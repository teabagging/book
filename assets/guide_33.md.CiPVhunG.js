They form a society with Ralph, one of the boys, as their group leader. While on the island, they want to be rescued, but until then, they hunt pig and hold assemblies. The story is about the struggle to keep order on the island.A significant event in the story is when Piggy and Ralph find a conch shell in the water. It allowed order to start on the island. This was because people were able to talk when they held the conch. It was also used to call assemblies.We think that the author is a good writer. His discriptions are very detailed. That allowed us to keep interest in the story. The author seems to be a credible source of what he has written, because he was in WWII, which was the time in which the book took place.We would definitely reccommend this book because it is different from most books we have previously read. It takes the reader back to the time when children always dreamed of having no adults around to tell them what to do. We also always kept reading because we wanted to know what would happen next. It is an excellent book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This past year I taught in a rural school, so I had the opportunity to choose what literature I wanted my students to read. I had 3 eighth grade boys, and chose to have them read this novel. The boys loved it, but on the other hand, we read most of it together in a group, because some of the wording was a little 'over their heads'. All in all, I find this to be one of the greatest classics ever written, and would suggest handing it to any young adult that's looking for a little enlightenment and a great read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It is remarkable what we humans can bear in order to adapt.It is true that the essence of the book can be abstracted and applied equally well to a lot of situations in the world today. However, I think it is necessary to point out that neither of the 'bands' of boys can judged: they simply adapted.Perhaps what makes the reader uncomfortable is the fact that, in the end, there simply is no tendency towards order, discipline or any other such cherished of our values. If left to ourselves, we have the tendency to self-destruction.Seen as a system, the boys were all adapting, to the place and to themselves at the same time. This implied redefining most of the values they previously had.The end is deeply sad because the one boy representing our precious modern values is the one chased and marginated.It is fascinating how Golding can tell us a story through the eyes of a bunch of boys, and at the same time be very precise and barely crude about the very subtle changes which they all had to suffer to be able to adapt.This book remainds me a lot of the movie Das Experiment. In the beginning, you have 20 healthy guys just brought from the street, fresh, with the same values and the same attitude. They all were called to simulate a prison, so one half (the 'healthier' half) plays the part of the guards, and the other half become the inmates. Then the forces start to act on each group, and each group begins to change in order to adapt, in order to 'stabilize' the system, according to their own perspective. In the end, they all change, and definitely not for the best. The game is death serious towards the end.It is a sad conclusion. But it is also remarkable the order and relative stability we have accomplished in our society, with our institutions and values; it is a strange and very fragile balance between the rules and values we have created, and the very things which we are instinctively compelled to do."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book because a Canadian student friend insisted. She apparently had it as part of her high school curricullum. I was not disappointed! I saw so much of modern life expressed through the eyes and actions of these primitive boys as they try to bring man's order to their society through ritual, then shunning, and ultimately, the well-intentioned persecution of those outside the group. It's too bad that more people can't guage their own actions from these themes of classic literature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"My opinion of the book is that i didnt like it as much and that it didnt pull me in to want to keep reading it.If you like action and like story lines where theres a fight for survival than you would probably enjoy Lord of the Flies.In the story you will see a group of kids that are stranded on a island and theres problems and many adventures that take place and if u want to find out more you'll have to read it for yourself.I wouldn't recommend this book because it wasn't exciting as much and i wanted to stop reading it becasue it was a waste of time for me.This is my opinion for my point of veiw of the book but its up tp you and hope you mgiht enjoy it or not."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the flies is a book that has adventure and emotion. The conflict between Jack , Ralph, and piggy is a diaster waiting to happen! An example, of this would be,when Ralph exposes Jack , as he really is by saying &quot; you're a beast a swine and a blooy, bloody thief&quot;. Between Jack and Ralph were bad beore, but this is when everything exploded.The amity between Ralph and piggy is one of the strongest you would see in two people. It's similar to a bond between a small boy an dhis pet dog. It's great how they confided in each other and are able to trust in one another. You could tell Ralph starts respecting Piggy when he says &quot;better Piggy than fatty&quot;. From then on Ralph beganto listen to piggy.The only negative thing I would have to say about this book is the way the kids act on the island. I honestly don't think kids of that age would act like murderous savages.In conclusion I think book is good for most ages. I really think young people would like this book because it has action and adventure."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought Lord of the Flies was a great book in the way that it showed how man has so many faults and that it is very hard to stay sane with so many different people with different views from yours. I loved how the story slowly started to turn to chaos and the boys one by one turned against eachother. Plus I liked the violence that this story had in it. I actually like this book so much that I am going to get my own copy and read it again.There are also some bad things that I didn't like about this book, but what book doesn't have its mixture of bad and good parts. One of the bad things was that some parts where difficult to understand and I had to read them a few times to finally get them. Another fault was that I have heard so many of the same &quot;stranded on an island stories&quot; and after awhile it gets on your nerves. Other than these things this book was very deserving of the 4 stars that I gave it. I would recommend this book for everyone except children under 10 because of some of the violence and High school level word usage."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding cleverly selects a seemingly innocent group of young boys to examine the concept of innate evil and human endurance. On a literal level, this novel is simply a thriller in which a group of young private school boys find themselves stranded on a forsaken island. At first, everything seems to go well. The older boys form a community in order to mainatin order and ensure survival. Over time, however, differences in opinions and personalities causes a gradual breakdown of the community until many of the boys turn their backs on order and even humanity, resorting to savage behavior.The novel is Golding's exploration of why mankind resorts to savage and/or evil ways when faced with ruthless circumstances (WWII/Holcaust, etc.). It is an engaging examination of the thin line between good/evil, human/inhuman, as well as a good read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is about the human nature. It's extremely complicated and deep, which makes it some what hard to understand, unless you analize every part of the story. I didn't like it because I'm too young to really understand a lot about human nature and the characters annoyed me. Through the whole book, I wanted them to do things so they could be saved, but the majority of them didn't care."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Recently I read lord of the Flies it was a very interesting and enjoyable book. The story has timelessness to it. The plots and characters are very entertaining. The first thing I noticed when I read the book was its reference to the atom bomb. This is the author's way of giving a time for when the story occurred. Also people were afraid of a nuclear war during those times so it sheds light on what life was like. The author did an excellent job of describing the atmosphere. He spent lots of time giving details on the characters and the island. I liked this because it helps readers get a better feel for what the author intended them to imagine. Another aspect I liked was how the boys developed into 2 societies showing the break that develops. It was nice to see how the two groups had a difficult time working together. It showed the stubbornness people could have when they feel they are right. Inside the society the characters where very enjoyable with their thoughts and dialogue giving a very realistic sense. Something I thought was unrealistic was the violence some of it seemed pointless. Often I thought that it was not realistic. Another part I hated was the dramatic character change as if the characters were always the same and the way they were. The story started off innocent despite the accident and turned into this is in many ways also comparable to frame story. It had little adventures in side the big story of survival. The thing I liked most in the book was the conflict. The boys who had split into tribes had to deal with and survive each other. But they also had to deal with the conflict between themselves and the environment-facing extreme whether and hunger. I would recommend this book to any one who likes action and lots of sometime over used detail. This is a book that is hard to sit down once you start it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"cast away on a deserted island, a pack of children, unsculpted by civilisation, spurred to act only as they have learnt through observing &quot;grown-ups&quot;, motivated by a will to survive as in their own prespective, the Lord of the Flies is a literary masterpiece that delves into the psyche of &quot;civilisation&quot; and its disposition. Golding is a visionary, as with several of his likes - Huxley and Orwell et al, creating a scenerio that might appear to most, so clich&eacute;, so meaningless, yet undeniably profound. children, indulge in the mundane - play mostly; or so it is thought. Golding uses children, the root and beginning of each human existence to express civil and social evolution, perhaps even communisim and democracy, leftist and rightist attitudes. justice and injustice. his presentation may be basic, but such are our origins. this is a throughly entertaining, thought provoking and undeniable classic of our time."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Though I have always been an avid reader, I didn't ever get a chance to read Lord of the Flies until late in high school. The main reason I read it is because one of my favorite authors, Steven King, praised it in two or three of his books. Though it wasn't quite as thrilling as I was expecting, I still enjoyed it, especially the way the author told the story. Most of all, I enjoyed the way the author explored how violence tennds to become a part of human nature. Also, the books insightful and disturbing points are driven home harder because it's children that are doing all the depraved and evil things that take place in the book. Good job Mr.golding"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I recommend this book for high school students who enjoy to read. It is a good book for a person who likes a little bit of adventure and some excitement. The one thing I did not like about this book is it does get dull during the middle of the book but it picks up a little bit in the end. It should be a book that you would want to read instead of being forced too."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was made to read this book this year in school ..., so I assumed that it would be horrible...like most all of the books that we have to read for school. But surprisingly Lord of the Flies was actually pretty good. I think I would've enjoyed it much more if we didn't have to read it so quickly (in about 1 weeks) and have to take so many notes about it and then have a test. The messages in symbols in this book are VERY strong and is a good book that has a lot of meaning in it. I would recomend this to anyone who hasn't read Lord of the Flies but is looking for a fairly short, powerful novel to read"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I'm a student who was just required to read Lord of the Flies. I personally thought the plot was good. I liked the charaters in the book. I think, though, that maybe the author has a similar problem in writing to myself. I know I get a good idea and cannot write it down the way I want it. I'm sure the original idea was a great one. Maybe if I reread this book at a later time in my life I may be able to like it better. I'm not sure. Over all, I'd tell you to read it, because its a book about survival from the elements, from oneself, and contains a large amount of action within its pages."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is about boys that are stranded on an island, no adults in sight. In order to stay alive they must hunt and make fire, but in the process, some of the boys get into dangerous situations. The boys crown a chief to keep themselves civilized, keeping things like they were back home. In the book, the characters meet a mysterious creature that scares the boys. I would not totally recommend this book to everyone, if you have a lot of free time it could be useful."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is an amazing book. The book was exciting, suspenseful, and thrilling. It gets better and better page by page. The novel was not too long or too short. It was very meticulous and made a perfect novel for those who love adventures. I'm in eighth grade and my sister, a senior in high school, were reading this book at the same time. Yes, we had different views, but overall the same opinion, a thrilling novel that hooks you in. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by William Golding was really a thought-provoking story. I had to read this book as a summer assignment, but I had read part of it a few years ago. Now that I am older, it has really helped me to understand all of the different aspects of the book. The way Golding used symbolism was amazing and kept you thinking. Normally, I wouldn't have chosen this book myself, but I enjoyed it. I would recommend this book to anyone, no matter what their taste. This is because I think it's significant for everyone to reflect about human nature and our society. Plus, it's a well written book. It's a classic."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This had to be the best book I ever read, and I would recommend it to everyone! William Golding tells the story wonderfully, and does a great job using symbolism.William Golding presented numerous themes and basic ideas that give the reader something to think about. One of the most basic and obvious themes is that society holds everyone together, and without these conditions, our ideals, values, and the basics of right and wrong are lost. Without society's rigid rules, anarchy and savagery can come to light.This book was indeed a well written masterpiece."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book many years ago in adolescence. It was a required reading work, a rite of passage work for any young person who wished to know the ' literary conversation- pieces' of the time.And it is a ' gripping narrative' a read that holds the reader's interest, especially as it is written in a clean, spare, very understandable prose.Yet I must admit the violence and cruelty which are the central message of the work in regard to what human nature is in essence, turned me off. As an adolescent dreaming reader I was looking for works which would give hope and faith in life. On the adolescent level 'The Catcher in the Rye' moved me to rereading again. And on the more adult level 'War and Peace' seemed to show the complexity and beauty of life in a way which made ' Lord of the Flies' seem to be a narrow- minded cartoon.We may be bad and evil sometimes, and many of us may be bad and evil all the time, but not all of us are evil all the time.The book to use a Faulkner phrase ' had no redemption in it'. And so while I respected it it fell far short of winning my approval and love."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the flies is, to me, a metaphor of human history. A group of boys ends up in a desert island after a plane crash and they have to struggle to survive. The battle of leadership begins shortly and two styles arrise. One is a symbol of order and civilization. The other is the opposite: anarchy and barbarism. Everything happens through the eyes of these boys, whose hope is to rescued. Highly recommendable if you liked Animal Farm for example."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"LOTF is a short and simple novel with a deep subject matter. Golding tries to convey his beliefs in the innate evil in individual humanity through a story wrought with simplicity.Golding does a great job in developing the characters of LOTF. The characters (unlike the 90's movie) are quite believable. Each of the main characters have their own personality and are utilized by Golding to symbolize his ideas.Golding uses a lot of imagery and symbolism, but he does this in a manner that is easy to understand. His writing style is simple and clear and without all of the complex language that can bog down a good novel. This story flows at a nice pace and never seems to \\"drag on\\".I enjoyed this novel. Underneath the symbolism there was a fast-moving, suspenseful story. And Golding did a good job in making the reader of this novel contemplate the nature of man and society. It's well worth the read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This review comes as a response to some of the other reviews on the site. Before I actually review the story, I'd like to respond to several accusations made by others.1) Some say that Golding's writing style is too slow when dealing with the environment, sun setting, etc., but very abrupt when dealing with death. The reason for this abruptness is to underline the character's nonchalance about death and dying. They don't care if Piggy dies, and the book is written to feel the same way. The writing that is long about seemingly unimportant things is only to create a mood, although, to be fair, mood need no be created with such laborious attention to detail.2) Several reviewers made the point to say that most teenagers don't talk the way the characters in the novel do. Well, of course they don't. The teenagers are merely a metaphor for the adult world and all of it's pompousness.3) Lastly, it should be mentioned that the beast is more important as a metaphor than as an actual thing, i.e. the children's irrational fear drives them to madness. But, you do in fact find out what the beast is, in a short passage of the book. If you watch the movie, it will become even more obvious.Now, on with the review.This was William Golding's first novel, and it is a classic. There are some problems with the writing, but the same can be said about most amatuer writers. But writing, in this novel, takes a back seat to Story and Message. Their are several different messages you can take from this, but this edition contains a section called notes on Lord of the Flies if you've read this and want to further your understanding of the novel.In the end, this is a very desparing story of humanity, with a few flickers of hope. This is a good place to start if you're begining to read deep literature. Supplemental works could include 1984, Fahrenheit 451, and A Clockwork Orange, because while this doesn't take place in the future, it might as well be a dystopian novel about the evils of government by tyrants."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I found this book quite interesting. It portrayed the dark side of human nature very well, showing how a group of boys could transform into monsters. I enjoyed reading this book, and would certainly recommend it. The reason I rate it four stars is that while it was a good book, it just didn't feel engrossing enough to me to receive that last star. Nonetheless, it is a very good book I would recommend."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"if ever you need to rekindle a hatred of mankind, read this book. however, if you work in retail, as i do, chances are you need next to no rekindling.i was one of the high-school kids who somehow got through school without reading this. so i figured i'd brush up on the classics i missed during the summer between high-school and college.i read it in two sittings (interrupted only by said retail) and i find it to be realistic and depressing. dont get me wrong, i love it...but its kind of a smack in the face.seriously, take your office floor, your co-cashiers, your senior class, put them on an island with little chance of rescue, and no repercussions.i dont think that human goodness would withstand."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I just finished Lord of the Flies not more then 20 mins ago.I had my doubts on this book very much.I have read many books in my life but this one had one of the best endings.I wasn't that happy with the book for the first 100 pages or so,but the rest was all good from there.Lord of the Flies shows the meaning of the struggles it takes to be a leader.There were key moments in the book nthat foreshadowed the ending.One was in the Beginning when Jack Showed a certain quality that showed that he had the quality to be a leader.When Ralph blew the Conch the First words that JAck said were &quot;Who is the man with the trumpet?&quot;That foreshadows the leader qualities he has by his curiosity for his choir's sake.I am not going to go any more into detail but you should buy this book and do not give up on it.It has a great ending that you will enjoy."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book written by William Golding, Lord of the Flies is a great book. It not only captures the minds of readers of every age, but it states a point about human nature. I think Golding's point in writting this book is to tell show us that there is a &quot;beast&quot; in all of us. As young Simon so clearly states. I agree with him on this point because at one point and time we all can loose control and become &quot;savage&quot;. Golding was brilliant for using children to bring this point across, because so often we think of children as being the complete example of innocence. And I think as the years progress or situations change, we gradually loose our innocence. This book was great and I would recommend it for children and adults of all ages."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Which is not to say that girls won't enjoy this too, but when it was published in 1954, \`Lord of the Flies' was written in response to the standard literature targeted to boys. Golding was frustrated with the idealistic, happy-ending-every-time formula, particularly in one book called \`The Coral Reef'-there are several cutting references throughout \`Lord of the Flies' to this work. In \`Lord of the Flies,' Golding shows us what he feels would *really* happen if a group of boys were left alone on a deserted island. As the book progresses, we see the boys' attempts at maintaining a civilized society degenerating faster and faster.The plots and ideas introduced present many questions of the reader. How does a group of British schoolboys, growing up in what they consider the height of civility, turn so readily to savagery? How does the temptation of power make them forget their goal of rescue so quickly? How can they so easily dismiss acts of murder? And, as you read the last three pages and close the book, you wonder...how do they feel about the events that have taken place, afterwards?A better question than \\"how\\" is \\"why.\\" In the critical note included in the back of the book, there is a quote by Golding that states, in his own words, the theme of \`Lord of the Flies': \\"...an attempt to trace the defects of society back to the defects of human nature...the shape of a society must depend on the ethical nature of the individual and not on any political system however apparently logical or respectable.\\"Given the novel's endurance over time and countless praises by the critics, one would judge that Golding succeeded. As a reader, you must decided for yourself, but one thing is for sure: This definitely isn't the Hardy Boys, the popular (yet plastic) product of the Stratenmeyer syndicate that, while it has withstood time as well, can't be said to have had an impact on society. Whereas this novel was carefully crafted to be intense and thought provoking, unflinchingly real...not to mention graphic. As a final word of advice, don't hesitate to read this...but don't read it while eating. ^_^;"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In my opinion, Lord of the flies was on of the dullest books I have ever read. It started off slow and at times I found myself trying hard not to fall asleep. The plot was actually quite interesting, but William Golding wrote it in such a way, sometimes I couldn't understand exactly what was going on. His word choice left me scanning through a dictionary a majority of the book. Yet this book did contain some quite profound symbolism. The theme would have to be the best party of this novel, being it relates to the real world or the cruelties of the real world.Some of the scenes in this book are actually quite violent, and unrealistic being that the kids are so young. In fact, numerous times I became sick to my stomach. Some of the scenes were good and beautifully written but overall I felt most of it was superfluous ."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Don't buy the Cliff's Notes: read this book for yourself - you will enjoy it and remember it for the rest of your life. And if you watch a movie version, read the book first. The old black and white film version cast with British kids is a million times better than the more recent color version with American kids -- probably because American kids are *already* savage...they have no civilized habits to lose! :-)There is an incredible scene in the book where some older boys toss rocks at a younger boy who is playing in the water. The author notes the the older boys are careful not to throw the rocks too close to the younger boy: I believe he calls the protective perimeter thus formed the circle of civilization or something. Anyway, it's a great and important passage; look for it. It foreshadows all the madness to follow.Here's a suggestion for a term paper (it worked for me): The character named &quot;Piggy&quot; wears spectacles that he fastidiously cares for when the boys are first marrooned; however, the spectacles are slowly demolished step by step as the boys descend into savagery. By examining the condition of Piggy's spectacles, you can judge how bad things have gotten on the island."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I first read this book (in high school, but not as an assignment) I also read one or two standard critical commentaries and bought into their analyses as its meaning. They teach us that it is a melodrama with Ralph as the hero and Jack the villain. Pursued by Jack and his tribe, who are going to kill him, Ralph (and in fact all the surviving boys), are rescued at the last minute on a beach by a naval officer, attracted by the conflagration to which a large part of the island had been reduced. In the last phrase, we see &quot;the trim cruiser in the distance:&quot; a warship. I.e., there is no real rescue. They will only be transferred from microcosm to macrocosm. They will live awhile longer, but are destined to see destruction on a larger scale, for that is man's destiny.The novel describes the failure of a society; but there is something troubling in the conclusion that such is an inevitable fate, a natural trend, the playing out of man's truest self. One must ask, if this is man, how can we possibly &quot;weep&quot; with Ralph, &quot;for the end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart?&quot; We can have no sense of how bad this is unless we have also a sense of something better. Can we fall without having first risen? From whence comes the standard against which we can call this denouement chaotic, evil, or in any way disagreeable?The customary interpretation suggests as Golding's message that, well, we just have to try to be civilized and keep our fingers crossed, maybe it'll work long enough for us to die a natural death. And when we're bullied, try to find the officer to protect us. Apres-moi, la deluge. Can this multi-layered and complex novel really have been crafted in the service of such a platitude? I liked the book then, and I like it now; but this sense of its begging the question nagged away-- from the first, I like to think-- behind the appreciation.Only years later would I stumble upon an article proposing an alternate interpretation. I regret that I did not photocopy it on the spot, for subsequent efforts to locate it have failed; evidently it has disappeared from the library. I read it at first with some distaste-- how dare this author say anything against the beautiful Ralph whom I had come to revere-- but in the end, I found it satisfying; and furthermore, it suggested something more insightful and practical than a bromide.In a nutshell: Ralph is not good, but Apollonian (fair-haired, first seen against the sun). Jack is not evil, but Dionysian (red-haired, dark-clad, the supreme singer). And &quot;it takes all kinds.&quot; The trouble begins when Ralph belittles and scolds Jack when he hunts for meat. Jack's apologia is simply, &quot;we needed meat&quot;: and that was a fact, as shown by the boys' hitherto fruitarian diet causing diahrrea. It was Ralph's responsibility, as the elected leader, to acknowledge, validate, and enlist even impulses and viewpoints which he might not understand or share-- but he could not see beyond his own. He alienated and denied a part of the community-- perhaps a part of human nature-- and things went downhill from there.This article was illustrated and supported by an abundance of details from the novel itself. Not all will be convinced by it, of course. But that a learned critic could find a meaning in the book which is so at variance from the conventional wisdom, and support it so well with details from the book itself, says something about the stature of the novel and its author. Less-than-great books do not sustain such ambiguity.It remains, of course, a minority-- perhaps a renegade-- thesis. But there is no doubt, as has been remarked by other critics, that Golding was dealing with ancient Greek as well as with Christian symbols and ideas. I speak as a Christian when I suggest that the neglect of the former is due to a caricature of the latter among many readers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"First of all, I will admit to a profound distaste for heavy-handed symbolism, and since this book is nothing but--well, profound distaste on my part was inevitable. Personally, by the time I've finished analyzing how Piggy's glasses symbolize human reason, the pig's head represents human evil, etc., the book has lost its impact for me and becomes pretentious.But that is not my main problem with this book. I find it frightening that so many people consider this book 'revealing' and a 'classic'. This seems to indicate that the message of this book has universal relevance for people. And this message is as follows: Humankind, homo sapiens, people as we know them, are intrinsically evil. Meaning, that deep down in our hearts we are nothing but wells of corrupt blackness, or as Conrad so aptly put it, hearts 'of darkness'. Anything good we do is a sham. We act a certain way only because civilization dictates it, but as soon as the rules of civilization no longer get us what we want, or they are no longer imposed on us, our natural tendency will be to fall into evil, our true, innermost nature.Garbage. I for one do not believe that human beings are intrinsically evil. Are they intrinsically good, then? Of course not. I am not advocating a world view based on naivete. Human beings have a natural tendency for both good and for evil. How much these tendencies influence a person's behavior is entirely up to him: he is not wholly at the mercy of his baser instincts. Even in 'Heart of Darkness', upon which Golding based this work, Marlowe faced the evil and did not succumb to it. These boys are given no choice, as evil is the only true reality. There is no way to fight it; one can either surrender to it, or run from it by way of civilization. To take an active stand against it is impossible.Even in 'Les Miserables' during the horrendous poverty and the barricades, where all of civilization is crumbling at its foundations and people are rotting because of it, there are glimpses into the beauty of humankind. Eponine, though sunk in squalor and darkness, finds redemption by saving Marius; this in contrast to her father, whose evil increases all the more. Jean Valjean sinks to the lowest level a human can sink to, yet there is hope for him; and because one person had faith in the good that was inside him, he, too found redemption. There is choice involved, and one can either strive for light, or fall into darkness. Maybe people like Golding because he unintentionally grants justification for the evil Man is capable of--after all, we can't help it. It's our nature. Therefore people need not bother to strive to become better than they are, to actualize the beauty within themselves. Humans have no inner beauty; it is imposed from outside to conceal the horror within.But there is more. And by not realizing that there is more, Golding sells everyone short."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think that Golding's purpose for writing this book was to show how innocence is lost and how we, as humans, cannot live in without any rules or authority. I certainly agree with his message because you reach a point in life where in one way or another you loose your innocence. I also agree with the fact that it is impossible to live without any rules or authority. The conch that Ralph used to gather everyone was a great literary element because it showed authority but at the same time it was fragile and white like Piggy. Personatly, I do not think this book is believable because it is not possible for only young boys to survive a plane crash and to live all by themselves on a deserted island. The part that I liked the least was the way Simon and Piggy died. I understand that Golding did it the way he did it to, show how the boys changed from the beggining of the story to the end of it. But I still think it was very cruel. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO PEOPLE ALL AGES BUT MOSTLY TEENS BECAUSE IT IS INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT THE LOST OF INNOCENCE..... :)"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Vivid and mysterious Lord of the Flies is one of those uncommon books which is susceptible to several levels of interpretation and analysis. It has this characteristic because it deals honestly and profoundly with human beings under stress, and because its author, William Golding, has a sympathetic and intense vision of the problems facing modern man, the varied reactions of different types of people under similar conditions, and the internal tension experienced by human beings forced to face new a difficult situations. Through its portrayals of human beings and human problems, this novel illustrated important general principles of human behavior and human relations. Lord of the flies is a thought-provoking novel. The book describes in detail the horrific exploits of a band of young children who make a striking transition from civilized to barbaric. The Lord of the Flies commands a pessimistic outlook that seems to show that man is inherently tied to society, and without it, we would likely return to savagery. Symbolism played had also played an important role in the development of story. This narrative technique was used to give a significance to certain people or objects, which represent some other figure. The following table lists many of the examples of symbolism used throughout Golding's book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A British boy's choir and a handful of other boys are flying over an ocean in an aeroplane when it crashes onto an unihibited island. The pilot of the plane is the only adult travelling with them, and he is killed in the crash. The children are left with no authorative figure in their lives, so two of the older boys (Jack and Ralph) start trying to gain control. However, the younger boys keep changing their minds on who they want as their leader, so they end up splitting into two hostile groups that are at war with each other. You can see the seriousness of the situation when the boys start getting killed off by their friends.I have compared this book to the government in the past. When there is little or no authority, the people tend to run amoc.However, this book is a great read. If you are looking for a deeper meaning in a book, it will be good for you. It deals with such topics as dependency (unknowingly), time and appreciation, and issues such as whether you should stand up for yourself if you'll be killed for it.Even if you are not looking for something deep, this is a great adventure story to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"First of all, let's get some things clear. There IS a &quot;deeper&quot; meaning to The Lord of the Flies. In fact, there are dozens. Second of all, Golding was an English schoolmaster who understood how children behaved. The idea that he was not qualified to write about children's behavior is ludicrous. One reviewer is partially correct when he states that children rarely attack each other. They rarely attack each other IN THE PRESENCE OF AUTHORITY. Finally, society could have developed with human nature the way that Golding presents it because human brains were developed to allow us to interact socially with other humans. Society would have then been made up of fifty to a hundred people, and authority would have been present, too.Having said all that, the only reason why you could not like this book is if you absolutely did not understand it. The Lord of the Flies might not have changed my life, but it really was a GREAT book. Its symbolism is poignant, clear, and powerful. The message the book gets across is wonderful.This dark, somewhat disturbing book is absolutely worth reading, and a copy belongs on the shelf of every serious reader. Each time I have read it I have come up with new meanings that I missed the previous time and it never gets old.If you know how to read it, it is definitely NOT boring. Be prepared for a wonderfully written, powerful book about the darker side of human nature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is probably the most disturbing book I have ever read.

Chaos, fear, blood-bath.

That is until this year when I was forced to read it again in order to teach it to my tenth-grade class. I had forgotten what a great read it is. As a teen, I missed out on so much that Golding had intended. Today--now that I'm a little older, a little better at understanding novels--I see so much more. The symbolism is wonderful, as is the book as whole. Plus: this is a beautiful edition and the E.M. Forster intro is brilliant.

But, if you're looking for a great, quick read, give &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; a whirl."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of The Flies, by, William Golding is basically based on a childhood fantasy everyone would like to explore.The book mainly revolves around a group of English teenaged boys whos plain crashes on a desserted island.The boys basically have to live and fend for them selves without grown-ups. Scavenging for food,building huts,tools,weapons,and defending themselves against the island monster. All in all if you like the thrill of a hunt and remember the fantasies of living on a deserted island as a kid this book is for you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A great book... A wonderful depiction by Golding of a group of teenage boys that are supposed to be &quot;civilized&quot; boarding-school students but turn wild and barbaric as a result of the harsh island environment that they are set in. This book provides a powerful representation of our own society, and how these animalistic natures all exist in the underlying shadows. Although the adult in his ship rescues the kids at the end, the point is made by Golding in the Epilogue that, even though the kids are rescued, who will rescue the adult?

It is disturbing and fascinating at the same time. Lord of the Flies is intriguing and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"There is a common theme to negative reviews of William Golding's classic meditation on power, anarchy, and human nature: They tend to come from disgruntled students forced to read the book for school. The complaints either suggest the book is too confusing and/or complicated -- far from the case; the narrative is very straightforward -- or that the book is implausible.But it's not.Rather than being implausible, what Lord of the Flies is, is disturbingly close to the mark when it comes to its look at our potential for evil and how quickly our tendency to exploit others rises to the fore when civilization is left behind.Still, who could blame them? They are struggling to understand themselves, and we expect them to absorb and understand what amounts to a rather dire essay on human nature? This is a harrowing tale about a group of lost youths, stranded and without guidance, whose fear and misunderstanding of the world (and each other) drive them to madness, and ultimately, murder ... far from a comfortable subject matter for young people still coming to understand their place in the world.Highly recommended as a short, cynical look into the human mind, and of the dangers that lie within us all."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is Golding's first and probably most famous novel, twice made into a film (in 1963 and 1990) and often required reading in high schools and in many college courses. Golding was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Literature. I found it surprising to learn that a number of reference books lists &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; as a science fiction novel! I later discovered that the first draft of the book had the boys fleeing from a nuclear holocaust at the start of the novel. Even in this final version there is a brief discussion of the &quot;bomb&quot; and about fighting &quot;Reds.&quot; In the novel, after a plane crashes on a deserted island, the surviving boys of a boys school try to set up a democratic society, waiting for rescue. At first, the boys cooperate and Ralph, with his friend \\"Piggy,\\" tries to maintain order. But, it fails and the boys &quot;evolve&quot; (or, devolve) back into savagery. It is only with the arrival of a shocked rescue officer does a semblance of civilization returns. The boys in the novel have the same names as the schoolboy heroes in R. M. Ballantyne's &quot;The Coral Island,&quot; published in 1858. But, Ballantyne's novel is &quot;naive optimism.&quot; Golding suggests that the evil is in each of us and that, left on our own, man will always have a tendency to revert to savagery. Is this really what underlies man's true nature? There is goodness and discipline in us and that is represented by Ralph. We just need more Ralphs.-----\\"Fancy thinking the Beast was something you could hunt and kill!\\" said the head.

Lord of the Flies is a classic well written with a moral to the story."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is one of the few books that have left an indelible mark on my being. What is presented to students across the country as a kids' adventure story is far from it. It is a timeless statement about the nature of human beings, who may fundamentally be innocent and civilized, but can quickly degenerate into adversarial brutes when they become free from the reins of authoritative supervision or isolated from collective notions of propriety. The chaos and terror that Golding so palpably illustrates results from Jack's pride and his ability to garner followers by appealing to their weakness during trying times. But perhaps this was only possible because of the lost--or killed--hope of rescue. This rescue was for a time the unifying and motivating vision that formed the basis of the children's activities on the island, and the eventual arrival of the rescuer is the moment of truth, when the depth of this tragedy is fathomed, and the aggression from Jack's camp becomes apparent to everybody. The novel is more than a chilling tale; it serves as a warning to us, who inhabit the island called 'Earth,' that if we allow our actions and egos to go unchecked, and if we lose hope in the future, then our fate will be dismal. It also exposes the precarious nature of civil order from beneath its veneer of stability. If we value order and harmony, then we need to appreciate that contravention of even simple standards of civility (e.g. speaking without the conch) may spell the beginning of societal decay. I would highly recommend (re)reading this book, because our society needs greater human consciousness."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is one of my favorite books ever. The story is awsome and it has a great message. Every one of the boys reminded me of someone I've met in my life. I've met people who are similur to Ralph, Jack, Piggy, Simon, Roger, Sam n Eric, and even some of the minor characters. I even found myself getting attached to some of the characters. I loved Simon, and just about every scene he was in I found myself thinking \\"Awe, you're so cute!\\" And I cried when I found out what was to happen to him. I felt bad for Piggy and I wanted to yell at the other boys to stop picking on him. I liked Ralph, he acted like a lot of twelve year old boys I know. Samneric cracked me up a few times. Jack also acted like a lot of twelve year olds I know. I even liked Roger, he made a good sadistic evil character, but I wouldn't want to be stuck in an elevator with him.Over all, I thought this was a great book. It had a powerful chilling message. There was a lot of symbolism, but not so much that it dragged the book down. And the author used the perfect amount of discription, enough so you get the feel of the envirnment, but not too much like taking ten pages to decribe a single leaf. I recommend this book to anyone.There are also two movies out on this book. If you plan to watch one, watch the 1963 version. It's in black and white but it follows the book. The 1990 version doesn't even feel like Lord of the Flies at times."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book captures the tension and anxiety of being a teenager among peers. Golding skillfully plays envy, rage, and fear off of one another both between and within the characters. The sense that none of the strife is warranted or deserved is set against the larger context of war at the end of the story. The reader is then left to cross the conceptual bridge between the micro and macro, and I suspect that many do not without the aid of a post-read analysis or critique.Peter Gamache, MBA, MLA, MPH"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is great, and I had fun reading this. However, like almost all books, the begining was quite boring. It didn't grasp my attention well at first, but at the end, it was interesting and vivid. There is some very slight violence in the book, and two people die. I wouldn't recommend this book to younger children, but for older children, this book is great."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies was not one of the better books I have read. I felt that the book was a little too predictable. I was surprised that this was Golding's response to the evils he saw in WWII as a member of the Royal Navy, because I figured it would be more graphic or have been about the war, rather than the story of a group of English schoolboys whose plane is shot down on an island. At the beginning of the book when Ralph calls all the boys who survived the plane crash with the conch and they voted him leader over Jack, I could tell that the conflict of the story would be between these characters. I did not feel like Golding was able to get across his theme of the inner evil of mankind because of his character choice of a group of young boys. From personal experience I can tell you that almost all young boys are mischievous and have an evil side to them, but I don't feel that they are an accurate representation of all humans. However, I do feel that Golding used a lot of great symbolism in this novel with the use of Piggy's glasses as being able to see things for what they really are, and the use of the conch to represent power and order. Another interesting thing is Beelzebub, one of the fallen angels in Milton's Paradise Lost, translates to Lord of the Flies. For the theme of evil Golding was trying to use, this was a great title."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"There are three books that I could not live without: Ayn Rand's THE FOUNTHEAD, McCrae's THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD, and Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES. Don't misunderstand--these are not easy &quot;fun&quot; reads, but thought-provoking literature. FLIES is extremely disturbing; a portrait of society gone mad, though told in a small setting, on an island with boys. Still, the point is made. No, this is not your average summer read for the beach, but it should be read and studied. What a shame that we, as a society, haven't learned the valuable lessons Golding tried to teach us."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I am definatly going to have to give this one 5 stars.

In the very beginning, the boys try to cooperate to find food, make shelter, and light a signal fire, therefore maximizing their chance of being rescued. They all elected Ralph as the leader since he seemed to know what to do to keep them alive. However, some of the boys become lazy, and would rather play and have fun instead of work. As Ralph's power and influence over the other boys begin to decrease, his antagonist, Jack rises with power. Jack was the leader of the group of boys responsible for hunting. But soon Jack and his group of boys become obsessively fond with hunting and is overcome by a sort of frenzy. Soon he begins to paint his face giving himself the look of a savage. Disgusted of Ralph's rules, Jack and his group of boys split from the rest of the group and move to another part of the island. Soon after, the situation becomes worse, and Jack's \\"tribe\\" are now hunting Ralph's group. The former instinct of civilization and order has become savagery, violence, and chaos.Almost all the characters and elements in this book symbolize something. This book is not just about a struggle for survival on a deserted island, it is about a conflict between two types of human nature that both exist in every individual. The first is to live by rules, act peacefully, and do things for a common good. The other is to act violently, obtain power through force, and to satisfy individual's immediate desires. These two characteristics can be seen in the two major characters Ralph and Jack. The main conflict to the whole story is civilization versus savagery. The lord of the flies is a sow's head impaled on a stick. The sow had been killed by Jack and his hunters and its head was meant to be an offering to the beast that all the little boys seem to think is living on this island. The lord of the flies is implying that there is evil in every human heart, and this is the major theme of this book.Overall, I thought that this was one of those books that would make you think about all the hidden themes and ideas expressed throughout the book. This book, I believe, is a book that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Annotation: Set during World War II, two adolescents: Ralph and Piggy, find themselves as survivors of a plane crash on a deserted island. There are no grown ups to show them how to live, but they soon meet more children and band together. As problems unfold, Inherent evil takes over in this masterpiece of human psychology.Author Bio: William Golding was born in the village of St. Columb Minor in Cornwall. He started writing at the age of seven, but he didn't pursue it until after attending Brasenose College, in Oxford. His first book, which was no more than a collection of poems, was finished one year before getting his B.A. After graduation, he moved to London and wrote plays. He lived in a settlement house, but moved to Salisbury in 1939. He enlisted in the Royal Navy during WWII, and hated it. He called it \\"a waste of four years of my life.\\" After the war he returned to Salisbury with a dark view on humanity's processes. His first novel: The Lord Of the Flies was declined by 21 publishers, but when it did get published in 1954 it was an instant hit in England and a bestseller in America. After that he wrote The Inheritors (1955), PINCHER MARTIN (1956), FREE FALL (1959), THE SPIRE (1964), RITES OF PASSAGE (1980), THE PAPER MEN (1984), CLOSE QUARTERS (1987), FIRE DOWN BELOW (1989), and THE DOUBLE TONGUE, left in draft at his death, was published in 1995.Evaluation: I've heard many things about this book. That is the reason I decided to read it, and I must say, it lived up to every single expectation. The pessimistic view on human nature is frighteningly real, and it is portrayed through an entertaining adventure story with a group of children stranded on an island. My favorite character was Piggy because he was the rational character. He was the intelligent member of the democratic \\"tribe\\" on the island, and a tragic hero in the end. The Antagonist on the island was Jack. He started as a good-natured leader of the hunters. This physical job eventually brought out the inherent evil that Golding thought was in every human being. All hell breaks loose when the hunting tribe splits from the rational tribe, and they go on a pig hunt. This is, in my opinion, the best scene ever portrayed in a book. The haunting image of a skewered pig's head that represents the devil sticks in my mind whenever I think of the book. He takes the innocent life of Simon hours before the other children do. The end of the book is tragically ironic when the Navy man walks in on a childish manhunt, yet he is doing the same exact thing on his ship. An easy read, but unbelievable book. I give it 5 out of 5 stars, and it's now my favorite book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think Golding really screwed up on this one...I found the plot really boaring and unrealistic. There were too many characters and most were undeveloped. And just when I thought the novel was the worst thing I ever encountered, I saw the old black and white Lord of Flies Movie. I really honestly think that a three-year old directed this...P-U."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I somehow graduated from high school -- a boys religious high school, no less -- without being assigned Lord of the Flies. So I decided to read the mother of all high school English books.I came to the text with certain preconceptions and prejudices. Like many high school students, I was force-fed my share of meaningful stories with something to say. I though To Kill a Mockingbird was simple and didactic, and, after two readings, I cannot comprehend what any serious person sees in The Catcher in the Rye. In Cold Blood and The Stranger were more my speed, stories with the confidence to tell their tales and not hit you over the head with life lessons. I approached Lord of the Flies with wariness.The story is well known. A flight filled with English schoolboys crashes on an uninhabited island, killing all of the adults. Ralph, a charismatic but forgetful 12-year-old, is elected the leader of the survivors, who quickly segregate by function. Ralph determines the day's tasks. Fat but smart Piggy counsels. Jack and the members of his boys' choir hunt the island's wild pigs. The \\"littluns,\\" the six- and seven-year-olds, exist in a task-less state of near hysteria.Jack, the warrior prince who provides meat, becomes envious of Ralph's position as leader. The principal arc of the 200-page book is the heightening tension between Ralph, whose priority is to maintain a signal fire and be rescued, and Jack, whose priority is to hunt and lead.Many passages were suprisingly clunky. Dialogue sections repeatedly ignored Strunk and White's admonition to \\"make sure the reader knows who is speaking.\\" Author William Golding devoted substantial space to physical descriptions, but they tended to be vague and confusing. Many of the secondary characters were cardboard, as thinly drawn as in Dickens but without the cartoonish charm. The narration's point of view changed abruptly at certain points.Lord of the Flies was Golding's first novel, so imperfections can be forgiven. He was ultimately awarded the Nobel Prize and a Booker so, to paraphrase Shelly Winters, some people thought he could write.But what is it about this book, an almost archetypal \\"promising\\" first novel, that has landed it on so many required reading lists? Lord of the Flies has sold more than 10 million copies, deep into Dan Brown territory, and my raggedy paperback is the 96th Capricorn printing. (Interestingly, the book initially flopped, selling only a few thousand copies.)Much of the success of Lord of the Flies must be due to the fact that it is a useful tool when teaching some of the basics of literary theory.First of all, kids will read it, especially boys who may not be the most avid readers. The idea of a world without grown-ups catches adolescent interest. The book is short. There's a fair amount of action, including a taut climax.Moreover, the Big Themes are laid on with a backhoe. The symbolism is so obvious that the slowest kid in fourth-track English can figure it out. A student can spend hours matching the characters with their analogues in modern society and, judging from some of the web pages devoted to the book, students have spent much more time than that. Every high school English teacher needs to explain that sometimes there's more to a story than what the characters do and say, and Lord of the Flies feels custom-cooked for that effort.I don't think Lord of the Flies has much to offer an adult reader, but it's a pleasant reminder of youthful efforts to learn the rudiments of symbolism and subtext.Now, class, what do Piggy's glasses represent?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is another classic that relies on a bad outcome in the story to get attention from readers. In a lot of schools it is required reading. I suppose that teachers think that stories with bad outcomes serve as warnings to other people, and the author probably had similar motives. However, there are two important questions to answer. First, does Lord of the Flies meet the criteria to be considered a \\"warning\\" to society? Second, does the content of the novel itself contradict its purpose?Lord of the Flies is a novel about a group of boys who are stranded on an island with no adults present. The boys attempt to form a simple \\"government\\" among themselves. However, their weak sense of order starts out with childish, verbal conflict and eventually turns into violence. Given the novel's summary, one may deduce that the message of the novel is a warning to society of the dangers of anarchy.I dislike the fact that almost all off the characters are boys within seven years of each other's age. Real world societies have a much wider variety of people. When writing a book designed as a warning to society, it is important to make sure that the whole society can relate to the book. In my opinion, the real art of writing a plot in a novel is to create a scenario in which people o many different ages and backgrounds get involved and contribute to the outcome. In Lord of the Flies, the consequence of the lack of diversity among the characterizations is that there are too many pages that rehash childish arguing. Therefore, the novel could have (and probably should have) been reduced to a novelette length.As stated earlier in this review, many literature interpreters believe that the purpose of Lord of the Flies is to demonstrate the dangers of anarchy. A lot of interpreters of literary symbolism consider the \\"Lord of the Flies\\" to be an allegory for the devil. Therefore, the fact that the book is essentially titled \\"the devil\\" seems to indicate that the book focuses on evil acts and events. In my opinion, one major flaw in the novel is that the characters with good intentions fail to have a positive impact on the outcome of the plot or the development of other characters. With that in mind, the problem is that the author condemns anarchy, but fails to tell us what we should do about it, which seems to cause the book to lose its purpose.Due to its monotony and \\"incomplete\\" philosophies, I do not recommend Lord of the Flies."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"My favorite chapter in this book would definitely be the first chapter when the kids are introduced on the island. There was this one kid that everyone had called piggy. To me that is the funniest thing in the world. I don't know why but the humiliation of another kid is extremely hilarious. It may seem cruel but to me it's funny. I would have to say that this book was definitely for the older more mature kids, like high school kids. All in all I would have to say that even with the kid getting humiliated I dislike this book with a passion it is way to boring and just when you think it's going to get good the book disappoints you and I don't think that is a very good book for the serious reader"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I first picked up this book, I was expecting a masterpiece-a work of outstanding literature. After all, I had only heard great things about it. However, I was extremely disappointed once I ventured on to read past the first chapter. Slowly, I progressed onward, making my way through endless descriptions, multiple plots, and enough symbolism to make my head ache. I think Mr.Golding should have remembered that not ONLY are themes important to keep the reader's interest, but PLOT is too. This book is an excellent example of how someone can get so lost in the hidden meaning of their words, they forget what they're trying to SAY in the first place. Not only are their problems with the actual structure of the book, but also in the language used. There is a wide variety of slang used, which is, for the most part, chiefly British! I found myself rereading sentences more than two times just to understand what was being said. By half-way through the book, I actually wanted to stop and start reading something else. Also, throughout the book, Mr.Golding leaves off on one note and starts a completely different series of events. By the end of the book there are so many plots going on, it gets old trying to follow which one is going on at the moment. So, in summary, if you want to read a book which has multiple plots, too much symbolism, and descriptions to put you to sleep, then Lord of the Flies is for you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this book exists to support the author's opinion that man is brutish and destructive.this was written well before clinical studies of violance, child abuse, the effects of peer pressure, etc. it reflects the basic christain view that man is vile.itis obvious that golding never considers that by the time any of these boys has spent time in their families and then in the prep school, any natural impulse has been thoroughly ground out bysocial standards. these boys are as affected by all they psychological influences as adults, with fewer methods to deal with them.of course they revert to so-called savagery--it's what they experienced at their school. of course there are no intelligent responses, we aren't trained to use intelligent response.the book is a polemic of the conservative christian--man is vile and must be controlled or he will become a savage.nurture has no place.i find it a completely annoying book, presenting an unrealistic result."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Here is an extremely typical example of the book:\\"There were only a few more yards of stony ground and then the two sides of the island came almost together so that one expected a peak of headland. But instead of this a narrow ledge of rock, a few yards wide and perhaps fifteen long, continued the island out into the sea. There lay another of those pieces of pink squareness that underlay the structure of the island. This side of the castle, perhaps a hundred feet high, was the pink bastion they had seen from the mountain-top. The rock of the cliff was split and the top littered with great lumps that seemed to totter.\\"Is it just me, or is writing like this exceedingly dull and boring? The plot of the book one can simplify into a seven or eight page summary, but the rest is too painful to read. Even if you look at Sparknotes, you find zero mention about any of the 90% of the book which is dull and descriptive, and it just focuses on the 10% which is the meat of the story."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is not as described. It is basically a paperback with a flimsy hard cover attached. I returned it. Do not buy this if you want a nice hardcover edition."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It's great ordering a book, and the book was good, but the delivery took so long that I had to go to the bookstore and get it for my daughters class anyway, so it was really a waste. Shouldn't take over two weeks to get a book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"After all I had heard and read about Golding's Lord of the Flies I was expecting a novel story, not a Rbinson Crusoe cliche, or at least some good writing/language, but what I got was a story that could have been conjured up by my 11 year old kid: lots of repetition (the conch, the glasses, the beast, the fire)and not what one could term an erudite piece of writing. How this book gets onto college lists is beyond me. Are we actually meant to interpret/understand the vague imagery, if that's what it is? Boring. Unfortuantely this is my first Golding book, and I'm afraid it will be my last... for some time at least."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book back in high school, over 20 years ago. I make my children read it, even if it's not required for their English class. Since it stood out in my mind for over 20 years and I remember details of it, it's impact was extraordinary! I think that it affects men and young boys differently,stronger than women and young girls. I think it's one of the best books ever written."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Don't expect to read this book for entertainment value--it's too dark and disturbing. This book is basically a moral fable that illustrates the innate character flaws in human nature. In order to illustrate the point that human nature is inherently flawed, the author chooses to use young children stranded on a deserted island as his means to do so. Although the children start off with some standards and an attempt at civilization, the flaws in human nature ensure the group devolves into anarchy. The point is that civilization and morality take effort, they are not natural. This is an instructive and important book, if not a happy one."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book as an adult. It was not taught at the high school I went to, but I was always curious about this book. I actually listened to it on CD in my car and found myself wishing my hour-long commute was longer - I was that riveted! This book is a peak inside the human psyche - a lesson in what separates us from the animal kingdom - and what can send us back. I found myself fascinated, full of questions. Are we really only several rules away from being savages? Do we instinctively know this and that is why the majority of us live peaceably within society's \\"norms\\"? I love books that challenge me intellectually and make me ask questions that hopefully help me understand myself and others around me better, and \\"Lord of the Flies\\" definitely did that."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is great. It paints a picture of what happens to a group of people when survival is on the line. Insightful and intriguing, if not disgusting at times. HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is one of the best, sitting next to all the other William Golden books. When few boys fell on an island from an airplan that was blown up by an atom bomb, they fight their way all out the island to be saved.This book will keep you on your feet, with fights and thrilling mysteries that are sometimes not solved. This is one of the greatest book of all time that will lead pondering at all times."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This classic story entitled \\"Lord of the Flies\\" by William Golding about a group of school boys stranded on an island after their plane crashes shortly before the next world war is a fantastic character study of the human mind's descent into madness. It has been compared to Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" and this comparison definitely holds its own.Once you begin reading, the richness of Golding's language and his numerous symbolic descriptions will make this page-turner very hard to put down. He describes the scenery in such vivid detail that you can honestly see the island in your mind's eye.Golding also touches on the inner struggle of the mass majority vs. the individual opinion. By the end of the book, this idea is easily understood. He also sets up arguments for rational vs. emotional reactions to situations, and the long-standing conflict that lies in morality vs. immorality.At the beginning of the novel, we meet Ralph, the main character who, in turn, meets \\"Piggy\\", an overweight, weak-willed child who is established as the voice of reason and rationality throughout the novel, despite being continually made fun of and disrespected.While trying to get a grip on their newfound reality, they discover a conch shell which becomes a symbol of order and control throughout the book. Knowing that they can't be the only children on the island, Ralph uses the shell to beckon any others. However, considering how the story unfolds, they might have been better off remaining isolated.Soon enough, groups of children appear before them and once everyone finally assembles, Ralph holds a meeting in which the children introduce themselves to each other and set up the initial rules of the island. Ralph is elected the leader at first but it is clear that another child named Jack will inevitably become his rival, as his is also a strong personality, yet Jack is more obsessed with the thrill and savagery of the hunt, as opposed to keeping order and making the best efforts to be rescued.As the novel progresses, we can see the sanity and rationality of the tribe slipping further down the rabbit hole, particularly from the perspective of Simon, one of the children who was more of a friend to Piggy and Ralph than to Jack. He is the only one of the children to discover \\"the beast\\", a rumored boogeyman-type character that the littler children fear. He is also the strongest connection to the title of the book, which essentially is loosely translated to mean \\"Beelzebub\\", or the devil. Simon has the deepest understanding of the evil that runs rampant on the island.Golding has stated that he wrote the novel as a character study of how we as a human race have struggled to rise above our primal needs for centuries, yet we don't realize just how quickly and easily we can return. In a matter of weeks, the children's goal of \\"having fun\\" turns into survival and for some, that's a tragic goal that is never reached.This book will hold your interest strongly throughout and can be appreciated for the basis of such island-based entertainment as Lost or the title of Rob Reiner's production company, Castle Rock Entertainment. (Stephen King enjoyed the book so much that he included the title of the climactic mountain setting as fictional town in his books. Rob Reiner, in turn, was inspired by King's books and took the name for his company.)\\"Lord of the Flies\\" is an excellent read and has been part of the school curriculum's literature requirements in many schools across the country for generations. In such a well-written novel we can examine the human mind and analyze human behavior with the luxury of descriptions such as Golding's, as opposed to picking up a psychology book.--unless that's more your thing, of course."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies, the classic tale by William Golding about the dark side of human nature, is explained throughout this wonderful novel. It shows a great distinction of survival of the fittest and the structure of law and corruption of power. The book talks about how culture that was made by man fails, Golding uses a group of British schoolboys stuck on islands who try to govern themselves as an example. The only conflict is that this ultimately comes with catastrophic consequences. The main topic themes that the story revolves around are the controversy of human nature and individual welfare versus the common good. It was very descriptive and entertaining throughout every page, the author would keep you on your toes of what would happen next. The book has a lot of suspense as well as a concept of realization of how we as a civilization of man function and fall."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I just finished this book for English, and I felt it nailed its message pretty well. The symbols and deeper meanings are really an early attempt at exploring the true nature of children vs. their morals under survival situations. It is sad seeing how young boys can do this to each other, but it is very realistic in its psychological views, and shows how anyone has the ability to give into power and impulses under the right circumstances. The ending just pieces everything together, and shows the true impact the actions have caused these boys emotionally, even though it is a little anti-climatic. In the end, the basic moral is to not give in to your natural impulses so quickly and not to be quick to judge other people. It also teaches you that anyone has the ability to turn evil when given power, but there will always be those with morals who continue to fight on."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"There are quite a few negative reviews on \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" and of course I had my own complaints with the book too.But I still give it 5 starts because this is an instance where the whole is greater the sum of its parts.Wasn't crazy about the author's prose style. It felt clumsy, jarring and often times I had to re-read entire paragraphs. But, at the same time, the chapters were so intriguing, enthralling and gripping.Golding's attention to detail gives the reader a complete sensory experience."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is Sir William Golding's most ingenious insight into human-nature and group political psychology.The pessimistic truth: when faced with the prospect of striving and attaining a higher-potential ..or merely settling for an easily acquired base commonality (for whatever dubious reasons), ...what path will MOST people take?Suddenly marooned on a small tropical island, a group of British school-boys find themselves confronted by a survival situation. Their plight soon renders them a microcosm of any tribe, community, or nation in flux.No adults survived the shipwreck. The two most intelligent and responsible boys, Ralph and \\"Piggy\\"(real name not revealed), logically assess the situation. They realize that through discipline, hard work, cooperation, and organization, the boys can survive on this small island until they are rescued. There is just enough food to eat, if they are careful. By adhering to a regular program of foraging, maintaining shelters, and manning a sentry-post to watch for the rescuers, they organize their people in an impressive effort. They establish a rudimentary system of democracy, with regular mandatory meetings for all, to address the immediate and potential concerns of the group.Unfortunately, amongst the survivors, is one Jack Merridew, the leader of a choir group. Jack, who is probably not as intelligent as Piggy or Ralph, has the advantage of being a natural charismatic-leader, and therefore, a natural \\"politicain\\". Of the many subcommitees, he volunteers his choir-boys to be the designated hunting-party and \\"security-element\\" of the survivors.Jack openly opposes the rigorous program of foraging and labor. He preaches \\"promises\\" of turning the island into a hedonistic \\"Peter-Pan\\" paradise. His ever encroaching domination of the group threatens the order established by Ralph and Piggy.The political game we have all seen played out eternally, soon takes its predictable course:-One side states a need for hard-work and discipline for the betterment of all, the other side refutes this with promises of leisurely \\"better-living\\" WITHOUT any such sacrifice of effort whatsoever.-Who do you think the electorate will vote for?-How many people will mindlessly join one faction or another, purely based on the side that appears to be \\"winning\\"?-How many times have we seen charismatic \\"leaders\\" sacrifice everything and everyone, ...just to be the \\"one in charge\\"?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read this book for school and I would say that I and A and B student(not bragging), but I just couldn't understand it!

All it is is an outlet for an author's deranged sybolism. The story is stupid and at the same time, pointlessly graphic. If you want to read a good book, read Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. It is a very good book. Golding, in a vain effort to make people understand his sideways point of view, wrote a parody of 1940's British society. Who really gives a crud? I don't.

The only time that it caught my eye was when they first got stuck on the island and when they got off. So basically,in the middle of this book, i wasn't listening. This book had alot of realism and creativity that was probably the highest point of this book. If I would have to pick a leader for them i wouldn't have picked any of them because they all act like animals. And the events that took place like for one when they thought that Simon was the beast, that was just dumb to me. I also gave it one star because it didn't deserve anyting better than that.The friendship between Ralph and Piggy was odd. Another thing that was odd was these kids had the urge to kill one another. At the beginning of this book, I asked myself,&quot;How did all these kids survive but not one adult did?&quot; I think the book would have been a whole lot better if they had about 2 or 3 adults to keep the kids from talking about that ridiculous beast. The Lord Of The Flies I read for an sophmore english class.

Jack is very pushy to Piggy because Piggy is fat, wears glasses, and has asthma but is friendly to Ralph. But all that changes when Jack lets a fire go out that causes a plane that passes by not to see them, after Jack becomkes more aggressive and just cares about hunting. Soon Jack starts his own tribe and the group slowly seperates from being with Ralph to going with Jack. Jack's group starts doing mean things like stealing Piggy's glasses to make a fire.

If you really get into the philospphy behind this book, you'll find its almost depressing. On top of it, it is unrealistic."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a story that revolves around a central theme, which is that without the rules of society human nature leads to savagery. The story begins when a group of British school boys crash on a tropical island. The only adult on the Island, the pilot, is dead. At the beginning of the book, a boy named Ralph finds a conch and blows it. Immediately the boys group into an assembly and choose Ralph as their leader. During the first part of the book, the boys strive for order and organization, but this soon starts to diminish. Ralph and his friends, Piggy and Simon, try to accomplish the task of building shelter on the island. They are alone doing this, for many of the boys are too young to help. Jack and his group go off hunting small pigs which populate the island. The disagreement about hunting causes great tension between Ralph and Jack during the book. As the book progresses, Jack's group forget their civilized ways, and there soon becomes a lack of order. Ralph and Piggy started a fire and it should be kept going at all times on a mountain on the island, so that they have a better chance of being rescued. They are unable to accomplish this task because many of the boys do not care about keeping the fire going and would rather go and play. Piggy's glasses are used for lighting fire and become an important symbol of power later in the book. Jack and his group, now known as &quot;the hunters&quot; become obsessed with hunting and killing pigs. To them, it is the most important task on the island. All the young children are preoccupied with the Beast, which they believe in as some kind of animal living on the island. During an assembly, Jack tries brings up the fact that Ralph isn't a good chief, because he can't hunt. Piggy and others are against the idea, but Jack is starting to become more and more savage and overpowering. Jack, Ralph and Simon attempt to kill the beast, in hopes of curing the little boys' worries. There is a violent storm on the island, in which Simon wanders down into a group of boys who are chanting and pretending to hunt. In all of the confusion and chaos, Simon is &quot;accidentally&quot; killed. In this part of the book, Jack decides that he is fed up with Ralph's leadership, and decides to start his own tribe. He invites any boys who wish to join him to come along. Jack's tribe becomes increasingly aggressive, and makes raid on the remaining boys' camp. By this time Sam, Eric, Ralph and Piggy are the only ones not in Jack's tribe. Sam and Eric are kidnapped by Jack's tribe, and Piggy is killed by Roger. Ralph hides in the forest nearby and Jack attempts to hunt him down. During the chaos the fire is neglected and eventually sets the whole island on fire. A naval cruiser sees the smoke from the raging island, and comes to the boys' rescue. Once the naval cruiser comes, and a officers comes out, the boys are ashamed of how they have become. I really enjoyed reading The Lord of the Flies and I would highly recommend it as a must read for anyone at any age. The story unfolds at a very good pace because it keeps the reader craving to know what will happen next. I feel that this story had a very strong introduction and conclusion, making it enjoyable to read. It almost felt like watching a thriller, when in reality they were just pages turning. Lastly, I give The Lord of the Flies four stars, because it is the type of book you can never get sick of."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"For english class we had to read Lord of the Flies by Golding..

From everyone that I have ever chatted to about this novel, they all share the same responses, and that is that William Goldings Lord of the Flies is simply not a good book. Human nature is evil and corrupt is about all this book goes into, and it is all written from a childs perspective, dull and flat. This book delves into the loss of innocence, but these children as soon as they are introduced appear haughty and arrogant and self-absorbed. And then, throughout the book, they go on and fight with one another due to their level of immaturity, and end up murdering one another. This book is not about human nature, it is about the immaturity of children. These children do not think throughout the entire book, and it just seems stupid and a pointless read. This book also offers no resolutions to this \\"problem\\". People can be evil. Look at all the wars throughout time, and the terrible things people can do to one another. We don't need a book to point this out. It is common sense. Golding has accomplished nothing, and many, many people agree."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding does not leave readers with any thinking space to ponder of the values he brought up in the book. Unlike Harper Lee, whose novel requires a certain level of intelligence to interpret and understand, this novel spits out the themes directly, leaving no space for imagination. Even the symbols are so simple and uninteresting.This book has such a cynical and pessimistic view of the world, that i totally disagree with. I believe that no child would cause such destruction as this, and no child would be like he described, a incarnate of Satan.It is a book with his own thinking. It may be good if one understands and agrees with his way of thinking.I don't."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"There are many things that I liked about this book. First and foremost, it is very well written. Golding can convey the mood of a scene very well. His extensive vocabulary allows each sentence to flow perfectly. It's a quick read, but the message in the book is very profound. Overall, it is a very interesting, powerful story.There are a few things that I did not like about the book. It was very depressing. My favorite character dies a gruesome death. It's basicly a story about children killing each other. The way he wrote it, Golding makes it sound like war is unavoidable. It made me sad.At first, I thought that the ending was completely wierd. I turned the last page in shock, waiting for more, but was dissappointed.Considering the things that I don't like about the book, I would not change a single thing. None of my classmates liked this book, but I actually did. It's not like I am a morbid person; I just think that the message is important. I probaby wouldn't like it if my class didn't force me to see all the symbolism. Now that I understand everything in it, I can appreciate the book. I would reccomend this book to someone who likes reading between the lines.

Telling a very realistic and moving story set in a very unrealistic backdrop \`Lord of the Flies' works on almost every level of literature to provide the reader with an all around emotionally gripping experience, and one they won't soon forget.As a plane carrying a group of young children is shot down during warfare the valuable cargo is spread out over an uninhabited island. The boys quickly must for their own civilization with only a sliver of hope to ever be found. The story mainly focuses around three very different boys. Ralph is the chosen leader, a boy who possesses common sense and an open mind. Piggy is his self-ordained advisor. He's the smartest of the boys but the most nervous and thus becomes the easiest target for the ruthless. Jack is one of the more ruthless, a born leader mostly because of his strong presence. He immediately attaches himself to the idea of hunting and becomes infatuated with the prospect of spilt blood.There's a scene in the novel where Ralph and Piggy lament over not having any adult supervision, not having a grownup tell them the course in which they should plot. Sitting back after reading this impressive classic and one will realize that adult supervision, or lack there of, was not the problem. The problem was that these boys grew up way too quickly. The problems that ensued were a direct result of their acting as adults, pursuing leadership and power and respect and authority. The clashes between Jack and Ralph and Piggy were all over power, over who had the right to rule and who would follow who.The novel opens with a glimmer of hope, that maybe just maybe with all the innocence in adolescence they may be able to survive in cohabitation without debilitating consequences, but almost immediately those hopes are smashed as the personality traits of the three main characters are uncovered and problems within the group begin to surface. The conclusion, as grim and tragic as it is, is a conclusion that is almost expected and best left to the readers discovery.So, with that in mind, I urge you to refrain from reading the introduction (beautifully written by E.M. Forster) or any of the \`notes on the text' found in the back for they give away too much of the story and or experience that is best left to self discovery. After you've finished the novel though, I encourage you to take a few minutes and read over what others have to say about the brilliance that is \`Lord of the Flies'. It will enlighten you and help you better appreciate and understand this novel as William Golding intended. \`Lord of the Flies' is classic for a reason. It's brilliant literature with meaning for all of us today. As we all may know full well, there's a lot we can learn from our children, but sadly, there's a lot our children learn from us that can be detrimental."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"One of the greatest novels ever written, Lord of the Flies brings into question the very nature of humanity itself. It brings in debate of some of history's most influential philosophers, Rosseau against Hobbes, concerning whether or not humanity is naturally good, or naturally evil. Golding's response and his analysis guarantees to shock the reader.In a WWII backdrop, a group of British boys are stranded on an island after their plane crashes on a beautiful island. Realizing that they would be there for a long time, Ralph, one of the boys, takes charge and attempts to lead the boys during their stay on the island. The story deviates as three perspectives take center stage and rival for humanity's attention. Piggy, the dorky intellectual, is the sole boy trapped on the island that understands the necessities for survival. He is the civilization the boys once knew, and the one that Golding holds with pride. A complete foil of Piggy's ideologies is presented through Jack. Jack is aggressive, cruel, and hungry for power, as he will use any savagery necessary to rise to power. In the middle of this dilemma is the story's protagonist, Ralph. Ralph is torn between using Piggy's wisdom and the allure of Jack's savagery. Through the eyes of Ralph, Golding forces the reader to decide which world humanity is capable of living in.The story is absolutely brilliant and promises to shock to the very last word. It is the perfect response to the total trash represented in the book's \\"inspiration,\\" Coral Island. Lord of the Flies brought back the much needed realism of humanity and its behavior that hadn't been truthfully and meticulously analyzed since Mark Twain. The language is painfully blunt, the images are horrifying, and the ending will leave you questioning even more of what you thought of society."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I am currently in High School and I was forced to read Lord of the Flies. At first i wasn't impressed but as i progressed through the book i realized how complex and interesting it could be. Key word being could. My best friend read the book a week before i did, we have different teachers, and the only thing she got from the novel was a cute adventure story of boys trapped on an island who go crazy. I couldn't believe she didn't see the significance. I was most interested is Golding characters like Simon who has Epilipsy and is almost a mystical, godly, all knowing character. Ralph represents democracy while Jack represents communism or totaltaliarism. I love how the characters could be fit into Golding's time. My teacher assigned us to write a criticism research paper of Lord of the Flies. The more research i find the more i love Lord of the Flies.If you haven't read the novel try to see the deeper meaning. And if you have, reread it because i bet you can discover something you missed."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a truly great book that can be appreciated by teenagers and adults alike, which is no doubt why it is often studied in schools.Golding makes pointed comment on religion, superstition, rituals, society, monarchy, democracy, etc. Coming so soon after WWII, during which he served, Golding has a cynical view of his fellow human beings.This book can be enjoyed on many levels. As a rip-roaring adventure yarn or - as the future Nobel Laureate obviously intended - a dark commentary on humanity.Golding who worked as a school teacher, brilliantly evokes the behaviour of boys running wild on a tropical island. Each boy is a living, breathing character.The book builds to a heart-thumping, unforgettable climax."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think the book wasn't believable enough that it could relate it to any ones life. Yes, it does have its points about life, but all in all it isn't realistic. I think the author's purpose for writing this book was to state the theme that, there is a need for civilization and rules. I agree with his idea. I made this conclusion when I saw the book's high points, which were the events that happen when there is no civilization or rules and it all led to chaos. Murder, theft, and violence are all products of no civilization, and that is shown in the book. I thought that the way that the author described the characters was amazing. The author described his characters to the max. You knew what a character was thinking when he said something or did something. The good characters were so innocent and pure. While, on the other hand, the evil characters were some of the worst people I've ever read about. The reader also loved to hate the evil ones, they do things that get on your last nerve. I don't think this book is believable. In the book, the children have to deal with events and situations that a thirty year old man would have trouble trying to solve. Children of the age of twelve or younger break into groups because of who stole the toy or the video game, not about how they should live or whether or not a childs schedule fits their lifestyle. Bottom line is that the book was good but has it's flaws."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies was a fantastic story that i would recommend to anybody. During a holocaustic World War II a plane crashes on a desert island leaving many children stranded. Coming together they find that they are alone with no adults around they celebrate they're new found freedom. Participating in anything they want they have the time of they're lives.Soon though they're order starts to come to a hault and all they're fun has spiraled into a down fall as they try to figure out how to be rescued. Chaos consumes them for an incredible story with an incredible ending. Four Stars to William Golding for this marvelous novel about brotherhood and representation of society at its best."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read in it school last year, as well as this year, and I wish we could read it again and again. I love the symbolism and the messege Golding is trying to portay of evil in all of us. Some of my classmates were grossed out probably because they were aware of how right Golding is about human nature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Have you ever thought about what extent someone would go through just to stay alive? Well find out in William Golding's book Lord of The Flies. The Lord of The Flies is a gripping book that takes you through the lives of a group of young British school boys whose plane crashes and leaves them fighting with nature and each other to stay alive and make it off of the isolated island. The group of boys try to start their own low class government and constitution, but when one of the young boys can't face this new government he breaks away and starts his own government which throws the island into a form of civil war. One by one each of the boys begin to lose their sanity and began eliminating each other. It shows just how easy it is for a group of normal civilized human beings can drastically change into inhuman and insane human beings when the stress and the extreme possibility of death is near. This book is riveting and emotional that proves that even the most civilized and disciplined people can turn into insane psychopaths. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think the author was trying to tell us that everyone has some kind of evil inside them. I agree with him because everyone isn't perfect. The best literary element in the book was the characters. I like how each character had its own great personality.It was a believable because without rules, crazy things like that can happen. The book could of be better if the begining was so slow and had more action in it. Overall i really liked the book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the flies was a book about a group of kids that plain crashes on an island and they get stuck their.The kids have no grownups around, so they have to do everything for themslves.They try to establish rules, but after a while nobody listens to the rules, and all hell breaks out. I think the authors purpose for writing the book was to show how people can turn savage in a short period of time without anyone to enforce the rules.I do agree with his message, because society's do need rules or else things like what happened in the book, will happen every day. In the book I think that the author handled the characters very well.There were many characters,and he described them and their personality very well.I think Golding is a great author. This book is very believable to me, because a plane could crash on a deserted island, and kids could have to take care of themselves with no grownups around.It all is possible. I think that Golding did a great job with this book and it is fine how it is written."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"So many people despise this novel because it is a cumpulsory for grade eleven students. I personally found the story both compelling and profound. If you aren't trying to look for any more than a good book to read, without the symbolism, it is decent. But if you examine the imagery presented, and the astounding knowledge of human conscience as depicted by Golding, you will finish with a whole new view. A haunting, penetrating study of human nature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The novel The Lord of the Flies by William Golding is a novel in which some boys get stranded on an island and they are trying to find their way off the island. To read this book and completly usnderstand this novel you should and almost have to be a very intellectual person and you have to be a deep person. There is some symbolism that is very difficult to understand and without a teacher or someone who understands the book telling you what it is about it could be very confusing. The book, however, had very good discription and was very well written. It made you feel like you were actually there with them and feeling their struggles and difficulties. I felt their frustration with each other. Can you imagine if you were stranded on this island and you had no adults, no parents, and no sense of government? I felt as if the book was never ending and it dragged on way too long. I didn't enjoy reading it therefore I really didn't put a lot of energy trying to figure out what the author was trying to say. I also am not a girl for ficton books and I usually don't like books that we have to read in school. If I were to read this book I would deffenitly go in with a different mind set. I would go in with the mind set that this book is very difficult to read and that I have to foucs a lot to see the hidden symbolism, and theme within the book. I enjoyed the scenery that was set up and the discription used to describe events. I recommend this book to anyone who has great understanding finding hidden symbolism and picking out the theme. Be prepared for a some what difficult novel yet thrilling. Be intense while reading this book!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is one of the slowest-starting books in the history of man. It takes a few pages to get yourself acclimated to Golding's writing style, which mixes stream-of-consciousness elements with traditional narrative in order to better portray the young, impressionistic (and impressionable) psyches of the children. That being said, the book hardly qualifies as boring. The statement it makes for the inner savagery and essential evil of man is quite strong, and never before this book had any other novel or work explored the subject in quite so provocative a manner. Yes, there is violence, murder, all committed by young men. They have reverted to their &quot;natural state,&quot; shucked off civilization and become what Golding argues to be the essence of man: selfish, violent, and covetous. For any who dislike the disturbing imagery - that does not negate the importance of the book. If anything, that should only prove how effective it is. It disgusts you because it makes you wonder if you are capable of it yourself. Four stars - a classic, but not a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"'Lord of the Flies' was written to show that no matter how civilized the human race thinks it is, it is all an illusion created for our own safety. We are all animals in soul, if not in mind. I was drawn into the book, I thought of the characters as real people, with real problems, and real personalities. I feared for the characters lives, for Golding's one-in-a-million writing style brought the story to life. 'Lord of the Flies' had to be one of the most believable books I've ever read. With an exciting, realistic plot; well-thought out characters; excellent imagery; and superb symbolism. I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to see the hidden side of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Although it is quite a gripping adventure story, there is far more to this book than a bunch of boys running about on an island. Golding himself designed it as a critical allegory illustrating the potentially dark nature of mankind and the importance of the individual in controlling society. However, it could easily be interpreted differently - as an illustration of the corrupting effect of society, as a reflection of the conflicting components of the human soul, etc. Truly a fascinating novel."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"LORD OF THE FLIES is a true modern masterpiece, a disturbing look at human nature and the decay of civilization. In this extraordinarily well-crafted book, William Goldman expertly and effectively uses symbolism to develop his themes. It is fast-moving, but my no means a &quot;light read&quot; and will almost certainly change your thoughts about civilization and human nature. The one thing I cannot understand, however, is why this book is required to be read by so many middle and even early high school students. Although the story is about pre-pubescent boys stranded on an island, it is NOT a book for children, who often find LORD OF THE FLIES boring (as shown by the fact that the overwhelming majority of negative reviews for this book are written by schoolchildren). Although LORD OF THE FLIES is not a difficult book to read, it takes a much greater degree of maturity and knowledge to be able to fully comprehend the themes (that man is inherently evil, etc.) and appreciate the use of symbolism in the book than most children under the age of 16 or 17 possess. However, for those who can appreciate the magnificent job that Goldman has done with this wonderfully disturbing parable, LORD OF THE FLIES is a life-changing work that is not easily forgotten. Enthusiastically recommended."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"One cannot fully appreciate &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; without first acknowledging the sheer volume of levels on which it works. The plot is, at the very least, engaging. Yet the novel's overall power lies in its structure; as it is through structure that the seeds of its meaning (and appreciation) can be unearthed. Once discovered, all else begins to fall into place.Consider that he sets the story on a remote Pacific island and makes his characters children. The island is the ideal setting from which to convey Golding's idea of the universality of evil, as it is untouched by civilization and is therefore open to the emergence of evil on an organic level. The setting reinforces the theory that evil exists in all of us, regardless of locational, political or cultural conditioning. He uses children rather than adults to reinforce the setting, as they are at the point in life whereby Man is at his most honest, and least likely to enter into a new, stark reality wearing the masks he has created for himself over the years. (The irony here being that masks are created in the novel; but as a result of regression, rather than growth. By having a child regress, the natural unconscious state of Man is realized.)As the island is a microcosm of the world, and the boys a microcosm of mankind, the notion of the universality of evil flourishes from this context. Golding suggests that man, by his very nature, is a sinner. Once we had fallen from grace (just as the boys fall from the sky), we condemned ourselves to a life whereby finding Eden is impossible. Our fates seem to be sealed. Early on in the novel, the reader learns through the discussions of the boys that atomic warfare is taking place in Europe. Golding sets the novel against the invisible yet looming backdrop of war so as to suggest that Man's inherent flaw is its allowing evil to dominate his world. This is because mankind at its ugliest (as represented by Jack) is incapable of acknowledging, and in turn controlling his dark side. Yet Piggy can control it, as he is a manifestation of the Freudian idea of the superego. Ralph is the ego, as his dichotemy is evidenced by his waivering back and forth to maintain control and reason. This is because Ralph finds himself slipping into the realm of the id, which of course, is Jack. As the book unfolds, clearly the id wins out, as chaos, aggression, violence and murder permeate the boy's so-called utopian word, just as is the case in the world of &quot;civilization&quot;. Man's fall from grace transcends time and space.The macrocosm/microcosm principle of the universality of evil is further reinforced through the novel's organization. Golding expertly structures the movement of the plot on two parallel plains. Note that the entire novel transcends slowly from a world of order, unity and comraderie into one of chaos, fragmentation and ultimately, bloodshed. This wholistic movement of order to disorder is replicated on the small scale through the intra-chapter movements themselves; each chapter begins ordered and ends in chaos. In other words, the physical structure of the novel replicates the thematic structure of the universality of evil. Note, though, that that the only two exceptions in the novel in which this physical parallelism does not occur are in the chapters pertaining to Simon. His chapters in the novel end in a tone of tranquility and spirituality. The first being the chapter entitled &quot;Huts on the Beach&quot; which closes with Simon, engrossed in quiet meditation under the silence and darkness of the forest's canopy. The second is at the end of &quot;A View to a Death&quot;, after his murder. Yet the tone is quietly elegant and luminous in its description of the water and sky upon his death.I suspect that Golding made these two structural inconsistencies to denote a message that in fact runs consistently, yet is never directly articulated in the novel. The clue to our own rescue; to our own freedom from the chains of the id, and from a world without faith lies in Simon, the whispering mystic. He is the only one that understands the beast in the shape of the lord of the flies, and can therefore communicate with him. This is because Simon understands that the beast is us. And perhaps from a literary standpoint, it was necessary that Simon be killed. It would suggest that for as long as we our governed by the beast within, without recognizing and controlling it, then we will never be ready to understand and experience salvation from ourselves. &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; teaches us that without psychological and spiritual balance, we are ultimately doomed."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Talk about eerie. This book's like a slap in the back of the head, because you know you'd do the same thing. You have to search to find all the hidden themes, but once you do, it's disturbing."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book out of curiosity. I was impressed for a book this old. I have to give it a 5 because, to me, it is better than the 4 it has. Probably it is being rated against other classic and we expect so much of it. Compared to most recent books I would give it a 5. This is an exciting book. The characters are excellent. They are realistic and give us a good look at who we (humans) are. The kids do natural things that we did as kids but the consequences are more severe because of the situation. It reminds me that we all could have been Nazis.It is refreshing compared to all the \\"socially significant, politically correct stuff written to make us feel good (feel we are good)."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's classic book Lord of the Flies is a startling insight into human nature. It shows humans acting at their most basic, primal level, which to us in modern times is the worst level. This level is one of instincts, fear, and a will to dominate and survive. However, Golding is in many parts too wordy, which interferes with the flow of the plot. I recommend this book to anyone who does not mind a little bit of gore."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book with a group of about 20 other people, and everyone hated it but me. The things that they disliked most were the graphic descriptions, the wordiness, and the often hard to understand symbolism. I however, liked it.I had read it before, so it was a little easier to understand. I believe that once you are able to get past the aforementioned details, it is a very interesting concept. The idea of the beast within us all and the fact that we are all essentially savages at heart is a somewhat frightening (albeit intriguing) concept.I highly recommend this book, although some readers (like many of my friends) may not be able to get over the duller aspects of it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"i loved this book in high school, and i love it even more today. what a wonderful commentary on the society's need for organization and routine overtly juxtaposed by the savage desire for a carefree, structureless lifestyle. i highly recommend this for lovers of politics, sociology, and/or fine (and concise) literature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"For a highschool book project the only thing that matters is the lenght of the book, &quot;the shorter the better.&quot; This novel is what they say, &quot;short and sweet.&quot; I picked up this novel with no good intentions only to find out this is one of my favorite novels I ever read! William Gerald Golding created a master peice when he wrote &quot;Lord of the Flies.&quot; This book has made me think beyond any normal person would think, I asked myself what would I have done on that island? Or what tribe would I have joined? Several questoins that will always be left unanswered.The boy's are flying home from military school and their plane crashes into the ocean. Only to find out that no adults have survived. They now have to live and depend on eachother to survive as hopes of ever seeing home descends dramatically. Now all eyes look upon the oldest to survive.The main character Ralph is a great leader, he's smart whitted has very good commmon sense and is a nice guy to the others. Ralph tries day in and day out to get him and the others off the island. Tension builds as more and more rebel from Ralph's orders and create a new tribe. I thought Golding did a great job with adding &quot;spice&quot; into this novel. Heat rises between the two tribes as the satanic Jack (the leader of the other tribe) gets so agressive death rises upon the kids.From the steller descriptions of the atmosphere to getting up close and personal with the kids, I think that this book deserves a 4 out of 5 only because the ending left me with a lot of unanswered questions.I highly recomend this book to any who likes thrills, adventure, humor or to someone who just wants a quick read. I guarantee you will not be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Though some of the other reviewers claimed that this book is sick, I must disagree. The book is social commentary. The boys, stranded on an island, develope a society not unlike the global society. In the end, when they are picked up by a warship, the ship is doing exactly as the boys were on the islannd. This tragic novel, is great in demonstrating the &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;. With its 3- dementional characters, it is a book that I would recomend to anyone, young and old. But please, when reading it look at it on many different levels, don't jest take the entire story literally."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies, William Gerald Golding,Perigee, 1959, 208 pgsWilliam Gerald Golding was born in 1911. He was an English novelist who won the Nobel Prize in 1983. He was educated at Marlborough Grammar School, which was where his father taught, and at Brasenose College in Oxford; he graduated in 1935. He became a schoolmaster in a school in Salisbury and joined the royal navy in 1940. After the invasion of France, he began teaching again until 1961. He published Lord of the Flies in 1954, Free Fall in 1959, The Spire in 1964, Darkness Visible in 1979, Rites of Passage in 1980 (won the booker prize) in addition to its sequels Close Quarters in 1987 and Fire Down Below in 1989. He was knighted for his accomplishments in 1988, and died 5 years later in 1993.The main idea that the author is trying to present deals with society. Golding is trying to convey that without the principles, conditions, or standards of society, individuals lose these values; without order, there can only be disorder. Thus, without rules, the ability to differentiate between right and wrong is lost, leading to chaos.The novel takes place during a war, which is unmentioned. A plane that is carrying a group of British students is shot down somewhere over the Pacific Ocean and crashes. The pilot dies and the children find themselves alive on this uninhabited island without any adults. Ralph, one of the oldest of the survivors, along with his friend Piggy, find a conch shell. Ralph blows the conch, and gathers the survivors and the novel begins from there. Events lead to the death of Piggy and Jack, one of the choirboys, to take control of the group of children. The boys start hunting Ralph, and Ralph runs to the beach where a naval officer arrives with a ship. The boys then get to go home after the officer thinks they have been playing games.As I said before, the author is stating: without the rules brought by society, the difference between right and wrong is clouded. I agree with the author because his novel was the perfect example of his message. It seems as though society is represented through a conch the characters carried around with them. After the conch was broken, society diminished from the island and the boys resorted to violent ways of attaining order; the hunters and the hunted. When the naval officer arrives, society's rules are again present on the island, and the boys become civilized again. This whole novel is a fair representation of what can go wrong without the standards of society. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a novel that deals with human nature and survival, because it so graphically and accurately depicts it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In high school, I remember thanking my lucky stars that I didn't have to read this. My friends all whined about it, and I considered myself lucky that I didn't have to endure the torture. Now that I've read this book, I feel like I missed out. I would have enjoyed reading and discussing this book in high school.Lord of the Flies is the story of a group of English boys who are planed wrecked on an deserted island. The oldest of the children are around 12-years-old, and the youngest around 6-years-old.It amazed me how so many of the boys didn't even realize what was giong on. I realize they are children and it probably seemed like an adventure, but it seems like they would have been aware that they had an accident. They seemed so &quot;unaware&quot; of what happened. At first, the boys saw their getaway from the adults as an adventure, but as the story progresses they start to delve into the &quot;darkness in their heart&quot;.I don't even know where to begin with this books. There are so many themes that could be adressed. You could look at humans innately animalistic nature (that doesn't make them much better than animals), you could look at how the boys &quot;society&quot; paralleled the war-stricken world they lived in, or you could ponder on the &quot;loss of innocence&quot;. Golding managed to pack many themes ranging from psychological matters to the relationship between people.I truly enjoyed this book. It's one of those books that you have to read more than once (or once very slowly) to grasp the many different elements presented to you. The only thing that I didn't like about this book is how Golding seemed to sometimes ramble about the landscape. Don't get me wrong. I wanted to know about the island, but he seemed to go on and on about one thing, and I would wonder if it would ever end."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies dives deep into and remains inside the collective psyche of a group of stranded children. The downward spiral they go into is gradual and frightening to behold. Certain children are representative of adult personalities found in the real world.You have Ralph, the moral compass. It can be argued that he was the only one on the island to hold true to what he believed in without fail. A natural leader, Ralph is chosen as chief by the other children at the beginning of the novel.Piggy is an ignored conscience. He says logical things that would help the group, but is made fun of because of his annoyingly nerdy, fat appearance. A lot of people probably know people like this.Jack is another leader. But unlike Ralph, he rebels and does what he wants. The other children see things in Jack that they inheritanly think is cool and want to emulate.When Jack becomes fed up with piggy and Ralph's logic, he starts a new camp. Eventually everyone but Ralph and Piggy are in Jack's group.Jack's clan becomes caught up in the idea of a 'beast.' The thing that does not exist exists in the minds of the children as an unseen evil that will attack at any time. The beast is the one driving force that keeps Jack and his group going, and it is enough to cloud there judgement, eventually driving them to kill.Ralph and Piggy hold strong while everything goes wrong. Jack and his group ignore their mistakes and pretend like nothing happened. Jack makes things up and his clan automatically excepts it as truth.The last moment of the book is a powerful climax. Jack and the childrens' primal savagry comes to a head as they chase Ralph through the forest. They have let go of all hopes and truths that the outside world contains. The fire on the island reflects off their eyes. But when they witness a rescue soldier dressed in uniform, everything that had built up inside them collapses. The fire leaves their eyes and they seem to immediately forget all the things that were important to them on the island. Ralph is the only one that seems to understand that finally it is over, and that he alone did not falter.This book has a great theme and a wonderfully frightening atmosphere. However, I did not particularly enjoy the style of writing, and I thought the symbolism was gratuitous. All in all, a worthy read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Are we born basically good? Or are we born basically bad? William Golding seems to have the answer. In this novel, The Lord of the Flies, we enter the a world of darkness and violence. All spawned out of the hearts of very young men.The bible says, \\"There in no one who does good, no not one.\\"And, \\"All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.\\"The hard fact of the matter is that man's natural bent is turned in toward himself.This self centeredness is a mild transgression...that creates all kinds of deeper more insidious types of evil in the hearts of men. What is stealing, but the selfish desire to possess something we can't buy? What is jealousy, but the selfish desire to be better than someone else? What is murder, but the selfish want to supercede someone else and take their place in the world from them? All of these evil desire spawn out of a natural inclination toward selfishness.In the Lord of the Flies we see the way in which a \\"normal\\" human being spirals quickly down into a life of total depravity. The \\"feel good\\" sociologists and psychologists will try to convince you that man is born basically good. But if you look at the actions of man and novels such as Golding's you will clearly see that man has the capability and natural inclination to turn utterly savage in a heartbeat.In this compelling story we meet a group of school boys stranded on a remote desert island. The boys work cooperatively for a time. Soon the trappings of society and order break down. The boy's rudimentary attempt at establishing a government crumbles and is rabidly devoured by the voracious appetite of self centeredness.There are two main power centers in this book:* Ralph/Piggy- who try to run a civilized society ruled by common sense and order.* Jack- the leader of a group of hunters who are ruled by sensual desires and to satify their basest needs.These two power centers clash brutally just like we do in our own minds, when we battle to keep down our strange desires. Like the concience battling the selish nature. Ralph/Piggy are a civilized concience trying to keep things orderly and good. While Jack and his hunters are untamed desire, ruled by their stomach and lust for violence.The hunters quickly decide to battle with the idea of organized society. They soon splinter off into a tribe ruled by the concept of \\"might makes right.\\" Ralph and Piggy try to hold onto the frayed edges of society and order only to be sucked into the endless void violence and uncontrolled selfishness.This book is timeless. You can easily apply it's message and themes throughout your life and experience. It plays out true everytime. True in that it frighteningly mirrors human nature unbound...Read it if you want to take a long hard look at yourself, and to examine your own thoughts and motivations in it's light. You may see how close we all are to becoming savages.Golding's novel can be very dark and disturbing... but let it take you in, by all means. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Like many Americans, I was \\"forced\\" to read this book back in high school. Like many at the time, I hated the fact that I was being FORCED to read a book without so much as a vote on the matter. At the time, in the early 80's, I found a way around in Cliff Notes. Still...I didn't get it. I tried, I think I got a \\"C\\" bs'ing my way through the required paper, but I really didn't get it.30 years later I sat down to actually read the book, and I get it now. The story is a masterful depiction of the collapse of society, expressed in the microcosm of the boy's tiny island world. Many others...see the most helpful positive review...have gone to great lengths to spell it all out here on Amazon reviews, so I won't do it again. I just wanted to cast my vote, assign my rating, and let anyone who might read this know that I get it now. And it's brilliant.Also, from what I can tell, a vast majority of the negative reviews, and nearly all of the 1-star reviews, appear to be from kids who, like me, were forced to read this book for school. Maybe in 30 years they'll get it, too."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's Lord of the Flies is a troubling look at humanity and society from the perspective of a group of kids. What makes it all the more troubling is the way it challenges our belief that children are innocent and only adulthood corrupts them. Golding makes it clear that there is something far more sinister, and impossible to describe, that makes civilizations crumble and allows evil to ravage us. Whatever this something is, it's in all of us. Through the eyes of a group of children isolated on a small island, the novel pits the need for civilization against the irrational savagery innate within us all.Lord of the Flies is a symbolic novel, meaning its events aren't meant to be taken literally. The setup, a plane wreck, is barely developed because what's important is to put these children in isolation, not how they got there or how probable it is only they would survive the crash. The pigs are another enigma. They seem to be an odd occupant of the novel, but their presence is symbolic rather than scientific fact. The pigs aren't just pigs, but a representation of flesh: the desire to eat meat and to overpower and slaughter living creatures. This isn't to say the novel is an abstraction. It is very vivid, and the reader can clearly picture the setting and the drama that unfolds.The island society is divided between \\"biguns\\" and \\"littluns.\\" The littluns spend most of their time playing and don't seem to fully comprehend the severity of their situation, and the biguns are the ones responsible for getting things done. A fear spreads amongst the littluns that there's a beast on the island. This beast takes many forms, residing on land, in the sea, and even in the air. The biguns try to shrug these fears off as silly, though in reality they're simply afraid to admit a certain terror at the idea of a beast on the island. This terror helps drive a wedge in Ralph's attempt at civilization, and the littluns are right to be afraid, though the beast turns out to be much closer to home than they realize.The novel is much more mature than today's young adult books. It isn't written in the fast and easy way that teens are accustomed to now, but at a slow, deliberate pace and with lots of description. Of course, it is beautifully written, and this is the benefit of using a more sophisticated, slower-paced writing style. The novel's concluding chapters become much more exciting and action-packed, and there is a lot of dialogue, which is something teens like. Personally I've heard many mixed opinions about the novel, and many are disturbed by the violence, though I think a large part of the dislike of the novel comes from the fact that many readers find symbolism intimidating. The problem is when someone hears a novel is symbolic, they read the book with a different ear than they would otherwise. Though it is a challenging read, I think the best way to enjoy Lord of the Flies is not to analyze it as a configuration of symbols, but to see the story as it is on the surface, in the conflicts between the children and their ideas, and wonder what Golding has to say about society. You may be troubled by his conclusion, but it's important to recognize."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"With a palette of earth tones and straightforward sentences, Golding paints a picture of the descent of a microcosm of British society into barbarism. The theme is of a society whose self-identified elite have always feared not that the barbarians are at the gates, but that they were inside all along.This classic book, short and simply phrased, deals with a planeload of children stranded without adults on a tiny, forested island during wartime. The pilot dead and the plane swallowed by the jungle, they must make their own social accommodations without the help of adults or the certainty of rescue. The thoughtful, bookish elements of society typified by the asthmatic and unathletic \\"piggy\\", find themselves rapidly marginalised and persecuted, while a cult of the hunt arises around one manipulative leader not squeamish about violence. The picture of humanity rapidly descending into a wild state is chilling. Facing the fears of a child formulated in its dreams and reified by manifestations of death, such as a perished parachuter in the night and the slaughtered offering, known as the Lord of the Flies, to \\"The Beast\\", the community rapidly turns on itself and extinguishes lives that tread incautiously across its unfamiliar terrain.I just happened to finish this book the same day I watched a David Attenborough sequence on chimps conducting a razzia against a neighbouring troop. The focussed, near-humans expressions of the chimps and the coldness of the violence and subsequent cannibalism brought a resonance that echoes throughout this book. Another strange tremor comes from the boys' barbarian war paint. In a Schwarzenegger film, the actors are shorn of individuality with ski masks so that they can become expendable. In Golding, the actors are freed from human responsibility by concealing their own features, rendering those around them expendable. Shorn of the comforts of civilisation and disindividuated by face painting, this is what we could all too easily become.A chilling and classic work."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"// SPOILER BELOW //Let's start from the end. The rescuing naval officer averts his gaze and gives the boys a few minutes to regroup their emotions and sense of becoming, their understanding in what it is they're doing, and what does he do? He \\"wait(s), allowing his eyes to rest on the trim cruiser in the distance.\\" And that's the final sentence in the book. After all the madness that's taken place on the island we're left with a \\"trim\\" cruiser, a symbol of modern man, modern achievement and modern man's very propensity to conflict; we witness the complex machinery, that ship, used to deter and keep it in check. (for I see the ship as generally good) But how does that ship come about? Throughout the book the boys try to build better things, things like TVs and radios, futile endeavors on an island. The accomplishments to which they strive are inextricably connected with history, with accomplishments that have come before us, with a fire passed down generation to generation. We inherit, we do not continually reinvent the wheel.But what if we had none of that? What if there were no streets beneath our feet and no maps delineating mankind's established purpose and order? -- Here begins Lord of the Flies.Lord of the Flies is a fast paced narrative written with an exacting eye for detail and natural images. The book is filled with a rich symbolic system that does not distract but adds to the pleasure of the read. The characters are depicted vividly and uniquely. And the entire plot and progress of the book runs with a profound momentum that carries you along, barrels out of control and splinters into a multitude of meanings and interpretations and a grand sense of experience.The book exists both on the level of character struggle - especially between Jack and Ralph - and on the level of a continuum of events that lead to situations that offer statements about our true or original nature. Effectively, Jack is subsumed by the island and its primitiveness. He paints his face to resemble another of its brutal and amoral powers. He draws others towards him, first with his charisma then with a more diabolical magnetism, where as Simoneneric say to Ralph as he pleads for their reason: \\"It's a tribe\\" and \\"Never mind what's sense. That's gone.\\" Justice and truth has become ceremony and worship of the chief.When the conch is smashed into a thousand pieces we ask, what is it that exactly has been lost? Something precious and past down through the ages, some force of light for man in the universe's surrounding darkness. Some point of cohesion among men. A reason, a simple reason for we as the human race. Then Ralph panics and runs through thickets and woods and eventually stumbles into a clearing and finds himself face to face with the Lord of the Flies, the bleached skull of a pig - white where before the conch had gleamed white; it's sick face deriding his attempts at escape, a cavity filled with a new amorality that fuels the primitive maw that swallows up these kids until, like Percival Wemys Madison, they forget even their provenances, even their names.One further piece of symbolism. As the fire roars and the savages cry in their chase, it is \\"as though the forest itself were angry with him, a somber noise across which the ululations were scribbled excruciatingly as on slate.\\" On slate? Are these boys creating a new schoolroom, one of fear and brutal reckonings? Developing a new rite of initiation, but something unmastered and unbequeathed, unlike any of the schoolrooms from which they were snatched."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Ever fantasize that you are on an island free from the restraints of society? William Golding has taken that scenario to the nth in this story of a bunch of English boys, plane wrecked on an island during WWII.We see the fabric of society slowly and most assuredly ripping as the rules are discarded one by one. Golding is very graphic in his description of the demise of pigs and plants.One will never look at fun and games in the same way.Lord of the Flies: Essential Art House"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"With a society as problematic as ours, its no wonder writers produce books that examine human nature and the problems it can create. William Golding was one such writer when he wrote the book \\"Lord of the Flies\\". This book takes a deep look at how a group of people would do cut off from society and how they would interact with each other. The book begins when a plane crash strands a large group of young boys on a small island. It doesn't take long to realize that the faults in human nature may threaten their chances of leaving the island alive. The plot is interesting and continues to build up as we see the characters falling apart. Ralph, the group leader, represents the average man; kind, compassionate, and he just wants to get everyone off the island alive. He may not stay in power for long though as his rival, Jack, doubts his leadership abilities and longs to have that power and respect for himself. All of the characters are deeply developed and each represents a different role in our society. This book will pull you in and make you care what happens to the characters, a great read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"How can I even begin to comment on this book? It was wonderful in every way- its symbology, dark undertones of human emotion and archtypes, and murderously well-done plot. One who thinks that this book is about a couple of boys stuck on an island randomly fighting and killing each other is superficial and quite frankly, stupid. This book is riddled with important messages about human nature and society, and much can be learned from the mistakes of these unknowing children. Golding's knowledge of ancient concepts of human nature, and also his accurate use of Freudian archtypes serve to deeply complement and better this wonderful book. I recommend this wonderful novel to any literate human being."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In my view chapter 8 is definitely the central chapter of the novel. In this chapter Jack leaves and the boys split into two camps; Jack and his hunters become increasingly savage; and we finally understand the true nature of the Beast as well as understanding Simon's role in the novel.The chapter begins with every boy on the island finally accepting the existence of a Beast; even Ralph, who was once so sceptical (\\"But there isn't a beastie!\\") believes there is one and convinces Piggy, who also used to be a cynic.Jack calls a meeting amid the growing tensions between himself and Ralph. We also recognise Ralph's growing maturity in the face of Jack's childishness. Jack's language is childish: \\"He isn't a prefect\\". Jack confronts everyone at the last meeting all the boys have together, and criticizes Ralph: ' \\"He just gives orders and expects people to obey.\\" ' At the end he challenges them as to whether they think Ralph ought to be Chief, and is humiliated when none of the boys agree with him: 'The humiliating tears were running from the corner of each eye'. He 'blundered' away and 'dived' into the forest.Simon then makes a suggestion: that they should climb the mountain, where the Beast is, because there seems nothing else to do. Simon is viewed as being 'crackers' by the rest of the group and is not taken seriously, especially by Piggy, in who he had at first trusted. Piggy changes here from being a shy and socially incompetent but intelligent boy, into someone gaining confidence by Jack's absence, but also by scoring points off others.An ominous mood is then set after the choirboys vanish, to go off with Jack. Jack imposes himself as leader and the choirboys accept it: ' \\"I'm going to be chief.\\" They nodded'. This leadership is enforced later in the chapter when Maurice and Robert announce that \\"The Chief has spoken\\" when Jack encourages others to join him after stealing some fire. However, they are reluctant to make this announcement; maybe they still feel that Ralph is the real leader and Jack in the wrong.We are reminded of how much the boys have changed: 'ages ago they had stood in two demure rows and their voices had been the song of angels'. Now they are hunters, dirty and uncivilized, about to kill a pig. We also realise that, for all their tough talk, they are scared of the Beast as well: ' \\"We shan't dream so much down here. This is near the end of the island.\\" They agreed passionately out of the depths of their tormented private lives.' The island also has a psychological landscape: at the end of the island, they are near the 'castle' rock.Kill is ritually left for the Beast, a chilling reminder of their progression towards primitive savagery. The pig's head on the stick represents a manifestation of the Devil; therefore it is significant that Jack and Roger are the boys who put the pig's head on the stick.Roger 'sharpens a stick at both ends' on which to put the pig's head. He sharpens a stick at both ends again when hunting down Ralph at the end of the novel. Roger features more in this chapter and becomes more important throughout the book; in the end he kills Piggy. In this chapter he is the most bloodthirsty of the boys: 'Roger found a lodgement for his point and began to push until he was leaning with his whole weight.'Ralph and Piggy call a meeting; during this, the idea of rescue becomes even fainter. Ralph's hair which falls over his eyes becomes a 'shutter'. Long hair is uncivilized; as Ralph's hair becomes longer so he can't see, the idea of rescue gets fainter as Ralph becomes less civilized.As the novel' title shows, this is the central chapter. Simon is a saintly character; a prophet who sees things. During one of his 'times' (faints, which prophets are meant to have) he sees a pig's head on a stick come alive and turn into the Lord of the Flies, a manifestation of the Devil, hence the 'ancient, inescapable recognition'. Through Simon's confrontations with the Lord of the Flies we come to understand the true nature of the Beast- it is the Lord of the Flies (\\"And I'm the Beast\\") but it is also psychological: \\"I'm part of you? Close, close, close! I'm the reason why it's no go?\\" However, Simon is not allowed to tell the others about his discovery \\"We'll forget the whole thing\\" and is threatened \\"You're not wanted. We are going to have fun on this island!\\" (see pages 45 and 95) and is warned that if he tells the others, and stops them having fun, \\"we shall do you\\". Simon does try to tell the others and is killed; the prophecy comes true.Since it is in his imagination that the Lord of the Flies warns him that he will die if he tells, and the Lord of the Flies is part of him, in effect, like Jesus, he predicts his own death.I had to study this book for school, and unlike other school books, I did not find myself hating it after a couple of days. I'd read it before, but thought no more of it than a sinister boys' adventure story. Studying it (I think it's one of the few books meant to be read into) really made me take an interest and now it's in my top 5 along with \\"Discworld\\", \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\", \\"The Day of the Jackal\\" and \\"empire of the Sun\\"."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's novel, Lord of the Flies, is a story of details, adventure, and conflict. William Golding uses his excellent skills of being able to switch looks that he creates on characters by using a hefty amount of details. The details provide readers with the feelings of other characters. When I read books, I enjoy books that have plenty of details that make your reading more vivid in your imagination and allow you to feel as if you are in the story too. I like how Golding creates different adventures inside one big adventure to make the novel have more excitement and more creativity. William Golding is known for his outstanding conflicts in his stories. His books always have more conflicts than others because his are more enjoyable. For instance William has a conflict between the setting and a conflict between the characters. Most authors just have conflict in the characters. I enjoyed this book more than most books and that is why I recommend you to read this. If you enjoy action and like plenty of details then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord Of The Flies is a very dark and unpredictable book that portrays the dissolve of a society in a smaller, more confined way. The way Golding starts the story you can tell that you're going to be for quite a ride, as he places you right in the middle of the action, perhaps to give you the chance to understand the confusion the children faced.This book begins with the children being thrown on an island and having to figure out a way to survive. They eventually seem to get themselves pretty well organized except for a few lazy workers. Then we start to see more and more people neglecting their work and this eventually turns into a small rebellion that continues to grow throughout the book.Since coming to the island the only two people there who had the ability to lead the group was Jack and Ralph. Ralph was clearly always the more rational of the two as he constantly focused ontrying to have people build shelters, and a fire, which he hoped would eventually be what saved them.Jack had a strange desire for hunting that slowly grew into a sick obsession by the end of the book. Jack eventually becomes fed up with the way Ralph is running things and branches away from the group. Support for Jack's group slowly grows as the book goes on. Either a desire to hunt or an unwillingness to work eventually causes just about everyone to leave Ralph's group except for Piggy.Piggy seems like a bright boy with good ideas, but because of his silly appearance and the complete disrespect he recieves from the other kids no one ever pays attention to him. The ironic part about it is that the cause of all the chaos on the island was the absence of an adult, which except for his age, was basically Piggy.While the children in the hunters group feared only the beast as they went on their daily hunts, Piggy and Ralph had to contstantly live in fear of the other children, who had become scary and unpredictable. The children in the hunters group revolved their entire world around the beast, who they had all accepted as real at this point. In this world they forgot about ever trying to get back home and seemed out of touch with reality as they casually talked about killing their friends.Another friend of Ralph's on the island was Simon, who never had much to say , but you could tell had a lot on his mind.To emphasize the drastic downward spin the islands tiny society had taken he punished the only two children Ralph could trust and readers had come to know.When the children all finally come back into contact with an adult he acts as an escape back to reality from the strange imaginary world that they had created."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"\\"Lord of the Flies\\" is singularly the most important novel for required reading, whether assigned in school or self-imposed. It regularly appears as number one on my own list of best books.Let's play \\"What if.\\" What if a plane carrying a full load of school boys crashes on a deserted island with no adult survivors? What would happen to those boys? What would you expect to happen?William Golding works with this premise: an idyllic setting, innocent schoolboys. One boy, an older boy just short of teenage years, a boy with fair hair, assumes leadership to stir the others into some semblance of organization and survival mode, much like adults would do if adults were present. He also saw a need to defuse the web of fear of the younger ones. Where are we? How long will we need to wait before someone comes for us? All questions with no answers at this time.Ah, yes, Golding tells us, everything goes well for a while. But remember the \\"scar\\" made by the crashing plane? Something ugly is on this island (but it's not the scar). It's in the bushes, in the dark, in the depths, in the depths of hearts, and it grows like the malignancy it is.A blatant revelation of what is about to come occurs when Roger silently and stealthily watches a young'un, unbeknownst to the little child. All the young'un is doing is running a stick through the sand, disturbing a crab in a tiny pool of water. Even he imposes control and fear on a helpless creature as Roger boldly picks up a couple of rocks and tosses them the youngster's way. He deliberately misses but comes closer with each throw. Next time he will probably hit the young boy, but not yet. This taboo--deliberately and unnecessarily causing pain to one smaller than you--has not been broken--yet.Although the dance of the spears, the primeval chants, the attack and killing of the pig, then feasting on its flesh, their kill, are shocking acts of savagery, this event is foreshadowed by the seemingly innocent lob of the stones. From a casual incident, but one with eventual intentionality, the ritualistic slaughter is not so far-fetched or surprising. Golding prepares his readers. This is how the chaos of society starts. It begins with one simple disconnect from the rules. It begins in the minds and hearts. Will I do what society expects? Will I follow the rules to keep things running and working? Do I break a rule or two for my own enhancement. Will I feel a power surge if my rock hits that young \`un?Ralph would probably speak of the terror of knowing that rules WILL be broken. He would speak of the utter horror that any rule can be and will be broken and he won't live to tell about it. Just ask Piggy.This novel is the only one I taught over and over during the twelve years I worked with high school seniors. My other choices I would switch around those years, drop some, add some. This one I kept. It is that important. I think of \\"Lord of the Flies\\" as a necessary manual for societal behavior and an effort to keep the chaos of evil at bay.Is it even necessary to ask how many times that rock has been thrown since this novel was published in the 1950's? Or how much chaos has imploded so many lives?Like the way of manuals, some remain in circulation and are deeply read; others fall by the wayside out of disinterest. Some are thrown in the trash. \\"Lord of the Flies\\"--what is its current status? And society--how is it doing? Reader, are you a little bit fearful?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding wrote this book as a response to \\"Coral Island,\\" in which a group of boys shipwrecked on an island make Christians out of cannibals, hunt pigs but do not spill blood, and are cheerfully rescued. Obviously, Lord of the Flies is much more than an adventure story about good little boys. It is an exploration into the darker side of man and the true source of the \\"beast,\\" or Devil.Meet Ralph, who represents sanity, common sense, and the conscience of man; Jack, who loves nothing more than hunting, blood, and power, and who Freudians might say embodies the Id; Piggy, who personifies intelligence, logic, and reason; and Simon, who discovers the true nature of the beast and represents a ray of hope for mankind.I love this book because contained in less than 200 pages is an insight into human nature and the failings of society. When you read this, be prepared not only to examine the book and all its symbolism but yourself and your civilization."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"With this his first novel, author William Golding wrote a novel that he could never surpass in greatness. Lord of the Flies is a novel about our human nature. Too often I think, people jump to quick conclusions about the book and Golding's stand on human nature. \\"His stance is too pessimistic\\" or \\"That books really gross.\\" What these people fail to realize is that Golding tried to paint a picture of human nature as he saw it. He wasn't making things up, I don't think he was particularly angry, he wrote Lord of the Flies to expose people to the atrocities that he witnessed in World War II.One of the largest underlying principles in Lord of the Flies is of course, human nature. William Golding gives the reader three interesting characters to analyze: Jack, Piggy, and Ralph. It's quite apparent as you read the novel that Golding must have read a little Sigmund Freud before writing Lord of the Flies. Let's start with Jack. Jack is the definite Id on the island. He wants to survive but he also wants to eat meat and have fun. Jack is clearly unable to control these urges and in turn has a pretty large influence on the other boys on the island. Piggy is the definite Superego on the island. Piggy is always referring to \\"well my auntie...\\" and always finds an excuse not to do something. Piggy has no intentions of satisfying his id, and in turn influences only Ralph and Simon. Ralph on the other hand, takes the middle road. He is clearly trying to find a way to satisfy his id, but he can't seem to find one. Take what he said in chapter eight for instance: \\"...Without the fire we can't be rescued. I'd like to put on war-paint and be a savage. But we must keep the fire burning...\\" Ralph is definitely trying to satisfy his id, but those laws of culture still remain with him, telling him it's not the thing a proper English boy should do.Another interesting connection I made while reading, was one between Jack's status of leader and the ideology of Thomas Hobbes. Unlike Hobbes though, Jack's power was used for quite the opposite affect. Hobbes believed that in order for a perfect society to exist, a higher power had to be in charge, in order to keep the other citizens in check. Jack was that higher power on the island. He was in control of everything, however, his power had quite the opposite affect of \\"keeping people in check.\\" Jack used the powerful persuasion of the id to persuade others. Jack could promise meat and fun, whereas Ralph could promise labor and fruit, something the other boys definitely didn't want.Lord of the Flies is also a novel filled with symbolism. Probably the most important of these symbols was the conch. The conchs represented several things, including freedom and order on the island, and possibly, even for a short time, unity between the boys. One of the most interesting aspects to the conch was the fact that Piggy couldn't use it. This shows a lack of leadership or strength on Piggy's part. The conch became a tool of free speech. Those who wanted to speak at the tribal council had to hold the conch in order to be heard. However, as the story progressed, this practice diminished more and more, until the island was a place of complete chaos and anarchy. In one of the last chapters of the novel, the conch gets completely destroyed. This symbolizes two things. First, it symbolizes the end of order on the island- no more meetings, no more assemblies, none of that, the island was a place of anarchy. Secondly, this destruction symbolizes the end of Ralph's leadership. The boys had become slaves to Jack and his power, their conscience gave in.Finally, about the novel itself. Golding is quite obviously a fan of Joseph Conrad. The writing style is almost identical, and the subject matter is very similar, with Golding opting to use children (young boys) instead of the men of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. The novel moves very quickly and it's rather short (202 pages in my copy.) You'll be immersed in the varying characters and degrees of humanity that they present. Keep in mind, that although Golding's view on humanity may seem very pessimistic, he's writing from his perspective on human nature, something that he witnessed first hand during WWII."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If not for anything else, William Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES (1954) is remarkable for having come out at a time when Western society was being bombarded with visions of totalitarian nightmares. The Nazis were gone, but still in modern memory. Russia's totalitarian state was a constant threat. McCarthyism hovered over everyone's privacy, as did J. Edgar Hoover. And recent fiction, like Aldous Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD and, especially, George Orwell's 1984 presented world views where the human spirit is all but squelched by governments and technologies.LORD OF THE FLIES, in its own way, says, \\"Hold on a second! Humans do need to be regulated. And they do need to protect themselves from each other.\\" His tale is a warning: Humanity, without government, will degenerate into savagery and anarchy. And that is precisely what happens in this book. You know the plot, by now. But what has to be mentioned is that William Golding is a visionary who has the story-telling mastery to convey and do justice to that vision. LORD OF THE FLIES is a remarkable and powerful book, one that should be on everyone's bookshelf."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Although I have not quite finished Lord of the Flies, I love the book so far. From my observations, the readers who enjoyed the novel loved the premise and the symbolism. Those who did not really like the book had problems either with having children as characters and carrying out these acts, or that it started out too slow. From where I am at in the book, it has been pretty good.In September 19, 1911 British author William Golding was born in Cornwall, UK. Golding went to Oxford University to study in natural science; he then changed his major to English literature. Golding joined Britain's royal navy and fought in World War2. In September of 1954 he published his first, and most successful book, Lord of the Flies. Golding passed away on June 19, 1993.The idea of these children stranded on this island and trying to survive is a fascinating plotline. The fact that these kids create their own little factions is also quite captivating. If this were to happen in real life, the factioning of the boys would have most likely happened. It would happen because as history can back up, people always separate themselves based on difference, whether it be due to opinions or race, people always segregate. The symbolism is this book is heavily implied. Ralph for instance is the leader, and it is implied that he is the voice of reason. Piggy is the timid follower who is very logical. Then, you have Jack. Jack is meant to represent the devil. He leads the children away from Ralph and teaches them to kill and disobey. People who did not enjoy the book missed all of this. All of this symbolism made the book so much more interesting because it turned a survival story into a story about human nature and the struggle of good vs. evil.I will agree with the critics that the book did start out a little bit slow, but it picked up shortly after. I have enjoyed this book for the most part; that must be why it is on my outside reading list. It may not be one of my favorite books thus far, but it must be a classic for a reason."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It is always with a sense of foreboding that I pick up a book that I loved when I was much younger and read it after several years have passed, my fear being that the book will no longer hold up after the passage of time. Lord of the Flies was a book that I read at least three times a year when I was growing up, starting at about age 12. I eagerly devoured it, grappling with all of its symbolism, and even writing poems about some of the main characters. Fortunately I was never required to read it for school or I likely would not have enjoyed it as much.I was pleased to read it again and find that Golding's novel of World War II era prep school boys surviving on an island after an airplane crash that kills all the adults is just as good as I remember it being. I could go on and on about the various symbolism in the book, and the descent of the boys into savagery, but I don't want to over analyze it.It is a terrific book, with well thought out characters. One cannot help but feel sympathy for Ralph as he tries to keep a semblance of order. Anyone who has ever been terrorized by a school bully will sympathize with Ralph's struggle against Jack; and Piggy is a truly pathetic character. My favorite character has always been Simon, who is just a little off kilter but in the midst of his ramblings speaks a great deal of truth.Kids, don't wait until your teacher makes you read this book. go out and get it and read it for yourself. Unlike most of the books you'll be required to read for school, this one has action, adventure, and enough gore to make it a good read. Later on you can worry about the symbolism and the deeper meanings within the book, but for now, just read it for fun."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If I were scoring the story, it would have 5 stars. Unfortunately this reading by the author isn't all that great. For one, it's dated and the audio quality suffers from that. There is no consistency in the sound so one minute he sounds okay and the next as though he's stepped away from the microphone. Another annoying factor is the breathing and sighing while he's reading making the whole thing sound like a chore. It's a pity because this is an excellent story but the narration could use improvement."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; was enthralling, terrible, and fascinating. I read it in a day, and it consumed my thoughts. The book starts out quite harmlessly, and I began by almost thinking I was in for a fun adventure story. However, I felt otherwise as I absorbed the dark, gaunt style this book was written in. There was something ancient and evil behind the pages of this book, in the unwritten words, and unuttered dialogue. The line that seemed most significant to me were the words spoken to Ralph by Jack after he has returned from pig hunting. They are discussing the feeling that both of them have had in the jungle, of being followed, and &quot;as if it wasn't a good island.&quot; The Beast is a recurring theme throughout the story, and I don't believe it refers to any one thing. The Beast takes the form that the children want it to, and it begins with their imaginations, but amounts to so much more. The children are the Beast, in a sense, in the aspect that their own selfishness, jealousy, and savageness have awakened this monster."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Can we really &quot;trace the defect of society back to the defect of human nature&quot;? This book was written in an attempt to find out. In Lord of the Flies, William Golding shows us, naked and exposed, at once innocent and corrupt, noble and cruel, and all to human. He uses symbols, theories, and ideas to help illustrate his point. For example, the female sow, represents the mother of the boys - the killing of the sow symbolizes the killing of the mother. The roles of the three main characters are different; Ralph being the ego (self knowledge), Piggy being the superego (conflict between thoughts) and Jack being the id (want). Lord of the Flies uses symbolism so well, that it is understandable, interesting to read, and catching. The writing in this book is structured so well. I was able to understand what he wrote, and I was hooked. What I liked best about this book was the clarity of it, the style of his writng and the plot of the story. His writing is also very specific. I was able to put pictures in my mind about what was being said - {Over the Island the build up of clouds continued. A steady current of heated air rose all day from the mountain and was thrust to ten thousand feet; revolving masses of gas piled up the static until the air was ready to explode}-this is an excerpt from chapter nine. It is obvious that his style of writing is excellent and should be highly acknowledged. It deserves a 5 star rating. Lord of the Flies is a wonderful, symbolic, adventure into ritual, primitivness, death, guilt, innocence, betrayal, and war. Only then, will you find the answer to the question, &quot;can we trace the defect of society back to the defect of human nature&quot;?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book many years ago in high school, and found it very philosophical. It isn't conforting in any sense of the word, but it gives a powerful message regarding the nature of humans. The whole conflict between Jack and Ralph is petty, but that was the point. Written during the horrors of WWII, W. Golding wanted to show the readers that the only difference between human beings and beasts is that we are governed by laws and civilization, without which we do become savages. Disturbing, extremely, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good book. Someone once told me the purpose of art and literature is to make an audience think through its powerful messages, not to be comfortable to place in a &quot;hospital&quot; setting. Lord of the Flies does exactly that. Through vivid descriptions and masterful symbolism, this book conveys a powerful message regarding human nature. A previous reader claimed, due to the Columbine shootings, this book should not be read in high schools, I couldn't disagree more. It is because of such atrocious acts that the message this book contains is needed more than ever."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book Lord of the Flies, written by William Golding is a very well written book. The genre of the book is historical fiction. The setting of the book is on an uncharted island during the WorldWarII era. The book is mainly about a couple of schoolboys who crash-landed on an uncharted island that they are stranded on, without any adults. I think the theme of the book was to show that society cannot run correctly because of the natural, sinful nature of man. Some of the main characters are Piggy, Ralph, and Jack. Piggy and Ralph first meet when they when they wake up next to each other after the landing. Piggy is a chubby, little bossy kid, while Ralph on the other hand is a mellow and relaxed, cool kind of kid. They call together all of the kids that are on the island including a boy named Jack. Jack is a stuck up kid who is a prefect at his school and is the captain of his choir class. While the short lived bond of Piggy and Ralph's friendship becomes weaker, Jack and Ralph, who are both leaders seem to get along very well. Piggy and Ralph were friends, but when a person like Jack shows up a more strong, leader-like and Ralph-like kid is up to be Ralph's friend, Ralph quickly ignores Piggy to become Jack's friend. But as Jack and Ralph's friendship grows the contest for leadership of the tribe of kids grows even more. Even though the kids already voted for Ralph to be the chief, Jack is starting to show that he could be a better chief. I believe this because all Ralph has ever cared for is to keep the fire going, and keep the hope of being rescued alive. While Jack, a more ferocious boy, focuses on staying alive most of the time, and hunting for the hard to get meat. I think that this book is best recommended for older teenagers because most of the words in the book are very complex, and because of the violence that happens. The book, Lord of the Flies, is a very interesting book. Even though it has some very confusing words and hard to understand material, it should be given a try."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Thrilling and heart stopping, William Golding's The Lord of the Flies is wonderful book to read. The book is wonderfully written, filled with non-stop action, dynamic characters, and wonderful imagery.About young boys who have crashed onto an uninhabited island, The Lord of the Flies is a story that describes how the boys react and live without the presence of an adult. What makes the book really exciting is that things are always happening. Golding does drag out the story with long narrative descriptions. Instead, he ensures that he keeps the reader's interest by always events occurring on the island. The island is always filled with activity whether it is hunting for food, building shelters or conflicts between the boys. As the conflict begins to escalate among the boys, the story further grasps onto the reader's interest.The plot is not some basic storyline, but focuses on human nature and the structure of society. Golding emphasizes how the boys were content to set up some sort of governing structure. Unfortunately over time, the boys reverted back to primordial states- no longer abiding by the moral rules of conduct set by society. Golding reveals how structure and order are needed to live peacefully among other people.The characters each have his or own identifying personality, which allows readers to connect with at least one character. The characters are interesting and dynamic, contributing to the exciting plot.Golding also creates wonderful scenery through his imagery. The island is depicted as a wonderful paradise, but also a place of fear and disorder. Golding is able to make that great shift between paradise and a dangerous place.If you want to read an exciting book filled with wonderful imagery and characters, The Lord of the Flies is the way to go."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Imagine yourself on an isolated island with a bunch of naked boys... no not like that, um... with a bit more clothes. Better. That is basically the environment of William Golding's novel. The entire story takes place on a stranded island, where a plane carrying a load of boys crash lands.Starting off as a band of nave schoolboys, the youths face reality and come to accept their fate on the island. Soon afterwards, they set up an organized system to follow, but before long, the boys' paranoia gets the best of them, fracturing the boys in half. As they begin to lose their civilized nature, the increasingly savage boys become both vicious and merciless. At the conclusion, the boys finally realize their innate barbarity.The cast of the story consists of a series of dynamic characters. Ralph, the protagonist, originally serves as the leader and catalyst for the boys, until the greedy and power hungry Jack attempts to usurp his power, which ultimately fails and leads to the creation of his own band of boys. The soft-spoken and moral Simon is the embodiment of Christ within the story, as he is the first and only to notice the growing savageness prevalent throughout the boys. Other characters include Piggy, the representation of rationalism, and Roger, the representation of sadism.The microcosmic depiction of our world perfectly captures human brutality on a small scale and the futility of government. Not necessarily hard to understand, the novel creates a deeply suspenseful mood that remains over the course of the story.If you want an easy read, but meaningful book, I greatly recommend this book. Not many other high school caliber books can provide such deep meaning, yet still produce an outstanding story with naked guys."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I wonder if this book is in the vein of other dystopian views of the world that were published in the mid-20th century, such as Brave New World and 1984. Sure, Lord of the Flies isn't necessarily directly predicting a bleak future for humanity, but it does present a bleak view of human nature, in my opinion. In the following statement I am probably making an oversimplification that doesn't do justice to the complexity of Golding's classic or Golding's thinking in general: trying to portray human nature via the behavior of a handful of main characters and a few of their followers can't possibly capture the diversity of human personality and behavior. Maybe Golding assumes that these few kids are representative of the sample of ALL kids, as a statistician might say. In either case, an interesting read that will remain a classic.

To me on par with \\"Heart of Darkness\\" and \\"Crime and Punishment\\" on the subject of human nature.

This is a must read for anyone."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies was a book that I was required to read at the start of tenth grade. When I started reading the book I wasn't interested right away. I thought the book lacked any action, and I couldn't identify with any of the characters, personally. Honestly, I kept reading because of obligation. Eventually I realized it was a good book. Towards the second half of the book the author added action and the characters evolved. Arguments took place among the boys which started fighting and drama. When the story started picking up it had me excited until the very end. Overall, I would recommend this book for anyone looking for a great adventure book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by William Golding 5/5I first read Lord of the Flies in high school, as do many Americans, and recall being the only person in class who actually enjoyed the book (and also the only one who disliked Frankenstein). I picked it up off of my shelf a few days ago (cracked binding, faded glue, and all the pages falling out) and finally reread it: I still like it. It's the story of a group of English boys trapped on a deserted island. In an attempt to be rescued, the boys being to cultivate their own civilization with structure and orders. This all to quickly falls apart. Lord of the Flies is a short masterpiece of children's lives mirroring the adult sphere and, like so many other books lodged in the annuals of high school literature, too often is read at an age when a person is most likely to lack the understanding of the full implications of the book. A splendid read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I'll admit i'm a late fan of this novel, never having the enjoyment of being assigned this in school. However i'm pleased in my adult life to possibly have a greater appreciation of it. This is truly a timeless story of the savage within us all and how even without a civilization, all different aspects of a society can be portrayed, even in the innocence of shipwrecked children. Ralph serves as our center, imperfect at best, yet constantly trying to do the greater good. Jack is his id, a leader by worth but not in ideology or action, our ego. Piggy is our brain and conscience, however fragile and annoyingly persistent. Roger is our wrath. An unleashed, unsympathetic, unbridled purely sickening rage. Simon is our curiosity and independence, He carrys our emotions and our feelings.The story itself begins with Ralph as the elected leader of the group of young children, however, the lead hunter, Jack eventually finds no solice in this decision and it becomes 2 camps at odds on an island. Thats the short version, which does no justice to the complexity of the story nor the incredible imagery given by the author. In this story, children do terrible things to children, yet the degeneration into savages is so gradual you can understand there blind lust for adventure and victory overall else, especially when that same idea has been behind every war known to man.I titled this review after a line from the novel, because i think it secretly underlined alot of what the story was about. Some Rules may not be fun, but the consequences without are far worse. This can be applied to so many aspects in life. As i think i will carry this with me a long time coming."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by William Golding is a terrific book about a group of British children who are left isolated on an island, and eventually begin to kill each other as they lose their sanity. Stranded on the island after their plane crashes the boys must battle the harsh realities of human nature while they strive to be rescued from a ship. The book not only tells an exciting adventure story, though, it also describes on a deeper level, the thin line between civility and sanity, and violent insanity.The book opens with a group of children choosing a leader among themselves and deciding on a group of laws to live by. At first the boys get along fairly well with their appointed chief Ralph. When one of the older children named Jack, is not chosen leader and is very jealous, he begins his own rebellion and attracts many fellow rebels. As the story develops, Jack and his band begin to disobey the rules, and eventually form a completely separate community. As the two communities develop, Jack's group becomes more uncivilized, and eventually his group murders a member of the other group out of blind hate and insanity. AS the story progresses the conflicts between Jack and Ralph grow until the boys are rescued by a British ship.Through this story of innocent young children who become dangerous, Golding teaches the lesson that even young people, however innocent, can become insane as a result of a lack of authority, government, and civilized neighbors to guide them.By: Tyler Stewart"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"An airplane full of prep-school boys is attacked in the air, causing a crash. The pilot is dead and the boys, all adolescents, are stranded on a deserted island. At first they band together as one tribe, hunting to survive and hoping for rescue any day. But then they start to fight with each other for power. They become better at hunting and surviving and they paint their faces with blood. The boys become less and less like civilized humans and more and more like savages. Eventually they turn on each other. Who will win the struggle for power, and will there be anyone left to be rescued by the time help arrives?This story is a disturbing look at what might happen if a perfectly civilized group of boys were left alone for an extended period of time. It's creepy to think that children would be involved in such atrocities, but it's hard to convince yourself that it wouldn't happen like this. Golding does a great job of making the transition of the boys into the darkness of humanity seem completely natural."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I cannot even use words to explain the sheer beauty of Golding's writing. The novel is about british boys whose plne crashed on a deserted island, but they are devoid of any adults. They begin to live life on their own and their true animal instinct divulges from the depths of their souls.I read this book for my ninth grade English class. I usually do not enjoys books in class as much as I do books I read on my own, simply because I did not chose them and I fell as though I am being forced to read them. The Lord of the Flies is more fascinating than any book I could ever pick for myself. The words are strong enough to lift a house. My eyes were stuck to every words Golding described with such thouroughness. The words are more thick with detail than one's eyes could every see. Every word is important and expresses a new meaning to the nature of man kind. I am daring you to take a chance by reading this book, even if it is not forced upon you. You may have a completely different view on the genuine nature of yourself."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book in eighth grade - alright, it was about two years ago - and I still read it occasionally. I mean, it's no quick read and definitely something that needs analyzation (just ask my English teacher), but it *is* one of those books that you have to read more than once to a) understand it, and b) to truly enjoy it.LOTF (not to be confused with Tolkien's Lord of the Rings) deals with British schoolboys supposedly during World War II, although it can be deciphered for different times. These schoolboys have grown up on London and life that is perfectly serene, so when they find themselves on a deserted island - with no grownups, what a great life! - they think this is something new to them and has to be explored.But as time goes on, things aren't as pretty as the island sets out to be. Things get ugly, and intrusive and bloody. (One scene is not for the squeamish!) Things are not as easy as they seem, but unlike life back home, there are no grownups to turn to and have them put things right. There is only control in the one boy who has it, and there is no turning back.LOTF is a good read, it really is. Just be sure, if you read it in English class, to get ready to analyze it.

When I did reach that point it changed so drastically it left me puzzled. Reading this book was a chore. I struggled to keep myself interested through every chapter.

I just recently was assigned to read this book in my sophmore English class and I now really enjoy the book. I think that this book is incredibly deep and thought provoking and can only be enjoyed if you are open trying to understand the underlying themes. This novel brilliantly explores human nature and the effect of civilization on people. Lord of the Flies is a great read and I highly reccomend it to everyone.

I also partially subscribe to the notion that 'A classic is something that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read'.Not true for this one: it transcends all barriers (for me at least).The plot is a remarkably interesting, the characters well defined and the ending delicious.To add more usefulness to this review: some other books that I like are - Of Mice and Men, All Quiet on the Western Front, Animal Farm, A Brave New World, The Catcher in the Rye. So, if you like any of these books, you might like The Lord of the Flies too."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The novel Lord of the Flies by William Golding, published by The Berkley Publishing Group (1954) is an action filled book about some schoolboys' struggle for survival after their plane went down on a deserted island.After the boys are stranded on the island it becomes evident that surviving will be like no other task they have ever undertaken. They learn to fend for themselves by trapping and killing animals, building shelters with branches and by learning how to use their surroundings in the quest for survival. From the very beginning there is tension over who is the leader. It comes down to which candidate has more appealing priorities, playing and hunting all-day or trying to get rescued by keeping a fire alive. While in the hunt for food the boys become total savages, to the extent where they even wage war against each other.In my eyes the message is that there is a savage in all of us and it comes out the minute we are faced with extreme hardships. The author does not only use the actions of the boys to show the changes that have occurred, but he also uses visual imagery to show their physical changes. For example, in the beginning of the book the boys are well-dressed clean-cut shorthaired boys; however, by the end of the book they are dirty, longhaired animals. Also, to add to their already dirty look, the boys paint their faces to camouflage themselves when they go hunting. The way the boys changed in appearance reflects how they're losing their civilized upbringing.In my opinion the novel Lord of the Flies was a great book especially for children around my age because it is easy for us to identify with what the kids in the book are going through. Even though I found this novel very exciting and engaging, I would never hope to be put in such a position as the boys in the story were."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Great preview into what William Golding thought of the children of his generation. Truly makes you think about how things can change; are our children more compassionate now, even boys, or would they succumb to the violence and societal pressures of living in a self governed system, like these boys did?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I've heard a lot about The Lord of the Flies throughout my life, but this was my first time reading it. It was surprisingly short and fast;it didn't quite live up to the hype in my mind but it was still well worth a read. It certainly can be interpreted as an allegory for the base nature of man and especially of the power of 'the mob.' Overall I thought Golding's descriptions and the way he kept the narrative moving was very effective; the characters evolved from typical schoolboys into something fierce, raw and unscrupulous. However I felt that I needed more character development and background in order to really care about these characters and therefore feel fully horrified at what happens to them."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This was a fairly interesting book, which is VERY famous. A group of schoolboys is stranded on an uncharted island when a plane crashes. At first, with no adults around, they celebrate their freedom and hope for adventure. They can do anything they want this far from the civilized world. And they are indeed far from the civilized world, for the situation quickly deteriorates into madness, when strange howls echo in the night, order collapses, and terror begins to grip everyone. The hope of being rescued gradually fades as well. This book had a very interesting premise, and I particularly liked one instance. Throughout the book, the boys are lighting a fire, hoping that the smoke will signal a passing boat to come rescue them. But then as no boat comes, Ralph, the \\"leader\\", gradually has to be reminded what the smoke was for in the first place, by \\"Piggy\\", one of the other boys. It was quite chilling.

As a girl reading this novel I was thoroughly unimpressed with the survival skills, war paint, and lords of flies. However, the appeal comes at the end of the book when you realize how innocence is destroyed by evil. My take on this novel: These boys wanted to build a society, \\"make it English\\". However, the innocence of adolescence doesn't prepare them for becoming a man, no matter how much they think so. I think in the end, the idea of being hunters and having \\"fun\\" overcomes the idea of rules and a society. However, you can clearly see how this affects the boy's and turns them into savages, who roam and kill. This book is definitely appealing for young boys. Girls, not as much."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book has been on my must-read list for as long as I can remember, and it IS a must-read. You will either love it or hate, but you must read it. At 24, I was a little ashamed I had not done the reading yet, and so I finally picked it up and told myself I was going to get this book out of the way. However, I realized how profound and real this book was a couple of chapters into it, and I began to enjoy it. I could write several papers on this book discussing it from several hundred angles and perspectives, and I loved that I could.The premise of this story is very simple, but with much underlying depth. It is about a bunch of children whose plane crashes onto a deserted island land and are left completely alone with no adult supervision - pretty much how I'd imagine LOST would turn out if it were based on a bunch of children rather than adults.Protagonist fair-haired Ralph becomes the voice of reason on the island. He is voted \\"chief\\" and takes leadership of the lost boys, by laying down ground rules and taking care of essentials - fire and shelter. On the other hand, antagonist redhead Jack is the wild, untamed boy who does not want to follow the rules. Then there's bespectacled Piggy, who is the wise, intelligent boy, who provides Ralph with advise and sensible suggestions. And last, but definitely not least, is Simon - the sacrificial lamb, almost like a Jesus figure. As one reviewer so aptly put it: \\"I prefer to read him as sympathetic point of view character upon which readers are invited to project themselves. His political disinterest are traits unique to his presentation and establish Simon as somewhat of a blank canvas upon which the reader can paint his own image. Simon's refusal to pick sides and his frequent assertion that he is on the outside give him an outlier identity that correlates him with the reader as an onlooker - present, but separate. Likewise his ability to see the island's beast for what it really is, the depth of his empathy towards the younger children and his clairvoyant understanding of their every need suggests he has access to information that should otherwise only be available to the reader.\\"Everything in this book is symbolic, from the characters mentioned to the conch that was used for order as a symbol of democracy, to the fire that represented adult responsibility, to a beast that pretty much represented fears. And all events are well-prepared for in advance by William Golding, as he gives us as many hints and clues as possible to reveal to us what was about to happen next. A simple, innocent act slowly builds up into a shocking act of savagery. Golding very visually illustrates to us how chaos in society is initiated. One innocent act of rebellion. One simple thought. One small step away from the rules that were set by the chief. Chaos begins in people's minds. It is indeed a novel about our human nature.As I was reading the book, I received several comments from people who saw me reading it and who would say things like \\"Golding has a great imagination\\" or \\"boys will be boys\\" or \\"that's a very disturbing book\\" and so on. However, I don't believe William Golding had to use much imagination - he was probably just recalling all the horrors of his war days. All he needed to do was rely on his own memory of human nature as he had witnessed it during World War II.And this isn't a story for children, or about boys in particular. This is a story about humans in general. We're all capable of savagery, if put in a situation that called for it, and that is a fact."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had not read this book for about 30 years.

It tells the savages of human nature to kill and to vie for power. The novel shows that children are born guilty but are influence by society. Both Jack and Ralph are guilty of human flaw and that leads to the widening gap between them. They are able to get along fine because they are English who shun savagery. As social orders erode with every mention of the beast, Ralph becomes the only person who clings to his pride to be civilized. The shattered conch symbolizes the lack of society on the island as it represents rules and agreement made, but not kept. Jack and the Gang, who never kill anyone before, murder Simon and latter Piggy, proving that human are born with savagery and become civilized under society. Without laws, Jack and his gang revert back to animalism preferring not to be rescue.I recommend this book because it has interesting angle on anarchy. Although I do not believe that boys will kill boys, the relationship between the boys shows the bigger picture on a national scale. The novel is accurate depicting authority, when results are not met dissidents will change the government."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As an avid reader and a lover of literature, I at last found enough time to pick up what is known as one of the greatest novels of all time. However, I found that it was a rather mundane read, even though it included somephenomenal uses of literary features.I had heard rumors about what themes the novel included before beginning - cannibalism, survival of the fittest, etc. I wasn't disappointed. Although there was no cannibalism, Golding truly exemplifies the deterioration of humankind when faced with anarchy at its finest. Through the medium of young boys, he was able to successfully portray how human nature slowly dissolves into unorganized chaos. Additionally, his use of literary features was clear and added to the plot, such as his choice of symbolism with the conch. With the destruction of the conch leading to the end of Ralph's power, it was clear that the conch represented order and freedom of speech.On the flip side, as someone who's more a fan of action-packed, drama-filled teen reads, Lord of the Flies was pretty low on the entertainment scale. Development was slow in this case, where the first death didn't occur until more than halfway into the book. And even then, I felt like my interest was only piqued in the last quarter of the book or so. Therefore, as a book I was reading for what I intended to be purely enjoyment, I can't exactly say I appreciated the time I spent reading it. However, I do acknowledge its literary merit and the reason as to why it's become one of the most widely read novels of all time.Sure, read it - maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did. But beware; if you're expecting something exciting and page-turning, this may not be the book for you (unless you really enjoy deciphering the meaning behind various symbols)."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"With total disagreeance to all of those who say that this book has little to no meaning, I'd like to counter that statemnt. Being a perfectly vivid book with deep meaning and descriptive plots, the author, William Golding, puts deep meaning to this book in a most subtle way that immature ro inadequate readers cannot truly appreciate or find.FOOTNOTES:The deeper meaning of this book ladies and gentlemen, is actually an allegory, a piece of writing that means or symbolises something by using character use or plots. In this book, the group of boys stranded on the island symbolises the human race. Jack is the major antagonist and symbol of the darkness and th interior rages and evilness that we hold within each and every one of us. Ralph symbolises the good within ourselves... But it's not my job to help you all with your reading homework."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"*Spoiler Alert* This review does give away the ending.In the book Lord of the Flies, Ralph and Jack are the two main characters struggling to gain leadership. They have many different views on how to best live on the island. Jack thought hunting would be the best way to survive on the island. Ralph's idea was to start a fire on the top of the island so that they might get the attention of any passing boat and be rescued. Ralph also wanted to keep things as civilized as possible while Jack preferred to start a tribe and live like the Indians would. After Jack captured some of Ralph's most loyal companions, Sam and Eric, Ralph goes to save them. When he gets there, the twins, Sam and Eric, are covering the side of Jack's island that Ralph approaches. Sam and Eric tell Ralph that everyone in Jack's tribe is going to hunt him, so Ralph runs after being chased across the island. He sees a Naval Officer on shore that rescues all the kids. The Naval Officer saw the fire and Ralph's civilized ways saves them all.Ralph's character is strong-hearted, smart and always trying to help others. Another character like Ralph is Zech from the book series A Land Remembered. Ralph is strong-hearted and always tries to stick through hard times just like Zech. Both are smart and both try their best to help others. Ralph will lead the kids of the island and help them off the island. Zech would rather ask for something for his horse Ishmael than for himself. The two characters would probably get along well if they could learn to respect each others opinion. If both were put on the island, they would help each other because the island converted to Jack's tribe since no meat was being collected. Zech would know how to capture pigs since he has herded cows with his dad and company.The Lord of the Flies is a book that shows how people push themselves to do what is best. Ralph tries to show the ways of civilization and how to get saved. Jack tries to find ways to get meat and take over the island. This book is great for testing your mind and for considering which decisions you would make. To figure out how the decisions the boys made played through, people should read the book and find out.Overall, one through five, with a five being the best, I would give this book a four. I would recommend this book to a reader that needs to know in perfect detail the setting because this book is great at describing the setting. The book also has some long chapters, so if you do not like the author giving two paragraph chapters this is a good book for you. It is also great for readers that like adventure and some action. This is not a great book if you like romance and love stories because this book doesn't have any romance at all. Overall, I would recommend this book for many young readers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I really enjoyed this book; although, I would not recommend it to the faint of heart. William Golding's Lord of the Flies is the story of a group of school boys that crash land on an island and are stranded with no adult supervision. This story that begins so innocently soon takes a turn for the worst. At first glance this novel is a story of children gone bad but with careful thought it becomes a concept much bigger than the children themselves.Many say this is about the psychology of children when no one is around to supervise them but I feel this explains, through a story about children gone wrong, the necessity for a central government. I think the story, that seems very crude, is actually our society and history in a nutshell. A group of people do like there government, so they break away. This in my opinion is a fairly simple concept but put into a story people think of it as some horrific thing. However, it is a fairly natural reaction. Whether or not this is how William Golding intended it to be understood, I think this is not supposed to be a story of children that go stir crazy on an island but a depiction of society.I definitely think this should be taught in schools. Firstly, it is an idea that most children have thought about, and it is an interesting story that captures the minds of the readers. Secondly, it gives you a different perspective of our society as a whole; something that seemed so normal but put into a story is actually a scary thought. This is a very valuable lesson to be taught and I believe all people should be exposed to different perspectives."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A great book to those who can understand its true meaning. Every object of the book has a meaning - the conch for unity. The beast for the darker side of humanity. Even Piggy - his logic and brains show that looks aren't everything. Lord of the Flies is a must for more mature readers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A classic that never goes out of style! Got it for class for my middle-schooler, who thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I have read this book twice in my life and all I can say is why don't we see writers with such talent anymore. That's easy to answer. The publishing industry could care less a about well written books. It is money they seek in the likes of writers such as Dan Brown and other authors who do not write everything with their name on it. It's called formula writing. Lord and books like it are so far above the crowd its silly."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"My daughter liked it and liked the explanations in the back under the Casebook part."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I bought this book as a gift to my daughter and I must say that she liked it A LOT !! Every time she read a chapter we would have a conversation about how much the book can be related to real life events, as well as past and future. Even though the book contained several unknown words for my daughter she love it and improved her vocabulary. A must buy I must say."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Have you ever wanted to go on an adventure to an island lost in time without even getting out of your seat? If so, this is the book for you. Lord of the Flies is not only an adventure but it is also a struggle of life and death at your fingertips. Each page weaves a magnificent story about a group of English school boys and their many struggles as they try to stay alive.The reason I love this book is the beautiful choice of words the author, William Golding, put into the book. The words paint a picture that makes you feel sad when the characters are sad or happy when the characters are happy. Golding's Lord of the Flies is truly a work of art.At the dawn of World War II, a small plane carrying a group of English school boys, all from the age of 6-12, crashes on an island somewhere in the South Pacific. The island is abundant with water, fruit, and wild pigs for meat. With all of these resources, they start to form a microcosm on the island.The character that stands out in the book is Piggy. In the book, Piggy represents common sense. He is a rather large boy, but his brains compensate for his physical appearance. Piggy is the first person Ralph meets on the island and they quickly become friends. Piggy is very supportive and defends Ralph whenever he needs defending. Towards the end of the book, Piggy finds himself in deep trouble with only Ralph as a friend.Lord of the Flies is filled with contrasting characters. For example, Jack is the leader of the gang. He has a posse of followers who will do whatever he says - good or bad. Jack is insecure and thinks that if he can't boss someone around that they are a threat. In the book, Jack is the opposite of Ralph. On the other hand, Ralph, the main character of the story, is a true leader who wants to get everyone's input before he makes a decision that affects everyone. Ralph's only goal is to maintain order on the island while Jack's goal is to do what he wants. Therefore throughout the book, there is a constant rivalry between Jack and Ralph.When civilization rapidly turns to chaos, someone will rise and someone will fall. Is it Jack or Ralph who will take command of the island and lead the boys to safety? If you want to find out what happens to Ralph and all the rest of the boys, read Lord of the Flies."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I'd read this a long time ago and I thought it was good then but I certainly didn't appreciate the complexity of Golding's characters. This succinct book is at the same time childish and grownup, able to marry the two in to a cohesive storyline. I am much more impressed this second time around.The hard part is showing how the children got on to the island because it would be a little hard to show a realistic plane crash on to a deserted island and still have survivors. In fact, where is the plane and what of the other dead children of the plane? This is exactly why this is all left unsaid because it leaves the unknown and mysterious as something that is altogether believable. Instead we start by following two children who find a way to call an assembly and form a somewhat organized society. Yet right away you see the cracks that will form. You see the childishness that is throughout the book. The insanity that could come of isolation from grownups.The accurate portrayal of children is what strikes me. The younguns who play and eat, not really understanding what is going on and yet still scared and frightened. The biguns trying to act grownup and organize everyone into a little society, and yet still frightened. The three most important, of course, are Ralph and Jack (on equal footing) and Piggy, to me the main focus of the whole book. Where Ralph and Jack act the biguns they still represent children, unable to keep their emotions in check. Ralph is the leader who slowly loses his train of thought and his focus the longer they stay on the island. Jack is the hunter who loses his mind as he cracks under the pressure of hunting, only to find that actually succeeding sends his fragile mental state into a much worse situation. Piggy, of course, actually represents the smarts of the group, the one who could have led them to a much more seamless survival if he only had an ounce of leadership. It is ironic, then, that he died at the height of the \\"civilized\\" children turning into savages.All in all a well rounded book that has lasted for over fifty years for a reason. If you've never read it, read it. If you've already read it, read it again. Definitely a fun book to read.4.5 stars."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book by William Golding is a haunting allegory about the nature of mankind and how our barbaric roots conflict with our newly found sense of civilization. I read this book in two days. Okay, so it's not a very long book, but still, considering I started reading it at about 11 pm each night, I was totally engrossed by this book. I didn't sleep the night I finished it. I couldn't get the story out of my mind. From the first word to the last sentence, this book holds your interest and keeps you on the edge of your proverbial seat. If you are looking for a book that will make you think, read this book. If you want to be entertained, read this book. Even if you don't, read this book. For pete's sake, just read this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is the highly symbolic story of a group of young boys left on a deserted island without parental supervision of any kind after evacuating England ahead of a nuclear attack. The crude body politic they initially form quickly devolves.This is not a book about survivalism. The boys find the island bountiful, providing an overabundance of fruit and, later, pig (probably an unrealistic abundance). It is rather a book about human interaction.Lord of the Flies is highly metaphorical and symbolic. It paints a frightening portrait of how quickly man can regress from the rule of law to his natural, Hobbesian roots, where life is \\"nasty, brutish, and short.\\" The great innovation of the modern nation-state is the discovery of a way to restrain the ability of those we choose to lead us to hurt us, something the boys are unable to do. The corrupting influence of power was a popular theme for the time, also used in Lord of the Rings and Animal Farm, among others (it was also a good time for speculative fiction).This thin novel is a quick, if not always easy, read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I started reading this book I was happy to look for adventure of a bunch of young kids/men stranded on an island without any support or knowledge of survival instincts. Then the story takes a turn by showing how human behavior creates anger, jealousy and hunger for control. The key of the book is how do people react when left to survive without controls, governments aka survival in nature.The writing style is smart, vivid and exceptionally detailed. The author describes every movement, colour, geography and person in detail.The plan is simple- put kids from various backgrounds in order to get a bag full of characters possible.Read this to realise how we end up behaving when there is no control and the dark side our human mind is capable off"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A group of English schoolboys are cast onto a Pacific coral island. Their plane has crashed and the lads from 6 to 12 are left alone amid the roar of the surf, the cries of the jungle and the indifference of the universe.Ralph emerges as the leader. He is a fair haired English schoolboy. He meets Piggy a myopic boy who refers to his asthma, bad eyes and Auntie back home in England. Soon these two boys are joined by several others who have survived the crash. A leader named Jack Merridew emerges as a challenger to the leadership position.Jack becomes a pig hunter leading the majority of boys into the jungle to slaughter pigs. They murder Piggy and Simon. The groups fears beasties and a monster who supposedly lives in the Castle Rock part of the island. Readers learn that a parachutist has landed on the island and been killed by the fall. This pilot's body has become decayed and repulsive as it is caught in the treetops waving back and forth in the tropical breeze. The boys are finally rescued by the Royal Navy who are themselves involved in warfare against their fellow human beings.We have had a glimpse of the sinful and destructive dark side of human nature. The veneer of civilization has been pryed open as innocent schoolboys have reverted to savagery and murder.The novel is a parable of nature grown savage tooth and nail in a Darwinian struggle for survival. In Freudian terms Jack is the id;, Ralph the ego; Piggy the superego. When Piggy loses his glasses and life to the savagery of the boys we see the intellectual and rational nature of humankind destroyed by mindless savagery. The Lord of the Flies is a pig which has been horribly butchered with its rotting head placed on the top of a sharp pole. \\"Beezelbub\\" is \\"Lord of the Flies\\" in Hebrew and is a synonym for the Devil.Lord of the Flies has been read in high school classes for years. It is not a nice story. Instead it is a very graphic novel manifesting man's inhumanity to man and the danger of savagery breaking through the rules of society.Both Joseph Conrad and William Golding force us to look into the heart of darkness. One of the classics of post World War II English fiction."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was awesome. I couldn't stop reading it. It was about surviving on an island and finding more people. So I'm going to write a review. Here is what the book is about.Two boys, Ralph and Piggy were alone on an island, so they thought. When they went to the beach, they found a conch. Since Piggy didn't want to blow it Ralph blew and more kids came. Since there were more kids, some people wanted the leader to be a kid named Jack and some people wanted Ralph to be leader. They took a vote and Ralph was leader.One day, they went to a rock and climbed it. Ralph and Jack and a kid named Roger came with them. Then, they went down. They then decide to split in to two groups but they would still stay in touch. They then walked back to their base.Another day, Jack's group stole Piggy's glasses and he got mad and told them to give them back. They said no. Then, they invaded (invaded what?). Later, a guy on a boat came to bring them back home. He asked if any were dead. Ralph said two. They took them and they never went back to the island.They got rescued. Most stories like this; at the end they get rescued. I always predict that and I'm always right. This book should be read by kids. It's a great book. The font is a little small but I still liked it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In my seventh grade English class we have just finished reading a great book called Lord of the Flies by William Golding. He wrote this book with unbelievable description which would either catch your eye or put you to sleep in class. For me, it was more like putting myself to sleep. That doesn't mean it wasn't a good book, I just think it was in my opinion a book more for adults. Besides the description the plot was well written. I enjoyed how he used Piggy to get the theme across.Mr. Golding put lots of thought into the book when writing description. From describing the ocean blue all the way to describing Piggy's looks and attitudes. Examples of this can be found throughout the book, literally there is no page without description. A description on a tree could even go on for 3 pages. Personally, that was what lost my interest. An example I found was on page 169 where it says \\"The twins watched anxiously and Piggy sat expressionless behind the luminous wall of his myopia.\\" This shoes both the scenery and Piggy's attitude which is stubborn. This shows his stubbornness because the author says he was sitting expressionless which is usually what I do when I'm frustrated. Another good description Golding had was on page 158 where it says \\"The air was heavy with unspoken knowledge.\\" This is showing the tension between Piggy and the other people on the island who are not listening to him.I enjoyed how he used Piggy to get the theme across because of the way he left Piggy there, just open. I can compare Piggy to an unlocked door that people just walk by, they will never know what they have just missed. That is what happened to Piggy they didn't expect anything from him just because of his obesity and judged him just by that which is plain wrong. Just because it is wrong many people do it in present day, it must just be a natural judgment. But really, Piggy is a smart kid. In my opinion I believe that they would have gotten off the island if they just let Piggy be leader or at least do more work. In my opinion the theme was \\"Use what you have, don't make assumptions, and you always have something.\\" That is the first thing they did when they saw Piggy make fun of him. They let that fly past their heads and assumed he wouldn't help. Really he was their key to success and knowledge. They always had him there but just left him hanging.So if you are thinking about buying this book or not, I would say go ahead. Anyways, the most you have to lose is a few dollars. Maybe if you don't like description then just don't even bother, but if you adore description then defiantly try this book. You will finish it and realize that book really wasn't that bad after all."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I don't understand some of these reviews. \\"Twas alright\\", \\"book was OK\\"!

With the banks receiving the taxpayer's, money then continuing to abuse the public. This is moral? This is OK? There is so much in this story to absorb to think about, to move one to action. I guess might makes right these days. This story is \\"alright\\"? It's \\"OK\\". Where are we going as a species?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I enjoyed reading Lord of the Flies by William Golding. It was a very well written novel. Although I believe the beginning started really slow and did not grab my attention right a way, but as I kept going the book became more and more interesting. Golding sure knows how to make a huge plot flow and was able to create a huge conflict for the story. The conflict in the end teaches some very valuable life lessons for the reader and the characters.Golding expressed each character extremely well. Each character was unique. The only characters that were very similar were the twins, but they were like one character rather than two characters. The four main characters Ralph, Piggy, Simon, and Jack all add to the story. Ralph is the elected leader and he believes very much in keeping order and government. Ralph also wishes to be rescued and builds a signal fire. (Which becomes a source of many future disputes) Jack is Ralph's opposite because he just wishes to hunt, have fun, and is tremendously power hungry. Piggy is the kid who everyone picks on, the misfit, but he very logical and applies sense to the tough situation they are in. Simon rarely does anything wrong. He is always there to help Ralph, but is sort of a loner compared to the rest of the schoolboys.In the beginning, a group of schoolboys are stranded on an uncharted island and are forced to fend for themselves. At first they try to run a form of government. Which is considerably hard when no adults are there to enforce the rules and as result chaos breaks out. When the boys were thrust into this sort of situation it caused them to grow and mature very rapid. None of them will leave the island the same boy they came to the island as. It shows the dark side of reality and forces us to except the truth is that even the most innocent will fall to evil one day. (Simon) As the boys were taken off the island at the end they all left behind one thing, their innocence.After reading Lord of the Flies by William Golding I say that it was a great book.

Sure, it can be gory, somewhat odd, and even frightening, but the story is wonderful. If you think it's unrealistic, you either forgot what it was like to be a boy growing up or you are female. Young boys can be imaginative and insiteful, and they can be mean, cruel, and even a little sadistic. This book brims with themes and implications, almost EVERY LINE of the book displaying some theme or other. Here is a story of survival , of loyalty, of standing for what's right, of good vs. evil, and of the realities of a modern life. Yes, that's right. Not only does the boys' reversion to savagery hold implications of a world without law or order, but we also see that such a world is beyond so many of us.

Lord of the Flies is an allegory. For those of you who do not know what an allegorical novel is, it is a story with two meanings- to entertain and to teach or suggest ideas about human nature or society. Yes, Lord of the Flies is about naked boys running around and becoming savage, but it is also about fear and evil and how these two things emerge in our society. So, before you start to read it and call it &quot;retarded&quot;, realize that golding was trying to get across a much deeper, philisophical message. His observations about human nature are represented in the actions of the boys.

The book has a lot of symbolismin it. Ralph portrays the leader, someone who wants to keep the peace, where as Jack is the overpowering &quot;mind-warping&quot; leader. He, in history, could be related with Hitler. Piggy, who is never listened to because of his appereance and size, could represent what society does to overweight people. Simon is the Saint in the book who tries to find truth where there is no logic. If you think about it, Jesus was crucified and died for the sins of others.

They vote Ralph in as chief, apparently due only to his looks and ability to locate and sound a conch shell. The survivors survey the island, set rules for speaking during meetings, start a signal fire, and build shelters. Ralph makes a proclamation: they (p 35) \\"want to have fun\\" and \\"want to be rescued.\\" Things rapidly spiral out of control after the children split into two groups: one aligned with Ralph, the other, with Merridew. The adversarial relationship between the tribes worsens as does the members' behavior. With a fire gone out of control, the presence of wild pigs, the appearance of a ship, an unwelcome guest, and rumors of a beast, the boys live in a constant state of unease, worry and fear. Eventually, they are forced to choose: hunt or be hunted. Their world becomes increasingly savage and chaotic up to its perfectly written, climactic ending.

I think that the theme of the book was to show that society cannot run correctly because of the natural, sinful nature of man. Some of the main characters are Piggy, Ralph, and Jack. Piggy and Ralph first meet when they wake up next to each other after the landing. Piggy is a chubby, little bossy kid, while Ralph on the other hand is a mellow, relaxed cool kid. They call together all of the kids that are on the island and they meet a boy named Jack. Jack is a stuck up kind of kid, who is a prefect at his school and a captain of his choir class. While the short lived bond of Piggy and Ralph's friendship grows weaker. Jack and Ralph, who are both the leaders, seem to get along very well. Piggy and Ralph were the two friends, but when a person like Jack shows up, a more strong, leader-like and Ralph-like kid is up to be Ralph's friend, Ralph quickly ignores Piggy and makes Jack his new friend. But as Jack and Ralph's friendship grows the contest for leadership grows even more. Even though the kids voted Ralph as cheif, Jack is starting to show that he could be even a better cheif. I believe this because all Ralph has ever cared for is be keep a fire going and keep the hope of being rescued alive. While Jack, a more ferocious boy, focuses on staying alive most of the time and loves to hunt for the hard to get meat. I think that this book is best recommended for older teenagers because most of the words in this are very hard to understand and there are some violence in the book. The book, Lord of the Flies, is a very interesting book. Even though it has some very confusing words and hard to understand material, it should be given a try."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This being a classic most of us had to read in school, I dared commenting on some plot points - so,***** *** ** * WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD * ** *** *****A number of phospholipids left alone in solution will self-organize into a double-layer membrane.

Well, life there is not easy. Now try to imagine those participants as kids: how tough would it be to survive? William Golding's Lord of the Flies is exactly that--and maybe even worse. There are no cameras, no doctors, no medicine, no boundaries, no requirements, no rules--no society. In this enticing novel, Golding illustrates the effects of society--or lack of it--on human nature. He argues, through the impetuous decisions of the characters, that, even though our nature is originally pure and chaste, its shape is greatly altered by the lack of collective guidelines.Stranded on an island after a sudden airplane crash, the kids soon realize that creating their own society and set of rules would be essential for order and survival. As the days go by on the island, however, all the boys drift away from their childhood morals and beliefs. While Ralph focuses on being saved, the others solely worry being fed.Many characters, including the commanding Ralph, start showing signs of loss and vacillation. Ralph, for example, regularly has to be reminded of his main goal on the island--namely to be rescued. Jack, who now has formulated his own \\"society,\\" becomes a real savage. The pure and innocent Sam and Eric relinquish their loyalties to Ralph and establish new ties to Jack. The involvement of Piggy and Ralph in their friend's death is a clear example of disorder's exacerbation on moral values and character.Symbolism is a great forte of Golding's writing style. Interestingly, each character or object represents an important concept that is needed for a society to function properly. Ralph, for example is the symbol of powerful leadership. Piggy is the symbol of sanity and intelligence. Jack is the symbol of strength. Sam and Eric symbolize purity and goodness. Simon is the scapegoat. The conch is the power and order that decides who \\"controls\\" the island, but one that proves a problem since all seek it.Through the actions of the characters, Golding successfully asserts that a base, but also a boundary, for human reason is needed for a society to function properly."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A plane crashes and all the adults die, a very likely situation, leaving little boys to survive in an uninhabited island. Other than the fact that every single adult on the plane dies while all the children live, this is an exceptional novel that portrays how powerful society is and what would happen if it disappeared one day, like on an island in the middle of the ocean.The newly stranded boys begin in a somewhat civilized society when they elect a chief and split up duties, but eventually this system is unraveled as one boy's desire to be chief threatens the survival of everyone. Ralph, Piggy, and Simon can be viewed as the protagonists because they are the ones who attempt to produce and imitation of society on the island; however, Jack persuades other to follow him and introduces the wonders of feasting and hunting instead of the arduous shelter building and signal keeping. Jack's desire to hold all the power eventually leads to the island being set on fire. This bold and rash move burns down the island and from that point on survival does not seem like an option.The effects of an uncivilized government is illustrated as these boys, the oldest is twelve, have the capabilities of killing two of their own when they are power hungry. They lack of logic and reason portray that a society holds everyone together and prevents things like a burning island from occurring.Overall this book is well written and its view on the power of society is a strong yet necessary message to express. Despite the young age of the savages, this can depict what irresponsibility and greed can create."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"*Although I do not like Golding's theme of returning to a primeval evil when man is unbound by society, he makes for an effective argument which he establishes through vivid imagery.The story begins with a group of kids that seemingly crashed onto an island isolated. Quickly, there are two leaders that seem to stand out and foil each other, Ralph and Jack. Each represent two different ideals, Ralph is the compassionate leader who is able to reason while Jack is the exact opposite, the two become friends and Jack assumes the position of chief hunter, because the group decided through a democratic vote that Ralph was to be leader. As the story progresses, the children's clothes become tattered and consequently their attitudes begin to change. They are slowly but surely reverting back to primeval instincts, where all they care for is to survive and to avoid the creature that dwells on the island...This total reversion occurs when Simon dies, the Christ figure of the story and also the voice of reason. He is weak and has epilepsies, however, he realizes that the monster is only part of their imagination, but it is too late, when he tries to relay this message to others, the rest of the kids are far too immersed in their barbaric ways. They kill Simon in a frenzy.Golding's barbaric portrayal of humans when unbound by the chains of society is truly cruel. He also assigns the death of Piggy who acts as another voice of reason by crushing him under a boulder, he describes in vivid detail his death. (it is nasty and revolting, the image of a human crushed like a pancake is not very pleasing, but this also attributes to Golding's portrayal of humans, that innately we are all bad and it is society that holds us civilized).The story ends when Ralph is the only rational one left, and the rest of the kids set the island one fire and begin hunting Ralph down. Luckily, before they kill him, people in boats come aboard the island and rescue him. They view the kids as playing, immediately toning down the seriousness of what had just happened. Ralph cries for humanity and the book ends.This book is entirely disturbing, but my morbid curiosity made me read on. I reluctantly turned page by page unable to stop, fueled by his grotesque images. I did not like the idea of humans being innately evil, but I have to admit that Golding is a good writer. He effectively uses our imaginations to get the best of us and figurative language to convey the desperateness of the situation.Try reading this book, it has dark themes, but just because one does not like the idea does not mean that one cannot simply enjoy the book for the sake of enjoying it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Read this as a kid in High School.

It has all the elements of a strong story, one that catches you up and keeps you up late at night. On a more important level, however, Lord of the Flies is quite simply the best book about war that I have ever read. It exposes war not as horrifying, or terrible, but as patently ridiculous and non-sensical.

If the book was only themese and symbols I'd give it a 5 star rating. Unfortunately, the book has a long way to go before I can give it even 4. My main problem with the book is that I do not like Golding's writing style. I think he put too much description in the wrong places. I also wish that Golding would have gone into more detail with Simon's character. If I didn't have to read it for school I probably would not have finished the book, but I am glad that I did.

Piggy symbolises the intellectual and concious mind. This book is a reminder of how thin the line is between humanity as conciousness and barbarism"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a novel that is truly the basis for so many things in our society today. It repeatedly reoccurs throughout our pop culture, in television and film, etc. I am not sure if Darwinism came before or after this book, but the principal idea is what happens when several human beings have to survive on a remote island far removed from society. The book begins with a plane crash of school children, and the surviving children attempt to establish some form of order which quickly disintegrates. What happens from there is indicative of William Golding's impression of the true, primal nature of humanity. Definitely a classic, which everyone should read. If not, there is a really good b&amp;w film which follows the book pretty accurately."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Vivid and mysterious Lord of the Flies is one of those uncommon books which is susceptible to several levels of interpretation and analysis. It has this characteristic because it deals honestly and profoundly with human beings under stress, and because its author, William Golding, has a sympathetic and intense vision of the problems facing modern man, the varied reactions of different types of people under similar conditions, and the internal tension experienced by human beings forced to face new a difficult situations. Through its portrayals of human beings and human problems, this novel illustrated important general principles of human behavior and human relations. Lord of the flies is a thought-provoking novel authored by William Golding in 1954. The book describes in detail the horrific exploits of a band of young children who make a striking transition from civilized to barbaric. The Lord of the Flies commands a pessimistic outlook that seems to show that man is inherently tied to society, and without it, we would likely return to savagery."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by William Golding is a story, which leads the readers deep into a boys mind during the time of World War II. Golding's book starts out with a group of boys from Britain who are shot down from their plane and is stranded on an island. What these boys do not notice is there is a &quot;beast&quot; on the island. This beast is known as fear and the greatness in evil. Golding wanted to illustrate in this novel the dark side of human nature and make the point that each member of humankind has this dark side. Golding uses the boys' fear of a mythical beast to illustrate their assumption that evil arises from external forces rather than from them-selves. This fearsome beast initially takes form in their imaginations as a snake-type animal that disguises itself as jungle vines; later, they consider the possibility of a creature that rises from the sea or the more hazy body of a ghost. When they spot the dead paratrooper who has landed on the mountain, the boys feel sure that they have proof of a beast's existence. In fact, a beast does roam the island, but not in the form, the boys imagine."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is displayed as a remarkable novel. The plot shows suspense, adventure, and thrills. As the novel slowly uncovers itself, each of the character's inside personality also slowly reveals. The novel shows the extent of action, humans would show for survival and the wide and vague diverse personalities different people contain within.Once the reader picks up the book, they would be enthralled in the novel and would feel trapped within. The words are used so intensely that the reader will often feel as if they are part of the story. This novel is beautifully written and the plot is presented in a unique manner.&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is a rather tragic and frightening novel. The protagonist goes through never-ending adventures for the hope of survival, and the antagonist does whatever it takes to get rid of the protagonist and would go far beyond imagination. Even though the protagonist was a static character, unfortunately, the antagonist is thought to be a dynamic character that turns evil through a twist of fate."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is an excellent book with many different symbolic refrecences.

Jack is a great dictator so this works marvolusly . Jack does not like everyone though , he is mean to piggy as piggy is weak , he has asma and glasses . Jack feels no sympathy whatsoever towards piggy though . Soon Jack lures the boys away from Ralph and piggy and simon ( the democracy ) to his group of wild savages . If the boys have no leader , and when Ralph starts to nag like a parent the follow the one they see as strong even if the morals are wrong . Alot like how the germans followed hitlar long ago . The inocence these children had is dead when they start getting exited about killing , they have nothing to do on the island so getting exited about killing makes them want to do it more . They end up complete savages and when they are all hyped up after a dance at a feast and simon appears out of the dark the group of savages all pounce on him &quot; they were no words just the sound of claws and teeth tearing flesh &quot; . The children later hunt Ralph and Ralph does not know what hes done so wrong to be hunted , the fact is he is different and so if someone standed out they would be hunted or killed then and there . Ralph is the innocence and reason in the island so was piggy and simon they all still had a concience . The others were won over by savagery . At the end when they are all faced with what the most important thing was and they had forgotten it , rescue . They all think about what they have just done . The actual fact that they had killed people , and it could have been them too . Ralph thinks and &quot; weeped for the end of innocence and for dear wise friend Piggy &quot; . I agree totally that the point of this is exploring the boundary beetween human reason and animal instinct . This was written when a war was on though so the author thought evry one , when put in the cercumstances would be that violent and savage . It may not be so . This was written to make people think very deeply about reason and how awful people can be when in a horrible situation like that of in lord of the flies . And by the way if your wondering what the lord of the flies is , its a dead pigs head on a stick which the children gave to &quot;the beast &quot; as a sactafice , it later in the book tells Simon that there is no beast , they are the beast basically . And simon who had the intellect and understanding of the savagery and the beast now had the laguage to express and describe it to the others , when he found this out he ran to the others to tell them .

For example, when people are in a group they change to fit in, just like the characters in the story they all became savages. This book was &quot;less than perfect&quot; because it didn't have any girls and the ending was not very elaborate either.

It keeps you on the edge of your seat and in suspense on what will happen next. The author makes you firmly hold the book as you read just in case something jumps out at you.It is a brilliant story about young boys stranded on an island after a horrible plane crash.

It is left up to a group of boys to establish order and a civilization until they are rescued.Golding shows symbolization of Christianity through his character Simon, a choirboy.

This group clearly demonstrates cruel and devilish intentions.It is such a descriptive piece that you can visualize and get a scents of feeling about the island and the characters.

(basically a lesson I learned)"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies was a well-written book, chock-full of symbolism and motifs and themes. However, some of the prose I disliked, and the plot skipped weeks at a time. The setting of the story is an idyllic island. The island is marred, however, by the arrival of a plane of boys that crashes on the island, who were being carried away from wartime Britain. The story probably occurs sometime during World War II. The incident that incites the conflict between Ralph and Jack, the characters who represent pragmatic leadership versus violent evil, is the vote for chief of the island. Jack loses bitterly to Ralph, his only support being his own reluctant choir (he is head choirboy). Ralph, ever the eager diplomat, awards Jack the choir as his to command. Jack declares the choir the hunters, which foreshadows how they will begin to hunt Ralph. The tribe, though, is still firmly behind Ralph and his belief in democracy and rules.The book progresses into the essential conflict between Ralph and Jack, as several deaths fuel the fire. The book is essentially a social allegory, a comment on the untamable brutality of humankind.The savagery of this book makes some shocking points about human brutality, and forces the reader to look inward and see some of that brutality in herself. The reader must have patience to adjust to the writing style, but the allegory about the inescapable violence of humanity is powerful and disturbing. Overall reading this book is rewarding."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I'm sure this review won't get any &quot;helpful&quot; votes, but here are my thoughts. Somehow, this book wasn't required reading in any of my high school or college classes, so I had no idea what it was about when I picked it up (on a flight on my honeymoon, no less). I thought it was a great read. I'm not one to get into allegorical type books or story lines, but this one was good. The author did a great job of presenting a microcosm of the best and worst sides of human behavior, or so I thought. I thought the final page ended the book perfectly. The kids get rescued from completely destroying themselves by adults, who are in fact part of a much larger world/society/culture trying to, well, destroy each other. Perfect ending."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I've heard people talk about how unrealistic this book is.

I'm sure a lot of readers say, &quot;If it were me on that island, things would've worked.&quot; That's even sadder than the teacher thing. If presented with the situation, we'd ALL be savages. Every single one of us. It's just mankind's nature. There's no problem with embracing one's nature, contrary to popular belief. Anywho, this book is not only exciting, insightful, gritty, and realistic, it's also very truthful. Read this book and see for yourself. Then you'll see that there's a little (or a lot, depending on yourself) bit of Jack inside all of us."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Book Review of Lord of the FliesThe thought of what you would do if you were stranded on a deserted has crossed almost every person's mind at one point or another. What if it was to happen to you? Would you know what to do to survive? Lord of the Flies by William Golding brings Golding's moral philosophy into an intriguing story of a group of boys crash landing on a deserted island. As the boys attempt to survive, new problems arise from the lack of society that force the boys back to the clutches of their natural instincts.A group of British schoolboys crash land on an uninhabited island somewhere in the ocean. With the only adult on the plane being killed in the crash, the two oldest of the boys, Ralph and Jack, begin a power struggle to be the leader of the boys. Ralph begins his life on the island by trying to incorporate a democracy within the group of boys. The boys then vote for a leader and they almost unanimously choose Ralph. The boys show their wish for society by making some rules to abide by. From the moment Ralph was voted leader, Jack was always his rival, whether he showed it or not. To show his strength, Jack starts a group of hunters that savagely kill the wild pigs on the island. The younger children of the island have their own problem, dealing with the fear of \\"The Beastie\\" supposedly a giant snake this imaginary beast develops into a creature that all of the boys' fear. Little do they know how the once imaginary beast would affect their lives. After Ralph confronts Jack about his hunters acting savagely Jack is enraged and orders a re-vote for leader. Once again, Ralph is voted leader again and Jack leaves the tribe to form his own group. To add to the conflict between them, the rest of the boys split off into two groups following either Ralph or Jack as their leader. To the reader this starts off as being a childish game, but when children start getting killed it evolves into a deadly struggle for power between the groups.This book is taught in almost every school system in the country giving a new perspective of human nature with its immense amount of symbolism throughout it. Depending on how you look at it the book can be broken down into different kinds of symbolism including human civilization, Freudian Psychology, and a religious allegory. As a reader, I personally saw the book as a vision of human civilization in which the island is a microcosm of the world. The main characters each represent an aspect of human society including human virtues, violence, civilization, intellect, and peace. Aside from the characters, key objects in the story also represent something on a higher term. In one reading it may not be possible to catch every symbol within the book, which may encourage you to read it more than once.Everyone who reads this book should be able to find a way to relate it to the world today. One of the best things about this book is that the way someone interprets the symbols is different from the next person. The general audience of this book is high school students who were forced to read it for an assignment, I being one of them. But I believe this book can be enjoyable to anyone of almost any age if they have an open mind. In my opinion, one of the main reasons why a student wouldn't like this book would be because they were forced to read it, and didn't really read deeply to discover all of the hidden meanings. But if you are open minded and enjoy a good book I suggest reading the adventurous eye-opening book, Lord of the Flies by William Golding.Golding, William. Lord of the Flies. New York: The Berkley Publishing Group, 1954."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies is a very good book. It may seem that it doesn't make a lot of sense at first but once you understand it is really quite good. Before the book begins a plane, with a group of young school kids, crashes in the middle of the ocean near an island. This has already occurred before the book begins. The book begins with a kid walking around the island trying to figure out were he is. His name is Ralph. He is an important kid in the book. While he is walking he finds another kid whose name is Piggy. Piggy and Ralph are two of the main characters.Ralph and Piggy realize that they are on an island with no adults. Ralph decides that for them to have the best chances of survival they must find all of the people on the island. To do this he uses a conch shell to make a noise. The noise calls all of the kids towards him. There are several groups of kids and even a boys choir that comes to the meeting. The conch shell represents power and leadership to the kids. The kids form a working relationship and they live with each other for a while. Then something drastically changes.This is a great book about how kids can take leadership and power. They were very organized while doing this but they still found a few set backs on their way. It also demonstrated how people can become very savage. This is one of my favorite books that I have read. I would recommend The Lord of the Flies to anyone that enjoys reading adventure and suspense novels."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's Lord of the Flies is a very well written novel set on a desert island during war times. This novel faces many issues that include growing up and maturity, working together, lost innocence, survival, and instinct. All of these themes are tackled by a group of schoolboys whose plane has been shot down during a war. The description of the condition of the boys and the island scene is very vivid. I was able to form a mental picture of the scenes easily. Left to fend for themselves, the boys go through many experiences to survive. Through these many grueling experiences, they must learn to hunt, cooperate with one another, fight for power among the group, and learn to adjust to living in the wild alone, without protection. In this book, the savage instinct of humans is portrayed, at times becoming a bit too graphic for me. However, all humans have instincts, therefore it was necessary to show these savage instincts to receive the full effects of being alone in the wild fending for yourself. I liked how the boys in this novel, through their ups and downs, learned to work together to make their own kind of civilization, which fit their needs accordingly. I would recommend this book for people of any age who enjoy novels that entail survival, which was the main theme of this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies was surprisingly a great book. I expected a dull and dragging book which is probably the exact opposite of what I got. It was gripping and it kept me reading. It can get boring ,of course, when your English teacher feels the need to analyze every line. That did help, in the long run, for me to understand the depth of the book. I'd reccomend this to anyone who enjoys reading."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I just finished reading this book in my 8th grade English class.

If you want to read a great book, definetly pick this book up."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The author, in writing about a group of plane-wrecked children's struggle to survive on an island, has elegantly revealed the structure and workings of the human psyche.

Like many of the critics, I had to read this novel for my english class. My teacher did not enjoy it, for it was very graphic, yet it was precise in its message. Man is a savage beast, and under any circumstance, the beast from within can emerge. The island was a microcosm of the boys' world in which a war was occuring. The loss of innocence was touching. Read this book!!!!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I enjoyed the storyline but not the plot. You might say it was dull towards the end, but I won't reveal to you the end, if you do like these kind of books. This book just lacked something in the plot- maybe it was the characters non-involvement in the plot maybe something a bit different- but I can't put my finger on it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book totally shows what happens when people feel stranded, like on an island. Some come to their senses and others go haywire and do evil things. But to really understand this book and get anything out of it, you have to understand the role of insantity in the characters. While only one really is insane, you have to think of all the others as the same only on a smaller scale. That's why it takes place on an island."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Wow!!! It is unbelievable the way William Golding depicts his characters, because they are so true to life. I read it a few months ago, but I am sure that I will remember in 50 years as though I read it yesterday. It is not one you can easily forget. I had to read it for my English class and now I am very glad that I did. I normally do not enjoy summer reading lists, but this was an exception to the rule. I feel sorry for those who dislike this book only because they were forced to read it for school. They are missing out on a truly marvelous book. My advice to those unfortunate people is if you can't approach a book with a positive attitude, approach it with an open mind."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I will never see life in the same way again. It shows mankind for what we really are: savages, held together by the ideas of civilisation. It shows us the 'end of innocence, and the darkness of man's heart.'"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A hasty finish from a point from where the author could have done wonders with the story. Undoubtedly the best part of the book being when the Lord of the Flies makes his brief entry in the story, when lawlessness prevails .... &quot;..funny thinking how you thought the beast was something you could hunt and kill, closer come closer....you are the beast we are all the beast... &quot; The darker side of man is hence exposed in the latter part of the novel..."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I'm not quite sure how to describe this. At times, while reading this book I felt that I had to almost force myself to keep going. It's not that I felt bored by the story so much as couldn't get into it. However, I gave this book four stars because when I got to the very end I was greatly moved. I don't know why but I got very emotional and burst into tears. I then felt rewarded and knew that this book was much more than what I thought it was.I also saw the black and white film from the 1960's and would highly recommend it to anyone over the age of 14. It's better than the book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Somehow I missed this book through grade school and high school, and am just now reading it for the first time, following a degree in literature. It is easy to see why teachers love it so much: the symbolism and thematic sense are simple and easily accessible. Like Of Mice and Men and To Kill a Mockingbird, it is an easy introduction into digging more out of a book than just a good story. And, also like those books, the story is good enough to keep kids -- and adults-- reading.So does it hold any appeal for an adult, used to digging around in Joyce or Faulkner? Well, to be honest, To Kill a Mockingbird is still one of my favorite books, and sometimes it's nice when you don't have to try too hard. In this book, an experienced eye can pretty much see what's going to happen from the very beginning, and then what is left is to sit back and enjoy the ride. And it is a pretty good ride, a pretty ripping little bloody story.I have some issues with the basic thematic material, wondering how and why (or even if) Golding really believes that grownups or law and society or really anything else really do tame the savage beast that is allowed reign on the island. When the soldier shows up at the end, is it really over? If I had the time, talent, and permission, it would be intriguing to write a sequel -- in which Jack and Ralph go the same boarding school and must deal with what happened on the island -- and, in the end, find that there is as much savagery living within the structures of civilization as there ever was on the island.I actually listened to this book, on tape, rather than reading it. I was fortunate enough to find a copy read by the author himself, with a short commentary by Mr. Golding at the end of every chapter. Very fun, and recommended. (...)"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I would recommend this book. Early on, I was hoping there was something more to the story than just lost boys on an island by themselves. Once I realized that the basic story was just boys fending for themselves, I enjoyed it more. It's not an easy book to get through because we can't get too close to the main characters Ralph and Jack. We know by the end, Jack and his &quot;hunters&quot; have gone too far, but somehow I never felt the panic or emotion that Ralph and Piggy probably did. But the story is fascinating just on the merits of human nature. Everyone should take that away after finishing this story - people can be broken down into basic personality elements."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is among the finest literary works of the twentieth century. Comparable to Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness,&quot; it gives the reader a glimpse into the dark side of human nature. Golding's novel is perhaps even more frightening than Conrad's, in that he uses children characters to accomplish this.No other literary work rouses the same seemingly contradictory feelings as this one - at the same time an animosity towards the snobbish civilization that bred the marooned boys and a yearning for the return of its constrictive, protective norms. An admiration of the instinctive ability of the children to pursue their needs for food, leadership, and rescue and a revulsion at what these needs become.These and the countless other emotions raised by Golding's novel make it one the most revealing, and consequently chilling, of our time."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was required to read this book for school in my Honors English Class(9th grade), I found it very hard to follow and too symbolic. This is the book of dreams for any English teacher who loves to get their students to read between the lines. Personally, I enjoy a book that is a challenging read, but in this book, every little detail meant something &quot;deeper&quot; and it gave me a headache trying to interpret the aspect of society the detail was trying to depict. I understood the book, but, it was not enjoyable for me and if it were not a required reading, I would not have read the book otherwise. But, if you like books to give you a headache, then this is perfect for you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I first starting to read this book I thought it was very boring but at the end it was so exciting and I caouldn't even put the book down it was so good I loved it. I liked how the author told the story I think they could of put I better begining. I advise people to read this."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I read the book Lord of the Flies I thought it was a very realistic book. When you put a group of people on an island you are going to have the one that wants to be the leader with rules,laws, and punishment. And there will be one who wants to have anarchy, freedom, and no violence. When the kids were put on the island they had everything in order until one person started to get ahead of the pack and wanted to do things his way and start his own group.... they either go with the one who is smart or the one that wants to go live wild. The book didn't realy catch my attention until I had to read it for school. Thats when I started to think of it and pay attention to the book. After we read the book in class, we watched the movie. It wasn't as good as the novel, but it gave me more of an idea of what the island and kids looked like. Many of the actions taken in the book were wrong and taught kids that its ok to hurt or kill someone. When the little boy was stabbed to death the night of the feast it was alright because they thought it was the beast. But when they found out it wasn't the beast they still had no feelings or regrets. When piggy was trying to get his glasses back from the Ralphy's group he was crushed with a bolder and killed. The kids intentially killed this boy and had no regrets. Many of these kids even turned to Ralphy when they saw he had food and shelter. The kids left the good group to go to the bad one and tryed to kill there old leader. At the end all the kids turned against the good and tryed to kill him and he was saved by a man who took him away from the island, but the book I gave four stars just for the simple fact that its suppoesed to be for kids and yet its telling you its ok to kill. Other than that the book is great and easy to read. There isn't that many big words so its kool."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book Lork of the Flies was an ok book. To me I thought there was too many stories going on at the same time and there was to many charcters that the author talked about. Yet it had good adventures I was not really thrilled about this book. If you are looking for an adventure type or survival book then this book is a good book for you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is displayed as a remarkable novel. The plot shows suspense, adventure, and thrills. As the novel slowly uncovers itself, each of the character's inside personality also slowly reveals. The novel shows the extent of action humans would take for survival and the wide and vague diverse personalities different people contain within.Once the reader picks up the book, they would be enthralled in the novel and would feel trapped within. The words are used so intensely that the reader will often feel as if they are part of the story. This novel is beautifully written and the plot is presented in a unique manner.&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is a rather tragic and frightening novel. The protagonist goes through never-ending adventures for the hope of survival. The antagonist does whatever it takes to get rid of the protagonist and would go far beyond imagination. Even though the protagonist was a static character, unfortunately, the antagonist is thought to be a dynamic character that turns evil through a twist of fate."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think that the authors purpose for writing this was to send a message that there is evil in all men. I agree with him because the boys expressed it after they lost respect for eachother. They all showed some kind of evil on the island. The literary element that the author showed was symbolism. He handled it very well because it made you want to keep reading to see if his symbolism was true or not. In my opinion, this book was believable because imagine being on the for six to nine months. the boys went crazy thinking about how long they were going to survive which of course made the evil come out in them. The book was less than perfect in the ending. I probably would have had some cops investigate on why some of the boys that were dead looked the way they did. That would have been my way of changing the flaws."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Believe it or not, I never read this book in high school, which seems to be when most people have read it. Lord of the Flies describes in detail the horrific exploits of a group of young boys who make an alarming transition from civilized to barbaric when they suddenly find themselves stranded on an island with no adults. Ralph is declared chief, and quickly determines that their main goal should be to keep a large fire burning so that passing ships will see the smoke and rescue them. There is a power struggle between Ralph and Jack, who is head of the hunters and obsessed with killing the pigs on the island. Jack finally wins and the majority of the boys decide to follow him, abandoning the efforts of the fire.There were spots in which I found myself re-reading, trying to understand scenes being described. This book is written in the view of a young boy so the reader needs to understand that as a youth, his view of the world is somewhat limited; thus forcing the reader to imagine what the youth is describing with limited terms. There are many passages that require some adult interpretation and imagination. After adjusting to this style of writing, I became thoroughly absorbed by the story, finding my heart beating quickly near the end as I sympathized with Ralph and his efforts to remain civilized."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"For a highschool book project the only thing that matters is the lenght of the book, &quot;the shorter the better.&quot; This novel is what they say, &quot;short and sweet.&quot; I picked up this novel with no good intentions only to find out this is one of my favorite novels I have ever read! William Gerald Golding created a master peice when he wrote &quot;Lord of the Flies.&quot; This book has made me think beyond any normal person would think, I asked myself what would I have done on that island? Or what tribe would I have joined? Several questoins that will always be left unanswered.The boy's are flying home from military school and their plane crashes into the ocean. Only to find out that no adults have survived. They now have to live and depend on eachother to survive as hopes of ever seeing home descends dramatically. Now all eyes look upon the oldest to survive.The main character Ralph is a great leader, he's smart whitted has very good commmon sense and is a nice guy to the others. Ralph tries day in and day out to get him and the others off the island. Tension builds as more and more rebel from Ralph's orders and create a new tribe. I thought Golding did a great job with adding &quot;spice&quot; into this novel. Heat rises between the two tribes as the satanic Jack (the leader of the other tribe) gets so agressive death rises upon the kids.From the steller descriptions of the atmosphere to getting up close and personal with the kids, I think that this book deserves a 4 out of 5 only because the ending left me with a lot of unanswered questions.I highly recomend this book to any who likes thrills, adventure, humor or to someone who just wants a quick read.

I believe in this novel, like others I have read published in this period, has a slow paced plot that does not have incredible amounts of action. In this book, it is sometimes necessary to read two chapters before something exciting accure. For this reason I feel the book may leave something to be desired among the new generation of readers. However, I feel that William Golding does a great job of creating the beautiful, yet traitorous terrain and characters on the island.

Poeple start dying and some other poeple start freaking out. William Goldings very descriptive writting brings some very graphic images to mind. The way Golding adds many hidden meanings in the book alsoo makes it very interesting. You start to realize that the book is more than just a common story of boys deserted on an island and what they do to survive.

It is, i think, one of the most important books in history because it represents human nature. Okay, i don't want to psyche 101 all you guys, but this book challenges the theory in of the \\"naturall goodness of man\\", a theory rationalized in its similar predecessor, Coral Island. Golding suggests that maybe, just maybe, man alone is not good, and there may be a part of him that will always be evil in its own way (the id, for all you Freudians out there) It suggests that sooner or later, everyone would have been consumed by this primordial and savage part of oneself, all except Simon, the Christ Figure, to whom nothing bad would ever happen, besides having the fate of a martyr. So not only can most situations in this book be almost directly related to a Freudian analogy,even the characters, but you will also see that anything in the book he mentions more than once does have some kind of symbolic meaning in the book, and you can find out what it is. The book also lets some wiggle room, enough to include your own perspective and ideas.

He also shows that he is VERY pessimistic. But even though reading the whole novel felt like being in a torture chamber, it was worth something.The one trait that really stood out about this book was the fact that Golding used biblical references to help stand behind his statement. For example, the little boy Simon was a representation of Jesus Christ himself. And you pick that up as he describes a few things that happens to him. Simon hits a tree and bleeds in the middle of his forehead. We all know that is a flashback to when Jesus was on the cross and had the wreath of thorns placed on his head. And what about the pig's head talking to him? Matthew 5 tells about Jesus being tempted by the Devil, which is symbolized by the pig's head, the \\"Lord of the Flies.\\"I give Lord of the Flies 5 stars because it clearly states why Golding says man is evil by nature.

A bunch of boys crash into a deserted island and slowly become very primitive. When Jack separates the boys into two different tribes, they transform from civil to barbaric. The two groups begin to turn on one another. Farther into the book, the fighting increases and the tribes really start to break away from one another.The point of this book is that mankind thinks that their society is civilized, but it is still very primitive. The world today is still based on survival; the strong overcome the weak. Even now, one angry word and our society becomes barbaric. Sometimes wars start and friendships end just by saying the wrong words. As each day passes, the boys start to destroy one another. Simple words between some of the boys end up agitating the tribes, and battles ensue.The Toronto School Board banned this classic from all its schools, citing that it was racist for use of the word &quot;niggers.&quot; As I was looking at all the banned books, I noticed how many are banned for their language.

It deals with the capacity for evil in all humans. Even in &quot;civilized society&quot; there is corruption. By the way, there is no cannibalism in this novel...

While i did enjoy the basic storyline, Lord of the Flies was written in a way that i found extremely confusing and basically uninteresting. The parts of it that i acctually understood weren't so bad though.In the start of the novel, a lot of young boys find themselves trapped on an island with no adults. In the first few days that they are there they elect a leader, set up rules, and get an organized camp going. They seem to be used to having rules and regualtions, and no one objects to this. There are some important main characters in this book. Ralph is the civilized, rational figure who is elected cheif in the beginning. He knows what needs to be done to get rescued, and throuout the book he is focused on that. Then there is Jack, who turns out to be the &quot;bad guy&quot;. He wants to be the cheif, and he really isn't interested in doing productive things, he wants to hunt instead. Piggy is the wise figure in this novel. His ideas always are the obviously correct thing to do, but because he is somewhat of a nerd, no one really listens to him and most of what he says is shot down.Throuought this book civilization goes down the drain. Jack eventually breaks off from the rest of the group with his hunters, and soon enough all the boys except for the little ones, Piggy and Ralph join his tribe to feast, dance and have fun.The conch, the shell that symbolized organization and power in the start of the novel, is smashed into thousands of pieces, which shows us that the morals and society of the boys has completely died. The beast, which all the boys are afraid of, symbolizes the fear that we all have of the unknown. It seemed that every word in Lord of the Flies had some deep hidden meaning, which i felt made the book tedious and confusing. Yes, it is a good book, but would i read it again? No."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"\\"Lord of the Flies\\" by Steven Golding has been applauded by students, teachers and critics alike decade after decade. Infamous for it's profound symbolism, I believe \\"Lord of the Flies\\" gives readers a chance to take a step back and look at similar aspects of their own society with a critical eye.Set on an unknown island off the coast of England, a band of military-school bound boys find themselves stranded after a fatal plane crash, killing all accompanied adults, the plot of \\"Lord of the Flies\\" begins. Although generation after generation have taken \\"Lord of the Flies\\" for it's keen representation, I believe that most readers have also denied themselves half of the story, which Golding also brilliantly creates.Through reading and re-reading this thrilling novel, I have found that Golding not only creates a symbolic microcosm, but also puts forth so much realism and almost stereotypic attributes within his characters and makes each one almost real. I believe that the actual story that \\"Lord of the Flies\\" gives it's readers more than one can see at first glance. Each predominant character (i.e.- the protagonist, Ralph and his group of antagonists, Jack, Piggy and Simon) plays off one another to make a plot of it's own.Remember this, future readers; look at all aspects of this novel, you may find more than you bargained for"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I felt that this book was really well thought of in the first place.

Even when they went hunting for Ralph he was the one with the blood thirsty eyes. The littleuns had problems all of the time being scared and all. The twins samneric must have been very horrified when the saw the (BEAST) or the dead man in the parachute. All of the sightings of the beast made the suspense even more. The rummaging through the forest in search of the beast all turned out to be rubbish. The ending of the book in my opinion was a rushing finish so I had no chance to enjoy it. I would recommend this book to all because it was touching in away and to all the kids it would be fun to have a shelter on a deserted island with no parents."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's The Lord of The Flies drastically starts out with about 13 kids stranded on a deserted island. these kids were recently in a Air plane crash going back from a school.They are stuck on a tropical Island .

If you would like to read the book you can find out about piggy and if they ever get rescued."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies is an interesting book that is unlike any other. It takes the cliched story of a plane wrecked group on a remote island and turns it into a thought provoking story of morals and reality. It starts with a plane crash on a remote island in which all of the children, which are boys from English Military Schools, live and (of coarse) al lof the adults die. Which creates a problem within an even bigger problem. The boys now have to to create a way to live on this island without the help and supervision of adults.So we start the book with Ralph and Piggy finding the conch, a symbolic shell that they use to summon the other boys and as a moderater. So they summon the other boys and they create their own rules and they vote Ralph as the leader. They decide that their only hope in being rescued is if they make a fire and a passing ship sees the smoke. Early on they realize that they need to create a form of life just as the adults would.But they aren't so lucky. As you would expect there are people who want to just have fun and go against Ralph. And the boy who sparks all of this is Jack. Throughout he is striving to become the leader. He is feels that hunting and getting meat is the number one priority. On the other hand Piggy and Ralph know that being rescued and staying together is the main priority. This of coarse caused Ralph to fude with Jack. This part of the book is the part that causes the whole thing to fall apart. I think that thisa is one of the things in the book that keeps me wanting to read it. It creates a real competitive feel to it and it makes you wonder when their angry climax.One of the events that causes a separation between Ralphs group and Jack's group is the time when Jack and his hunters are supposed to be watching the fire but they decide to go hunting instead. The fire goes out and of coarse right at that moment a ship goes by. Ralph naturally atacks Jack and causes them to become rivals to a greater extent.There are parts that make this book out to be a savage murderous tale. Two of the boys Piggy and Simon get murdered by the other boys. SImon in a accident where the boys get scared and think he is the beast. And Piggy is murdered when some of the boys get angry with him and drop a rock on his head. Although these deaths areunexpected they are needed to create the whole thing to just feel more crazy and makes you think afterwards about how their families will feel when they find out their children got killed but all the others lived.But i think that the major flaw in this book for me was the ending. It ended with the boys all running after Ralph trying to kill him and then being saved. I agree that it causes you to think at the end of the book about what will happen. But i think that it should have either told more of what happened when they got back or they shouldn't have been rescued. i agree though that it did leave you thinking which gives you a chance to create your own thoguht on it.This book makes you think about all of the things that you would be forced to give up if you were in there situation. As piggy says &quot;We did everything that grown ups would do. Why didn't it work?&quot; I think that even if the boys were replaced by adults it would still be the same, maybe a little tiny bit more civilized but not much.Over all this book gives you an adventure like no other, that is real and that you can relate to. It keeps you wondering how you would act in their situation and that is the most interesting part of this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book entitled Lord of the Flies, written by William Golding, is an excellent story of a group of boys from Europe whose plane is shot down during a flight over the ocean during World War II. The story entails the deep physical, mental, and social struggles of a group of young boys on a deserted island. The struggle of survival among the boys of the island revolves on partial cooperation. They have to build shelter and find food. Also they're in constant disagreement that eventually splits them into two groups, one to keep the signal fire going, the other sees the need to hunt. All had a common fear, fear of the beast. The beast represents the unknown; the unknown is especially frightening to those who are younger and are losing touch with civilization.All the children on the island have a common goal, at least in the back of their minds, which is to get off the island and be rescued. In the end all the boys, Ralph (the most charismatic character in the story), Simon(the intellignet, prophet-like figure), Jack (the power-hungry, savage-like, and irresponsible child), Piggy (the highly intelligent, pudgy, little boy ), Roger (the small and dirty boy who represents pure evil), Sam and Eric (young twins who always do everything together) each get off the island in one way or another.The pace of this story is easy reading but it does get slow at some points. The style used in writing this book is very detailed about descriptions, understandable but kind of slow. This was a good book recommended for readers of all ages because it is an adventorous story that teaches us about the need for rules and cooperation in an uncivilized environment."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is an amazing story. Willian Golding must have been a very smart man to write such an original book. In this story, a group of British boys are stranded on an Island with no adults. Ralph, their chosen leader has high hopes of rescue, and realizes the strong importance of a continous signalling fire. He tries to keep the other boys under control with rules but like all little kids, they want to play and have fun. There are very few boys who accept their responsibilities. When a chance of rescue is destroyed because of the signal fire not being watched, Ralph becomes angry with the other boys, particularly the hunters, lead by a boy named Jack, who took the fire watchers with him to hunt some wild boars inhabiting the Island. Before long, Jack becomes frustrated with Ralph for trying to run things and makes his own group of hunters called the &quot;tribe&quot;. Ralph is left with his fat friend Piggy who is not respected in the least by the other boys, two twins; Sam and Eric, and some very little boys who aren't interested in helping. For one reason or another Ralph ends up alone against the hunters and the story ends with the tribe in a vigorous pursuit after Ralph. I am only fifteen, but I was able to appreciate every aspect of this book. Lord of the Flies is full of symbolism, and if you like that sort of thing, or even if you don't you'll love this book. I was going to write William Golding and tell him how much I appreciated his book, but he passed away three years ago. I'm sure I'll read this book many times in the future and I've been encouraging my friends to read it. It's just a great book"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I normally loved the books I was assigned to read in my English classes, and never understood why so many other people were complaining about and trashing on the great books we were reading (probably because they hated anything they had to read and I've been reading since the age of three). But not this book. I just found it boring and unrealistic, slow to get into and then still slow once I'd gotten into it. The icing on the cake for me in my dislike of this book was when my ninth grade English teacher (who does this with this, her favourite book, for all of the classes she's had before and since mine, which was 1994-95) gave us a little lesson on the symbolism of this book.I don't have a problem with symbols or allegory in a book, and thank God I've forgotten most of the symbols in this book (and in the other books she taught us). It's interesting to realise, for example, that the conch symbolises order, but how is that going to give you some sort of epiphany while reading the book? And everything in this book is a symbol-Piggy's glasses, some kid's scar, the obnoxiously-termed \\"littluns,\\" the conch, fire, Simon, the decapitated head of the pig, you name it. Could we be any less subtle? I, like most of the other students who had this woman for English, regardless of our respective religions, had no problem with the fact that Simon is supposed to represent Jesus, but the way our teacher presented this information made the Biblical account of Jesus's life and crucifixion seem like (no pun intended) the Gospel truth, telling it to us as though that's exactly how it happened, based on nothing but the Biblical account and not any opinions by scholars which might challenge the old view. Her little lesson broke the Establishment Clause, and every time I see this book, I think back with revulsion and anger to that uncomfortable May day when she gave us that religious sermon in a public school.Getting back to the book, it's incredibly unrealistic how these well-bred English schoolboys, none of them over the age of twelve, devolve into savage, unreasonable, wild, uncontrollable, murderous, unrestrained beasts after maybe two or three weeks on this island. It's one thing for a sadist like Roger or a bully like Jack to go that way, but all of these boys, so quickly forgetting their high-class upbringings and education, losing hope of being rescued that soon and turning to setting fires and allegorically raping sows? Maybe if they were older, or maybe if twenty years or so had passed, then it would seem believable for them to descend into animal madness due to being stranded on an island. All humans have these primal base instincts within, but surely they're not brought to the surface after so short a period of time! They should have still been sending signal fires, making shelters, and looking for fruit and water sources by the time the deus ex machina ending rolls around, not chasing one another around wearing pig's blood on their faces, brandishing spears, ghoulishly chanting \\"Kill the pig! Spill her blood!,\\" talking to decapitated pig's heads, thinking the bogeyman is after them, and all while an out of control fire is raging on their island paradise. Things don't happen that way.This would have made a more believable story had the events taken place over maybe ten or twenty years, not two or three weeks, so we could see a natural and realistic progression from proper British schoolboys to wild marauding savages. They're skipping a lot of steps in between."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"i think the author's message of this book is very clear. He is telling about how mean, cruel, and uncaring people can be, no matter what age. I definately agree with this because of all the horrible things that are seen on the news, it's supports my theory. I think the author used characters best in the book because, in the book, from beginning to end, he analzyes and builds up every character. This is good because it lets you know who you're reading about. This book was pretty much believable, excpet for the fact that the kids were a little too young to be doing what they were doing. Which incidentely, in my opinion, is the only flaw in this book. If i were the author, i would have simply changed the kids ages by making them a couple of years older. If this was done, it would have been much better and more realistic. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"During my last year in High school I was asked by my English teacher to read and review the book Lord of the Flies.I had high expectations since it was a suspense novel. The book did not completely let me down. It had a plot that for the most part kept my interest. At certain points I felt that it dragged on instead of flowing smoothly. All together it is a book I would recommend to others that like suspense with a little fantasy and mystery thrown in.The part that I was particularly interested in was when the boys had their first assembly. It showed that without adult influence they could still survive. This part is interesting to me because how the boys were able to create a sense of order without adult guidance. The scene when the boys are rescued is just as exciting to me. This part shows what they had become. They realized that even after they gave up hope of being rescued they could still learn to survive. A great message to all readers not to ever give up hope.As I continued my reading I came across my least favorite part of the book. That is when Simon is killed. It shows that they have become heartless.What is truly sad is that not all of them realized what they have done. This means that they don't care. I have trouble understanding how the boys can go from order to complete anarchy."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The two boys we meet on the first page of \\"Lord of the Flies\\", Ralph and Piggy, are as freshly minted as Adam in the Garden or the earth/ice gods of Greek and Norse mythology. Born full-formed, they are pre-modern, utterly unsurprised by their own existence. They are no more plausible as 12-year-old boys than the usual totemic first humans of \\"creation myths\\" from cultures around the world. Plausibility is not the objective of myth; moral instruction is, and \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is plainly intended as a morality tale illustrative of human nature, which is depicted as innately savage, held in check only by authoritarian social structures and above all by \\"rules\\".Reading \\"Lord of the Flies\\" as a version of Genesis does make the story clearer, though I make no claim that such clarity was William Golding's intention. But: A) they're in a garden paradise; B) \`Woman' has not yet been created; C) fratricide, the Cain and Abel story, is central; D) Yahweh, in the form of a Grown-Up British naval officer, makes his judgmental appearance in the end.\\"Lord of the Flies\\" can also be read as science-fiction. Most critics have taken it as an apocalyptic parable, an \`end of the world' scenario, with the boys as the only visible survivors of a world war. End of humankind, beginning of humankind, take your choice! Of course, without girls, without Eve, humankind wouldn't amount to much. If, indeed, the boys were being transported to the island, or to some other custodial location, the reader will have to puzzle out the survivalists' intent. If, on the other hand, these boys -- all British but of mixed ages -- were on a flight somewhere and were stranded on the island by a crash, the questions brim up faster than the tide. Why didn't any of them know where, why, how, or what? On a plane of the size Golding could have imagined, wouldn't they have at least noticed each other while boarding? The \`creation myth' reading eliminates some of those questions; the boys popped into existence on the island without real-time antecedents, even though they were created with the illusion of prior-life memories.Implausibility in the cause of plot development is one of the constant weaknesses of second-rate science fiction. \\"The Lord of the Flies\\" is riddled with implausibilities small and large. My guess is that William Golding had less than no experience with the outdoors, other than English playing fields. Let's get persnickety for a moment: 1) The boys start a fire INSTANTLY with sunlight through the lens of Piggy's glasses; Hah! I'd like to see that done! 2) The naked or nearly naked boys, with their tender English feet, scamper over coral and volcanic rocks all a-jumble, and through palm and bramble thickets, at the speed of thought on the typewriter keys; Golding had clearly never attempted hiking off-path in his life! 3) The island is straight out of Disneyland! If it's big enough to support a population of wild hogs, to have running streams of fresh water, and to feature a peak as high as described, then the boys COULD NOT possibly cover the territory they do in the time they're allotted, any more than Jack Bauer could drive from edge to edge of Los Angeles during a commercial break! If the island is as small as it has to be for the final \`hunt' to make sense, then it's too small for any other item of the story to compute. There are also some ecological illogicalities, the strangest of all being the presence of those pigs without any history of human settlement. Honestly, as a narrative of \`survival' in a hostile or indifferent environment, \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is less realistic than \\"The Hatchet\\", Gary Paulsen's classic for young readers.In short, William Golding knew absolutely NOTHING about nature! And knowing nothing about Nature, how can his depiction of Human Nature be considered meaningful?That's the burning question for me, in reading this rather childish portrayal of the innate bestiality -- the \\"original sin\\" -- of our species. Frankly, I think \\"The Lord of the Flies' is fatally dated; it's a specimen of the mindset of the year it was published, 1954, at the beginning of the Great Fear of nuclear destruction. It dates from an era when the implications of evolution were just beginning to dawn on middle-class literary Joes like Golding, but long before any combination of ethology and evolutionary psychology had begun to probe the roots of social-ethical behavior.Is it still worth reading? Yeah, it's kinda fun. Does it have depths of insight in the human dilemma? None that I can take seriously. Should it be a standard reading choice for school children of any particular age, as it has been? Is it actually a book intended for \\"young readers\\"? I'll have to leave those questions for teachers to consider."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies comes from the word Beelzebub meaning devil. With this novel William Golding Justifies that even the most innocent of beings can be corrupted by the devil and become a monster.Marooned on a desert island a group of British, school kids discover that their only hope of survival is to stick together and build a fire. Ralph, a level-headed 12 year old, is burdened with the responsibility of chief much to the disliking of Jack Merridew. All things seem to be going well until Jack and his appointed hunters, get their first kill and talk of the beast start to stir. Ralph starts getting more and more obsessed with the fire as Jack starts getting hypnotised with hunting and killing. As the ties of civilization get further away so do the ties of sensibility. Jack breaks of from the others to form a new tribe, promising things Ralph cannot provide. As many of the older ones fade away to the opposite end of the Island Ralph is left with his wise and trustworthy friend Piggy and the quietly troubled Simon. Ralph believes all is lost but is uplifted by prophesised words from Simon.On the other side of the island Jack and his sinister side-kick, Roger slowly spread chaos across the island no longer much sense of humanity. They are blood thirsty savages.As a storm gathers terror spreads into everyone and terrible things start to happen.Golding conjures a shocking tale that makes us realise that in everyone there is a dark side waiting to emerge and no matter how many times we deny it, it will always be there tempting us.This book chills you to the bone as Golding's words drag you onto that island and subtly yet effectively shows you even in the darkest hour hope can be found.His use of language helps to keep you on your toes as his narrative skills capture every little moment.A truly, intoxicatingly troubled book indeed."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding is a deeply symbolic novelist who relies, especially in this novel and in The Inheritors (1955), on ideas from the viewpoint of evolutionary biology and anthropology. The central symbol of The Lord of the Flies is that of a pig's head upon a stick stuck in the ground, a totem in the making perhaps, but seen by Golding as Beelzebub, the \\"lord of the flies,\\" the devil, a head of rotting flesh enveloped by flies.The central idea is that without civilization we will degenerate into predatory animals ruled by superstition, the will to power, and the primordial need to survive. When Piggy's glasses, which symbolize the tools and knowledge of our culture are broken, it signals the degeneration, the return to the wild in which, as Thomas Hobbes has it, there are \\"No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\\"That a group of English school boys could degenerate so quickly after crash-landing on a deserted island may be seen as a bit fanciful, or more exactly, as the artifice of the artist; nonetheless, the premise of this extraordinary work may well serve as a cautionary note for our times. Should we, through nuclear warfare, a runaway greenhouse effect, sectarian violence on a global scale, or through the exhaustion of the fossil fuels that power our civilization, regress to the state of savages, we have this warning.Instead of the noble savage, instead of a return to the Garden of Eden, instead of the Swiss Family Robinson or Robinson Crusoe, Golding takes us step by step from the world of the boy's school to life and death power struggles and a fascination with savagery to the beginnings of tribal warfare. As in The Inheritors, Golding sees not the good in humans, but the viciousness. In The Inheritors we homo sapiens murdered the gentle Neanderthal, here we children become gangsters of the island, on our way to becoming tribal chieftains as murderous and vengeful as the God of the Old Testament. I understand that Golding wrote the novel in part to answer the pollyannaish naivete of R.M. Ballantyne's The Coral Island (1857), which I haven't read.Clearly cruelty is one of Golding's main themes. Left to their own devices and without the restraint of civilization's justice, humans will be cruel sometimes just to be cruel and sometimes as a means of gaining power. The boys Ralph and Piggy naively try to set up a democratic sort of government, but are defeated by the brutality of Jack and his will to savagery.The loss of innocence that the boys experience is seen as not the loss of something they intrinsically had, but of something superimposed upon them by civilization. In reality, Golding is saying, there is no innocence in children, that is only a fairy tale idea to which we romantically subscribe.This is one of those novels that has found its way onto the high school or even the middle school curriculum because it is easy to read and because it is easy for young people to relate to. But the strength of this novel lies not only in its theme and readability but in the fine characterizations of the individual boys. As in all great works of literature, it is the combination of character and story that compels us to turn the pages, and invites our admiration.It should be noted that Golding deliberately left out one of the central drives of humans, probably because he did not want to muddy up his theme of savagery, or perhaps because he felt the task too great or perhaps because he didn't find the task palatable. I am referring to the lack of sexuality in the novel. Not only are there no girls on the island, but the boys do not, at least overtly, involve themselves in sex. We can see that Golding's artistry anticipated this criticism since it can be argued that the boys in this situation and at their tender age are not yet ready to express themselves sexually. I wonder if postmodern psychology would agree. Certainly Freud would not.Bottom line: a great read, a terrific adventure, but not a book in my opinion that should be read by preteens, in other words, you need to be older than the characters in the book in order to read the book without fear of nightmares."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the novel Lord of the Flies, there is a direct correlation to the way the boys attempt to set up a form of organized government, and todays world. Ralph and Jack, the main characters, both seek to accomplish complete power of the island. Although they have a different opinion on how to run the island, each boy wants to be the leader and in complete domination.Ralph is set up to portray the \\"good guy\\" or the protagonist of the story. He is voted the first to be in charge of everyone on the island and through the beginning of the novel tries to run the island through a democracy. But as the book continues, he begins to lose control and a more anamalistic behavior takes over. At the same time, Jack is competing against Ralph to turn all of the little children against Ralph to feed his hunger for power.Jack is the obvious symbol of evil and wrong doing in the novel. As the book continues, Jack begins to feed more and more off of the power he recieves. Jack tries to turn the island into an anarchy. Ultimately Jack gains all of the power, out of pure fear from the little ones. The chronological order of the book also covers the necessary toics needed to show the rise and decline of the different leaders."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was written excellentally by Golding expressing the overall problems of society. The destruction of innocence and rationality helps to improve his theme. The overall twists in the plot and storyline make it an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's book of classic woe and hardship, the book tells of a group of young boys who are stranded on a deserted island. With no adults there with them they have to find the strength inside of them to survive on their own. The book starts off great with the boys getting along and learning how to work together, until they start to get power hungry. Ralph is voted to be chief of the group but you see the inner battle of how to rule, the side of hunting and playing and enjoying the stay at the island with out parents, or watching and tending the fire to get rescued. While Ralph is dealing with this another one of the boys wants to be chief and decides that hunting and playing is the way to go, he wants Ralph out of leadership and that is where the struggle begins. The fighting between the two boys brings out the evil in all the boys on the island. The book is the tale of the evil that mankind carries around, unknowingly, with them. It tells of the evil in all of us. Can society live and survive being good? Or does this inner evil take over? This book does a marvelous job telling of that."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book Lord of the Flies, written by William Golding is a very well written book. The genre of the book is historical fiction. The setting of the book is on an uncharted island during the WorldWarII era. the book is mainly about a couple of schoolboys who crash landed on an uncharted island that they are stranded on without any adults. I think that the theme of the book was to show that society cannot run correctly because of the natural, sinful nature of man. Some of the main characters are Piggy, Ralph, and Jack. Piggy and Ralph first meet when they wake up next to each other after the landing. Piggy is a chubby, little bossy kid, while Ralph on the other hand is a mellow, relaxed cool kid. They call together all of the kids that are on the island and they meet a boy named Jack. Jack is a stuck up kind of kid, who is a prefect at his school and a captain of his choir class. While the short lived bond of Piggy and Ralph's friendship grows weaker. Jack and Ralph, who are both the leaders, seem to get along very well. Piggy and Ralph were the two friends, but when a person like Jack shows up, a more strong, leader-like and Ralph-like kid is up to be Ralph's friend, Ralph quickly ignores Piggy and makes Jack his new friend. But as Jack and Ralph's friendship grows the contest for leadership grows even more. Even though the kids voted Ralph as cheif, Jack is starting to show that he could be even a better cheif. I believe this because all Ralph has ever cared for is be keep a fire going and keep the hope of being rescued alive. While Jack, a more ferocious boy, focuses on staying alive most of the time and loves to hunt for the hard to get meat. I think that this book is best recommended for older teenagers because most of the words in this are very hard to understand and there are some violence in the book. The book, Lord of the Flies, is a very interesting book. Even though it has some very confusing words and hard to understand material, it should be given a try."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read the book and then saw the movie. The movie was all right but like any movie it didn't do the book justice. The book was much more descriptive and kept you on the edge of your seat. I enjoyed reading about the different boys and the roles they took on being stranded on a deserted island together. Instead of banding together they ultimatly end up in 2 groups against each other because of 2 headstrong individuals. And of course, instead of getting along, the boys had to find one poor boy to still make fun of. The book sparks different feelings throughtout the book and the author does a great job hitting just the right feelings at just the right time."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of The Flies is a wonderful novel filled with deceit, mystery, and violence. It displays all of the problems of society. Very young british school boys get trapped on this paradice of an island and by the end the book the island is death filled, burnt to the ground, and destroyed. The symbolism in this book is so deep and meaningful that you have to read over and over agin to really understand what the author was trying to display. This is an ingenious novel and I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is an important book of what happens in a society when there are no rules or any guide lines to follow. Ever since the boys were placed on the island they were destined to fail at creating their own perfect environment. The setting they are in starts out as a good fun environment to them but by all of the boys hunger for power it turns them against eachother and turns this so called \\"good\\" island, into a \\"bad\\" island.Jack is a representation of evil by how he thirsts for blood and meat as a opposed to being rescued. He would let the fire go out which is their only chance for survival just to cut open a pig. Ralph represents good by trying to create order, shelter and a way to be rescued. Jacks group takes over the island creating the human motivation for evil and hunting. Ralph being the only one left his motivation is forced into surviving as opposed to creating order. The whole island turns to chaos when just one person takes control. This person represents the devil figure and he takes down everyone on the whole island except for Ralph. This book shows how important rules and order are in a society today. It also shows how human motivation can completely take over the whole human body and let barbaric things happen that would not happen in a normal oderly society today."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I remember reading Golding's novel as a teenager for some English class I didn't care about. I had a littlun's attention span then, and never really understood the work.So I gave it a re-read. This time, I may have grasped a few more things.Why are there no females on the island? The presence of females would have turned the novel at best into a pulp teen romance novel, at worst into a Survivor episode. Teen and pre-teen romantic entanglements on a remote island. Yikes. Their absence is to me striking. I think Golding chose to leave them out because, like in real life, girls only complicate things.It seems unlikely as well that dozens of young boys would end up on a remote island by themselves. Something like a Gilligan's Island, English boys-only school field trip? I understand it had to happen like this in order for the story to develop, but I wonder how all the adults could be killed and somehow small boys survived a terrible boating accident.It is obvious that the novel is a social parable seen through boy-play. It mocks human superstitions and fears (the beast) and stupid clan alliances. It explains how we humans, with all our modern technological inventions, are only an instant away from devolving into savages. We need authoritarian symbols (the conch in the story) and rules to stay the decline. The conch in the story always calls the boys to order, up until the first human sacrifice of Simon.The boys engage in ritualistic-like pig sacrifices, where they chant Kill the pig! Spill the blood! Slit her throat! in a savage mantra, and proceed to devour the meat after the killing. Ralph, representing law and order, takes part in the ritual by eating the pig flesh; he is hungry even though he is disgusted by the ritual. The sacrifice ritual eventually devolves into human offerings, with the killing of Simon. We know who is next, because Piggy (the despised intellectual) predicts he is. And then the final act is to attempt to destroy Ralph, who represents all law and order. Ralph is only rescued in the end by the Naval Officer, ultimate adult authority.It is significant that the youngest boys exclaim that the beast lives out in the sea, after a search on the island fails to uncover any monster. The bodies of the human sacrifices, Piggy, Simon, even the Pilot, are washed out to sea in a symbolic offering to the unknown Sea-monster.Some reviewers have criticized the work for being overly simplistic. I say good chefs boil their soups down to concentrate the flavors. The symbolism is rich and potent in this text, and many are the modern writers in need of this advice."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's disconsolate tale of a couple of young boys trapped on an island after a terrible plane crash is exciting and powerful. It all starts when a young boy named Ralph sets out to search the island for any other people. He finds a boy named Piggy (another boy from the plane crash) and a couple of other boys. Everything seems to be going well on the island until they discover the body of a dead pilot and mistake it for a terrible monster. I would not recommend this book for children under the age of ten due to its complex descriptions of its characters and settings that at some times I couldn't understand. I think the way William Golding made the book similar to what can happen without a good government and what it is like living in a state of nature was a good way of explaining it to teenagers who read this book. I would recommend this exciting and powerful book to other people."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Stumbling through the jungle, the fair-haired boy makes it to a beach and finds a chubby boy. After crashing on the island, they're surprised to see each other. Ralph along with a handful of other boys are on a plane evacuating a war area and get shot down. They crash onto and island where they are scattered among the island. No adults are found to have survived so Ralph and Piggy find a conch shell in the water on the beach and use it as a horn to call the other survivors. They all meet up on a rock ledge with fallen trees, conveniently placed, for benches. Ralph is decided as leader and immediately appoints Jack as head of the hunters. They decide that the first thing they'll need is a fire as a signal in case any ships are nearby. Everyone runs off to get wood and eventually they create a huge bonfire. It gets out of control and burns down a good amount of the jungle. The hunters are requested to get food while the others build shelters. Everyone slacks off except Ralph, Jack, and Simon. Eventually Jack convinces everyone that Ralph being leader isn't going to work and they all turn on him. Ralph escapes into the jungle. The boys that stuck with Ralph and Ralph go to try and reason with Jack and his followers but they don't listen and start throwing spears at the others and once again, Ralph escapes, but this time by himself. He sprints to the beach and faints. When he wakes up, there's a British Officer standing above him and Jack and his followers come running out of the jungle. They all realize how they've turned into horrid monsters and cry. Then they all board the ship and are off to a civilized and safe location. I enjoyed reading Lord of the Flies. It was full of brave, sane, and strong boys. Though the boys were only 12 years and younger in age, they still formed a semi-civilized \\"government\\". There was also the twist where Jack pulls everyone away from Ralph and turn on him. One fact that I found interesting yet disturbing was that they started reverting to cannibalism to survive.Ralph was almost immediately chosen as leader and not surprisingly. He did find the conch and call everyone to a meeting and got them organized. Even of age 12, he was reasonably intelligent and also appointed other positions such as head of the hunters, Jack. Ralph did a great job and kept his sanity even when everyone began doubting whether or not they would ever be rescued. He kept them sane too, for the most part.When Jack convinced most of the boys that Ralph wasn't doing a good job being leader, I thought that Ralph would be thrown out of power, which he was, and he would be forced to obey Jack. Instead though, he kept some of the boys on his side including Piggy and tried to reason with Jack and the others. Because Jack was stronger than all of his followers and had better leadership skills, he made them run Ralph and Piggy off even if they had to kill them. Piggy was killed but Ralph escaped. Jack continued to pursue Ralph with the others. It was truly a surprising twist and made me want to read even more.The one thing that bothered me the most was that the boys reverted to cannibalism to survive because they couldn't catch any pigs on the island. It was mainly Jack's group that reverted to this though. All of Ralph's followers were subject to cannibalism while only Ralph escaped it.I was never bored with this selection and I would encourage all people that aren't disturbed by any of the facts that have been shown here to pick up Lord of the Flies and read it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a very enjoyable book. It is a book that you would enjoy reading if you like analyzing day-to-day life in your litature. The way Golding makes the boys on the island symbolize people and actions in the real world is what makes the book so good. I origianly thought the book was gooing to be boring and hard to catch on to but after I got into the book I wanted to know more about the characters and what was going to happen next. If you dont like putting yourself into your reading then you would not like this book. The plot in this story is always changing, because right when you thilnk something predictable is going to happen ,golding puts a spin on how they characters act or what their next action is going to be.

A boy by the name of Ralph is chosen to be their leader and he appoints Jack to be the leader of the hunters. Throughout the book the boys attempt ways to be found, many of them not working. There are basically four main characters in this novel, Ralph, Jack, Simon and Piggy. All of them have unique traits which lead to conflicts throughout the novel.A twelve year old boy by the name of Ralph is the chosen leader of the civilization. Throughout the book Ralph has to fend off the other boys attempt at his power. Jack, elected leader of the hunters by Ralph is the opposite of Ralph. Jack is a savage like boy that wants total power and will do whatever it takes to be at the top. Simon is said as the only naturally \\"good\\" character on the island. He is nice to all the younger boys on the island. Piggy is Ralph's \\"lieutenant\\" who is an innovative inventive child. His intelligence leads to the development of the Sundial, which the boys use to tell time. They are all given things to do in order to be found, some more challenging than others.The first thing Ralph wants the children of the island to do is start a signal fire. They use Piggy's eyeglasses to start the fire, but the fire quickly ignites the forest. When Ralph realizes that the Signal Fire is out he is upset at Jack. When Jack gets back from hunting he has caught something for the first time and Ralph's fury gets lost in the mix. Throughout the novel a conch shell serves as a symbol of power. Whoever has the conch shell controls everything; the kids, the island and most importantly the civilization. As the adventure goes on the little boys or the \\"littluns\\" are becoming terrified of being on the island.Later on in the novel the hunters go into the mountains of the island to look for monsters. The littluns are having nightmares about there being monsters on the island. From a distance the hunters see what they think is an ape hanging from a tree. It is really a parachutist that was killed hanging in a tree. A character by the name of Roger is beginning to become a factor at this point in the story. Roger is Jack's \\"lieutenant\\" and is just like Jack. Cruel and a savage type of boy. Sides between the groups of children are being formed. Jack's hunters versus Ralph's people. Roger rolls a boulder down a hill and kills Piggy and shatters the conch shell. In spite of all this fight between the groups a ship saw the fire that was started and arrived at the island. A British Naval Officer saves the children.If I had the choice to read this book again I would because it is a very good book. If you are the type of reader that likes adventure and not knowing what is going to happen then this is the book for you. At every point in this novel, you could just stop at the end of the chapter you had to keep reading. If I had to grade this novel on a scale of one to ten, I would give it a nine because it was a great book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book takes place in the middle of a furious war, with a plane evacuating a group of schoolboys from Britain is shot down over a deserted island. After the plane goes down the boys realizing they will be their for a while and set up a government. They also elect a leader and, make a plane to be rescued. They choose Ralph as their leader, and Ralph appoints Jack to be in charge of food.Ralph, Jack, and another boy, Simon , set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return, Ralph says that they should light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys ignite some dead wood by reflecting sunlight through the lenses of Piggy's eyeglasses. The boys are playing rather than monitoring the fire, and the fir engulf the forest. One of the youngest boys in the group disappears during the fire never returning, presumably having burned to death.One day a ship passes and, Ralph and Piggy notice, that the signals fire which, had been the hunters' responsibility to maintain has burned out. Furious, Ralph accosts Jack, but the hunter has just returned with his first kill. Piggy criticizes Jack, who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and scolds the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting, it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys, known as the littluns have had nightmares from, the beginning, and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally, asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea. Not long after the meeting, some military planes battle high above the island. The boys, asleep below, do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts down on the mountain. Sam and Eric are responsible for watching the fire at night, they are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up, they see the enormous shadow of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand, they rush back to the camp in terror. Jack and Ralph, travel up the mountain.. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office, but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach, calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire, this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey, but before they have finished, most of them have slipped away to join Jack.Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt of a pig a violent, slaughter followed by sowing the head to a stick as a offering to the beast. Later, encountering the bloody, fly-covered head, Simon has a terrible vision, during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice, says that Simon will never escape him, for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up, he goes to the mountain, where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist. Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the middle of a chaotic revelry when they see Simon's shadowy figure emerge from the jungle, they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day, while the others hunt him like an animal.. Ralph collapses in exhaustion after being chased out of the forest, but when he looks up, he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer's ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well.I enjoyed reading this book it was very interesting and had a lot of action in it. I liked how the ending began with the plane going down and the boys being stranded on the island. Another favorite part of the book was towards the end when all the boys break up and they are fighting.

It's a captivating story, with an intruiging plot that holds your attention throughout the story. It's about a group of British kids that are trapped on an island after their plane crashes. All the kids come together as a group and decide that Ralph should be the leader of the island. Ralph, with the help of his friend Piggy, decides that the island needs to have rules and regualtions. Jack Merridew is mad that he isn't voted as chief and at first is ok with it, but as the story continues he turns against Ralph. Jack is a hunter and starts a society of hunters on the other side of the island. I am not going to say much more but the plot is very intense and violent with many examples of hatred, and also death.

Everything seems fine on the island until they discover the body of a dead pilot and mistake it for a beast. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the TV show Lost.

The Lord of the Flies by William Golding is a great thriller that tells a story of how power can overcome a soul and how quickly horrible things can happen. After happiness and hope turn to violence, Ralph is left with no power and turned against by his friends and hunted down.I thought this book was incredible because of the characters and how they acted on the island. I began to wonder what it would be like to live on an island with forty other kids my age and no adults, I came to the conclusion that it would be terrible and it would be grand chaos. I would recommend this book to teenagers and adults over the age of twelve because it has very intense action and hard language for a small child to understand."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Imagine you are trapped on an island with a group of boys. What do you do? How do you survive?William Golding's novel \\"Lord of the Flies\\" was written in 1954. It is an action/adventure book about a group who suffer a horrific plane crash, and the boys are stranded on an island during the World War II era. The tale involves the struggle of power between two boys. Ralph is just your average male just looking for law and order. Jack on the other hand, is a constant slave to power.Just imagine what boys would do when stranded by themselves. One thing they do is paint their faces, and turn into savages. The book brings you on a journey of boys trying to survive, or will they just be boys and play, forgetting about the fight for survival?Golding shows us that everything has a good and evil side. The book does have its twists and turns and some things will surprise you. Despite all of the entertainment, I felt this book was very predictable. What else could you get in a story about people stranded on an island? This does not necessarily mean it is not a good book though. I guess you can only judge it by reading it for your self."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"With no parents, teachers, or rules, is there really any question as to why the characters in Lord of the Flies by William Golding had no mercy? The story is about a group of English boys on their way to boarding school when their plane gets shot down in the middle of World War II and end up stranded on an island. They try to form a society and govern themselves, but not long after, the boys are having chaos for breakfast and anarchy for lunch. The book reminds me of the movie Thirteen, only the male version. In Thirteen, the main character goes to shocking lengths to befriend the most popular girl in school. Before her mother knows it, she is powerless to rescue her daughter from a whirlwind of drugs, sex and crime). They both, I find, are not shocking at all. This is the way people today are, to say you were shocked is saying your living your life blind. Ralph is your typical guy in high school who is unsure of himself and just watches the bully pick on the little kid. Jack on the other hand is the jock/bully who everyone \\"admires\\", whether it is in fear or respect. Simon is the artsy type. He is out of the box and in his won world. Piggy, a very intelligent boy would be your \\"nerd\\" who stands up for what he believes in. The Lord of the Flies is a well written book full of truth. When you read the story, don't be disgusted.

A fat, bespectacled boy named Piggy tries to hold the group together, and uses his intelligence to work through the problems the group encounters.

It is so relevant today that it is hard to believe it is fifty years old. It depicts, in chilling detail, how civilization breaks down when a group of school boys, none over 12 years of age, are marooned on an island, with no adult supervision.It can be read as an allegory for adult society in which there is no responsible supervision, for example, when the government appoints people to head agencies who have no experience, like Brownie, or appoints people to agencies that the government wants to destroy, or when the government appoints a person to represent us in the UN and the person has said the UN should not exist. Does this sound familiar?However, this book first appeared in 1954. It is a work of art. It may be just an artistic description of some school boys slowly descending into a violent abyss of their own making.Either way, it is a disturbing book. It shows, clearly, how thin the veneer of civilization is, and what ugliness lies beneath that veneer.I have read this book twice and was disturbed both times. I think it is still relevant. And that relevance makes the book even more disturbing.An edition like this is a strong addition to any serious personal library."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the book Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, a plane crashes on a untouched island, and without adults, a group of boys will have to find a way to survive. The boys vary from the ages 10-15, this is important because the older boys control the group. The main character is basically the leader. His name is Ralph. Ralph is a very interesting character. He is smart, responsible, and he knows how to survive. Jack is one of the older boys too. Most of the conflict in the book is somehow is related to him. He is a great hunter and is very aggressive. Simon is the most responsible and is the smartest of the group. All of these characters play a big part in the book.The island plays a big part in there survival. It is filled with trees, fruits, and animals. The boys also speak of a beast. The island has a mountain where the boys create a flame that they hope will be spotted. In the book a place called Castle Rock is mentioned. It is an elevated place where a lot of important things happen. The island also has a lot of symbolic elements. It is where almost all of the symbolism is. Another important part is that the wild boar lives there, which is important for there survival.After reading the book, I thought it was thrilling and it had good elements that made it interesting. The elements of the story made it interesting which made me want to read on. The characters were twisted, and they always did something I didn't expect.

That includes, responsibilities, aggressiveness, knowledge, and much more. William Golding, aloud the readers to be able to see whats going on in the setting, for the very deceive details.The author,(William Golding) use lots of details and symbolism. Like for an example, the island that the boys are on represents, change and difference kinds of challenges. Another one is piggy glasses, they symbolize, freedom and wisdom. Personaliy i liked the setting. That took place on the island, and when the boys got together on to plan out their actions.If you like adventures and risk taking books, then I recommend that you read this book. I thought it was a great book and I would probable read it again in the future if I get a chance. You should read it too and then you'll think the same way!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This epic classic is one of the best reads of my life, and I've read a lot of books. When William Golding sat down to write The Lord Of The Flies, he never imagined the words he put down would be what is know one of the most known book titles from kids as young as eighth grade (in some cases younger.)In this book kids from ages 6-13 years are stranded on an uncharted island. These boys have no adults; life is good right? Read the book and find out.I personally like a set of twins Sam and Eric. These two do everything together, from duties to relaxing to finishing each other's sentences. These actions earn the boys the name Samneric. These characters do what they're told and can have a good time doing almost anything, even chores.This book is, however, highly controversial. What I mean is this book is full of symbolism. Some believe it has a hidden theme based on the bible, with a Christ figure and a satanic representation. Others believe this book is a representation of loss of innocence. People have done incredibly in depth analysises of the book; unfortunately, Mr. Golding is dead, so if (and hopefully when) you read this book you'll find some symbolism and draw your own conclusion.Although the chances are slim, this could potentially happen, but as I said not likely. I would hope that with all that has happened since Golding's time some sort of adult would be found and would have been able to keep some order.So, all in all, this book is a must read page-turner with quite a few insane twists. Although I must warn, the ending in my opinion could be better, but that doesn't even scratch my overall opinion of the book, which was, in a word, excellent."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book I found took a while to get into but had a good way of starting. I love the plot and how everything turns out at the end. The story starts of well but soon enough the children become scared because of the &quot;beast&quot;.The group is split into two. Ralph and Piggy end up by themselves and Jack and his tribe become a bit obbsessed with the beast. They are the hunters and almost become to caught up in being standed on the island and fending for themselves.They go to far and end up doing things that are quite shocking for anyone espeshally children. The group become to over the top and they end up just not caring about their old friends anymore.One of the main points in the book is the fire. They decide to make a fire and keep it going so that passing planes nad ships would be able to find them. When the fire is left to go out and a plane passes the island Ralph and Jack have the fight that almost leads to jacks death.The tribe and jack and piggy are always stealing and fighting and even when people get hurt and things are getting out of control. Alot of the book is very sad and it just shows you what could happen if people did get stranded on the island. Toward the end things are going crazy and before they find adults theey almost burn down the island trying to find Ralph.When the children suddenly become in contact with adults at the end again they act as if they have woken up from a very long dream. They start crying and everything hits them that has happened in the last few weeks. They tried to act like adults and make rules but things definatly didint go as smooth as im sure all of them wanted."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"After The Lord of the Flies I had lots of mixed feelings. This book had its good and bad points. There were a few times when i got really into the book, but a lot of points where i found myself dozing off or just not paying attention to a single word i read on the page.I really liked the begging of the book. It seemed like this could have possibly happen. The kids on the island formed a small society and create a form of government and a system like I believe anyone stranded on the island would be.As the book progressed i became more and more less interested in the book. The author wrote a lot of the same ideas over and over like jacks going on and on about hunting. GET THE IDEA, CAN WE GET ON WITH THE REST OF THE STORY!After a while i lost the sense of the characters actions being realistic. Jack forms a tribe that splits off of the rest of the kids. His tribe seems to be based on hunting and spilling blood. They start singing &quot;KILL THE BEAST! CUT HIS THROAT! SPILL HIS BLOOD!&quot; Which is the most random thing i can ever imagine anyone doing.Golding in my mind never actually explains how the kids survive. The kids just live you don't really hear about how they find the fruit or the water. None of the kids ever complains (except about mean over and over...) about things like sunburns or lack of food being cold, things you would expect from a bunch of young kids trapped on a tropical island in the middle of nowhere.Even though Golding does not address the main points in my mind, the points he does address he does very well. Ralph has a strong will to get rescued and him and piggy seem to be the only ones that are actually trying to get rescued. But Golding creates this beast that started out as just a nightmare into the kids killing each other because they are so paranoid. I wonder how the kids ever became so violent and bloodthirsty.All in all i didn't like the book. But for people who like a very fantastic and random story in no way could be true; you might like it. If you are looking to read a serious book about survival in the wild i suggest hatchet which is very good in describing the way a boy learns to live (emphasis on the learns). He does not just run around and kill things like the kids in LOTF."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read Lord of the Flies knowing it's a classic and for the most part I thought it was pretty good. It details the story of young boys stranded on an island after a plane crash. At first, the primary character of the novel, Ralph, heads the dictatorship that begins, but as time passes, Ralph comes to blow with Jack. Where Ralph sees the boys' primary concern being signaling a passing ship for help, Jack is concerned with hunting. So, two groups emerge with Ralph and Jack as the leaders. After that, some very dramatic and interesting happenings take place as the reader sees savagery and visciousness develop amongst the boys.The only real problem I had with the story was the lack of explanation about the boys. The novel starts after the plane crash has taken place and the author never offers an explanation for who these boys are or where they were going. Also, I found it somewhat unrealistic the way in which the boys seemed to get along so well on their own. They didn't seem nearly as frightened as I'd imagine boys would be in their place in reality.Overall, I say this book is worth reading if you're interested. It's not too long and has a pretty good story."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was amazed to find that so many people gave this book a bad review!

That is the way of nature.Humans may be the &quot;superior being&quot;, but we are all animals inside. We all have the primal feelings, and once we are taken out of civilized culture, our true nature begins to shine through. That is exactly what Golding explains and symbolizes in this breath-taking story.Anyone who gave this a bad review either does not comprehend the story and situation, or they are to wrapped up in the idea that humans are \\"too good\\" to turn cannibalistic or become murderers. Young BOYS, especially, have a certain \\"macho\\" aura, and they all have the obsessive need of being a leader. Those saying that this is \\"unrealistic\\" obviously have not had or been around children. There is nothing as simple or as cruel as a child."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is my favorite book. This chilling tale of human nature is one of the best books written. read it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is one fabulous book full of great themes, motifs, and symbols. Golding, although it is apparent that he really hates humanity and is a bitter man, is such a wonderful writer and makes this story come to life in more than one way. This book's reference to Christian Iconography is so great that it gives this story so much more depth. His symbols are also one thing that show us what human nature is really about and how it actually is.This book is about a group of choir boys that get stranded on an island during a war. They try to establish rule and order but eventually find themselves trying very hard just to stay alive while their hope for being rescued is floating off on the horizon. With all the adventures that show us what humanity is really like, this is one read that everyone should enjoy."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If you are a William Golding fan, or you desire a novel jam-packed with action and excitement from cover to cover, you will love Golding's most famous novel, Lord of the Flies. In this literary masterpiece, Golding takes an imaginative look at the life of young boys in an extraordinary situation: without rules, boundaries, or a defined social system. His boundless sense of imagination, and his unparalleled creativity allow him to form a lifelike environment in which the reader can capture a sense of reality on such a seemingly bazaar topic. Set on a small deserted tropical island, thickly wooded by rain a forest, and a harsh jungle, the boys often have trouble in their fight for survival. One may ask... How did the boys find themselves on this island?During a nuclear war, at an unspecified time in future, a plane carrying British schoolboys crash-landed, the boys found themselves alone and helpless. Golding did not set a specific time period in which the story takes place. By doing this, he allows us, the reader, to put the story in the time we desire - making it more enjoyable to its variety of readers. The boys had crash-landed on their new home; and few other people would ever believe the story of this place should the boys ever return to Britain one day to tell it. The perseverance, and leadership of a few twelve year olds, kept the majority of the six to twelve year old bys occupied and leading productive lives away from the civilization they were accustom to. William Golding tells the story of the boy's interminable stay on this otherwise - despondent piece of rock. Golding stresses their trials and tribulations on this undiscovered place, and how boys become savages when culture and pressure are not present in someone's life. The boys' primitive instincts reared their ugly heads while they were living on the island - they had never lived in such a way ever before. .The novel begins with two boys, Ralph and \\"Piggy\\", who at first are alone - no other boys are present. They are looking at the destruction of the jungle caused by the rough descent of their plane. Eventually the boys begin to congregate. Showing a great sense of maturity, Ralph takes charge - and assesses their situation. The boys range from six to twelve years old, and at first it seems like there is no way to keep order. Ralph decides that they are going to run their island as a democracy - the boys vote to keep Ralph as their leader, though many of the boys stay loyal to Jack. A few of the biguns (or older boys) were fighting for control of the island. Jack, another boy of twelve, rivals Ralph for leadership throughout the novel - Jack quickly becomes the leader of the hunters. Previously, a group of choirboys, the hunters became a savage faction. They collected pigs and other forms of meat for the boys to eat in addition to their regular diets of berries.Ralph, despite Jacks competition, was able to maintain control of most of the boys for the better part of the story. His own minor digressions into savagery however, put his leadership into question - and Jack eventually took control of the island. Golding's last fifty pages, depict an island in utter chaos. His satiristic attitude of the adult world, mock the political and militaristic disputes in our world now. He shows how a small group of boys can sum up our entire society with both political rivalries, and groups battling each other for control. Lord of the Flies is a great novel! William Golding really struck gold on this one! Take a journey unlike any other - a planeload of preteens, lost on an uninhabited island. A fight of their own accompanies their fight for survival on this small-unknown isle. Will they ever get off?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies, lucidly written by William Golding, tells of the terror and adventure that befalls a misfortunate group of young boys. The story takes place in the future at the outbreak World War III, which the author predicts will occur. The first page of the novel describes two of the main characters, Ralph and Piggy, exploring a jungle on the island where they had just crash-landed, discussing their plane crash. Ralph, Piggy, and a plane full of other children are headed to an orphanage-like facility when their jet goes down on an uninhabited, tropical island. For the rest of the novel, the fate of the surviving boys will become the author&#65533;s main focus.Ralph and Piggy gather the boys on the island. Ralph, being a natural leader, creates basic rules for the children to follow and a strategy for survival and rescue. Immediately, one of the older boys, Jack, is highly confrontational with Ralph and his authority. Ralph&#65533;s main priority as chosen leader is to build a signal fire that will continuously produce smoke in order to get the attention of passing ships. Ralph and Piggy do their best to maintain order, law, and a functioning community. Jack and many others no longer wish to be part of Ralph&#65533;s tribe, with all of the rules, jobs, and responsibilities. Jack becomes chief of this own tribe and incessantly harasses Ralph. The two warring clans are forced to deal with one another and well as a mysterious beast that lives on top of the island&#65533;s mountain. Throughout the book, all of the characters face both external and internal conflicts.In the first chapter of Lord of the Flies the setting of the story is meticulously described. While reading Golding&#65533;s portrayal of the island&#65533;s climate, I almost felt sweaty and fearful of poisonous jungle creatures. Golding is an expert in the art of showing the idea he is expressing, not literally telling the reader.&#65533;[The boy with fair hair] had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him&#65533;the jungle was a bath of heat. He was clambering heavily around the creepers and broken trunks&#65533; (page 7).I extremely enjoyed reading this novel. It is psychologically fascinating, providing a rarely discussed insight to the savagery of the human mind. This is not a light read; rather it is a book to seriously read two or more times in order to fully appreciate it.There is a clear connection between Lord of the Flies past and current tribal warfare, political factions, even the business world. Another similarity between this book and reality can be found in adolescent social situations. In many schools several group leaders emerge and compete for students to follow them. When this struggle occurs in schools, it is of course not as violent or blatantly aggressive. It also does not result in deaths, with the exception of a few rare occasions.William Golding&#65533;s Lord of the Flies is timeless and a tremendous read. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the human mind, or is just looking for a book that stays with you long after you have put the novel down."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Unlike the book \\"Robinson Caruso\\", or the movie \\"Castaway\\" where they need to rely on supplies they have to gather from the wreckage of a boat or a plane to survive, the island in which these children are stranded on is a small Garden of Eden. Like the biblical Eden, man is once again shown to be imperfect and filled with original sin. The boys live on an island where it seems they have no worries. Fruit is available in plenty. The weather is great. There are no predators except themselves. Their fall from grace then comes when all this is shown to be not enough for them, and they kill a mother pig for meat. There is no god, or devil on this island however, only man. Ralph represents the good in man. The descriptions of him are even godlike or golden, but Ralph is just a man (or boy). Jack is described as the devil, but once again he is just a depiction of the worst of what is in man. Simon and Piggy who represents man's wisdom fall in-between these other two individuals representing man himself, and both are flawed and killed. The \\"Beast\\" which the children are afraid of first takes on the form of a serpent or snake and later the form of a \\"Great Ape\\" up on the mountain, but in each case the real danger comes from within however, as man is the one shown to have a heart of darkness. When Simon talks to the \\"Lord of the Flies\\" it is all explained. \\"Fancy thinking the beast was something you could hunt and kill!\\", \\"You knew didn't you? I'm part of you? Close, close, close!\\". They can't hunt and kill the beast because they are the beast. There is also no salvation. When the children ask for a savior, or sign, what they are given was a dead Man (paratrooper). It is all man. This is not a book of hope. Even in the end when the children are rescued there is still no hope, as the naval officer who rescues them is still just part of a greater war between men, and the Garden of Eden they leave behind has been turned into their own hell filled with fire. I believe William Golding uses a lot of psychology in this book and each image takes on a deeper meaning. It is not known how long the children are on the island, so it seems kind of timeless. The number of children is also vague, which I think is deliberate. They are also at times faceless children. I thought it was wonderfully written and deserves to be listed as one of the best books ever written. Even if it is a little depressing, it made me think."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This novel has become a hoary old standard of high school literature classes, but it deserves everyone's attention. In it Golding brilliantly develops the stranded childrens' point of view, enlarging it to the scale of a mythic struggle between civilization and savagery. Don't be put off by this grandiose theme: each of the main characters is a sharply drawn individual even as he represents an idea, and the prose is stunning--a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought Lord of the Flies was a pretty good book. I felt there were quite a few changes the author could have made to the story. There was a lot of symbolism and many British terms I didn't understand, making the book a little confusing at times. I also disagree with how Golding killed off the littlun with the birthmark, Simon, and Piggy. I thought there was just something wrong about killing off three young children in such a violent manner but I also think it was needed to make a very strong point about how you may think that you know a person but on the inside they could be someone totally different.There were some good aspects of the book. I liked the way the author described the environment the boys were in. It was very thorough and it gives you a good understanding of the conditions they are living in and a good mental image with out going into too much detail. I also thought it was interesting how Golding divided the boys into two separate societies. I felt it demonstrated the two sides of society very well. It shows that on the surface society seems organized and well-governed but sometimes underneath it all people can be savage, cruel, and sadistic to one another.Overall I felt that this book was well written and unlike most books I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading and understands symbolism."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies takes place on a small deserted island where a plane full of young boys has crashed. It is about the obstacles that the boys overcome on this island without adults, and how their different characters and ideas clash. The main characters are Ralph, Jack and Piggy. Ralph is the appointed leader who is constantly challenged by Jack who believes he is important because he was the choir leader at school. Piggy is unaccepted by everyone except Ralph who sees Piggy's intelligence. This book is about how a group of boys behave with no adults and no rules.A significant moment in this book is in the first chapter when Ralph blows the conch shell and all of the boys come to him. This moment shows the power of the conch shell and the power it gives to someone who blows it. This is important because power and power struggles are definitely apparent in this book.I would recommend Lord of the Flies to people who enjoy books about children trying to survive without any adults. Also people who like to read books which show some of the extremes humans can go when there is no one in control. I would suggest people who don't like graphic descriptions of violence not to read some scenes in this book. I personally found the book to be a bit of a slow read, and sometimes the descriptions got really long, thus making the book rather boring.I feel that the author, William Golding, of Lord of the Flies is a good author. Because he uses so much description of the boys, the island, and of the boys' actions it is very easy to visualize what is happening. Also he writes in such a way that it makes the book seem real, like this really happened. Lord of the Flies is a very well written book. For me the mark of a good writer is making it possible for me, the reader, to connect to the book, and characters. So I feel that Lord of the Flies is very well written."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding wrote a good book contrasting two types of war. Boys are stranded on an island after a plane crash. They are challenged to face a number of opsticals, including death. The time set is during WWII."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Yet another book suffering from the &quot;classic-itis&quot; syndrome. Golding presents an intriguing premise and utilises provoking themes of savagery versus civilization, but he writes in such an uninspired and drawn-out manner that it's extremely difficult to truly absorb oneself into the narrative. Every character was flat and unlikeable in at least one way; the only one that came close to gaining my interest was one I pitied, and I deeply dislike piteous characters.I am female, and I have usually never minded any lack of prominent female roles in books or films. The way Golding uses the female here, though, is half-baked and somewhat insulting. As well, while I don't mind symbolism if it's varied and carefully used, there is only really one large symbolic theme in this book, and I found it rather elementary and fumbled.I don't mind gore either -- among my favourite books is All Quiet on the Western Front, and despite its skewered view, one of my favourites movies is the hyperrealistic Black Hawk Down -- but the gore here has almost no emotional value at all and simply disgusts.The closing paragraphs are the only parts that came close to being interesting, if just for the symbolic contrast it provided. Even then, however, because Golding for me had built no tension or suspense whatsoever up to it, it merely showed how silly the entire affair and its participants were, and almost made me laugh despite the apparent gravity that was involved.It may have been all the enthusiasm around it from other readers, but even so, William Golding's &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is one of the worst &quot;good&quot; books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the book Lord of the Flies, the author William Golding shows the reader what it would be like to be stranded on a deserted island. This book is for thinkers that like peering into the savage part of our nature. Besides, it's about seriously messed up half naked British boys.

I guess when you pick apart every syllable and say it means something profound then it does. As for a plot that means anything or charecters that make the slightest bit of sense well lets just forget that.At best you have a harrowing tale about kids being trapped on an island losing their identify here the become a mycocausum for different types of society.

It was a favorite for most of the students in my class so I decided to give the novel another try and I'm glad I did...I read this book a second time very quickly as I was intrigued by everything that went on in LOTF and I learned a valuable lesson in that if you don't come together in a time of need you will suffer and also that we sometimes fear what will happen and fear to help others so we are classified as &quot;beasts&quot; I found something valuable the second time I read this novel rather than the first go around...Do read this book..I think you will enjoy it and get a lot from it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This was A book of choice I had chose for a book report in my histoy class.

But I did however, like the description of the platform, with the green water and reflection on the plam leaves. But They way he described the kids,i don't know their faces, and that whole skinny dipping scene and that they're all boys on the island- the way he kept descripbeing them, every detail of there looks- sounded kind of quer to me.--I'm sorry, no offense.

Ralph &quot;the boy with fair hair&quot; is made chief instantly as the others prefere his easy going ways to the angry and arrogant Jack . As time goes on Ralph has no one keeping to the rules , only simon is helping . Jack hunts and starts getting more people to agree with him at the fact that he should have been the leader . Jack is a great dictator so this works marvolusly . Jack does not like everyone though , he is mean to piggy as piggy is weak , he has asma and glasses . Jack feels no sympathy whatsoever towards piggy though . Soon Jack lures the boys away from Ralph and piggy and simon ( the democracy ) to his group of wild savages . If the boys have no leader , and when Ralph starts to nag like a parent the follow the one they see as strong even if the morals are wrong . Alot like how the germans followed hitlar long ago . The inocence these children had is dead when they start getting exited about killing , they have nothing to do on the island so getting exited about killing makes them want to do it more . They end up complete savages and when they are all hyped up after a dance at a feast and simon appears out of the dark the group of savages all pounce on him &quot; they were no words just the sound of claws and teeth tearing flesh &quot; . The children later hunt Ralph and Ralph does not know what hes done so wrong to be hunted , the fact is he is different and so if someone standed out they would be hunted or killed then and there . Ralph is the innocence and reason in the island so was piggy and simon they all still had a concience . The others were won over by savagery . At the end when they are all faced with what the most important thing was and they had forgotten it , rescue . They all think about what they have just done . The actual fact that they had killed people , and it could have been them too . Ralph thinks and &quot; weeped for the end of innocence and for dear wise friend Piggy &quot; . I agree totally that the point of this is exploring the boundary beetween human reason and animal instinct . This was written when a war was on though so the author thought evry one , when put in the cercumstances would be that violent and savage . It may not be so . This was written to make people think very deeply about reason and how awful people can be when in a horrible situation like that of in lord of the flies . And by the way if your wondering what the lord of the flies is , its a dead pigs head on a stick which the children gave to &quot;the beast &quot; as a sactafice , it later in the book tells Simon that there is no beast , they are the beast basically . And simon who had the intellect and understanding of the savagery and the beast now had the laguage to express and describe it to the others , when he found this out he ran to the others to tell them . Unfortunatly &quot;the beast and evil in the children&quot; got to him first ."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"\\"Lord of the flies\\"The book in the beginning was interesting but when i reached the part when they go after ralph and piggy and try to get them,that's what i didn't undrstand.

While it might have some important messages and symbolism, it is all buried too deep between the lines. It projects the problems of society onto a group of boys plane wrecked on an abandoned island; in the beginning they all attempt to survive and use the resources that are available, but as they continue to be marooned on the island, their little society becomes corrupted as they become violent and manipulative. The multiple plots, many characters, and headache-inducing descriptions all made this book tedious and unpleasant to read, especially since I had to do so unwillingly for school. I found the fact that the author had to use symbolism for every point he wanted to make, such as the boys turning into monsters, and the pig's skull, got really tiring and boring to read. While this book is considered a classic and I suppose it has its relevancy after all these years, I would not reccomend wasting your time on it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the flies is an amazing book.

I agree with his message because there is a point in everyone's day, or life that their true beast comes out. The best literary elements that Golding uses were foreshadowing and symbolism. He uses symbolism the best in the way he used Piggy's glasses to reveal a sign of vision. Not just eye-sight but the sight of seeing things clearly. Piggy was the only one on the island that had a clear vision of life and he was also able to see that rules are needed in life for things to work out and for there not to be any serious conflicts. L.O.F. is a very realistic book because if any number of people were stranded on an island without any rules there would be absolute chaos. People would be power hungry like Jack. There would be a few people that thought that rules were neccessary to survive, like Piggy.They would eventually turn into worrying about themselves, and getting only what they need to survive in life.

Most teenagers thought it was stupied, but you got to remeber that, that is how life is, there is good and bad people, most peoples like the bad people because they make life seem easyer.

It's SO simple, yet the real meaning behind it is complexed and shows how our own mortal sin looks beautiful but leads to destruction. The fears of the island are their own fears.

In Golding's Lord of the Flies he handled the characters the best. The characters were all well developed and each one represented a different aspect of human nature: Ralph was leadership, Piggy was intelligence , Simon was spirituality , Jack was dictatorship , Roger was evil and Samneric represented the fact that everyone needs someone to help them function. Lord of the Flies was a little unbelievable in the plot aspect of the book. Twelve year olds wouldn't believe in democracy. Also the whole island seemed kind of unreal and fake like it was just a backdrop. I think the plot was less than perfect and could have been developed a little more. All in all, I would give this book 3 stars."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding is an exquisite writer. He uses symbolism to describe the fact that there is evil in everyone. He also uses symbolism to describe fear and anger. He provokes the mind to think that they are in the story by using descriptions. Although some aspects of this book were unbelievable, it could happen. I personally see only two flaws in the book. The first being that everything needs to be more innnocent in the beginning so that when drastic changes come they are extremely drastic. The second being that the book goes very slowly, almost too slowly. However, overall it was an excellent book. I enjoyed reading Lord of the Flies."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think that the author's purpose for writing this book was to tell how to survive in the world/forest without adult supervision. I agree, because the boys would have needed to learn how to survive without supervision sooner or later in their lifetime. In this book I think that the author used climax best, because it got extremely intense as it got closer to the end of the book. I liked the intenseness in the book a lot. This book was believable to me. It was believable because the events that took place, really could have happened. The only thing that could not have taken place was that an airplane was attacked, than crashed and no adults survived any of it. I also think that the book was less than perfect. It was good writing and good reading. I rate this book fair."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think that Golding was trying to tell his readers that there is a need for rules and civilization.I agree with Golding because if there were no rules or guidelines to abide by then people would go crazy and we would end up in total chaos.I think Golding's best literary element in Lord of the Flies was his characters he created. Each person was very different from each other. I think it could be believable because without a set of rules or regulations people would act the way the boy's acted in the book.I think the book was fine.I just would've changed some of the beginning so it wouldn't drag as much as it did."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The author wanted to show you the lost of innocence. I agree with the author because the boys were so innocent in the beginning but as time goes bye that soon changes. The author best handled symbolism. For example, the conch represented authority and Piggy's glasses represented nearsightedness. These symbols helped me understand the book. The book wasn't believable because I don't think that a bunch of boys ranging from the ages of 5 and 13 can really survive on an island all by themselves. I think the author shouldn't have Piggy and Simon die in such a cruel way. If I had a choice I would've let them live and I would've had Ralph and Jack become friends again.Overall, I thought the book was good."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The sequence of events throughout the story were very well designed through the way of Golding's description abilities. Sure, sometimes it does become annoying and you lose your place a lot, or you can't understand what's going on or who's doing what. Yet, it was still good. The book was, though, within the greater whole, a well written believeable piece. Some of what happened could happen and some of if really isn't that believable. Yet, with how well Golding described it as if he was actually seeing it, that helped get the effect of it being real. Also, none of us really know what would happen if we got stranded on an island. So we don't know how true or untrue the whole actions of the situation are. Some people might agree or not with what all I have said, because everyone interprets things differently, but this is what I think"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This novel is about a group of boys stranded on an island due to a plane wreck. Everything starts out ok with everyone getting along and helping each other survive.

That doesn't mean that it wasn't a good book because I thought this book was great."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I really enjoyed William Goldings novel Lord of the Flies. It was adventurous, tragic, and very convincing.

Lord of the flies is a book that reflects the behavior of humans when trying to adapt into a primordial environment. The main characters in this book are Jack and Ralph, and a group of schoolboys that get stranded on a deserted island after their plane crashes. Ralph takes over and gives rules to the other boys, trying to keep order, sort of like a society created from scratch. Jack, on the other hand, becomes almost caveman-like, trying to impose his own Darwinian rule over the other boys. It seems as though his only rule is that there are no rules, and everyone that wants to survive must learn to fight for everything that they have. I think that one of the biggest fears that humans have in our consumer society today is not really death, but being left to fend for themselves with no televisions, or jobs, or cars, or restaurants. I think that the movie \\"the Blair witch project\\" tries to deliver the same sort of general madness that people experience when they are left out on the fringes of \\"normal\\" society. People go insane when they find themselves in a situation where there is nothing to do but try to survive, pretty much like an animal. It's sort of like a reversion back to our original instincts which couldn't have been all that different from animals: eat, sleep, and procreate. I think that Goldwing developed a good and interesting story showing different aspects of our own personalities exemplified by different characters. Jack is one aspect, of course the side of us that wants calmness and order. Ralph is the opposite side of the coin, while Piggy just wants simple pleasures, without concern for order or for savage instincts. In conclusion I recommend this book to people that are interested on drama and moral complexity. It is not a book for the faint hearted or people looking for a straight forward story of good and bad."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Good read, shows how out of control 'rational' thought can become in the face of mob mentality. A lesson we should learn, but seldom do."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It is my understanding that this book is widely read in middle and high schools across this country by who I can only assume are impressionable children. My critique of this book is also a bit of advice I offer to the teachers of our youth. Don't go half-way with this book. Golding has done an astouding job depicting the seed of evil that has been planted in every human being since the Garden of Eden slip up. Tell the children who the Lord of the Flies is. But, be careful... This is a very serious book that could have a positive or negative impact on a child. I'm sure that the movie KIDS (written by Harmony Korine) would never be shown in a high school classroom, but really, this book and that movie drive at the same ideas. I'm only asking teachers and administrators to keep this in mind when they decide to make Golding a part of their curriculum, because it would be a perversion of classic literature to water down Golding's dark portrayal of human nature...."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a novel that could have only been written in the 20th century, the century of unparalleled horrors in which humanity can no longer delude itself with the optimistic ideas of progress that so entranced the 19th century.

At first, it took much time to figure out the symbolism Golding was expressing. In the beginning it was extremely hard to for me to follow. I found myself quite dumbfounded at times when their were hidden meanings behind the plot. Without my teachers explanation I wouldn't have been able to get through the novel and understand it like I should. I enjoyed the characters, the each came to life by Golding's description's, and their actions and behavior. I thought it was intresting, that a &quot;beastie&quot; can be imaginary, and hidden inside one's self. However, even though I was complexed, when reading the novel's resolution it clicked, and I was at once understanding the book. I am enamoured by the novel's theme; at any age, their is always a seed of evil inside of you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"We did not think that the book was very good because up unitl the last few chapters it was soooooooo boring.

It shows us that no matter how young, or old you may be you still have that seed of evil hidden inside of you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"&quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot; is a parody of RM Ballantyne's &quot;The Coral Island&quot;. The latter is an uplifting Boy's Own adventure story that shows that even in adversity well brought up young boys can still behave like gentlemen. By contrast, the Lord of the Flies chronicles the disentegration of civilised values as, freed from adult or parental supervision, the shipwrecked boys degenerate into savagery. Piggy and Ralph are the two voices of reason. After the brutal death of Piggy, Ralph is isolated and has to use his wits just to survive. The novel can be read on several levels. It is a modern parable and a frightening reminder that just below society's civilised veneer are darker forces."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was ok. I must admit that i was really bored at the beginning. It became more interesting towards the end of the book.

This book has a lot of moral but it takes time to like it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding does an excellent job in conveying man's essential illness in this book.

I LOVED this book!! I read it in my own free time and not for school, perhaps that is why I liked it.

The ending was pretty good - if you could understand it. Everyone who said that it was a dumb ending just didn't understand what the author was trying to convey.

I'd recommend this book to people in the age group of 12-16."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is rather controversial; it is well-written, so much that people who disagree with Golding's themes loathe it with a passion, and others are entranced with an equal passion -- I was one of the latter.

Some of the events,such as the pig hunts,are very descriptive and thought provoking,it makes you feel as though you are there.

The best writing can be found only in the segments discussing the scenery. I thought the idea of the book was great but some of the analagies made are somewhat unrealistic. Although people do become crazy (especially 12 year-old boys) the characters in the novel were extremes of each stereotype. Ralph was far too angry and it is realitively unrealistic to find an utter satist like Roger, going to a private catholic school. I thought the best part of the book was the symbolism. The book is reasonably OK but extremely overated. If anyone is interested in a female and more racy version of the same sort of book I recomend &quot;John Dollar&quot;."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"While reading this book, I found that I couldn't put it down!

This is exactly how a group of British boys became when their plane crashed on to a deserted island during a war. This book explains about the possible nature of humans when they are put in a different habitat and are given a choice between life or death. The Lord of the Flies is a book that keeps you hanging till the end and keeps you guessing on whether or not this is what humans are really capable of. This is one of the most thrilling, suspenseful book that situates you through the eyes of the characters and makes you second guess on whether or not the boys will be saved. If you are looking for a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat, Lord of the Flies has it all.This book takes you through the eyes of Ralph, the protagonist, Piggy, the one that is always teased, Simon, the quiet and shy one, Roger, the sadistic boy, and Jack, the antagonist. Throughout the story these 5 boys play a main part to the roles of human nature. The setting takes place during the time of a nuclear war where a plane crashes towards a marooned island and a group of boys find themselves stuck on it. With the pilots dead and no radio signal for help, these boys try to govern themselves to act as a proper \\"community\\". As connections within to group start to become closer, the plan becomes disastrous. The government began to crumble, plans turn into chaos, and the boys are forced to split. As Ralph and Piggy wanted a peaceful, orderly government, Jack thirsted for power and dominance and that was when the other boys were forced to choose between the two.William Golding was a British novelist and Nobel winning author who wrote many novels but he is best known for his novel Lord of the Flies. Golding's unique style of writing has captured a magnificent story that shows what a world could be if it was civilized and what it could be if it was full of chaos and destruction. Apart from his writing, he went around learning and becoming a schoolmaster, lecture, actor, and a musician. His ideas that formed the novel Lord of the Flies came from his own personal experience when he had to migrate out of Britian to an island because there was a D-Day invasion. That was what gave Golding the idea to write the novel where he envisioned the war as Jack where it wasn't civil and peaceful and the life before and after as Ralph, civilized and in order.Lord of the Flies has made many impressions but what made this book stand out from the rest was its theme behind the text. Between humanity and the insight about life without society, Lord of the Flies has it all. William Golding created a book that left me feeling awed in the end and he struck me as an amazing writer. Lord of the Flies will never cease to amaze me, it's a picture perfect book and it will always be the book I will turn to when I'm stuck in a stuffy room with nothing to do."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I love how my perception of this book has changed over the course of 15 years. When I first read it, I thought the characters barbaric and unreasonable. At 16 I had never left the United States. After traveling much of the world and seeing the reality of what *jungle* island living is first hand, the actions of the stranded boys feel more justifiable. Perhaps it is one too many viewings of Survivor, but in a stranded situation would you hold your cool? Would Wilson really have made it though Castaway if he had been human instead of volleyball? Maybe if he was family, but starvation causes even the best of us to lose total control of our id. Freud would agree, even a well trained mind gives into instinct."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Long before \\"Survivor\\" or other reality shows that requires the elimination of its \\"contestantants\\", there was a masterful book written- \\"Lord of the Flies\\".More than an interesting book, it provokes thoughts and discussions on an elusive topic of human behavior or misbehavior. Evil usually occurs by its presence but it occurs when good is absent. How would you react in a desert island with other people? Would you do anything to survive even at the cost of other lives? How do you make the spirit of cooperation overcome the dispirit of competition?\\"Lord of the Flies\\" has been required reading for many middle-schoolers and high-schoolers. More important than the story itself is the theme of how would humans behave to survive.

What I really like about Lord of the Flies is the psychological aspect of the interaction between the boys and later on the planned and reasoned speeches and conversations of the lead character, Ralph. Golding does a great job of keeping the reader on the edge making this novel one of the best psychological thrillers, in addition to making a statement on the human condition."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book actually came in a day early, which was awesome.

I would definitely order from here again."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies is a book full of symbolism and personifications. It's a book that requires your full attention and it not something you can just skim over and be done within a day. Everything and everyone in this story is a symbol of a more complex idea. Roger isn't just \\"bad\\" or \\"mean\\", he's sadistic and a representation of evil in its purest form. Take Jack for example: He's a person who uses power for the benefit of himself not the whole community, in other words, a dictator. But on a more serious note, he represents how in the wild, characteristics a person has, are more pure; The rules of society that had tamed and controlled these malicious attributes (Or in Simon's case: Good-natured) are now absent, and that pronounces and extremes these qualities. That is why I like the Lord of the Flies. It makes you mull over every event and pondering on what William Golding is trying to show or tell us. It really is an extraordinary book that captures the essence of after the abandonment of civilization, how sometimes humans' greatest enemy is themselves."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Omg!!!

Would their personalities and mind-sets change? &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; helps readers see how people change when they have no rules and no structure in life. When a group of boys is stranded on an island, they learn who their friends are and how to survive from those that aren't.William Golding makes readers realize how cruel kids can be to each other and when they are on there own, in a sense, become like animals. The boys start by working together but end up splitting into two groups, therefore becoming enemies. The foil between characters enlightens the reader to realize the difference between the personalities of the boys. The boys' situations connect with their personalities and their sense of friendship and magnify their need for survival."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Rings, Lord of Chaos--two of my favorite fantasy novels. Lord of The Flies--a nigh-perfect book. You can see it on three levels: adventure story, character study, or a political level, and it has something for everybody. It isn't for the faint of heart, definitely, but it is still an incredible book. If you don't read this book, you're missing out on one of the most amazingly symbolic, wonderfully written books of all time--even more so because of the simple narrative. My favorite scene was the part with Simon and the pig's head--but let's not spoil anything for you! Pick it up and read it! It's a quick read and you won't regret it unless you still cringe everytime you see Saving Private Ryan... OK, maybe even then, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Just as Conrad's work &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; does, Golding's &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; reveals to the reader the human soul's tendency to change to the primordial or primitive self. I think that Golding's use of children as the main characters in the novel is helpful in conveying this message. The children's refusal to follow Ralph stems from the nature of children, in that they found no excitement or satisfaction from following him and his rules. Ralph's maturity resembled that of grown-ups, which children revolt against. On the other hand, Jack's group offered as an incentive more childish excitement in paiting themselves, hunting and ceremonies. We, as the reader, can see the children's folly in following Jack, but they are unable to think rationally due to their immature natures and new-found freedoms. Using children, Golding tries to symbolize the essential qualities in every human's soul and reveal something to the reader about him or herself."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Like many readers, I first heard about this book in an L.A course in school. I chose to read it for a novel project. The title of the book made me curious as to what it was really about. The first couple of chapters are boring and confusing, so you'll probably have your doubts about it being a good book. As you read on, you'll begin to understand what has happened and you'll agree how William Golding's symbolic meanings are awesome. The ending of the is best and I'm glad I read it. You'll be too! It's definately a five star book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"one of the all time greats. this book is so haunting, and horribly ugly at times, you will feel filthy reading it. some of the actions that the characters do, are startling, but you will find yourself thinking that if you were in the same situation, what would you do? it will challenge all of your misconceptions about this book and others like it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A group of boys crash onto a deserted island without the supervision of adults. They quickly begin to form their own governments. One of the boys, Jack, represents a tyrannical dictator, who rules by the emotional responses he gets from the other boys. He also rules by charisma and fear. Instead of devoting his energy to attempts of rescue, Jack prefers hunting and killing the wild pigs that also live on the island. Ralph, on the other hand, represents a less effective, yet good-hearted democratic leader. Slowly, his group of boys is swayed away from him by Jack's fun-loving wild clan. The climax of the book begins when Jack feels Ralph is a true threat to him, and orders his boys to hunt, and kill him. Finally, just before he would have been captured, Ralph is rescued by a group of sailors who were attracted to the island by a fire Jack had set to smoke Ralph out of hiding, and he is saved. This book really is interesting if you delve into the proposed psychological implications about our political society that Golding is making. If you just want to read it as an exciting novel it is good too, though."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies is a good and well-written book which I came to know while reading Stephen King's Hearts In Atlantis.

The book is very believable in that you can get stranded in an island during the middle of the war. Also because of the different themes in the book. The author handled writing symbolism best, because you can understand each character. For example, Simon is a symbol for spirtuality. And Piggy is a symbol for reason. I think the author's purpose for writing this book is to show how you can lose your innocence. I agree with the authors message. Although the book was great, the book was less than perfect in that it had too much drastic description about the killing of the pigs."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is one of those books that would have been written whether Golding had done it or not. And it is one of the best books you could ever choose to read. Note what other people on this site are finding wrong with the book: it's boring, it's not exciting until the end--one reviewer hadn't even finished the book. Be advised: thrillers don't win Nobel prizes for literature. Many people fail to understand: this book is not a thriller written before it was cool. People with a grain of human intelligence will see this book for what it really is: a thundering moral masterwork. Golding explains that the sum moral state of any human community cannot exceed the moral state of its weakest member; a bad apple spoils the lot. The symbolism--from the beast to the Lord of the Flies himself--is breathtaking, and the final irony of the ending so perfect that, when you finally understand the significance of it, you'll laugh ruefully. If you like books for the right reasons, you'll love Lord of the Flies.And finally, to clear up a small point, the title doesn't derive from a misinterpretation of the Hebrew word for &quot;devil.&quot; The Hebrew word &quot;Beezlebub,&quot; which occasionally is assigned to the devil, means, literally translated, &quot;the lord of the flies.&quot; There you have it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was shocked by this book and dont think that it deservs the accolades that has been given.

I didn't like the way that many of the kids went crazy. I know you are stranded on a deserted island but i don't believe that you would just go crazy like that. I know that being on an island like that would probably make you alittle crazy, but not enough to brutally kill two of your peers. They all knew that in order to be survive, they needed to maintain order. I don't believe they would just betray their elected leader just to have some fun. As for the characters, I like Ralph. He handled himself well in the situtation. I did his best to maintain as much order as he could. You could tell that Ralph was had the potential for a good leader. Jack on the other hand, I did't like. At first he seemed like he was a nice kid but then he turned on Ralph and formed his own tribe. I couldn't believe when kids actually followed him. Then he got everyone to turn on Ralph who was just trying to keep order on the island. At one point Ralph gives in to Jack and goes to have a feast with him. They then kill Simon because they thought it was the monster running down the beach. Jack just made things out of control with his new tribe. He turned everyone into killers. I like Piggy for one reason, because he was the only one to stay with Ralph. This eventually got him killed, but he was loyal to the leader that he elected. Beside that he was that great of a character. He seemed like he would get on your nerves after awhile. Thats mainly the reason I didn't like his character that much. The ending of the book was horrible. I was expecting something more to happen than for them to just get rescued. That is the main reason i didn't like this book"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"\\"This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force.\\"-Dorothy Parker.

I think the author had a great idea on his hands when he decided to write this. Perhaps the author had trouble getting it on paper? I know some of my classmates feel the same when I say it wasn't as well-written as it could have been. I'm not saying he didn't use big enough words! He was extremely wordy, and a little too descriptive at times. I have nothing against words, as I love books myself. But, there was a point in the book (and I don't want to spoil this for people who haven't read it,) where he discussed things about blood staining sand, and the beast being dead, and 3 pages later which were FULL of description, we see, &quot;and Simon's dead body drifted out to sea,&quot; or something very similar. And all he would have needed was that last sentence! He didn't NEED 4 pages of blood and gore! But, alas. It isn't like we can have all the books turn out how we want them. My English teacher saw me with a book by Tolkien, &quot;The Silmarillion,&quot; and she said,&quot;No Tolkien until after 'Lord of the Flies!'&quot; Well, I've had enough of &quot;Flies.&quot;No more 'Lord of the Flies'!What I need is 'Lord of the Rings'!Sincerely,A total book worm who breathes for Fiction Fantasy."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's implication that &quot;painted niggers&quot; and &quot;savages&quot; represent the darkest aspect of human nature reeks of the worst imaginings during the European colonial days.

I love the way he showed how sociaty would be without government or rules!

LOF was an excellent novel and allegory. Ralph symbolized law, order, and democracy, Piggy represented knowledge, truth, and morality, Jack symbolized anarchy, brutality, and destruction, and Simon showed spirituality and insight. Everything in the book showed some aspect of society. Even though it was written in 1954, it is still very valid today. I recommend it to anyone who likes adventures but doesn't mind learning important lessons about life at the same time."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As a high school teacher of British literature, I like to use this novel to represent a different viewpoint from the Romanticists, who believed that man was born essentially born good and innocent but corrupted by society. Golding shows us just the opposite; if we don't have order and rules, as symbolized by the conch and by Ralph's futile attempts to lead the boys, we lapse into a state where the &quot;beast&quot; within can overtake us. The boys gradually descend into this state of wildness and darkness - the shedding of clothes, the face painting, the hunting, the split, and so forth. No, the novel isn't realistic, as many other reviewers have pointed out, but it isn't intended to be. Look at the time period it was written - shortly after WWII. Golding seemed to foresee order dissolving into chaos, and he shows us the consequences. The imagery and symbolism are quite good, as is the touching friendship between Ralph and Piggy. I recommend the novel, even if you only choose to read it on a literal level."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read a lot of novels for entertainment purposes, but I'll start off by saying that those I read for school I usually like less then those I read on my own. It is possible I am biased. This novel seems to invite overanalyzation in the worst way. The flimsiest throwaway line can be sought out and examined for meaning. These meanings often reflect only what the reader wanted to see. I think Golding was trying to make a point and did a passable job at doing it. I think he lacks subtlety, however. The books that carry the most weight in my mind are those which do so in a manner you hardly notice, but at every turn Lord of the Flies screams out, &quot;there is an innate evil in humans!&quot; Its ending seems contrived and somewhere along the line it acquires a nightmarish quality that seems to me to detract from the theme."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Briefly, for those of you that don't know, Lord of the Flies is a book about a group of boys who are stranded on an island. At first they get along but as the book progresses they fight and kill each other.Well, this was a book I had to read for school. I felt that chapters 1-7 were boring, 8-10 were okay, and 11 and 12 were boring. It had some exciting moments, but it had many times more boring moments. There was really no one to root for, no good guy you cared to see to live until the end. In other words, I couldn't have cared less if they all died. There is a whole lot of symbolism. Actually, I am going to have to cut this review short 'caue I have to work on notes about the allusions in it. Its due tommorow ( uh-oh ).Anyway, if you are the type of person who enjoys sitting around reading boring books, this book is for you!Oh- oops. I just read the rules. This nice little review couldn't ever qualify for a prize. I guess I should explain where Golding went wrong. Well, I thought that at points it kind of rambled on. As I said before, there wasn't anyone that you really could root for. I think that if Golding had created some sort of wonderful character that was nice to everyone, heroic, smart, not afraid, then you would want to turn the pages to see if they would leave. Well, now I really got to go and work on those notes!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I first read this book as a young teenager and I've revisited it twice since then. There many messages in this novel for those who seek them but for me the key message was how a group of children organise themselves in order to survive.Resourceful, ruthless and inventive are some of the adjectives that first came to mind. The boys demonstrate the best and then, increasingly, the worst of human behaviour. Jack and Ralph each have strengths and weaknesses: there is no single leadership model which best addresses the situation the boys find themselves in.Whether you read this as an allegory or as a black and bleak adventure story, 'Lord of the Flies' invites you to think about what you might do in similar circumstances.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The cold war era produced a lot of fiction that explored the corrupting influence of power and the rising threat of totalitarian governments, warning us that no society was immune. But while authors like George Orwell were more interested in the machinery of totalitarian governments, how they rise to power and how they maintain control, Golding was more interested in humanity, the flaws of human nature and how quickly we can revert to savagery.Golding wasn't the first author to explore the concept of mob mentality or the savage nature of man, but he was the first to illustrate it so chillingly with a group of British school boys.I have one small complaint about the novel. Golding never offers a satisfactory explanation about how these boys end up on the island. The novel provides only a vague explanation regarding a plane that was shot down. Golding never explains where the boys were going when the plane was attacked, why there were no adults with them except the pilots, why so few of them knew one another, why they were initially scattered all over the island, and so on. The reality is that in order for Golding to conduct his literary social experiment he needed the boys to be on the island with no apparent chance of rescue, and with no adult presence. It was also critical that the majority of boys not know each other, that they be of various ages, and that they initially be separated from one another so that they can come together and form a new society. Because there was no plausible back story to explain all this, I was never fully convinced that Lord of the Flies was something more than a contrived social experiment.That said it's a fascinating social experiment. While contrived, Lord of the Flies is a compelling novel, an exciting adventure story and a powerful morality tale. The novel is extraordinarily well written with descriptive prose that brings the sights, sounds, and smells of the island to life.Lord of the Flies is a disturbing tale that reminds us that civility is an artificial state and very fragile indeed (At least for humans with a Y chromosome). Had the island been inhabited by a group of school girls I don't suppose it would have been necessary for one of the girls to issue the cryptic, sinister warning that someone had \\"sharpened a stick at both ends.\\"I highly recommed this novel. It's worth reading, even if Jr. High School is just a distant memory."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Ever fantasize that you are on an island free from the restraints of society? William Golding has taken that scenario to the nth in this story of a bunch of English boys, plane wrecked on an island during WWII.We see the fabric of society slowly and most assuredly ripping as the rules are discarded one by one. Golding is very graphic in his description of the demise of pigs and plants.One will never look at fun and games in the same way."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"What happens when those raised to be an integral, contributing part of civilization are suddenly set free before their training / acculturation is complete? You have the Lord of the Flies. Written in the mid 1900s by William Golding, this book is one of the last in a long line of English works that explores the relationship between society and the lone individual. Other works of this nature include Robinson Crusoe, Gullivers Travels, and Ulysses. Specifically, how much of the evil in the world (the Western, Anglo-Saxon world) is due to the effects of society restraining the individual, and how much is due to the individual himself? These questions and the related issues of freedom, law and order, respect, competition versus cooperation, are all explored in this book.In short, a plane full of English schoolboys crashes on an island in the Atlantic ocean. Slowly, the various survivors find each other and try to form some semblance of a society from which they came from. Tasks are delegated, and roles taken on as they fight for survival hand-to-mouth. But soon, some of the party discover that life is more fun if tasks are shirked, and they revert to a more primitive state of hunting and killing. The boys divide into two groups; Ralph who tries to keep them in a semblance of civil society, and Jack who leads the downward spiral into primitive fury. Jack's group slowly morphs into a bullyish gang and begin killing the others in a game of predator - prey. The killing comes to a sudden stop when society reimposes itself in the form of a rescue ship.Published at the height of the Cold War, this book is quite complex in its treatment of story and characters. Many themes of both a personal and political nature are included. This reviewer read the book during his early teens, and found it too complex to fully understand at that time. This is probably the youngest age at which this book should be read. The book is considered a classic of English literature; though I believe it should be cited in classes of political theory, sociology, and the other social sciences. Most importantly, I believe this book more than any other, exposes the psychological foundations of Anglo-Saxon culture and society by showing what happens when those raised to be part of it are removed from external controls. The boys' ensuing behavior reflects, to me, an upbringing of rod and beatings, drills and formalities characteristic of the English school system. I dare say that a more enlightened upbringing, along the lines of Rousseau's Emile, would not have created such monsters in disguise... All in all a great book though."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Imagine you are trapped on an island with a group of boys. What do you do? How do you survive?William Golding's novel \\"Lord of the Flies\\" was written in 1954. It is an action/adventure book about a group who suffer a horrific plane crash, and the boys are stranded on an island. It takes place during the World War II era. The tale involves the struggle of power between two boys. One, who's name is Ralph, is just your average male just looking for law and order. Jack on the other hand, is a constant slave to power.Just imagine what boys would do when stranded by themselves. One thing they do is paint their faces, savagely kill pigs through their anuses and turn into savages. The book brings you on a journey of boys trying to survive, or will they just be boys and play, forgetting about the fight for survival.This book is very symbolic in meaning, that everything has a good and evil side. The book does have its twists and turns and some things will surprise you. Despite all of the entertainment, I felt this book was very predictable. What else could you get in a story about people stranded on an island? This does not necessarily mean it is not a good book though.

It touches on alot of levels about society and how we act as people. The novel is about a group of young boys from Britain who are on a plane on their way to boarding school, when it gets shot down and crashes on a island. There are four main characters, Ralph who is the leader, Piggy who is the smart one, Jack the strong agressive one, And Simon the naturalist, relgious one. Through these boys, you see the diffrent facets of society and how they are suppose to interact. During the time they spend on the island the rules of a civilized society start to fade away and brings out the primal instaincts in our human nature due to survial of the fittest.. I belive that this is a great novel to read and it displays the ideas of what would happen if societys rules were taken away and how we would function.

He shows the basic primal instincts of English boys regressing from society back to basic thoughts -kill or be killed.A slew of boys crashed and stranded on a deserted island, forced to fend for their food, their own Democracy, and their very lives.Jack and Ralph -the oldest boys of the bunch- fight for dominance and leadership of the group throughout the book.The entire book delves into an area never traveled before in the time frame that it was created in. It's something one never thinks about; what happens to prim and proper people when society is no longer around to keep them humane? William Golding has strung together a world of hunters, pigs, deaths, and carnage -all based in the middle of the World War II era.The book brings to light unsettling emotions as you read. William Golding makes you wonder how savage humans truly are, and question whether it would be possible to survive living on an island with a group of boys, no older than the first teenage years and others so young they're barely able to speak properly.The book was artfully written and fast-paced.

In the first coulpe of chapters you find out that there is two boys in the beginning are just two really firghtned and scared boys and they remeber what happened to them. As they get more and more into this place they found out that this is an island and there really isnt any possible way for them to get out of this place. The weridest part of this book is the boy piggy and the other boy ralph find this conch shell and when he puts his lips and blows the conch it brings all of these other boys togther. Ok in personal opion when you blow a conch shell it gets loud but it doesn't tell all the other boys to come to this place where they blew.More and more into the book the boys who were like they don't need there parents and start relaizing that there helpless and cant do anything about it. When they realzie they don't have there parewnts to help them that means they cant gget for them selves. They cant find any food or any thing to drink so they going against each other and start getting crazy and start attacking the leader of the group and that's ralph and piggy. Ok I thought that this part of the book gave it some snare and razzle-dazzle and kid of explains what really happens when oyur on island with no food or water. It really helps the readers to explain what reaaly happens to a person or a kid when they have nobody to help them.The ending of this book was really surprising because as soon as ralph runs out of energy and speed he drops and falls and as soon as he was aout to get killed... something out of the blue happens but I cant tell you.

An airplane full of English schoolboys has crash-landed on a deserted island. As their condition detiorates, loyalties and protocols begin to crumble and the animalistic side of human nature emerges within the group. As I stated in the title of this review, the writing is authentic. You won't find the string of cliches like you see with other authors. The story is beautiful and terrifying at the same time.

On the outside, its a novel about a group of english boys who have crash landed on a island that is void of any adult contact. But on the inside, its a deep look into society and human nature. After some time on the island Simon,one of the english boys, meets the LOTF. The LOTF tells Simon that he is in him and all others on the island. Refenceing from the Epiloge p.205, the LOTF translated means Devil or Satan. In my opinion, based on this book, all human beings are naturally evil and that we are driven by self-intrest. I liked this book and think you will too."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book in my opinion is a decent book for a adventure sotry or for a exotic novel. But what it is good at is opening a eye to what our society is really like. Lord of the Flies is about about 20 or so english kids who crash land on a deserted island that know ones knows about. The actual LOTF means Devil or Satan if translated. The Devil in this book sads for the boys evil in killing a pig and putting its head on the stake so the \\"beast\\" won't kill them. It goes on for a while and then the boys split up and become savages killing 2 kids. This book represents all the flaws in society and how all men (and women) are truly evil at heart.

The book takes you through the journey of these boys. They have to deal with the fear of the beast in the dark forest, the fear of each other, and the fear of no escape. The book shows how normal boys can turn into savages and turn against each other. The two main characters, Jack and Ralph, start off friendly but as the story developes tension rises, and things take a turn fot the worst. In the novel, William Golding uses suspense and mystery to keep the reader interested. I would recomend this book to everyone. Golding's descriptive novel will keep you interested from start to finish. It will also keep you in suspense about whether ot not the boys will get off the island."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In william golding's novel, Lord of the Flies, he presents a very dark story with a dark theme, even if the setting of the novel isn't. What happens is a group of young british schoolboys crashland on an uncharted island. We don't know where they were going and what they were going to do when they get there, but I think they were being sent to a bording school where a war that was going on couldn't reach them. The whole theme of the story is about why these boys degraded to total savages, and why they were no longer caring about the modern civilized world when they did become savages. As all of this goes along, there are many symbolic things in the story itself, like one of unity, of rationalism, or of intelligence. So as the story goes along, these symbols either become unimportant or are raised in importance. Golding did this to show us examples of what happens when we lose these symbols."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If you see yourself as a kind-hearted person who believes in the good of humanity, reading Lord of the Flies will shock you out of that stance. Golding uses this large analogy of a group of boys stranded on an island to communicate that underlining every human being is a savage beast waiting to emerge. Each main character symbolizes a different aspect of humanity - Ralph: the good leader, the ideal societal figure; Piggy: the intellectual that is not valued among the savage beats; Jack: the epitome of a blood-thirty savage. At first, the boys desperately try to create a secure and functional society, but as hope of rescue fades and the boys start valuing strength over intellect, the innate beast from within quickly takes over the vast majority of the boys, destroying all remnants of society. This book defies the expectations of what people would normally expect from a group of boys alone on an island. Instead of having childish adventures and happy-go-lucky games, the boys become warily hungry, brutally frustrated, and even deadly. This book dives deep into the foundation of human nature and explores the function of society."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"One of the very few books I was assigned to read during my school days.

Not as an allagory for anything or as anything of that sort but as a story of adventure and survival. Recently I have read it with my english class and explored the symbolism and allegories. I think that the lord of the flies is a very strong book with a strong message that can be understood at many levels and I think that this is a book that ever family that enjoys reading should own. The Lord of the Flies can be enjoyed and reread by people of all ages and spending an hour to read up on the symbolism in this book is well worth it as it enriches the story alot and provides a whole new meaning to the book. 5/5 for a great read for all ages."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Ever fantasize that you are on an island free from the restraints of society? William Golding has taken that scenario to the nth in this story of a bunch of English boys, plane wrecked on an island during WWII.We see the fabric of society slowly and most assuredly ripping as the rules are discarded one by one. Golding is very graphic in his description of the demise of pigs and plants.One will never look at fun and games in the same way.Lord of the Flies: Essential Art House"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Technically the best piece of fiction that I have ever read! Despite knowing that the novel is a full-blown allegory, the characters and the emotions involve the reader in their world so perfectly that one can almost feel the book come to life before himself. The settings and the environment is very beautifully described, especially the phrases concerning the descriptions of various sounds, fire and the heavens. No work of writing can be perfect, but this one is as close to it as it can get. Perhaps that is the reason after all why Golding won the Nobel Prize for Literature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"After reading Catcher in the Rye, I was on the lookout for similar kid adventures with more meaning than say, Harry Potter. This tale about a band of lost boys marooned on a remote island while the adults wage war across the human civilisation is very entertaining and a swift read.A small novel, it starts off with how a bunch of disorganized kids install a council for the safety and sufficiency in their island refuge and the unanimous leader Ralph is envied but accepted by a better behaving marching troop's leader - Jack.The conch is the symbol of power and authority vested in Ralph. The conch is passed to whoever wishes to speak and everyone listens. With such a good start you would expect them to get better. But these are human children with their innate savage instinct. And now with an island to explore and rule on they get initiated into barbarism with the hunt for a pig, supported by a hunting song, killer's dance and more.There is lot more to it than children's games here. There might be a monster on the island. Ralph and Jack will of course compete in this new hunt to prove bravado.Deaths of kids are mentioned with good subtlety in this novel and mystery is created with simple scenes/words. With the eventual break up of the council and savagery rampant in the island it is up to Ralph to restore normalcy and his rightful place as the leader. The mindsets of different kids is shown through their actions.A great parable for human wars and human nature, this book may leave you depressed even though the ending is safer than the kids' island adventure."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Why I Thought Lord of the Flies was a great bookBy Gage McMullenWhat if all the rules were taken away,There were no adults,No guidelines.A plane crashes on the way to a fieldtripwith only 1st graders and older middle school kids,the pilots and teachers are dead it's just them.What would happen?At the beach, in my bed, at the caf&eacute; I could just not put down Lord of the Flies! I thoroughly enjoyed this book because the author was not afraid to write about dark, horrible, and gruesome things such as death and violence. For instance when he explains a baby pig getting chased down and stabbed with several spears then having his throat slit by the hunters, it made me want to yell out \\"stop\\" right there in the middle of my room. If you think that's dreadful, there is a part in the book when the opposing tribe takes a large rock and throws it at a boy named Piggy, he gets hit in the head and bleeds to death while falling to the water. It is so horrible and sad but without it the book just wouldn't be the same.My favorite part of the story was when the chief of one side of the island (Ralph) is being hunted like a pig by the other tribe. He tries to run and find a place to hide, when he finally finds a good bush to hide in they light the forest on fire forcing him to run out into the open! You think he's doomed but a ship sees the smoke and comes to rescue the kids. This book seriously sped up my heart and kept it going.But this book isn't just about kids on an island it truly is about what would happen if the rules were taken away, if we had to start from scratch, would we rebuild civilization or would we revert to our inner animal? Who would rise to the top the strongest and toughest, the smartest but shyest, or the handsomest and most outgoing? What would be your job in the tribe make fire, build forts, hunt? What would happen to you would you rise to the top or sink to the bottom? This book really got me thinking so I kept enjoying Lord of the Flies even after I was done. I really loved this book, Lord of he Flies by William Golding."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"easily one of my favorite books of all time, particularly in the fiction category. the author gets across his point about human nature being basically animal in a humerous and even sometimes gripping way."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of The flies is a good book that has many suspensful conflicts.

It explores social interactions between young males, and the limits of the conscience. The ending was shocking... be prepared for an exciting story! (This is middle school reading)"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The dark, indistict and yet highly suggestive cover of the Riverhead edition (1997, introduced by E.M. Forster)peopled with its shady, human-like silhouettes and snaps of muted color, provides a better glimpse than any other edition of an important theme of the novel--illusion, and its power to become real in the minds of those possessed by fear. Chimera.I think this theme is as important now, as it has ever been, perhaps more so considering the recent fears in the most powerful nation on Earth. With fear and vulnerability gripping America, the world has turned from being an oyster to a threat. People are frightened by the stories churned out by their media. There is anger, feelings of extreme vulnerability in the face of the invisible. Leaders fan the breezes of these highly charged feelings to create monsters lurking on the fringes of stable, rational society, ready to tear it up. Democracy, in the face of such invisible, powerful threats, can seem altogether too inadequate and fragile. Another response--a more powerful one--is needed. Force, the erosion or elimination of democratic rights, the tightening of controls. And of course, hunting down the beast. To ensure that all this is accepted by the very people who have the most to lose, a leader maintains the illusion of dark, evil forces bent on the destruction of a nation. And so on....Think of Jack and his tribe...then think how it all came about.Simon is the first to see that there is nothing to fear on the island, but the children themselves , with all their fears of the dark. Think of the littl'uns, missing the comfort, security and reassurance of adults, their parents. They cry at night, they see snakes twisting about in the jungle-fire (in reality the burning vines waving about as they are being consumed by the flames)and mistake their nightmares for the real thing. Jack capitalizes on their fear, while at first being afraid himself. He is a young child after all, which is easy to forget.Right from the start Golding works in images of how the island paradise has the potential to be turned into something sinister and deadly. We hear the \\"witch-like\\" call of a bird, see the \\"skull-like\\" coconuts strewn under the trees. Is it all really there? It takes the active imagination of the human mind to turn trees, coconuts, birds and the jungle into something awful. Something that can kill. Our confidence that what we can apprehend \\"reality\\" directly through our senses is put into question, for it is always through an interpreting mind that our sense perceptions are filtered. Our terrified minds \\"see\\" snakes, moving shadows...\\"hear\\" witches shrieking in the forest, our bodies \\"feel\\" the cold touch of a creature crawling over us...and we react according to how we understand our sensations.The lyrical prose of the novel helps us experience what the boys do through connotation, metaphor, simile. This is what literary language does best: offers us experience, rather than information. Golding, being the brilliantly suggestive writer that he is, does just that. He offers us images, illusions in the shape of lengthy, highly detailed and descriptive scenes, which make very real a dream-like, unreal experience. Simon's experience of the butterflies dancing is just one example of this. In the same chapter, a storm is moving up. Or is it a storm? Golding uses the image of a great battle brewing, with the added image of \\"drums rolling\\". Rather than being a natural occurrence, the storm is presented to us as a powerful army preparing to unleash itself on the small, isolated island. The army is put there by a human mind. And it becomes very real for both Simon and for the reader. By personalizing Nature,(which is how the children experience the island) we tend ascribe to it intentions and purpose. In this way, the storm becomes menacing and seems to focus on the children, forcing them to cower in their flimsy huts when it trummels the island.And that brings me to the next point about illusion and reality. Not only are the boys creating reality, so is the reader for him or herself, by recreating through the words on the page a surrogate experience. Some reviewers mistake the words on the page for referring to a reality that they never lived. This is not to say that they are naive enough to believe that the novel is based on real-life, but they write as if there is some truth-value to the details. This is the conduit metaphor that Bruce Pirie writes about in _Teaching High School English_, which powerfully drives the reading and interpretation of much literature. What is missed is that stories, whether spoken or written, are always constructed affairs. And that pertains to any story, including our own descriptions of ourselves. We are not giving \\"reality\\" of our true self when we tell someone about who we are: we are presenting a version that we believe to be accurate and true. What gets left out is the amount of selecting of perceived personal attributes that go into the description of our self (the unique, single \\"self\\" being another illusion of Western society...how many \\"selves\\", do you construct and present to the world every day?).Does Golding not wish us to consider how the use of language constructs the very reality that it is supposed to refer to? His very skill in getting readers to describe Jack, Ralph and the others on the island as though they were real and to live the children's experiences may attest to this to.... as well as a history of High Schools reading literature in a realist tradition.Anyway, enjoy the novel...or the illusion of directly living another's experiences. Plenty to enjoy there."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The novel Lord of the Flies written by William Golding is astonishingly well made with details of what it is like to live and survive without government and rules/society. Ralph, 13 year old protagonist who led a normal life; his life hit a tragic down spiral when he was in a plane with his Boy Scout troop heading on a tour of tropical islands. Their plane failed to fly and crashed into the ocean with no adult survivors. Ralph encounters many conflicts such as person vs. person, as in the time when he and Jack fought with closed fists until one of them gets hurt person vs. nature, like the time when the raging hurricane whips through their island and destroys everything in it's path and lastly person vs. self, when Ralph doubts himself and is stressing his decisions. Many of the camp members turn against him and go out on their own, it is up to Ralph to stay alive and help his companions, but can he tame a lawless beast like the hunters?I found this novel flawless and exhilarating; William Golding did a truly great job on this awesome novel. The author made me feel Ralph's pain and also made me feel Jack's anger. It made me feel as if I was one of the boys in the group, choosing which side to take, the hunters or Ralph. I felt the joy the hunters had when they killed their first pig, and their fear when they encountered the beast. I found myself reasoning with the hunter's plans but saw the point of Ralph's logic to stick together. I felt the shocking thunder and the clash of waves during the hurricane and felt the adrenaline rushing through my body. Even though all of these things were great I also saw some flaws in the book. I felt as if the wild pig detail was kind of weird; how that in the middle of the ocean on a deserted tropical island there would be pigs, other than that one detail I felt the book was magnificent."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies by William Golding wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. I thought that the idea of the book was very good and the theme was well thought out, but i don't think it was well written. Some parts could have been better, but it was interesting. Somethings I disliked were that there were only boys on the island and no girls. If there were girls I think the story would have been different. I also didn't like how Piggy died. I think the book would have had a better ending if Piggy stayed alive.Some things that i liked about the book were most of it was realistic. The schoolboys made rules for themselves, and there became two sides. I liked how the characters were described and how the meanings of their names mathed their actual names."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is about a group of boys whose plane is shot down on a deserted island. They are also the only survivors on the whole plane. This novel takes place in the late 1990's. The boys our forced to live on their own, and do whatever is possible to keep them alive. Obviously, everything isn't working out just the way they would have liked it to, and they have to face many troubles along the way. Later on in the book, the boys end up turning on each other. I enjoyed reading how they interacted in such a tough situation. I could never image what I would do in that type of situation, and hearing how other people reacted was neat. Nobody would ever think something like this could happen, and very few people would be able to survive living alone on a deserted island. It shows the reality of a true human society because people really are selfish and cruel and will do anything to look out for themselves. It really makes you think about human instincts. Soon after, when you are under the pressure of survival you will end up emotionally breaking down, and doing what is best for you, and only you. I think this book would be most suitable for a teenage, adventurous boy. Lord of the Flies is one of those books that keeps you wondering what will happen to the boys next, and you keep on reading. Because of its intriguing plot of survival of a young crowd, the book was hard to put down."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by William Golding was a great book that took some time to develop. I at first thought that this book would not keep my attention. As I read on I became more and more interested in this book. The idea of having a group of children varying in age stranded on an island was very fascinating. I didn't know how they would react to this situation they were placed in and that's part of the reason this book kept my interest.At first the kids thought it was fun not having any adult supervision. The boys agree to work together with Ralph trying to maintain order by assigning various chores such as keeping a signal fire going that they started with piggy's glasses and gathering food. However, the chores stop being done and their society breaks down. This reaches its peak when Ralph sees a ship in the distance and the signal fire is out. The hunting boys were supposed to keep it going and before Ralph can scold them they come back with a kill. This turns the kid's loyalty toward Jack. I thought this was the most interesting part of this book. I enjoyed how it showed the struggle in society between order and lack of it. As jack gains power among the boys, Ralph finds himself suddenly being hunted by his former friends. These kids turned savages show no remorse when they kill one of their own with there bare hands and teeth. I found it very compelling how these civilized kids can suddenly deliberately want to kill one of there former friends. However, the reason I gave this book a three out of five was the ending. There was great action throughout the book and then it suddenly ends just by Ralph running out of the jungle to see a British Naval Officer.This books characters exemplify three distinct aspects of human nature. Jack shows mans roots in his primitive behavior. He opts to hunt and be free, shirking the duties that could ultimately rescue him. Ralph's character shows the desire of man to be civilized yet be free and wild as well. He wants to be rescued but at other times is intrigued by the hunt and wild side of human nature. He shows his desire to be rescued by trying to keep order and have chores. Oppositely, he is overwhelmed by the hunt and ultimately kills his friend in the fatal attack on the beach. Finally, Piggy is on the opposite spectrum from Jack. He is constantly reminding the others of the proper way to act and mentions adult's behavior as an example. These characters represent the constant struggles that live inside mankind in everyday life.In conclusion, this was a great book to read. The plot was exciting with the exception of the mundane ending. It is a book that can be read on many levels and with characters that represent struggles that continuously plague the human mind. I gave this book a three out of five and would recommend others to check it out."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Critique of Lord of the Flies written by William Golding in 1954. Lord of the Flies is about a group of young English boys whose planes crashes onto a remote island. Throughout the novel the boys gradually changed from civilized English boys to small savages that need to survive. The author used many metaphors and Imagery to describe the situations and places on the island. All the places in the island where described very well for example when Ralph first used the conch to call the other boys. The author says, \\"Ralph pursed his lips and squirted air into the shell, which emitted a low, farting noise\\"(Golding 15). That line tells the reader exactly how he blew the conch and he described how he put his lips on it and what sound it made. He uses very descriptive words in that line and the reader feels like they are standing right next too them. The authors metaphors are also another good use of litery technique it in the book. William Golding also uses alliteration in this next example. This quote is when Jack is ready to hunt the beast. \\"He gave a wild whoop and leapt down to the pale sand\\"(Golding 52). \\"Wild whoop\\" would be alliteration and could also be considered onomapeia. The \\"pale sand\\" is a metaphor because it described what the sand looked like. William Golding used many literary techniques in this book, which make the book more interesting and fun to read. Lord of the Flies by William Golding was very interesting and fun too read. I liked how the author described many aspects of the island and the creatures that lived on it. The book was very detailed so I always knew what was going on, because it felt like I was right there. I enjoyed reading Lord of the Flies because it was very interesting. It described so many things that I could imagine being next to one of the characters. Lord of The Flies proved to be a great adventure novel. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read adventure novels and people who enjoy a novel with a good ending.Works Citied1.) Golding, William. Lord of the Flies.

Well, I think that symbolism is based on your own opinion. We don't know that the author meant to have this particular thing represent this particular idea. When you get to the story itself, the first four chapters and the last four chapters are worth a read. However, everything in between I found to be very boring and you find yourself having to stop and re-read certain things because you forget what is happening; there is no action to help keep you up to speed.Just FYI, I didn't have to read this book for school. I read it in my spare time. From what I understand, those who must read it for school have a far lower opinion of this novel, but I don't know that for a fact."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies begins in complete chaos. A group of young boys are stranded on a tropical island after their military school plane was shot down. All the adults onboard were killed, so the boys were completely alone. Even without the supervision and direction of parents to help them, the boys try to get organized. The pick a leader, establish a set of &quot;laws&quot; for the island, and make plans for their survival.Throughout the book, there is one boy who is rediculed at every chance, and only one boy tries to defend him. There is a constant battle for power between the boys named Ralph, who is sensible and only concerned with getting rescued, and the boy called Jack, who is a savage and only thinks of hunting pigs and having fun. After heated arguments that split the boys in two, raids by the hunters that destroy Ralph's shelter and his only chance of making fire, and the murder of two boys by Jack's tribe, the battle escalates to a the whole island going up in flames while the hunters try to flush out their prey... Ralph.Golding uses a lot of desciption to make you feel as though this could actually happen. He creates a realistic microcosm (a little &quot;world&quot; that represents a bigger world), with a government and a trouble-maker, that shows what humans resort to in times of desperation. The climax of the book is a good surprise, but it ends too quickly without enough explaination to understand it easily. I enjoyed the story, but Golding repeats things too much, and I didn't even like those parts when I read them the first time. Jack talks about hunting too much, Ralph talks about keeping the fire going too much, and I hate the song the hunters sing. It repeats killing the beast and spilling its blood over and over, and they sing it all the time. Without these annoying repeats and the short boring periods spred throughout the book, I would say that the Lord of the Flies is a great story (but it is not written like one.)"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's novel, Lord of the Flies, is a story of details, adventure, and conflict. William Golding uses his excellent skills of being able to switch looks that he creates on characters by using a hefty amount of details. The details provide readers with the feelings of other characters. When I read books, I enjoy books that have plenty of details that make your reading more vivid in your imagination and allow you to feel as if you are in the story too. I like how Golding creates different adventures inside one big adventure to make the novel have more excitement and more creativity. William Golding is known for his outstanding conflicts in his stories. His books always have more conflicts than others because his are more enjoyable. For instance William has a conflict between the setting and a conflict between the characters. Most authors just have conflict in the characters. I enjoyed this book more than most books and that is why I recommend you to read this. If you enjoy action and like plenty of details then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book relates dangerous things about human nature in a very entertaining and shrewd manner.

I especially liked the way Golding built up and created the characters in the book. Ralph and Jack were the main characters in his story and also in my review. I felt that I was able to connect to both of them in different ways.Ralph was a very charismatic leader in the way he spoke and the way he carried himself. He was strong and seemed to be the only kid on the island thinking straight. Ralph's thought process was adult like and very advanced for most twelve-year-old kids. Although there isn't much in Ralph's character to pick on, I will say one thing. I felt when he and Piggy were being threatened they should have tried a little harder to stand up for themselves. He was a strongly spoken person but didn't like to be violent in any way and wasn't sure how to take care of threatening situations when all alone. I'm not saying he should have also resorted to killing, as the others did. I feel he should have tried to at least build some sort of shelter in a secluded part of the island to protect he and Piggy from \\"the hunters\\". Even with his faults in my mind he was a much better leader than Jack.Jack was the exact opposite of Ralph in my mind. His character was great and it was interesting to read about both Jack and Ralph in the same novel. When Ralph asked for order Jack would fire back with profanity and defiance of all attempts to be civil on the island. Jack's character is also hard to criticize because I was able to see were he was coming from in his thinking. Yes he did go a little far, but we never knew how we would act when faced with the same situation. If I were to pick at the character of Jack I would have to pick at all the hunters. I can't see how the young kids could have become so violent toward everything and care so little about life. That was a little unbelievable but I still enjoyed the story line.I like the way this book was put together from the beginning to the end. The mounting suspense kept me wanting to read more. The only complaint I have about the structure of the story is the end. It just ended, it wasn't a bad ending, but I felt like I was left with a lot on my plate. In my opinion the end is definitely the most difficult to get down well on paper but I felt that Golding could have done a little better with it.I really enjoyed this story including content and characters. All of my critiques are purely my attempt to find something in this novel to pick on. I felt that the novel was very well written and I liked all the characters to some extent."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, was an interesting book. I enjoyed the book because I like adventurous books, and I like the plot of the book. If you don't like stories with only children characters and an outdoor setting I don't recommend this book. The book is set on a deserted island. A plane crashed and stranded a whole bunch of kids on a small deserted island with no adults. The kids make an adventure out of the situation and form a tribe and pick a chief. The kids build huts on the beach and hunt for pigs, which are the best source of food on the island. I especially like the fact that Golding had added symbolism into the story and it was very interesting to me. Some of the symbolism that stood out to me was the conch as a symbol of authority and bought the whole group together. Piggy as a symbol of intelligence, Simon as a symbol of imagination. Throughout the book, there is one boy who is ridiculed at every chance, and only one boy tries to defend him. There is a constant battle for power between the boys named Ralph, who is sensible and only concerned with getting rescued, and the boy called Jack, who is a savage and only thinks of hunting pigs and having fun. After heated arguments that split the boys in two tribes. A hunting tribe and a tribe to try to get rescued. Ralph was clearly always the more rational of the two as he constantly focused on trying to have people build shelters, and a fire, which he hoped would eventually be what saved them. Jack had a strange desire for hunting and no care with what happens to them on the island. Piggy seems like a bright child with good ideas, but because of his silly appearance he receives no respect from the other kids.

The thought of this group of young boys on an island all by themseleves without any parents just fascinated me.

I thought that it was very interesting reading about Jack and his crew members wanting to kill these other boys that they were friends with not so long ago.I would defiantly recomment this book to anyone. It was a great read for anyone that likes adventure. This book kept me on my toes the entire time; I was always wondering what was going to happen next.

The story of the plane crash of British schools and their journey afterwards isn't merely a childs tale of survival, but rather a much broader theme of animal instinct vs. human behaivor. Much of the book discusses the two primary characters, Jack and Ralph, and their journey of rule. Jack has an autocratic system of rule, while Ralph relies on a more democratic system. I guarantee this book to anyone looking to have a good read, or even if they are looking for something deeper than that."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book really teaches you something.

The sorty takes the reader through the horrors of how these boys had to work together to survive and what struggles they went through with each other. William Golding did a good job of showing how much different people are and what different goals people have. &quot;Loard Of The Flies&quot; was a quick read for me yet it still made me impatient because the charactures kept repeating themselves. Ralf, a leader in the book, would always say &quot;we need to keep the fire going.&quot; Jack, another leader, would always say &quot;we need to hunt.&quot; Sure the book needed to state this so we could get to know the characters but we didn't need to read these quotes every five minutes This book was very similar to &quot;Animal Farm,&quot; except it used people instead of animals. I saw lots of similarites in the two books and how power can get into the wrong hands. Some people like to abuse their powers and these two books show that really well. I think people who like to read about government would like this book because it relates to how a country is ran. Willam Golding did a good job of using description in which he described every little detail, whether it was a person, the island, or what the boys were doing. &quot;The Bushes crashed ahead of them. Boys flung themsleves wildly from the pig track and scrabbled in the creepers,screaming.&quot; This is just one of the many quotes where William Golding uses vivid details. I have been trying to add more details to my stories"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"might only be man's ability to appreciate this book. And apparently much to my surprise some people aren't able to appreciate this masterpiece. And masterpiece it is. It is one of the greatest novels of the Twentieth Century, rivaled only by The Great Gatsby and Catcher in the Rye. What should be examined is whether the book would ever receive a mediocre reading once given appropriate discussion of the symbolism and implications for society and the inherent evil in an unmanaged civilization. This is a book that on the surface might appear gory, pessimistic, and blah. But that's most likely derived from a shallow and effortless reading of the text.Like The Great Gatsby, this is a text that should be read on a regular basis to re-live the youthful pleasures of reading."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is definetly one of the best books I have read. For anyone who is wondering whether to read or not I definely recomend you do. What I would like to point out though is that many of the reviewers are giving away all of the plot to everyone else who hasn't read the book. Instead of telling everyone the ending and ruining it for them how about you give a basic setting instead? Maybe some basic information about the main characters as well but not so much that you tell what happens to them later in the book. Hopefully some people will read this and realize that your cheating people out of a great book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought this book was good and it was exciting. I like the way the author describes the characters in the story. I also like how you read the book you can picture everything. I like how the boys start their own government and they have a leader. His name is Ralph. They all just want to have fun but the littleuns don't listen to the older ones like Ralph and Jack. Then every one starts turning on every one. Ralph and Jack are arguing and the littleuns just swim and play never help with anything. Jack is starting paint his face with different colors while he hunts. Then he kills a pig. Ralph wants Jack to make shelters and Jack wants hunt so they start fighting and Jack takes a group of kids and he has a tribe. Jack and his tribe kill some of Ralph's tribe. It's a very good book you will have to see what happens to Ralph."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a novel of drama that is set on an uninhabited island during World War Two. Ralph, a boy elected the leader of a group of boys who were stranded on this island, has to solve problems for them. Conflicts between the characters of this book will keep a potential reader of this good novel will keep a reader wanting to read on until they finish the book. This is what happened to me when I was reading this classic novel by William Golding. Lord of the Flies is a good book for middle school students because to an elementary reader the book just wouldn't make sense. I recommend this book for potential readers and buyers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a compelling book. It's both scary and heartbreaking as well as beautifully poetic at moments.The language is dense at times. Golding is one of those authors that takes extreme effort packing meaning and evocation in each word. Sometimes it's an effort to read them, but it's ultimately well worth the effort.A must-read about the horror and fragile beauty inherent in being a member of the human race.If you enjoy reading &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; I highly recommend Stephen King's excellent new book, &quot;Hearts in Atlantis,&quot; which uses &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; as a sort of departure point for an impressive coming-of-age story set against the Vietnam war."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a story about mankind's inherent brutality. I read this book in 1992 when I was in Grade 11. (Not because I had to, I should add.) I saw the 1963 film first and this made me read the book. A group of English schoolboys trapped on an island slowly turn into a horde of savages. Part of the reason I read this book was in case it did become set reading for our English class. It turned out to be an unnecessary exercise but I enjoyed the book anyway. I actually envied the kids who had to read it the following year for English. Listening to them complain that it's boring or that they didn't understand it. (My class read &quot;1984&quot;, another book I can recommend.) Avoid seeing the woeful 1990 film version of the novel. Most of the original story is blatantly missing."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"After reading a few comments, yes, I do agree that this book might be too difficult for the teenagers. But I would recommend it to everyone having to deal with the boys (and girls) of that age. The book brings an insight into the teenager's life, it's fears and emotions. Excellent read!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a menacing look at the true nature of man, or the author's idea of it. I found it an unbelievably shallow look at the human spirit. Just thinking of this book at night keeps me from getting a good nights sleep. I think Golding's work is overly unsensitive, although it makes you think about yourself and what you would do in that situation. If you would do the same hideous things that the boys wind up resulting to."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"no real review here"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"\\"The Lord Of The Flies\\" is an exciting adventure yarn that memorably delves into the problem of free will versus social order. Unlike most such literary explorations, we learn here that free will may not be all that great after all, or a confining social order all that bad.A plane crashes in a tropical island, leaving a large but unorganized group of pre-teen boys the only survivors. A boy named Ralph takes charge by virtue of a vote, and for a while the boys work reasonably as a team to facilitate their rescue. But dark forces are at work from within and without, and soon the social order the boys came in with is displaced by brutality and murder.A familiar subject of parody on such shows as \\"South Park\\" and \\"The Simpsons\\", \\"Lord Of The Flies\\" was itself written as something of a parody of the English children's novel \\"The Coral Island\\". In \\"The Coral Island\\", a boy named Ralph and his two friends find themselves on a desert island and display sufficiency and daring before their eventual rescue. Here there is no such sufficiency, and only a negative kind of daring. Neither boy nor nature is of a kind to play by the rules, perhaps author William Golding's point when he presented this in 1954 after having served in the Royal Navy during World War II.Ralph may be our hero, but Golding points out he's not much of a leader. Ralph, he writes, \\"would treat the day's decisions as though he were playing chess. The only trouble was that he would never be a very good chess player.\\"Ralph's brain trust, a kid with the unfortunate nickname \\"Piggy\\", is arguably no help, full of whiny hall-monitor admonishments and rather lazy besides. Also an ally is the insightful but rather moony Simon, a bit of a lone wolf. About the only boy who really seems up to the task of taking charge here is a choir leader named Jack, a natural-born hunter who rallies the others with talk of painting their faces and having fun.Of course, Jack's the bad guy, but after a few readings I can almost imagine this story being told by Jack in an alternate version as a sort of parable of free-living youngsters shaking off the adult wanna-bes in their midst to get in tune with their wild sides. Never mind the fact that some of them, like the sadistic Roger, are more in need of a sedative.Though the book is dark, it is neither oppressive nor boring. High schoolers should take heart - there are much duller books you can be reading than this. If you are like me, you may even find the novel electrifying in the way it keys in upon the hardness of growing up. The beasties Ralph and the others live in fear of may be fantasy, but bullies are real, and few books depict that sad rite of passage as well as this one.Great writing, too. Each chapter has a fully realized sense all its own, and Golding's depiction of the island and its natural, chaotic beauty make for some memorable passages: \\"The assembly looked with him, considered the vast stretches of water, the high sea beyond, unknown indigo of infinite possibility, heard silently the sough and whisper from the reef.\\" The natural world does at times seem to be a menacing force as described by Golding.\\"Lord Of The Flies\\" was a favorite of mine in high school, and remains so nearly 30 years later. It doesn't get old; it just draws you in a little deeper each time."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Thanks a lot for fast delivery; the book arrived 4 days from order date regardless of \\"estmated date.\\""},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a really good book.

It is also a great study on human nature. It is the perfect example on why anarchy can not work. Human nature does not allow a society without hierachy to function. It all falls apart in the end. Also when one reads the book, one can also get a lot of pop culture references to the book like the conch, and piggy. The Simpsons has a funny rendition of the novel as well. The part about where the title is explained is trippy as all hell. Great book. I recommend this to anybody that has not read this book already."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I initially read this book because in the back it said it was compared to Catcher in the Rye, one of my favorite books and as I expected, it did not disappoint one bit.

It is a tale of a group of English boys that are stranded on a deserted island. They realize that they must work together and cooperate to stay alive. This is much easier said than done. They are more worried about who's in charge, than they are anything else. There is a constant battle for control through the whole book. Because of this battle some boys lose their lives, and others just lose their friends. They slowly begin to turn savage and fighting becomes the most important thing.

I also think he did an excellent job describing each character and giving them their own ways of doing things. This book beleivable because I know if you leave a bunch of children on an island alone, sooner or later they will show their true colors. There is one part that I did not like and that is when Jack kills the female pig, guts her and puts her head on a stick."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was pretty good.

I have to say this book was a good book for people who like adventures. Golding used really wonderful symbolism and outstanding irony. It makes you think one way but it ends totally different. His purpose of writing this book was to tell us about themes. One of the themes you notice in the begining of the book is the Loss of Innocence. He shows this theme through the killing of the sow. Golding also handled the climax real well. This book was believable becouse at the same time the book took place when there was a war going on. I don't know how the book could have been better because in my opinion it was by far, the best book I had ever read. Now I'm really afraid to go on a trip with the other students."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The most interesting parts in the book were when the boys saw the parachutist on top of the mountain and thought he was a monster.

Golding seemed to have no idea what he was talking about either let us know by describing objects as &quot;stuff&quot; or by losing us in run-on descriptions. But after discussing this book and rereading it for my test tomorrow, I've realized the full potential of this book. I didn't know a short book could take so long to read, but read it, then go and analyze it.

I would encourage every 14-year-old to read it too."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is truly one of the masterpieces of literature. The stark symbolism is chilling and unparalled. One caution though, do not read this novel if you do not appreciate or understand symbolism. THIS NOVEL CAN NOT BE READ AT SURFACE LEVEL! This book is not to be read by young students who have not had exposure to interpreting plot lines and symbolism.After completing the novel I was spellbound and thought about nothing else but its chilling implications. It is one of the most provacative novels in existence. By examining the inherent evil in all mankind the reader is lead on a search and realizes that the sought after beast is embodied in each individual. You will never look at human nature the same way after reading this novel."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I'll make this short, because there's lots more 5 star reviews to be read!

A treasure!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a brilliant view of the world as we know it. It's extremely well written but William Golding didn't just produce a beautifully written novel, he produced a frightening view of the human race which I know I will never forget. The book's impressive characters convey to the reader an amazingly powerful message about good and evil. The book is also a true page turner, an exciting adventure story that spirals toward a spectacular ending. The author also portays the island on which the story takes place so well that while the reader is flipping pages constantly, to see what comes next, he will find himself transported to this unknown island in the middle of the sea. Personally I am extremely impressed that Golding can portray so many of the problems in the human race with just, &quot;kids being kids,&quot; but he did accomplish it. This tour de force tale of society is highly recommended, although be warned you'll never see the world the same way again."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was very well writen and was worth my money.It was an good book about survival and it shows how people really act without rules or laws to live by."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Overall, I liked Lord of the Flies. Golding developed the plot well and there were not any of the dry, boring parts which make me yawn and want to stop reading. I appreciated that the plot didn't make the ending obvious. A weak point of the book which bothered me was that all the dead bodies were conveniently washed out to sea. Reading this book made me think about human nature and the different ways different types of people react. Simon, in my opinion, was the best character since he could step back and look at events and decisions from a different perspective. I believe he was a very crucial character, who was not too wrapped up in himself. Showing him helping the littluns get fruit was good since it points out that there is good in human nature. I found the conflict between Ralph and Jack to be intriguing. I like how Golding showed the struggle between good and evil through out the book. This is an intriguing and thought-provoking book which I recommend to almost everyone."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I was a little worried about what kind of book it was in the beginning, but I am really glad that I stuck with it till the very end. Golding did an excellent job of describing where the boys had landed and what the boys looked like. Golding used the simple technique called description that captivated my attention from the very first chapter. Golding really knows how to right a book to engulf readers who really don't like to read. I would recommend this book to those who like an interesting book that is filled with suspense, the fight between good and evil, and the change from adolescence to adulthood."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies, depicts a spine tingling tale of man's willingness to return to his primitive ways. In this book, a plane crash results in several young British boys being stranded on a deserted island. Throughout this tale , a boy named Ralph tries to lead the band of boys. He does so by trying to maintain a civilized society. However, many of the boys begin to stray and began to return to man's savage ways. This band of savages has a leader named Jack. Jack's ways completely go against all of Ralph's ideas and morals. As a result, a conflict occurs between Ralph's goodness and Jack's evil. In the end, we see that even the most civilized man does return to his savage ways when he is backed into a corner. Golding uses a lot of symbolism throughout this intriguing tale. Thus, he is able to keep the reader intrigued by not only the suspenseful plot but the underling meanings as well. Lord of the Flies is by far one of the best books I have ever reader. I highly recommend this book to any reader who is looking for a great suspenseful adventure story."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies is a good book for anyone in High School to read. I enjoyed it and I think that others my age would also enjoy the book. Even though this book is not something that I would have chosen for myself to read I am glad that I got the opportunity to do so. The Lord of the Flies is a very good example of how people can go from being civilized to being savages in just a matter of time. It gives us an idea of what life would be like if we didn't have rules and regulations. It also shows that even though you sometimes wish that you could just get away from all of the adults and do whatever you want things don't always turn out the way that you expect them to. I think that The Lord of the Flies was a very good book and I would recommend it too anyone looking for an adventurous book filled with many unexpected twists."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Over all I feel Lord of the Flies is one of the most terrifying and intriguing books i have ever read. After devastating plane crash, Ralph tries to bring order and work habits into effect. All he can get from the other boys is fun and games. Although they seemed fun, they soon destroyed the group and caused havoc. Golding set a perfect scene for this type of book, a deserted island with only the jungle as sources of food and shelter. This would be a hard task to manage if your an adult, but he had the oldest boy being around twelve. The boys are forced into separation from the beginning. Even though they stay together in shelters and work, they are separated by their beliefs and are bound to act out on it. Ralph, with Piggy's help, try to keep the group of boys together. No matter what they say, Jack always seems to have something better to say or do. In the end, Golding shows that if people are placed into a society with no rules, nothing good could come of this."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is more than just a story of a group of young Brittish school boys who are trapped on a tropical island together. This book discribes, in part, a journey that every human takes. This journey is a journey of the discovery of ones own morals, character, and compassion. Golding shows us that without rules and authority, man will abandon the comfort of society and regress into barbarianism. Ralph seems to be the symbol of the child in all of us. Though ignorant and naive, Ralph reminds us all what it is like to unconditionaly trusting and co-dependent on others. At a time when laws seem hypocritical and society seems counterproductive, &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; reminds us why we even bother with civilization. My favorite character by far is Simon. Simon was weighted down with the knowledge of what was to come and he was unable to convince his friends that he was telling the truth. To me, Piggy represents the person that society and civilization was made to protect. I think these types of stuggles go on continuously in human society. These struggles are only reflections of our inner struggles between our super-egos and our ids. The final question that I got from this book was this, is it better to hide behind the rules of society as Ralph, Simon, and Piggy did, or is it better to hide behind a mask of anyonimity as Jack and Roger did? Like a great paradox, in the end no one really knows the answer for sure. I really enjoyed this book and I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought this book was one of the best ever written. I put it up there with Animal Farm. It was such a cool book. I would reccommend it to anyone who likes survival stories with actual conflicts. A very good book!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book 12 years ago in high school, and it remains one of the most affecting novels I have ever read. I'd put it in my top 10."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A reviewer wrote that the fact that most of the boys turned into savages was unrealistic. On the contrary, I thiunk it was the most ingenious and realistic part of the novel. The premise that makes them turn a bunch of stuck-up, snotty British prep school kids turn into savages is one that's also been preached by Freud, Darwin, and Anthony Burgess (the author of A Clockwork Orange, another great novel). It goes as follows: human beings are simply highly evolved animals. Although we may be much smarter than dogs, monkeys, or lions, we have the same animal instincts and tendencies that they have. Also, contrary to what religion may tell you, we're both with no sense of right or wrong. Some of us, such as Ralph and Piggy, as we grow older and develop free will, develop a sense of right and wrong. However, in the case of many others, such as Jack and Roger, who seemed harmless at the begining of the novel, no moral sense of right and wrong is ever developed, even though the given is usually unaware of this. The only reason that the such people are &quot;kept in line&quot; is because society trains them that way.

Jack, the boy that sees a need to disagree, starts his own hunting tribe. These boys become savages and do what they want to at any given time.

I have heard that the ending is the most interesting part. I surely hope so. I'm finding it hard to pick this book up and finish reading it. The book probably could have been about half as long as it is. How many times did the author describe the pink rocks or the way the sun was setting? In Chapters 6 and 7 all that is discussed is finding the beast that the boys are looking for. We as readers at this point know that there really is no beast! This part is definitely too drawn out. There is way too much description in this book. I usually enjoy imagery in writing (it allows the reader to envision the scene just as the writer did when he or she was writing the book), but I think this book has so much imagery that it is actually confusing. I even find the dialogue confusing sometimes, because I'm not sure who's talking at certain points. I could go on and on about my opinions of this book.

However, as a criticism of more optimistic boys' adventure stories, as a critique of democracy, or as anything much beyond a warning of the obvious, that young children, especially young boys, must be carefully civilized (and continually re-civilized), it's a failure... because Mr. Golding cheats. Though Mr. Golding would no doubt claim (with justification) that boy's adventure authors tended to stack the deck in favor of their protagonists, Mr. Golding does the opposite. His characters never had a chance. A comparison specifically with R. M. Ballantyne'sThe Coral Island, referred to in the novel, and generally with other boys' own adventures should suffice to prove the point.AGE: It is no accident that boys' adventure stories tend to feature teenage protagonists (Ballantyne's were 18, 15, and 14) because a certain amount of maturity is necessary to make them even plausible. It is therefore no accident that Golding's oldest \\"biguns\\" are only 12 while the \\"littluns\\" are as young as 6.TRAINING: It's easy to forget that the concept of \\"childhood\\", the idea that those under the age of majority should be allowed to \\"play\\" and be sent to school rather than being put to work as soon as they're able is a relatively modern idea. Now, no one in his right mind would suggest going back to the old way of raising children, but it did have the singular advantage of better preparing children for being castaways. Ballantyne's protagonists are sailors in training; Golding's are a bunch of schoolboys.NUMBERS: Though the primary reason is probably ease of storytelling, the number of characters in a boys' adventure novel is usually kept to such a manageable number that there is no requirement to establish of any sort of \\"government\\" in order to get things done. Golding has so many characters that they never even manage to count themselves!PRIOR RELATIONSHIPS: Almost invariably boys' adventure story protagonists are close friends before the crisis hits; with the exception of Jack Merridew's choir (and the twins of course) none of Golding's protagonists even knew each other before the plane crash.RELIGION: Karl Marx had it partly right, religion IS the opiate of the masses, if by opiate you mean balm to and healer of the soul. Religion can give you courage and strength where there is none, and it helps you to do the \\"right thing\\" even when no one is looking. This makes it very useful in a crisis where group survival depends on something other than \\"looking out for numero uno\\" though it can lead to sacrificing oneself for others. Ballantyne's protagonists were surprisingly (at least looked at from today) devout Christians. This gave them the courage to face a horrible fate, though said horrible fate was the consequence of risking their lives for someone else. In contrast though all of Golding's protagonists are presumed to be at least nominal believers in SOMETHING, there is no evidence of religious belief in any of their actions, which hastens the death spiral of their little society.CHARACTER: This is the critical matter, as even Mr. Golding would admit, so it comes as no surprise that his protagonists only run the gamut from A to B, from evil to useless. Ralph, the \\"bigun\\" initially chosen chief is all but completely lacking in leadership skills, not to mention being something of a dolt. He is (just barely) capable of grasping what needs to be done, but utterly incapable of convincing anyone, not even himself, to do it. Piggy, the only one who can honestly be called \\"intelligent\\", is also fat, weak, asthmatic, socially inept, whiny, and blind as a bat without his glasses. (Gee, Mr. Golding, why didn't you make him wheelchair bound, too, so he'd have spent the entire novel crawling on his belly?) Samneric, the twins, are utterly incapable of functioning separately. Simon is kind and gentle and helpful, though a little bit balmy, but too young and too inarticulate to have any influence. Jack is a megalomaniac, and Roger is a sadist. The \\"littluns\\" are just barely capable of feeding themselves, which is fortunate because no one else is going to do it. The wonder is not that three boys died, the wonder is that any remained alive! If they'd crash-landed in a temperate climate, no one would have survived the first night below freezing.As a commentary on democracy, Lord of the Flies is of little use because there isn't any democracy in the novel! (Despite what the Colonial Office might claim, \\"one man, one vote, one time\\" is not a democracy!) Though Golding's depression is more understandable when you remember when this was written, the reason he turned out to be so wrong about democracy is that he failed to grasp its strengths: democracy, especially constitutionally limited democracy, is the ONLY Earthly form of government even capable of long term functioning with wicked, sinful citizens because no other form of government has solved the problem of succession. Democracy does not claim to always install the best leaders; it merely offers the only peaceful and practical method for removing the worst. If Jack Merridew had had any prospect of winning some future election for chief, he might not have found it necessary to resort to violence.Finally, in regards to the last page remark, \\"I should have thought that a pack of British boys... would have been able to put up a better show than that...\\", I'd argue that they did better than a similarly handicapped group of primitive tribes-children would have. Sure, the education received by the primitive tribes-children would have prevented many of the bone-headed mistakes committed by our young bulldogs, but the weaker taboo against violence, especially in the area of settling political disputes, would have made the crisis worse when it came and the death toll much higher, if only because primitive tribes-children would be expected to be a lot more competent at killing each other."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Some students, forced to read this book, seem to develop a strong dislike for it and a blindness to its power. Fortunately, I discovered this masterpiece on my own. I loved the sparse, yet effective writing. I was captivated by the struggle of these boys to survive on their own. And, ultimately, I was stunned by the quick spiral into chaos that reflects the heart of mankind.Golding never bought into the idea of humanism. He was courageous enough to face the truth of our own depravity, rather than joining the crowds of his day that shouted \\"man is basically good.\\" Even without a religious compass, Golding accepted that men, left to their own devices, will seek their own satisfaction, egos, and control. His startling use of children stranded on an island demonstrates this theme with brutal power. Even in the end, when adults step in, we see the children's bleak future in the shape of a battleship.You may agree or disagree with Golding's ideas, but few can discredit his ability to challenge our preconceptions in a book half the length of most masterpieces. \\"Lord of the Flies\\" showed me the power of fiction to communicate ideas, and for this reason I've pursued my own career as a novelist. I owe Golding a debt of gratitude."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I am 16 and really picky about books and if you like survival books then this will be great for you but if you also like to just read this will be great for you from BILLY W"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Many of us were forced to read this novel in High School English class. I am glad I had to read this book, it made me think, but I remember it being gruesome as well!!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is more of an insight into Mr. Golding's view of humanity than it is an insight into humanity itself. Needless to say, Mr. Golding has a very negative view of people. Perhaps his view is colored by the fact that he lived through the development and dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan (atomic bombs are brought up in the book as having hit the airport from where the boy's plane departed) and the rise of Nazism in Germany. Mr. Golding uses a group of plane wreaked boys to tell his tale of what he thinks is the natural denigration of society. Still, I can't find his view at all consistent with the world around us. If savagery was natural for people we would not have developed into a civilized society. In fact, with few exceptions, all peoples form structured societies that impart rules for the welfare of the group; not the other way around as Mr. Golding would have us believe. Except for few notable exceptions (like Nazi Germany) savagery is not natural for people. Even there, civilized peoples prevailed. Additionally, I believe this book has racist overtones in that Mr. Golding chooses to use the jungle motif to display his version of savagery. Why couldn't he use another back drop?Technically good writing gets the book three stars."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I picked up this book when someone had mentioned they were required to read it in school as children. This book is about the end of innocence and the heart of darkness. Ok, before you get scared away by the two phrases I just mentioned, let me explain. So without even reading the book, you probably know it's about a bunch of English schoolboys who get stranded on an island and are forced to survive without the supervision of adults. This book is supposed to be full of symbolisms; each character and animal represent some idea or entity in society. The end of innocence I mentioned begins with the slaughter of a pig for food. The heart of darkness comes when the leader of the hunting tribe loses his mental stability and decides to hunt for more than just pig.It's actually a very short story (208 pages), and the dialogue is very simplistic. I found the author's descriptions of the jungle, beach, lagoon, and mountain to be quite boring. (You'll also notice that I said schoolboys in the last paragraph; there are no girls in this story. There is no underlying love story. There is no humor. There is no excitement whatsoever.)To be honest, I don't like this book. Even less so as required reading for school kids. To not interpret the symbolisms would be to leave the book as a plotless story. Yet to interpret it would mean exposing children to the horrors of savagery, abuse and survival.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 3 (You can put as much interpretation as you want in the &quot;symbolisms&quot; of this book, but I'm too lazy to let my mind wander in search of a deeper meaning.)E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a)A (Action) - 0.5 (You really can't get excited over a bunch of schoolboys and a few pigs.)P (Plot) - 2 (Boys get stranded, boys form a society, boys survive and wait for rescue.)"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"all most everyone says that this is one of the best books ever written.i disagree completely.the book is about a group of young kids who are stranded on an island after the plane they are on crashes.the kids survive by making their own rules and selecting a leader among themselves.the boys want to be the leader and they soon become enemies.its not that great like a lot of people claim.thats my opinion."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"&quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot; was not exactly a &quot;feel good&quot; book. If you like profound, dark, and symbolic literature, this is a great book for you. But if you can't sit through many pages of overly detailed description, I don't reccomend this book. I enjoyed the characters, their dialouge and thoughts, but the lengthy descriptions of the island were too much, and took away from the action of the story. I think the minds and personalities of the characters were protrayed realistically, but some of their actions were not. The violence that occured in the story most likely wouldn't have happened in real life. The sequences in which Jack tries to find Ralph towards the end of the book was very overdone. The changes that took place so quickly in some of the characters were exaggerated also.I did like the beginning of this book and enjoyed the characters, especially Simon, but I thought it was carried too far later on. It started out, it seemed, as a harmless adventure book but turned into a deep, thought-provoking tale. If you can handle the exaggerations and boring descriptions, this book wouldn't be that bad. But if you're looking for a book with a crisp story line and reasonably fast paced action, &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot; wouldn't be it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was asked to read this book, and I thought the title was interesting.

None of them know each other (unless they went to school with others), yet they were all on the same plane. The pilot did not survive. Some of the boys become obssessed with killing while others are obssessed with being rescued. Kids die and a few turn cannibalistic.

Since it was required of me to read this book in school, I was forced to make my way through each dragging chapter, but I would have never on my own time, and it's not because I didn't understand the book that I feel this way about it. My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism, which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings, the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders. If the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective, it would make more sense, but in order to understand its symbolism, one still has to read it, and it is really not worth it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As a teen entering the 9th grade at private school, I was instructed to read this book by the school. I, of course, read the book, but did so with pain. This is not a long book, but not short either. It took me about a week just to read all 208 pages. I was unimpressed by the topic of this book, several young British boys stuck on an island, and in my opinion, this author was in la-la land when he wrote the book. Although this is just my opinion, it was agreed on by my father, who read a small ammount while he waited for me at an appointment. If you love fantasy stories about people on deserted islands that try to form a government and fail, then resort to killing each other, this is definately the book for you. This is not a book I would recommend for those my age, 14, at all. I will say, however, that the ending reflected the main idea of the story and was excellent. The book was still difficult to read and I hope this review will warn you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"While I was reading this incredibly violent novel I could hardly bear to go on. I couldn't wait to finish it. Not because of the fabulousness of the book but because I couldn't wait to put the book down; it was so dumb. Unfortunately I was forced to finish the whole thing for English class. I'm glad the whole &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; topic is over. I've given several reviews on this book but since none of them came out I'm making one again---so I can tell everyone to be cautious and not to buy this book. No---that may be a little too harsh. I think this book is very uninteresting for most teens so I don't reccomend this book to be read by kids in the 16 and below age range. I suppose it's bearable---for someone who actually enjoys reading books, like myself. But this would be utter hell for those who despise reading. The whole thing is just so wrong. Too many descriptions, extremely wrong moral/point or whatever, way too violent, and I agree that W. Golding also failed to mention who was saying what sometimes, as the reader from Houston said. I don't agree though that the ending was good. It's like, there's this bunch of British boys stranded on a little island. Then they start getting all violent and drifting farther and farther away from their normal, civilized selves. They form into two groups---the good group, with Ralph, and the bad group (also known as the tribe) with Jack---and fight over the silliest things. In the end two characters no longer exist---they've been killed by some of the boys. After all that senseless stuff all that happens is that a cruiser comes and rescues them and the whole nightmare is over. I mean, stupid or what?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is one of the few books in my elite \\"bounce\\" category -- it bounced off the wall when I finished it. I am aware of all the praise that has been heaped upon this book. This is one of the times at which I must find myself unable to really even comprehend the reasoning (if any) that goes on in the minds of those who have handed out the awards._Lord of the Flies_ is, we are told, a novel about human beings and their nature. It's a shame we see so few human beings in the book. Golding seems to see savagery as the natural and instinctive state of humanity, a position that's logically untenable (if this was the \\"natural\\" way, exactly how did we acquire civilization at all, let alone keep it long enough to develop the printing press necessary to spread such [negativity]?)Ignoring the stated literary intent, the book is on the surface the story of shipwrecked children trying to survive, a la Robinson Crusoe and Mysterious Island. However, in this aspect it also fails miserably, with characters not even covering the gamut of behavior one would suspect from children (at least some would have tried making a boat, one would think; while the exact time Lord of the Flies takes place is indeterminate, Kon-Tiki had sailed from Peru to Polynesia in 1947, something the character Piggy, at least, would probably have known), and with one of the most important parts of a survival story -- the survival science -- being gotten dismally wrong. This is most notable in having the NEARSIGHTED Piggy's glasses be used to start a fire, and it's one of the least excusable; even if Golding himself wasn't nearsighted, one would think he'd have one or two acquaintances whose glasses he could borrow for a second to test the idea.Admittedly, Golding has an excellent grasp of the language and uses it well. The book is well-written in a technical sense. Yet it fails utterly on both its major levels, failing to convince me of its major thesis on human behavior, and wrecking the suspension of disbelief in its overt plotline.I was personally quite aware of the potential savage nature of young people -- I was one of the bullied types -- yet the level of cynicism necessary to accept Lord of the Flies' ideas never came to me. I think Golding misses an essential streak of optimism that exists in young people, a willingness to try things and a dedication to survive that explains the fact that we're still a civilized species instead of a scattered group of savages barely above the flint-chipping level."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I hate this book.

I thought there was just something wrong about killing off three young children.There were some good aspects of the book. First of all I liked the way the author described the environment the boys were in. It was very thorough. I also thought it was good how the author divided the boys into two seperate societies. I felt it demonstrated the two sides of society very well. It demonstrated that on the surface society seems organized and well-governed.

The boys have to learn how to make their own food, look after themselves, make shelters, and make fires. They select Ralph to be the leader. Ralph, \\"the boy with fair hair\\", is twelve years old and tries to keep the boys in order by making rules, \\"'We've got to have rules and obey them. After all, we're not savages. We're English, and the English are best at everything'\\", but the boys don't follow the rules. Piggy is Ralph's sidekick who helps him make the rules and think of ways to help them survive longer. Piggy is slightly chubby so the boys make fun of him for that, especially Jack. Jack is the hunter; he finds the pigs and kills them for food. He tries to be just as high up as Ralph, but not as many people like Jack as much as they like Ralph. Soon enough Ralph and Piggy realize that the pigs are not the only ones being hunted, but they are too. The theme of this book is civilization vs. savagery. The boys have to try to keep themselves sane while they are on this deserted island. I liked how the author switched from Ralph, Piggy, and Jack and told from their point of view.

There are definitely some good, maybe even great qualities of Lord of the Flies and the allegorical and symbolic meanings that are hidden throughout the book are important and a good thing to study in class yet, if I was given this and say, War and Peace, I would grab War and Peace in a second. The truth to why I dislike LotF so very much is a bit complicated. This book opens on a boy wandering around an island. You are given almost no information on where this boy(or the other boys who show up later) came from. There are little bits of information of their back story stuck in the book almost randomly. Unless you are paying a lot of attention to every word that Golding writes, it is easy to miss these precious details. That is not the only reason that this is not may favorite book in the world. I'm not sure if Golding purposely did this or if this is just the way he happened to write it, but the the majority of the characters seem to be purely evil and it is quite hard to read the book without feeling you have personal grudge against each one. I won't go into intimate details (just so you can read it yourself and understand the disgust I have with these boys) but each boy acts in a certain way that makes you wonder how evil a child can be when not under any kind of adult supervision or guidance. In conclusion, if you would like to buy this book, I warn you. You may be one of the ones who like it and shrug off the savagery of the boy or you could be one who can't even stand to finish it. It is completely up to you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Well I was very happy with the exactness of the text of the book just wasn't happy with the page numbers it gave me because I needed page numbers for quotes in the book for an essay I ended up using a friend's book have the page numbers next time for people like me"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read this book for my freshmen English class. After reading all the reviews,I noticed people kept calling the book 'evil'. They've missed the point. The book is about the raw evil of mankind. I love survival books as well and this was right up my alley. I would not reccomend abyone under 12 reading it. Ermm the reason I did not give it all five stars is simply because it ended so abrutly. I could go for some sort of explaining as to whhat happens next. Well thats it. thanks William Golding for giving me the opportunity to read this book"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Sometimes it's easy to see how a work can be timeless, particularly when it's based on the timeless adage that boys will be boys. Lord of the Flies tells the story of a group of boys marooned by a plane crash on a small deserted island, with the nearest adult supervision lying beyond the vast ocean. The kids try to construct a functional society, while working towards the goal of getting rescued. But personal ambition gets in the way of common sense and everything crumbles. The novel does an excellent job of contrasting certain themes: civilization/savagery, maturity/childishness, collectivism/individualism, and so on. At times, this gets a little heavy, and the novel often reads like it was written to be analyzed by generations of high school students. The reader may also find that the descriptions of the landscape are weak and often repetitive. However, the novel draws out a great story. It is filled with suspense and frustration, and culminates in a heart-thumping climax. Even though the main characters are all boys, it sheds some critical light on human nature and the frequent conflict between the individual and the greater good. I would recommend picking this up at any age, as it is a very entertaining and somewhat frightening read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was educated at Maidstone Grammar School, the school at which William Golding taught for a brief period in the late 1930s, and although I did not arrive at the school until many years after Golding had left, school legend still had it that the main characters of \\"Lord of the Flies\\" were based upon boys he had taught at Maidstone. A friend of my father even claimed to have been the model for Jack Merridew. (It is, in fact, more likely that Golding was inspired by the boys of Salisbury Cathedral School where he was teaching when he wrote the novel).I won't set out the plot in any detail, as it seems to be well-known to virtually everyone, especially in Britain where it is frequently studied at school. (Oddly enough, despite the school's Golding connection, it was not on the curriculum at MGS and I did not read until my days at university). It concerns a group of British schoolboys, refugees from a war raging in Europe, who gradually revert to barbarism after being marooned on an uninhabited island. Ever since at least the eighteenth century, the \\"desert island\\", the uninhabited tropical island with golden beaches fringed with palm trees, has frequently been depicted in Western culture as the nearest one can get to paradise on earth. This idea can be found in literature (\\"Coral Island\\"), the cinema (\\"The Blue Lagoon\\"), broadcasting (\\"Desert Island Discs\\") and even in advertising campaigns; the makers of the \\"Bounty\\" chocolate bar have for decades centred their entire marketing strategy around this concept. Golding's novel, with its deliberately anti-Utopian theme, can be seen as a reaction against this received idea; the names of the two main characters, Ralph and Jack, were borrowed from Ballantyne's \\"Coral Island\\".The book can be read on a number of levels. On one level it is a political allegory about the relationship between dictatorship and democracy. At first the boys try to organise themselves on a democratic basis, electing Ralph as their chief and setting up a system of assemblies at which they can discuss their concerns. A conch shell, used for summoning assemblies, serves as a symbol of their fragile democracy, but it does not last. Jack, Ralph's only rival in the election for chief, forms a group of his friends into a gang of hunters, with the aim of hunting the wild pigs which inhabit the island. As the novel progresses, more and more boys are won over to Jack's gang, until Jack effectively replaces Ralph as chief without ever being elected to the position, and is able to use his hunters to hunt down Ralph and his few remaining supporters.To readers in 1954, less than a decade after the end of the war, the parallels with the rise of Nazism would have been obvious. A charismatic leader, unable to gain power democratically, does so through force, backed by a private army and leading a movement based upon a \\"them-and-us\\" mentality. The new leader holds the loyalty of his followers by satisfying their material needs, creates a sense of group identity through ritual and violence against a common enemy and uses his power to persecute those defined as falling outside his group. Some who initially oppose him are persuaded to conform to the group identity through fear of the consequences if they refuse.The novel's religious implications are perhaps less obvious, but are none the less present. Golding was brought up in a free-thinking, non-religious family, but appears to have given up his early scientific rationalism in favour of an idiosyncratic version of Christianity. Jack and his original hunters are all choirboys from a Cathedral school like the one at which Golding taught- an obvious irony, given that choirboys are often regarded in Britain as symbols of childish innocence. The scenes in which they kill the pigs and then feast on them are reminiscent of primitive religious rituals; they even place a pig's head on a stick and treat it both as an offering to the \\"Beast\\" which they believe inhabits the island and as a sort of idol, the \\"lord of the flies\\" from which the book takes its name. (The expression is a literal translation of the name Beelzebub, and \\"the Beast\\" can also be a euphemism for the Devil). The boys' descent from innocence into savagery can be seen as symbolic of the Fall of Man, although other, secular interpretations are also possible. One of the boys, the gentle, mystical Simon, has been seen as a Christ-figure. .If the book is read either as a political or as a religious allegory, then it is easy to see Ralph as its hero and Jack as the villain. Read on a psychological level, however, the issue is less clear-cut. Ralph and Jack symbolise two different attitudes to life, and two different styles of leadership. Ralph and his close friend Piggy represent the rational, the harmonious, the logical and the rule-based; in short, they represent the civilisation which the boys have left behind. Jack and his gang represent the irrational, the will to power, the instinctive and the atavistic. Under normal circumstances, it is the first set of principles which would seem preferable to most people, but of course the circumstances in which the boys find themselves are far from normal.Adult civilisation has broken down even more comprehensively than does the boys' attempt to replicate it on the island- we learn that nuclear weapons have been used in the war. The boys, attempting to fell from that breakdown of are confronted not only with their own physical needs but also with all the terrors which assailed their primitive ancestors- terror of the dark, of the unknown, of hunger, of solitude, of dangerous wild beasts. In, these circumstances the irrationality advocated by Jack may answer their emotional needs more adequately than the rationality advocated by Ralph and Piggy, which is why he succeeds and they fail. Seen in this light, the boys' reversion to the more primitive instincts of human nature can be seen as a response to the collapse of civilisation rather than the cause of that collapse, a valuable survival mechanism in extremis rather than pure villainy.There is not enough space in this review to discuss all the many levels of meaning, including Golding's complex and multi-layered use of symbolism and imagery, in the novel, so I will content myself with the three aspects set out above, the political, the religious and the psychological. This is one of those books in which you can find more with each reading- in my view one of the hallmarks of a great work of literature. I was surprised to learn that \\"Lord of the Flies\\" was actually the author's first novel- surely one of the best first novels ever published."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book taught: That you cannot socialize savagery out of a person, children are reflection of the adults in their community, laws cannot hold people together, and more."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a fine piece of literature.

Before long, the boys begin turning theirattention to the leader of the pack and his friend &quot;Piggy&quot;.The book depicts some of the worst human emotions ofchildren . It progresses from an understandablerestlessness to progressive violence and ultimately murder.This is a good rendition of group dynamics includingleadership, role-playing, group cohesiveness, the breakdownof group cohesiveness and the complex dynamicinvolving rewards and punishments in the pursuit ofgroup goals.The work depicts both the positive side and negative sideof group conflict. Its positive side is constructiveargument leading to a successful resolution of a problem.The negative side is violence in the pursuit of groupsurvival goals. In the instant case, the violence is directedtoward &quot;Piggy&quot; whose pleadings to move the group towardconstructive conflict resolution are ignored. Ultimately,the group embraces &quot;the herd mentality&quot; until the consequencesof its murderous actions are irreversible. The chaosseems to halt when an authority figure steps off a searchboat and views the scene for the first time. There aremany lessons to be learned from this work. These range fromgroup cooperation to the negative impact of group deviancyfrom normal modes of civil conduct. The work is appropriate foryoung teenagers, persons studying group dynamics and othersinterested in quality English literature. The work is wellwritten. The sentence construction is good for a book depictingsmall talk between and amongst typical teenage boys in middleschool. The work shows how groups deteriorate into destructivebehavioral modes when logical problem resolution fails toproduce generally acceptable alternatives.A typical assignment might be to read this book and havethe class critique it in small groups of 4-5 students.Participants could discuss control points surrounding thebreakdown of order, as well as alternative negotiationstrategies aimed at enhancing group cooperation/cohesion."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read it on my own, i wasn't forced to, like most people, i like books like this that kind of 'criticize' society.

In Lord of The Flies, these England boys got to experience this first handed. If you like suspense/action stories, this book will be a real page-turner for you. This book shows how young people can also make big mistakes in a time of need. It also shows how having good friends can really make a difference, and how you should never take your friends for granted because there might not ever be another friend as good.

I wouldn't recommend this to anyone under the age of 14 or 15. But, it is a great novel for older readers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The symbolization and all of the hidden messages in Golding's work is what makes it such a classic. Golding's work can be viewed from so many different perspectives. Some people see his work as just a fictional story written for pure enjoyment. Others view his work as ridicule to British society and government. Still others see his work as a message of what he believes human nature really is, evil. I believe the latter of the three ideas. Golding was trying to reveal to his readers that he believed a society without rules and regulations would lead to a world of true human nature, in his ideas that would be evil. In the story the deserted boys at first do not know what to do. The two eldest boys Ralph and Jack decide that their needs to be a leader and that leader should be chose by a vote. They also decide their needs to be rules and punishment for when the rules are not followed. The ideas that the boys have prove that Golding's idea that they are still restricted from being their true selves because of society's conditioning. As we proceed we see that the some of the children are less apt to being \\"good\\" because the restraints that society has put on them has been lifted. Some children without society are now running wild and acting like savages; the island is in complete chaos. Some of the boys are still trying to keep order and in turn we get the battle of \\"good versus evil.\\" In the end the boys are rescued because of this battle; the island is set on fire and because of the flames they are noticed and rescued. The book is wonderfully written and has so many more meanings then I have even mentioned. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for either a leisure book or a book that they can analyze. The novel is such a classic because it allows the reader to make his or her own choice about what the book really is about."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As you no doubt know, this book i san attempt to portray the evil throughout history and the fall of innocence. This book does just that perfectly. At the beginning of the book, nearly all as well. The turning point is the slaughter of a pig, an event whose symbolism can become more clear later. The Cliffs Notes available for a low price greatly enhance the reading, and define several British words used. Also, the characters and their allegorical symbolism are explained. This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies was an extreamly suspenseful book. It is about many boys between the ages of 5-13, who are stranded on an island. They lose control over themselves, and forget what it means to be proper.

The book give insight on the duality of human nature - the divide between order and chaos, intellect and instinct, structure and savagery. But however chillingly frigtening Golding's depiction of the dark side of human nature doesnt come across as shocking due to his masterful use of symbolism and foreshadowing. While there's no promise that it'll be enjoable for some readers, it's guaranteed to be unforgettable, which is why i guess, it remains a cult favourite."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This was the text book when i was in 12th grade. i didn't read it fully until after my exams.guess what i read the book at least 5 times after that. The story shows how the human society evolves and gets the shades of the good and the evil. Golding makes it a point that it does not depend whether the humans were superior or inferior (he chose a group of well behaved English boys.....supposedly the best in good behaviour, oderliness and intelligence) or the sorroundings are good or bad (a tropical island.......lush green vegetation, beautiful beaches.....a heavenly sorrounding). also the group was cut off from outside influence so that the factor of influence from existing society norms is discounted. but even though the givens were the best, what finally the group of boys turned into is startling. certainly a must read if looking for some serious reading."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It has a slow build up at the end it was a good book. to me it has a little to much detail but all in all pretty good."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book deserves its reputation as a classic and is a must-read for every person.

Probably the most significant of these symbols was the conch. The conchs characterized several things, including independence and stability on the island, and possibly, even for a short time, harmony between the boys. One of the most motivating characteristics to the conch was the fact that Piggy couldn't use it. This shows a deficiency of control or power on Piggy's part. As the tale progressed, this routine shrank more and more, until the isle was a dwelling of broad chaos and mayhem.I love its break down and build up in society. I love books like this and enjoy the psychological thinking that must be modified in order to do this. I find as I grow older the simple way a belief system can be created in a community...is fascinating. Lord of the Flies is THE most classic example of this procedure."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I hadn't actually read this book, just seen the movie so I decided to go back and dive in. unfortunately though the book does seem to be more heart pounding and graphic, the narration really takes away from what is a terrific spotlight on what civility really means and how little it takes to break it down. The acting in the movie was really good comparatively to the trite contrived redundant dialog in the book but the slightly more adult oriented graphicness and realism of the books plot like more than makes up for it.A must read, but don't know if it's really worth going over more than once."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book was excellent.

The book was sent in just a couple of days after purchasing and was in excellent condition."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I've been a teacher for over seven years now but only in the past year have I been getting more and more interested in the history of pedagogy. Through my master's studies, two names have struck me as both progressive and extreme: A.S. Neill (1883-1973) and Anton Makarenko (1888-1939). While progressive education may be not suitable for nationwide schools, some lessons gleamed from the case studies can be implemented. Before reading Lord of the Flies, I channeled my humanistic educational theories to sort out the misconception of the brutality of childhood through the theories of Neill and Makarenko.Rear cover synopsis:\\"A plane crashes on a desert island and the only survivors, a group of schoolboys, assemble on the beach and wait to be rescued. By day they inhabit a land of bright fantastic birds and dark blue seas, but at night their dreams are haunted by the image of a terrifying beast. As the boys' delicate sense of order fades, so their childish dreams are transformed into something more primitive, and their behavior starts to take on a murderous, savage significance.\\"------------Inspired by Scottish author R. M. Ballantyne'sCoral Island(1858), William Golding turned the tables on the way children react when left by themselves. In Coral Island, three boys were stranded in the south pacific and got a long quite well... until the adults intervened: pirates, inhabitants, and missionaries. By themselves in their childish world they led an idyllic life, but conflict arose when they were confronted by world of the adults. Golding takes a different stand on this theme and sees the children as hopeless without adult supervision; the nature of the child as a barbarian.Golding is a Cornish author while Ballantyne was a Scottish author. These are facts often better left to historians, but one more character needs to come into play in order to reaffirm my position: the Scottish progressive educator A. S. Neill. Neill believed that children carried the same tacit ideals of what it means to be a good human being; children have the innate ability to govern themselves and discipline themselves. When adults assume their self-appointed role as governors over children, Neill believed that the children were then subjected to all the psychoses in the adult world, which steals the essence of childhood away from the children. Neill's Summerhill School offers an education like this.As an educator myself, I read The Lord of the Flies through the eyes of A. S. Neill and his Soviet counterpart Anton Makarenko, both believing in child self-sufficiency. Much of the symbolism and many of the incidences on the island can be attributed to the psychological distress the boys endured when under the rule of the adults and how some struggle to hope with their childhood nature. The conflicts arising from the adult-ish characters (Ralph and Piggy) contrast the overbearing childish attitudes of the rest (Jack and Roger) with the \\"littluns\\" displaced from the power struggle between Ralph and Jack. Though frightened and largely ignored, the \\"littluns\\" are the only children on the island to be spared the awkward suspension of responsibility between childhood and adulthood. The rest are victims of their inadequate understanding of their adulthood misconceptions and their own miscarriage of upholding their childhood values.The central symbol of adulthood misconception is the conch, a tool used to gather around the subordinates like the children experienced at the airfield when they were gathered by the megaphone. While initially successful, and with much disdain displayed by Jack, the conch is accepted as a symbol of unity and law. However, the mere idea of using the conch to symbolize the megaphone shows that Ralph and the children are ill at ease with their new found freedom. Abiding by the rules of adulthood they experienced in school has ill equipped them for the freedom they should be experiencing on the island--a time for growth, a time for the children to be children.To see the awkwardness of the life they were experiencing in England (under the yoke of adult governors) versus the life they can experience on the island (where the children can be children, even Golding writes in Chapter Four, \\"...the northern European tradition of work, play, and food right through the day, made it impossible for them to adjust themselves wholly to this [the island's] new rhythm\\" (74).Piggy and Ralph both obviously carry the largest burden of adulthood to the island. Their intrinsic need for conformity and law drive a stake through the fabric of the childhood experience for the rest of the children. When a schism arises between Ralph and Jack, it's Jack's childish notion of having fun that tears him away from Ralph's sect; Jack's need to experience the hunt, to have what he considers fun, establishes the rift which separates his cave-dwelling clan (what boy doesn't want to build a fort?) from Ralph's stricter beach sheltered clan. This schism between the clans of adulthood and childhood manifests itself in hopelessness and savagery.The savagery experienced through the eyes of Ralph is that through the eyes of an adult. The children, the clan of Jack's cave, simply see their bloodlust actions as uninhabited self-governance--those who disallow their childish ambitions are persecuted, albeit beyond Neill's and Makarenko's idea of kind justice. Even then, the savagery isn't realistically experienced by all of Jack's clan with one death being attributed to honest fear and another death being attributed by the action of one. The ultimate hunt at the end is seen as bloodthirsty through the eyes of Ralph and Roger, whereas only Roger really sees the violence as necessary to regain the equilibrium of his clan's childish motives. Jack is Roger's vehicle of madness, his key to the door of his warped fantasies... adult fantasies not shred among the rest of Jack's clan (what happens to the twins at the end of chapter 11?).The fear of adulthood manifests itself with the arrival of the dead airman. When the children are begging for the presence of an adult, one arrives in corporal yet corrupted form, and the children vilify the corpse. They assure themselves there is no beast yet they later confirm its very existence. This fear stays with them even after the corpse itself is flung to sea. At the conclusion there's an air of unwelcome acceptance, calm hostility, or belittling realism.So, the savagery of childhood that is commonly associated the Lord of the Flies isn't part and parcel with childhood itself; rather, the brutality is only a symptom of one character's (Roger) nonacceptance of childhood and the most of the scenes of violence can be explained by the children's inadequate understanding of both their own childhood nature and their misconceptions of the adult world which they try to implement, failingly, in their own world. It's not childhood that's brutal, it's the misconstrued conveyance of adulthood to children (through education, advertising, entertainment, etc.) that is manifested in the child's actions that is brutal. Children aren't born with hate... they're taught."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is perhaps my personal favorite book of all time. So much is symbolized within the novel that it is truly mindboggling (I did spell that wrong, dont judge). Now I do believe that this novel is not for persons under 15 (thats my age). On the surface this is an interesting novel that tells of several boys decent into madness and savagery. This is all a younger child will see. They will also see pointless violence and deaths. However, in this novel, everything is done for a purpose (how it hates me to say those words dont ask why). Each character symbolizes something or someone, each place, each scene has its own importance that truly adds too the novel. Another complaint is that the novel is boring. I do not really understand how it is boring. It is thoroughly intriguing and entertaining. Another complaint is that the novel is altogether too gory. I personally believe this is an overstatement, however i do read fantasy and sci-fi commonly so I do have some experience with gore and am not particularly bothered by it. For some reason i feel like those reviewers typically enjoy romances. The final overall complaint is that the novel is too dark. This i cannot really fault this argument, for the novel does border on mild horror at some points (psycologically). Yet it all is important in desplaying the darker side of human nature. Overall this is a great novel, that deserves acclaim even if read in English class. i recommend reading it alone before you read it with your teacher. Yet this is my opinion."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The cover of my copy of Lord of the Flies says that over 6,855,000 copies are in print, and my copy is old. Countless thousands more have likely been printed by now. Hosts of school children have read this book for class (or at least skimmed an online site describing the book), but I hadn't even opened the cover until this year.Lord of the Flies is a classic in every sense of the word. It is popular, it is memorable, and it incorporates a number of elements essential to a great story.For those not familiar with the book, Golding creates a world in which a group of schoolboys are stranded on an island, alone and without adults, and Golding depicts the rapid decline from civilized friendship to animal behavior as the boys realize they may never escape. Unlike the children in Ender's Game, these boys weren't selected for any striking intelligence, and unlike Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games, Ralph and Piggy, the protagonists here, never achieve greatness by lifting themselves to a greater moral height.No, on this island, the fair-skinned British boys quickly regress into tanned savages, trading their humanity for survival. One boy, Ralph, becomes the early leader by group vote, and he struggles to maintain teamwork and civilized behavior among the group. But Ralph quickly finds that the deepest instincts of the boys drive them not to civility but to savagery.William Golding wrote this book nearly sixty years ago in a different intellectual climate. Today, characters aren't written with a natural depravity; they're written with an innate potential for greatness. America loves Katniss Everdeen because she went from ignoble poverty to national fame and leadership. The world first fell in love with Harry Potter for his innocent greatness, not because Rowling peered into the darkness of his soul.Golding, however, perceives that human nature contains more than sunshine and untapped potential; he admits our natural weaknesses and predilections without writing narrowly depraved characters. The boys are compelling not because they fit into our preconceived stereotypes but because they mirror the dual nature we find within ourselves. The boys first taste desperation, praying that adults will save them, knowing they need the outside help. Slowly, as time passes, the boys attempt to create a small society, as they realize salvation may not ever come. But each, in their own time, begins to taste the darker temptation to hunt and kill rather than cooperate and share.As a result of that progression, darkness and death mark the latter half of Lord of the Flies. The story is not depressing, as Golding often understates the violence and weight of the story, but the book does not provide satisfaction for anyone looking for an hour or two of light escapism in its pages. I enjoyed the story and see the benefit to familiarity with a classic tale, but I closed the book with a shudder. Golding has painted a picture of humanity outside society, and the reality of depravity is not a pretty thing."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I purchased the book on cds for my daughter's 8th grade class. They truly enjoyed having this book on cds so they can follow the reading in class. It was clear and the narrator was great."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies by William Golding is, simply put, amazingly depictive of the brutality and beauty of human nature. The book begins with British boys all of decent and educated backgrounds stranded on a island with no adults. In the book, the boys are initially led by a sensitive, smart, and logic driven Ralph and a competitive, ambitious, and instinct driven Jack. The group of boys initially all have meetings where their opinions are regulated by a conch found by Ralph and Piggy, Ralph's assistant. Gradually, the delicate friendship between Ralph and Jack breaks, and rivalry, savagery arise. The boys split up into two groups, each an enemy to the other, and conducts actions even to the most brutal degree, murder. As superstitions and fears arouse, the boys created a beast out of their own uneven emotions which became the centerpiece of the story and at the same time an excuse to all actions as more and more, the boys shift their blame to the imaginary beast.Everything in the book possesses great symbolic meaning. Piggy, who throughout the book was Ralph's assistant, represents society's intellituals, who despite their brilliant minds and common sense, are condemned for their lack of expression and appeal. Ralph represents leadership and justice, and the beauty to the human nature while Jack in contrast, shows the instinctive beast that dwells in all humans. The conch, which at first was in effect during meetings, represents democracy and the freedom of speech for only with the possession of it can a boy speak. The beast, the ultimate focus of the book, is a creation of mankind's own fears and insecurities. The book is brutally beautiful; it reveals to us a side of human nature that many thought was nearly impossible and also, the delicate exterior that we call civilization."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is, without doubt, one of the greatest books ever written.

I suppose you probably want my reasons for reccomending this book, before just buying it on my word that it is good. The reasons are as follows:-1: Lord of the flies is original. And I mean actualy, properly original. It does not try to compete against the high tech thrillers such as Jurrassic park, (also an amazing book by the way), or the fast pace thrills of the Da Vinci Code, (amazing again). It is not a horror book, or a romance, or a science fiction book. If I am forced into a situation where I have to classify this book, I call it a very, modern classic. It is one of those books that stays with you for the rest of your life. You will be able to remember every little plot twist for years to come.2: It is a beautifully crafted, highly relevant novel that acts as a window into the emotions of a child, as well as reflecting the behavior of the human race as a whole. In other words, it shows you what would actually happen if you dumped a load of kids onto an island in real life. There are no illogocal leaps here. Everything flows, everythiing works, everything is stunningly real. It is this that makes the book as terrifying, and as haunting as any I have ever read.3: It's good for all ages and all audiences. Well, all ages that can read. Basicaly it is fine for anyone who could read and understand Harry Potter. It is terrifying, but not in the way that induces nightmares. It has action in it, but it is not entirely based around car chases. It is not hugely fast paced, because you will be hooked enough to read it at a slow pace. It will make you think about/complain about/reflect on life.It is not a romance. But I would say that the character relationships in it are the most important part of the book. (In case you're wondering, this is not something I usualy say, and character relationships are not usually what drives me to buy a book. But in this case... just buy the book and see for yourself.)4: It has everything, all written in a style that not so much leaves you wanting more, as leaves you wanting to get other people to read the book, while you read it again. It has a good plot, characters, location, suspence, anything else you can think of.5: If you still don't want to buy it, buy it for a friend, (any friend, it doesn't matter, if they can read it they'll like it), and then take thier word for how good it is. They'll just get to read it before you do, thats all.So, this is one of my favourite books ever, number 1 is possible, and it won a nobel prize for literature. So now that you know my opinion go and buy the book.Bought it yet?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"One of the greatest books I have ever read and the best William Golding has written has to be by far The Lord of The Flies. This superbly written book has an extremely simple basis, which is human nature. William Golding illustrates human nature through words by telling the story of a group of schoolboys who crash land on a deserted island. At first the boys get along electing democratically a leader. The leader being Ralph who symbolizes everything good and righteous. Slowly however things on the island begin changing as human nature and a power hungry boy takes over.The power hungry boy is named Jack who symbolizes evil and in my mind Nazi Germany. He slowly by force takes over Ralph, Piggy, and the rest of the weaker part of the group. This group could possibly symbolize the Jewish people in Nazi Germany. Jack and his band of strong classmates oppress and put down the weaker bunch continually. Slowly they become more and more physical until fights break out and two distinct groups are formed.One group headed by Ralph was the weaker group and the other headed by Jack was the stronger group. Eventually, Simon a boy who was for peace and not dividing was \\"sacrificed\\" by Jack's group and total war broke out until Piggy had been killed and everyone else on Ralph's side fled to Jack's. Ralph alone and scared was hunted like an animal by Jack's band of hunters. The forest catches ablaze and Jack is on Ralph's heels with a spear in hand but what will happen next? You must read the book to find out!This book is one of my personal favorites because of the immense amount of symbolism and hidden meanings. The characters can take on different groups in history and play out exactly what happened in those situations just like the one I provided about Nazi Germany. Another reason I adore this book is because of it's cold and raw reality about human nature and the scary fact that the school boys in the story could one day be anyone of us."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is an incredible journey, that follows a group of boys stranded on an island after a plane crash. All the parents on the plane have died, so this big group of boys has to fend for themselves. A big part of this story is about how the boys still create rules to govern the island. A leader comes around named Ralph, who has continuous argumments with Jack, the oldest, who himelf wants to be in charge.Things start off well, but sitings of a beast on the island scare many. One of the boys named Piggy, a very intelligent, but not liked boy, has great ideas and tries to get everyone to listen to Ralph and do what he says. One thing Ralph is big on is keeping a rescue fire going. Jack, makes a group of hunters to get meat and when their out hunting the fire goes out as a plane flew by, but couldn't tell anyone was there because there was no smoke.Ralph and Jack get into a huge argument that ends up seperating the boys into a group of rebelious hunters lead by Jack and the other group with Piggy and Jack. Jack's group has all but Piggy and jack. Gruesome and odd ending chapters see the end of some as the hunters kill them. The leadership and rules set on this island fall apart, and shows how rules can diminish is a second and things can turn ugly fast. This book was a very good one to read, it had a an ending that leaves you thinking, and a story that makes you think about your own life, and a great story about these boys on an island who have to fend for themselves, create rules, and watch things diminish and change drastically after disagreements and a fight for power take place on this island. I reccomend this book to anyone who is looking fo a fun and interesting story to read, that has a great ending that leaves you thinking about what's next."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord Of The Flies is without a doubt a classic work of symbolism. William Golding really did do an incredible job of linking every vague detail in his book to the ideas he had about human nature, and the post world war II world in symbolistic forms (The Conch, The Glasses, The Beast). Still, finishing the book leaves one with a rather bitter taste in their mouth. I feel that the extraneous amounts of unnecessary violence Golding included, and the extreme behavior of the characters as the story progressed really kept me from appreciating the true artistic essence, and incredible emotion of this book.The story itself begins with a group of young military-school boys (who are assumed to have suffered a plane crash over the ocean water) landing on a small, uninhabited tropical island. Ralph, the main character, quickly steps up to leading the group, and gets the boys on track to getting rescued. He has them start a signal fire; make shelters, and just generally keeps them in a microcosmic society of the world they once knew.The society quickly breaks down though. Jack (a boy jealous of Ralph's leadership) is overcome by his urge to hunt wild pigs and have fun, and finally leaves the group over a conflict of interest about the signal fire. Gradually everyone who once followed Ralph leave him to join Jack's primordial savage hunting tribe, where they hunt wild pigs and savagely kill them. This in itself is graphically documented throughout the book, and the boys' morals are gradually replaced with more primitive instinct and reasoning.Before you know it, a book that started out fairly boringly is filled with rotting severed pig's heads on sticks talking to characters in the book (in their head, showing their mental stability starting to depart from them, but somewhat disturbing none the less), and Jack's tribe savagely killing some of the boys that didn't join them, for unclear reasons (being overcome by their lust for violence, rebellion from sane society, call it what you will). There is a sporadic parallel story going on, about a \\"Beast,\\" which is nothing more than the boys' respective manifestations of their worst fears (and perhaps the fear of the consequences of their actions catching up with them), and this fear feeds Jack's tribe's ruthlessness towards the end of the book. Quite predictably, the book ends with the boys being rescued, but not before Jack and his tribe almost murders Ralph.I really wish I could have appreciated this book more, but frankly the writer's negative view of the world (which was in turn reflected in his writing) was a little too depressing to be enjoyable. I do recommend the book as a good read at least once, and it is without a doubt a classic work of literature, but when it all comes down to it... I feel it is both a boring, and highly depressing story."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In this book from the astounding mind known as William Golding, a bitter struggle between man and beast lurks in the dense, dark jungles of an uninhabited island in the Pacific Ocean. During World War II, a plane transporting some British children (between the ages 6-14) crashes over an island in which only the children survive to inhabit. In the beginning, all is well until two of the main characters, Ralph and Jack, endure a terrifying power struggle between them. Jack, the villian, wants to rule the other children with tyranny and alongside him are his hunters. Ralph, the chosen chief, believes that keeping a fire ready for rescue is the main and most important thing for their survival. These two boys' ideas soon clash and the many boys are split up into two tribes. This book was so exciting that some of the reading made my heart beat with intensity. It is no wonder that this novel is calssic, and I reccomend this book to anyone willing to read it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"OK, I must be the odd man out here. This book falls into many of the &quot;listmania&quot; lists of other books that I found to be quite good. So, I had it delivered and found it to be the worst book I've read in a few years. What do people see in this?I'll grant the fact that there is some nice symbolism with the conch, the boar head, and such. But that is all it has going for it.Golding attempts to show the reader how easily mankind can become corrupted when left to their own devices, but the story he masked it with is pretty poor. For something written as recent as 1950, I would have expected much better.First off, there is no mention of what happened to the plane. Just some boys on an island and the plane crash just seemed to be a way to get them there. There is no wreckage to deal with, no dead bodies smelling up the island. Secondly, there is no time reference at all. It seems that the kids hair just grew long, magically overnight. Without any mention to a timeframe, it appears they are on the island about a week. I'm sure it was longer, because nobody should have as little faith in humankind to think that we should devolve to savages so quickly. Maybe Golding did think it could happen that fast... I don't know.I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who really enjoys reading and likes to see the plot and the characters well developed. This seemed to be thrown together with no regard to the plot whatsoever. If this book comes on a recommended list, but there are other options, AVOID THIS ONE!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies is an excellent character study. Shows the well meaning, the wise, the hateful, and the barbaric in different chacters. How civility can disappear when faced with survival and an unruled society. How some of the boys use clay to mask their faces, and in turn mask themselevs and their humanity was well illustrated by William Golding. Not a light book, but an easy read. Not an enjoyable read, but a good reminder of how people could be."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is one of those books that many of us had to read in high school. I didn't, but picked it up anyway-- and it has quickly become one of my favorite books. On the surface, it is a tense, exciting adventure novel, short enough to be read in a single day, but long enough to provide fulfillment.Lord of the Flies can be read, on another level, as a cautionary tale of the true state of human nature-- what Ursula K. LeGuin would call a &quot;thought experiment.&quot; Like LeGuin's Left Hand of Darkness, it is one author's attempt to decipher one facet of human nature by isolating it and stripping it of its support. In this case, a group of children are stranded on a tropical island during what appears to be the Third World War. With no adult authority, the children attempt to fashion their own society based upon the one they left. This quickly breaks down, however, and the true nature of Man emerges. As a thought experiment, this book works wonderfully. Isolated from &quot;civilized&quot; society, they are freed from the bonds and restrictions of it, and as children, are not as inculcated with the lingering values and mores that adults would bring with them. The stage is set for a clear glimpse of true human nature, were it to be freed of the bonds of society. In Golding's view, human nature clearly reflects what Thomas Hobbes called the &quot;state of nature&quot;: the children live in a state of &quot;continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of people, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.&quot;The symbolism in this book is clear and precise, without disrupting the realism or flow of the book. Piggy, with his glasses and insistence upon order, represents society's rules and Freud's superego. Ralph, the obsensible leader of the children, tries to balance the wishes of the children to play and the choir to hunt with the need to keep a signal fire going and build shelter, and could easily represent Freud's ego. Jack, the choirmaster, with his anger and eagerness to hunt and gain power, describes the id at its most merciless. Many more symbols abound, but writing of them would ruin what is a fantastic story!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This isn't really a book you LOVE, but it's really interesting think about. I would read this with \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" since they were both written around the same time, and see who you agree with--Golding or Salinger. Both are short reads, too, which is always a bonus!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought that the Lord of the Flies had a really good theme, about the beast within us all. However, the way it was brought across to the reader was kind of wordy and confusing. But, the storyline behind it I thought was good.All in all it was an okay book to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A Review by NateIn Lord of the Flies a group of boys are crash landed on an island after a big storm blew down their airplane leaving them with no adults on the island. Some of the boys take charge and their names are Ralph, Piggy, and Jack. They all go to the top of a mountain and light a fire so boats will see them. Later the boys do different things some go hunting, others play on the beach, and two are left building shelters, and one is Ralph. The boys think there is a beast which is proven to the boys when two see something on top of the mountain that moves. They slowly grow to be more and more savage and even leave pigs heads for the beast. Something bad happens one day and the boys split up into a group of savages and one of boys who are normal. They fight over things the four in the normal group go to the savages. One is left after a capture and a hunt is made for him.Some things I liked about the book are how the events are realistic like how the boys grew to be savages. I also liked how some things that happen just appear there unexplained but are easy to guess how they happened. In some parts something that seems like it doesn't even matter and were just added for no reason changed what happened for everyone. I didn't like how some parts were very insightful but not explained so I had to guess and one character is meant to be religious but it is like things that happen in the bible are related to what happens to him.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes books with a lot of twists and surprises. Although I would not recommend this to anyone who strongly thinks that the human heart is completely pure and no one could do anything bad to anyone else or be savage."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this book, among others, shows the true nature of humanity. though it may not be the most optumistic book in the world, but the book is so realistic about how people act and think that it would make you cry with shame. this book reveals the true cruelity of humanity as we strieve to survive in any way we can."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is William Golding's best-written novels of all times. He captures your mind and attention right from the beginning and keeps you reading till the end. His descriptions and attitude helps you visualize a mental picture of the characters. It is extraordinary how Golding grabs you with his words and makes you feel like you are sucked into the novel. Golding's novel is a combination of horror, drama and adventure all in one. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and in suspense on what will happen next. The author makes you firmly hold the book as you read just in case something jumps out at you.It is a brilliant story about young boys stranded on an island after a horrible plane crash. They have to learn to survive on an uninhabited island with no adult supervision. It is left up to a group of boys to establish order and a civilization until they are rescued.Golding shows symbolization of Christianity through his character Simon, a choirboy. Golding moves on to show you evil also exist within the group through Jack and his followers. This group clearly demonstrates cruel and devilish intentions.It is such a descriptive piece that you can visualize and get a scents of feeling about the island and the characters. You feel the events as if they were occurring right before your eyes. It is spectacular how Golding keeps the reader interested until the end and even after that the reader wants more. I recommend every one who loves adventure and a thriller to read Lord of the Flies. It is an interesting novel that sends out messages about human ways to live life, along with the message of evil verses good."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Reading the reviews for this book makes it clear that there are two camps of readers of this book: those who read it in high school and those who read it later in life. Count me among the latter.I didn't know what to expect when I picked up this book. I was pleasantly surprised by Golding's depth and sharp insight. Despite the youth of its main characters, Lord of the Flies is not some juvenile adventure novel. Golding's bleak commentary on the absolute evil (the \\"Lord of the Flies\\") that lies in our hearts, waiting for just the slightest opportunity to throw civilization into chaos is chilling and powerful.I hope that those people who read this book in high school go back and read it again later in life, especially those who did not like it. Lord of the Flies is not an exercise in finding symbolism and motifs ... it's about understanding the point that Golding makes through his story. Lord of the Flies is clearly one of the more compelling and intense books I've read in a long time. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought this book was very interesting in many ways. It really opened my eyes to the evil nature of human beings, and how, if we let it, that evil nature will come out. When they first land on the island, the boys are all dressed in a uniform, and they are proper, as their upbringing would cause them to be. There is, however, a huge difference in their appearance and attitudes at the end of the novel. All of the boys are dressed up like savages, with paint on their bodies. None of them care at all about rules or regulations or what is right or wrong. That shows just how easily humans can turn from good to evil. I enjoyed reading Lord of The Flies because there was usually never a dull moment. In every chapter, there was always something new developing. This was a very good book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"i thought this book was very good. It was really interesting. When i first started reading it i was aware of how young the boys were, but as i started getting farther and farther into the book i forgot. Their attitudes had changed majorly and so did their actions. They were basically heartless. At the end when they were rescued and the reality of them being so young hit me again. ALl in all it is a really great book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"One of the numerous required reading for us in school, it is memorable to me for the simple reason that this work, on one level is a semi-adventure but on a deeper level, is a symbolic narrative open to many interpretations--moral, psychological, political, social--which created a lively discussion in class. I can now better appreciate it as an adult. It is about a group of schoolboys, marooned on an island and in due time turns savages. Golding's pessimistic premise was that left to ourselves, mankind would regress to barbarism and savagery--a very grim view of the nature of man. But he didn't want to be realistic about it because Golding calls his books fables. He was a school teacher (that may perhaps serve as another reason why this was required reading for a majority of schools) and his World War II experiences in the Navy and years teaching small boys have helped to shape his philosophical attitudes. It was very much evident in the &quot;Lord&quot; as this was his first symbolic novel.The major idea of the novel is that evil is part of human nature (so forget about the idea of ending all wars) but not of civilization which is an absolute must to restrain humans. He wanted to stress the parallelism between the adult and children's world and that both have the capacity to destroy: the boys the island, the adults nuclear war (remember, this was first published in 1954--when the Cold War was in full swing). Golding criticizes the idea that science can explain everything but Piggy believes that science explains everything, that there is no evil except the ones created by troublemakers. And yet Piggy participates in Simon's murder and was not very convincing when he would not accept his own guilt. As for the 'noble savage' living happily in the wilderness as described by the French writer Jean-Jacques Rousseau, uncorrupted by civilized life--Golding attacks Rousseau's belief that humans in their natural surroundings are rational and good and that society corrupts humans. On the contrary, according to Golding...civilization is needed for saving man from their brutish, destructive instincts.The novel has so many numerous overtones and symbolism, which needs a certain level of maturity in order to be appreciated. And so after many years have elapsed I find it now more engrossing than ever. If you want to be entertained but at the same time challenged...this is the book to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is one man's cry to the world, often at times very witty and sarcastic. As the seemingly simple plot advances, many values of the &quot;modern culture&quot; are questioned, exploring how, as a society, we came to accept shocking practises/truths as normal.Most of the negative reviews are the result of NOT understanding the book, and it is very ironic that a book this open in its messages is not understood by the majority of people. This book is a must-read for everybody, especially if they try to understand human nature, the basis of society and action and why people behave the way they do.I highly recommend this ground-shattering book. Everytime you re-reading the book, one finds a new layer of understanding. How the social codes develop, how we are living in the illusion of safety and education and to which degree this is embodied inside us. This book will certainly scare many people by showing them how strong our instincts, and ID are, with a dangerously convincing style."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I hated this book, along with my other book i had to read this summer.

I would not resort to killing people after like the second week. Then there is the fact of Ralph. Ralph is really arrogant of Piggy's feelings and eventually starts becoming annoying. Piggy is the only real character I liked next to Simon. Jack is really arrogant also. He is so immature that it is almost laughable. Didn't these kids come from a private school? My gosh, to think that one week on an island could make some of the worst sins be committed by 10 year old boys....The whole detail of the story becomes a little to fine for its own good. The pictures the author describe have no meaning to me. Apparently there is a square, pink piece of land jutting out of the beach. What? The whole end of chapter 3 was the worst when Simon walks through the forest. I just stopped caring about how that blade of grass was bent at a 76 degree angle.For those who want a great book try Tolkien or R.A. Salvatore.

The group is around 15-20 kids. The kids get to choose a leader so they can have everyone in control so nothing can go wrong (even though there is always something that goes wrong).Then later on the book a lot of kids get hurt and there are no adults to help them. Well, I can't say no more because then I will give the end to the story and it wouldn't be interesting anymore, but you will enjoy it.

Upon arriving at the island, they have a group meeting, and when Ralph is voted chief of the island, Jack is left as an also-ran. That's something what I liked about this novel, the whole idea of children being captive on an island, living of pigs and fruit, and trying to maintain a civilization with order and authority all by themselves.However, I am surprised that I actually finished this book. This book is beyond the most boring and dull book in the world. It seems as if William Golding spend weeks on each paragraph and dialogue just to sound so absolutely intellectual to the highest extent. From the looks of it, I'd say that he tried way too hard to impress his Oxford college friends. Unless if you are really into the symbolism or if you have a master's degree with an English major, then you would have been able to understand everything in this book. From every significant event, to every detail expressed about the children's actions or their surroundings, it is better to have Cliff Notes by your side if you wanted to catch every little segment of symbolism and importance."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"While this book was well written and created vivid pictures, I was disturbed by the the theme of this story.

Since it was required of me to read this book in school, I was forced to make my way through each dragging chapter, but I would have never on my own time, and it's not because I didn't understand the book that I feel this way about it. My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism, which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings, the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders. If the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective, it would make more sense, but in order to understand its symbolism, one still has to read it, and it is really not worth it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I first read this book 30 years ago for a high school English class.

Golding's message that mankind is imprisoned by civilization, and once we are freed from it we will return to &quot;savage&quot; roots is baseless and nihilistic.

Obviously it's flawed because otherwise we would never have achieved civilization in the first place. Besides the general degredation of humankind that Golding appears to relish, the book also fails because of its silly, deus-ex-machina ending. In short, about the best thing that one can say about this book is that it's widely read; but then again, so was the Little Red Book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies was without a doubt one of the stupidestand most pointless books I've ever read. Some people say it had adeeper meaning, a meaning that could change the readers life. To those people I say, &quot;Get a Life!&quot; There was no meaning or point to it at all! The book was about naked kids running around killing each other for no reason. It was retarded! It's not even worth my time writing this review - the only reason I am is to warn others who might innocently pick up the book because they heard it was good. My advice: don't waste your time or money (this book doesn't even deserve to be rated as 1, but I couldn't get negative numbers)!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is the only book I've ever read that I actively dislike. I'd be tempted to say that it's an accursed book. The imagery is somewhat confusing and, when worked out, sometimes means the opposite of what I think it should mean. There is some semblance of a plot, but it does not follow a clear story line. The thoughts behind the book are garbled, the language often muddy, and one has the feeling that if there had been just one female on the island of whatever age, none of the events would have happened. These were not the actions of boys. It was not a representation of society. It butchered my mind as surely as the schoolboys butchered each other."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"What struck me the most about The Lord of The Flies, was the ease with which Golding conjured up a world of kids: their habits, reactions and responses. The story is about a group of British schoolboys who are, after a plane-crash, left on their own in a lonely tropical island. The story is basically an allegory; and Golding does his work marvellously. The gripping story has a clear, straight-forward narrative, and is certainly one of those books I wouldn't mind re-reading, over and over again."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought the novel Lord of the Flies by William Golding was an exceptional story to read. The book is about how a group of children got deserted on an untrodden island and how they try to survive and get rescued. Children probably would not like the horror, but the book is suitable for teens and adults. Golding used many devices including symbolism and he also didn't finish the book completely, which let the readers choose what will happen to the boys. He ended the book with a guard finding Ralph and a few little ones while Jack and his crew was still missing. I didn't like the end of the book or the symbolism because I don't adjust well with these aspects.Even though it was a fantastic book, I thought some of the scenes were disgusting. For instance, some of the descriptions of the pig, Simon, and Piggy's deaths were gruesome. Golding used descriptive words to make you imagine what was going on. When those events were about to happen, Golding used foreshadowing. The story is so unpredictable and suspenseful that readers are on the edge of their seat. Golding wrote amazingly with not many boring and slow parts. However, there are a few confusing parts in the story that are complicated to understand. Overall, Golding did a great job rewriting the story with a different twist from the book that started it all - Coral Island. In fact, this is one of the best novels that I ever read. I would rate this book 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the FliesEricAt the beginning of the book a plane wrecks on an uncharted island in the middle of an ocean. Two of the survivors meet up at the very beginning. Their names are Ralph and Piggy. Ralph finds a shell like horn called a conch. Ralph blows into it and all the survivors hear it and make a meeting. The middle of the book consists of the kids forming a society, more like a society of dictatorship. They all are anxious for power. All the more stronger kids are taking over. At the end of the book Jack and Ralph are battling for Piggy's glasses and Ralph gets them back.The main character, Ralph, is tall with broad shoulders, brown hair, green eyes, and he looks like he would be a boxer. He is a good leader and is trustworthy. We share the same traits by our broad shoulders and brown hair. I'm not tall but he is.I really liked the book because it explained that it is impossible to run a country without leaders and without rules you should always have a couple leaders and rules."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"What happens when a bunch of civilized schoolboys are castaway on a tropical island with no parental authority or supervision? Without the influence of civilization, what is left but barbarism? Obviously the law of morality is quickly replaced by the law of the jungle. This has to be one of the great novels of the 20th century. And I love the themes explored here. The story premise is great too, and well-executed. What is so original and moving about Golding's work is his profound understanding of the human capacity for evil and guilt."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"After reading this book, I couldn't help but think of the boys whom I know. It made me wonder with which camp they would align themselves: Jack's or Ralph's. The frightening realization is that there are so many bullies out there aged 12 and younger who would probably turn out just like Jack or Roger if left to their own devices. I shudder to think of how right Golding was in his theory that man is easily swayed by fun and immediate gratification, and that remorse and compassion are considered weak and disdainful emotions. This book will be lost on the young reader, who lack the understanding of the use of metaphor and symbolism. Viewing a rendition of the island while reading the story provides a helpful guide through Golding's description of it. A couple Web sites to see maps are homework-online.com and gerenser.com. Don't read the character or story analyses until you've read the book, though, or you'll spoil the impact of the story, but definitely read them after you've finished the book. Lord of the Flies will leave a lasting impression on its readers and, hopefully, will make them realize the importance of belonging to a civilized society."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was rated number 41 on the Modern Library's top 100 list, though after reading it I felt it should have been rated higher. On the surface, this is a simplistic story and a rather short one at 200 pages. What is brilliant about this book, however, is Golding's ability to craft a powerful and timeless statement about humanity and mankind. His prose is concise and focused, yet his ability to paint a picture of castaway life on a tropical island is every bit as good as much longer tomes. I found the breakdown of civilized values played out on a beautiful tropical island to be a terrific dichotomy. The interplay between the English school boys and the brutal reality of survival on an island provided numerous intersections in a brilliantly interwoven plot. The end result is a rather haunting reminiscence of this story after you've finished reading it. This is similar to Robinson Crusoe or The Count of Monte Cristo in that they are all stories we know. Yet, going back and reading them again as an adult brings new worlds of meaning and perspective along with perhaps a new-found appreciation for why they are timeless stories to begin with."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The first thing that got me was that this is very similar to the Catcher in the Rye when it comes to how fast I was able to read this without getting bored. I think William Golding has created a very distinct book on humanity, as well as an interesting story that I had to read twice before I understood it. ^_^"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Personally, I didn't completely like Lord of the Flies but I still give it thumbs up for the outstanding plot. It began rather slow and dull and continued that way until about three- quarters of the way. I believed too much symbolism and much unnecessary high levels of vocabulary were used throughout Lord of the Flies. Considering this book is required to be read in the English classes of most high school students, I believed it should have connected to us in a more straightforward manner as in contrast to a symbolic way as it did. Furthermore, when I begin to read a novel I am usually brought in or attracted by the beginning of the book so I can keep interest in it. If I had not been required to read Lord of the Flies, I would have almost certainly stopped to read it due to the lack of enticement and hooks in the novel.Towards the end of Lord of the Flies is where the book began to get interesting and truly began to hook me into reading more and even reading ahead of the class. Even though it gets good in the end, if you look at it from another point of view, things begin to get a bit out of perspective and maybe out of reality. That's when you must realize that these kids have been stranded on an island for an incredible amount of time and things can sometimes get out of control; you'll have to read the book to find out exactly what happens. Even though I didn't personally like Lord of the Flies, I still believe every sophomore should be required to read it due to the great storyline and I also believe it is different from most novels but in a good way."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by Golding is a perfect novel.It is the story of English School boys during the war times. The boys are on an airplane heading for sanctuary from the war, but their ship crashes and the boys are deserted alone on an island in the middle of nowhere without any adults. The children plan to set up their own government to rule them. They believe they can create the perfect civilized government on their own. One of the boys even comments; &quot;We're not savages, we're British&quot;But the boys soon give into their animalist urges of hunger and fear and turn into reck-looses and savages in the name of survivial.This story is perfect social commentary.Also like the children becoming savages with out parents to guide them; its an example of how humanity becomes animals without a God. As suggested by the very title of the book &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;; which is a biblical name for Satan (Beelzabub -Mt.10:25;12:24,26/Lk. 11:15/ Mk.3:22)This book is a clear example of what happens when people worship the god of the earth by give into their animal instincts and choose to ignore the God the father."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies... boring? Now that's a new one on me. Golding wrote his book with young readers in mind--the very sort that would enjoy action, and adventure. And perhaps more so young male readers as his experiences of children and their behavior are from a boy's school playground.Some reviews have the effrontery to suggest that this Nobel prize winner adjust his style to accomodate their laziness. To that I say... Nuts! The ignorance is in proportion to the self-righteousness of the young critics who are prompted by their teachers to write such tripe. And there is no shortage of opinionated critics who haven't made the least effort to try to understand the book or attempt to read authorially or for that matter examine themselves in a critical light.At least have the curiousity to find out more. There are plenty of smart readers within easy reach. If nothing else, read the Coles Notes, York Notes or any critical guide for that matter to get a sense of how much one can get from reading and re-reading this book. Is it really cheating if you do it responsibly? And by the way, there is a purpose to the book's detailed (what some impatiently call the \\"boring\\" and \\"long-winded\\") scene descriptions. Find out what critics say.The beauty of the novel (the writing, that is) lies in the poetic descriptions that we are offered. Some reviewers talk about the \\"realistic\\" flavor that Golding brings to the story. Far from being \\"realistic\\" I see these scenes as having a dream-like and timelessness about them. When Simon lies in a trance in his hiding place near the clearing, watching the butterflies above the tall grass, there is a sense that time has stopped. Human time has little significance on the island. Watching butterflies may be \\"realistic\\"; but the full value of the scene comes through the words which form the less-real images in our reading minds. They are vivid, but being \\"realistic\\" is hardly the point of the scenes. Experience is. A very new, strange, unusual feel to our lives. Isn't this the value of writing literately? Not to offer realistic images of \\"real\\" life but to offer unspoken, often unthought but very much felt experience and sensation. Anyway, the butterfly scene connects to another one, where some of the littl'uns are playing at the edge of the beach. The narrator offers up images of distant shores and time and the movement of rock and sediment. The sheer scale of cosmic time compared to the puny activities of the children (pooping, hunting, fighting, squabbling) is breathtaking. The narrator treats us to poetic visions--what some reviewers lumpishly call \\"all that long-winded description.\\" To cut scenes like this out would be like reducing a poem to some prosaic \\"message\\" and claiming that it all \\"boils down to the same thing\\". Such nonsense.A teacher's chestnut for this novel (judging from some of the reviews) is to have a trial to wind things up. I cringe when I hear this. What young readers are being asked to do is assign blame and re-establish a moral order that Golding puts precisely in question throughout his novel. The last paragraphs drive the point home."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"i had to read this book for school and even though i found it very disturbing and sad, when you examine the whole book as an allegory and see what each of the characters represent, you see that this book was not written for entertainment but dor the author to prove his point which was that the nature of all humans is naturally evil and without societys rules the boys, who had been well educated and pampered turn into savages as their makeshift society breaks down. this book is for those who are looking for a thought provoking book and are not afraid to read a slightly disgusting/disturbing book to get it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"\\"The Lord of the Flies\\" is an epic adventure full of fear and suspense that leaves its readers on the edge of their seats, wondering what will happen next. It's about a vast group of boys who are marooned on an island and forced to create their own society. Without parents to guide them, the boys slowly let go of civilization and their savage nature emerges.My favorite part of the book is where the group of boys are fully consumed by the primal evil that dwells in their hearts. Their feelings of fear and rage rise up and force them over the edge. They snap and kill their friend Piggy by crushing him with a boulder.I recommend this book because it puts you in a state of mind where logic is bent and twisted. It gives you a peek at insanity. This book has non-stop action and it allows you to vividly imagine what is going on. I couldn't put it down and you won't be able to either."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This novel is unquestionably my favorite book. I enjoyed every minute of the text, and enjoyed analyzing it even more. With highlighter and marking pen in hand i went page by page and discovered the true depth of William Golding's writing in the tale of a band of young and adolescent boys whose plane crashes onto an uncharted island, and in the absence of adults they create their own world complete with government, conflict, and even bloodshed. In this ultimately dark novel, one witnesses Golding's unparalleled talent in storytelling as a means of intelligent propaganda, the story itself being a microcosm of the world war that was going on at the time. It's a fascinating read, whether you choose to read it for its deepest meaning or its most simple.I highly reccommend reading this book. Though a mere high school senior, as a well-read student/bookworm I have not been met with any classic or modern novel that has captivated me with every word in the way this novel has."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding addresses what happens to society if the norms are broken down and anarchy takes its place. Golding uses English school boys stranded on a remote desert isle for his study of society. At first, the boys agree to work together with Ralph trying to maintain order by assigning various chores such as food gathering and keeping a signal fire for search and rescue attempts. Not long afterward, Jack challenges Ralph and lures the boys away to live like savages hunting wild pigs and running around in paint. As jack gains power among the boys, Ralph finds himself suddenly being hunted by his former friends.Lord of the Flies is an intense look at larger society if the norms are ever overturned. At first it is fun acting any way one wants when there are no adults to oversee. However, the mundane chores stop being done and order breaks down. The young children that were being looked after, just disappear without reason and nobody seems to mind or notice. The savage group reacts alomost with casual abandon when one of the group is accidentally killed by the rest. When order is tried to be reinstated, chaos reacts swiftly and harshly. Lord of the Flies is both a great read and a very important book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the novel &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot; by William Gerald Golding, a group of English schoolboys get deserted on an island after a plane crash, left alone with no adults. This book follows the day to day life on the island, cooking, hunting, and the desperate struggle to keep their smoke signal going. However, as civilized as these children appear at the start of the book, the call of their savage, human, inner soul is too strong for them, and the instinct to survive forces them to undergo a a shocking and terrible change. The book, using dramatic imagery and a disturbing plot drew me into its fast paced world, where I discovered shocking and horrifying secrets about the human spirit let loose. The book was severely disquieting, yet its strong and bewitching plot made me read on. Ending with a roar, this masterpiece alarmed me greatly, yet I still recommend it to a young adult reader who is willing to let a gripping page-turner sweep them away to a land that they have never dreamed of."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Although it is a social commentary, similar to &quot;Heart of Darkness,&quot; containing a pessimisstic view of human nature, &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is also an adventure novel. A scatter of British schoolboys are stranded on an island paradise, and they form a little ordered assembly, which, according to the rules of Murphy's Law, goes to pi. It is a stark, beautiful book, which near perfect writing. What do I mean by this? It's not just well-written, but it is perfectly focused, perfectly edited. Think of the Western &quot;High Noon.&quot; Every line of dialogue was key in revealing the plot. There was no one standing around and just explaining things, like in &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot; Things are expounded through actions, through thought, so that every word has meaning, and every meaning, entertainment value. I'm surprised at those who found it boring. I can't offer any persuasion -- you have to be willing to read it, and it won't appeal to everyone. But the reason this book is so terribly disturbing is that it is so &gt;realistic&lt;. Not to give away any major plot happenings, but recent (within the last year or so) news events only make some of the more grisly things in the book seem closer to home, and therefore more unsettling, which is maybe why a lot of readers found it too shocking to appreciate. Just try not to think about the symbols when you first read it, and think of it as an adventure book.

Baring in mind that it was written during the time of WW2 and the Nuremburg War Trials it is not surprising that the book discusses the essential evilness of man. It is a harrowing tale of a group of young boys stranded on an island and the slow descention into a savage existence. What makes the book so brilliant yet so disturbing is that it cronicles the feelings each and everyone of us have felt at some stage of our lives. One is prompted to ask the question, &quot; In a world dominated by humans, in a world in which we have progressed so drastically what seperates us from animals?&quot; It is bleak but true and the deep psycological symbolism of the characters and the events make it something special and deserved of its reputation as one of the key books of the 20th century. Like &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; and &quot; Heart of Darkness&quot; it make us think about humanity and makes us question our existence.

It must have happened at some point, that a group of people declared themselves worthy to judge for our youth what would teach them to love reading, what made a good story.I love reading. I love a good story. I hate Lord of the Flies.As hard as the educational system tried to force me to read and appreciate their endless list of disturbing books, I still love reading good ones. And when I think back on these school-supported pieces of filth, Lord of the Flies stands out as the top representative of what is awful in a book.I get what the man was going for, what he was trying to say about humanity. I wish I could say he was dead wrong about human nature but indeed I think he accomplished just what he set out to do. That got the novel one extra star. No more. Yes, when left to their own devices, a group of innocents could very well turn savage.And that's exactly what is wrong with making young people read it. Is there no other novel to teach them about human nature? They'll hate whatever we give them, true, and maybe that's why they have been given such vile specimens, to save the good books for them to appreciate later. But it's no excuse...When I read this in school, it was horrible enough in print, but then they saw to it that we watched a dank, dark, desolate motion-picture rendition as well, in order that we might forever have burned into our memories the image of a little boy being speared by bullies and a plump boy being crushed by a boulder shoved by those bullies. All it did was give kids nightmares and serve to punctuate the message they'd been sending us all through school: bullies will have their way and adults will remain absorbed in their own problems and let them.Some people like a book that makes them feel, whether the emotion be good or bad. By all means, if you don't care how you feel so long as you're feeling something, read this book.But if you're a teen who has been depressed, living with harsh conditions, facing problems without seeming to find anyone on your side, lay the book down. Read a nice mystery, Jane Austen, Terry Pratchett, Douglas Adams, something that will make life have a little joy in it. Lord of the Flies has been written with the singular ability to suck out whatever joy remains.Shame on anyone who decides this is the sort of book, out of all that were ever written, that young people should read. We are not all stable, healthy, sheltered innocents who need to see the gritty side for our own good.Now bring on the \\"not helpful\\" ratings that will be assigned by all those who have already read it and like it and don't really need to read a review anyway."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Upon his return from World War II, William Golding wrote the book Lord of the Flies, demonstrating how the war had altered his view of humanity and the evil it was capable of. Borrowed extensively from R. M. Ballantyne's The Coral Island, Lord of the Flies is set on an island that acts a microcosm of WWII. The school boys demonstrate what Golding believes will happen should man be unleashed into the wild with no society to monitor his actions, what will happen when man gets in touch with the primitive evil inside him. Using supposedly innocent children to enact this tragedy, Golding makes his message even more daunting and thought-evoking.In the midst of war, a plane evacuating a group of school boys from Britain is shot down over a deserted island, far off course. The story follows the boys' attempts to survive and to be rescued. It follows their process of electing a leader, the battle between Ralph and Jack, and the island's descent into chaos. This novel is pretty intense. The allegorical struggle between good and evil is suggested in the title of the novel. The title is said to be a reference to the Hebrew name Beelzebub (literally \\"Lord of Flies\\"), a name sometimes used as a synonym for Satan.The story, which seems to be another survival story, keeps its readers engaged with the tension contained in the calm yet eerie narration. The mystery laced yet seemingly uneventful opening of the novel immediately captures the attention of readers and holds them in a sort of frustrating suspense as they wonder about the meaning and significance behind the introduction. As the story develops and the island is enveloped in madness, the reader wonders in horror at the savagery such young and supposedly innocent children are capable of. Without any sense of morality and other societal influences, children are the perfect subjects in this examination of true human nature.The syntactical structure and the abundant imagery truly make Lord of the Flies a graphic and daunting read. Variations in syntax between long, continuous lines and choppy, rhythmic sentences help readers visualize and relate to the situation in the book. Be it the pounding nervousness as their camp is invaded by children gone wild, or the frightening image of the \\"lord of the flies,\\" each scene is intensified by the author's mastery of language. It helps a reader further delve into Golding's microcosm of humanity as the boys' descent into savagery threatens our faith in the good of humanity.Despite the magnificence of its message and the remarkable skill with which this novel is crafted, I definitely do not count Lord of the Flies as amongst one of my favorite books. I personally felt that Golding was far too pessimistic in his view of humanity. While the story does serve was a frightful caution sign, it does not reflect the whole of humanity. Golding seems to have been greatly affected by his experience in WWII. It is true that war brings out the worst in people, but it is also true that war and savagery do not define our existence. Perhaps I am simply far too optimistic but I feel that just as there is innate evil in the world, so is there innate good. That is why the struggle between good and evil is a ever present theme in both literature and life.Lord of the Flies is a great read if its allegorical message is taken with caution. Its deeply developed characters add complexity to this mind shaking story. The suspenseful plot in addition to Golding's eerie narration makes Lord of the Flies a novel that will leave you shivering. All in all, it is worth the read. That is unless you'd rather go for something less philosophical and more simplistic."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's view of humanity is needed now more than ever. After watching two world wars in his own lifetime, Golding began to wonder whether man was really good or evil and this is what he explores in the novel. The story is very well paced and there's a lot of symbolism throughout the novel. This is one of those books that I would use sparknotes to find the connections if you're not reading this for a class. The connections are fascinating and really make you think about things that are going on right now in 2009. This is a classic that has stood the test of time and it deserves that distinction."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Many books try to show the essence of human emotion and feelings. Another common theme is to show the innocence of children in a world of adults. William Golding's Lord of the Flies Golding finds the true balance of the innocence of children with human instinct when it's thrown into the midst of the jungle.In Lord of the Flies, the reader is placed into the world of children as they are stranded on an island. In a world without order, the kids have to rule themselves and make their own law. Soon the strongest of the pack come out and rule the weak-hearted. If a child disobeys the higher power, they get punished the sentence of death.The characters of Piggy, Jack, Ralph, and Simon are characters that everyone can relate to. They all express different human emotions that are inside of all of us. From the strong leader Ralph who leads the children, to Simon who is the boy who could lead the children in a peaceful and productive way of life.Many people say that there is too much symbolism and not enough on the story. I don't agree with this because the symbolism is what makes the book so powerful and lasting. Symbolism is something everyone can relate too and makes the reader think.Golding's goal to show children breaking down into basic human nature works perfectly in this story because all the characters feel real. He makes the characters crash so much that they feel like normal kids but, they still have animal characteristics like the urge to kill that make the kids so complex. He also makes the characters likable and more believable without overdoing it.To Sum it all up, I love the characters and the symbolism in the story. The Characters are well developed and have depth which is nice to get once and a while and the symbolism makes the reader think about human nature and emotions. The weakness I see is that it takes a while to get into but, if the reader continues to go through the story and stick with it, the reader will find the story fun and endearing. Personally, it made me think about life and how at the worst of times people become monsters and do not listen to themselves."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this novel in my Honors English class, my junior year in high school. This book completely changed the way that I read stories.Classic! There is a depth to the book that you have to search for. I have never read another story with so many underlying messages and metaphors. Once you see them, you'll never read the same again!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"LORD OF THE FLIES, by William Golding, is one of the best books to come along in literature since Chaucer and his CANTERBURY TALES. Mr. Golding writes beautifully and poetically of this tragic commentary on humans and our society, making the story of these young boys all the more poignant and thought-provoking.This book is not for the weak of mind, nor the faint of heart. Several high school peers of mine found it \\"boring and stupid,\\" simply because they felt there was not enough adventurous action and \\"too many big words.\\" They did not understand that Golding wrote as many of the time did, with detailed description of the small things, so as to give the reader a better vision of events and enthrall them further with the story. Truly, this may be his greatest strength: his ability to completely captivate the reader by way of giving descriptions so thorough our mind cannot blur it.Many of my peers also would've liked \\"more blood and guts.\\" It's a shame they did not realize that Golding did not write of gruesome things to revel in the macabre. He wrote of these to make stick in our hearts the tragedy that young boys, devoid of civilized society, had no ability to stop themselves from committing atrocities. For one to read this book looking to enjoy an unremarkable fairy tale, where things end as happily as they begin, I'm afraid one would be sorely disappointed.I, however, was not disappointed in the least. I expected great things from this story and I received them: an enthralling plot, sincere characters, vivid descriptions, beautifully tragic writing, a deeply affecting social commentary and an ending that keeps you on the edge of your seat.If anyone is bored with a simple movie, I'd suggest buying a copy of William Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES. This is one adventure that will never disappoint!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Well, most people in America have already read \\"Lord of the Flies\\" by William Golding, which is definitely a classic. So I'm not going to give a synopsis, just a general appraisal of the work.The main characters (Ralph, Jack, Piggy, Roger, and many more) are very complex and very riveting. You can clearly observe their distinctive personalities with their actions and their dialogue.

After the crash, a boy named Ralph and a boy named Piggy come together and use a conch shell to send out a noise to alert the other boys to come and meet them. A tribe of mixed ages is formed by their efforts, and the little ones of the tribe starts seeing a beast during the night. Shortly after the sighting of the beast, the tribe kills their first pig. While the tribe is busy killing the pig, however, the signal fire goes out and a ship passes by. Between the pig and the fire and the beast, the tribe has too many disagreements and splits into two clashing tribes.This book is about a test of will and leadership of the boys because there is no guiding or advice for the boys to follow. This is a study of how some people might come together and bond while others will become enemies with no one to rely on for help or friendship. Somehow, against all odds, the boys survive for a period of time. This book is definitely worth reading and would be perfect for kids between the ages of ten and twelve who like adventure stories. The author is very descriptive and uses intimate details to describe the setting, but also writes in a classic style with some words or sentences that are added unnecessarily. The character's emotions and thoughts are described very well and it feels like they have realistic troubles and ideas. The book has a very interesting and exciting plot that incorporates the characters and the setting very well. The dialogue is also very realistic and interesting. This book is a great read that will never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This was a great book. I had to read it this semester for my English class and I loved it! The way he describes things are amazing. I couldn't believe what happened to Simon! I was heart broken. This story should be read from High School and up! I was a little nervous at a few parts but Golding really pulls you into the story and makes you feel as if you were there yourself. You can put yourself in the place of his characters and live their lives and see through their eyes. I truly loved this story and i think that you will too."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Unlike most graduates of American primary and secondary schools, I managed to get through high school without reading William Golding's Lord of the Flies. I first read it to familiarize myself with the text in order to better assist a student I was tutoring. Since its publication in 1954 readers and scholars have found it to be a perfect subject for infinite speculation and theorizing as to its philosophical and allegorical underpinnings. But even apart from theory, Lord of the Flies is a marvelous novel for its attention to pure story. My recent re-reading of the text revealed Golding's real gift as a writer is in revealing tone, voice, emotion, and character."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by William Golding is one of the best books I have ever read. It shows that the line between civilization and barbarism is narrow. People are capable of doing heroic things and committing horrible acts of cruelty under the right circumstances. Golding has perfectly captured the tensions inherent in human nature.Golding has created a scenario where a group of boys were marooned on an island after a plane accident. No adult survivors were to be found. The boys came together, chose a leader, and created a system to organize life on the island. At first, the boys were enjoying the carefree life. Ralph was the boy who was chosen as the democratically elected leader. Piggy was his intellectual friend who had several physical maladies. The stronger boys on the island resented his presence and did not appreciate the talents he brought to the table.Jack was the antagonist of the story. He wanted to be the leader, but the boys feared him and were more comfortable with Ralph in charge. Ralph called the boys to assembly with a conch shell, a primary symbol in the book. Jack led a group of boys to hunt for meat. He killed a pig and put the head of a swine on a pole. It was surrounded by flies and created a horrible sight.The amiable early days in a tropical paradise soon came to an end. Jack led a mutiny against Ralph. He attracted the boys by asserting his power. The members of his group painted themselves like savages and lost their inhibitions. The group became more and more barbarous. Jack became a dictator who ruled by fear and the other boys fell in line and did his bidding. Jack and his gang killed Piggy, which was metaphorical of the might makes right line of thinking in Social Darwinism. Ralph managed to escape with his life as British troops came to the rescue. The boys contemplated the horror on the island and were moved to tears.This book shows that society can fall apart quickly without safeguards. It shows that all people are capable of evil under certain circumstances. It is a sober warning to protect freedom. Golding fought against the Nazis in World War II and saw people not too different from himself be capable of joining a bandwagon and committing acts of unspeakable cruelty. This book offers the reminder that we should all look at ourselves and keep the beast within under control. The biggest threat to civilization is found within human beings, not from outside entities."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is Nobel Prize winner William Golding's vision of what would happen if a group of schoolboys was marooned on a sub-tropical island. The descent to tribalism and savagery is not reassuring, but Golding may well have been right for all that. He gave them a relatively hospitable environment; not populated with dangerous wild beasts, capable of feeding them and providing fuel, and with a warm sea for swimming. They established a forum, elected a leader, appointed certain boys to particular roles, and set about maintaining a column of rising smoke to draw the attention of any passing ships. The smoke, and the fire generating it, become a major theme of the book. The fire gets out of control and a boy disappears, presumed burned. Serious tension arises when the group assigned to maintaining the fire chooses instead to hunt wild pigs; a ship is briefly seen on the horizon, but at that critical time there is no smoke from the island to attract it. The fire is moved to a more accessible place on the island, but at cost to visibility. Then the hunters, who quickly become a majority of the boys, set themselves up as a separate community on a different part of the island. They lack fire, so set about stealing it. Had they asked, it would have been given to them. Then it occurs to them to take by force the means to make fire.As I read the book I was moved to recall social relationships and conflicts in the classrooms and playgrounds of my own experience, and to reflect on the value to growing children of the oft-resented adult ordering of the world. One could read and enjoy the book at that level and leave it there. But, if we are minded to follow, Golding offers to take us further. It seems the world beyond the island is engaged in nuclear conflict. Can the adults be imagined to have got things right? How did they get themselves into that mutually destructive situation? Has the adult world not also descended into tribalism and savagery?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. I'm not one who enjoys books of this sort and when I began reading the first chapters, I strongly disliked it. The first chapters are slow and hard to follow along and the symbolism can be tiring. However, once you get further into the book, small things happen that leave a reader wondering and you can't help but continue to read on and on. One cannot help but make connections over and over again when reading LotF.LotF really works your mind. Nearly everything in the book is a symbol of something else. This given fact leaves you wondering what everything could represent, from Piggy's glasses to the beast. You'll find yourself cheering on either Ralph or Jack and you will feel like you are fighting to survive with everyone else. The details paint such a vivid image in the reader's mind that you'll feel as if you were there. A reader will be lost in the movie in their head.I do reccomend reading Lord of the Flies & I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Although the story of the book was decent, and the symbolism very complex, I did not really agree with the message of the book, and found its theme unrealistic. I don't think that the situation would collapse into anarchy but instead primitive government, such as in the beginning of the book.The desires of the boys to \\"just have fun\\" were very unrealistic and counter-intuitive. For example, not one person outside of Ralph and Piggy truly care about getting off the island. No one misses their family, and it is not even mentioned. There is no discussion of the boys' background except for the fact that they are English, and nobody ever thinks about it. It is completely unrealistic to ignore the fact that in the real world, the first priority of the boys would be to try and escape and go back to the civilized world.Secondly, the overwhelming desire for meat, which is supposed to symbolize the savagery in humans, is highly exaggerated. The fruit on the island is plentiful and there are many resources. The boys never have any problem getting food and realistically would not engage in such frivolous hunting for meat.I also found the characterization extremely flat. The characters are just faceless names on the page outside of Raplh, Piggy, Jack, and Simon."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding portrays war as a seemingly inescapable and integral aspect of human culture. Humans, in any setting, can default towards their darker nature. Golding concedes that we have this nature but the moral of his story is that we must struggle to overcome it. Analogous to experimental design in a laboratory, Lord of the Flies is Golding's research study. In an effort to control for all variables, the research design encompasses subjects, pre-adolescent males, placed on a deserted island isolated from all societal variables. His hypothesis is that, inherent in human nature, if there are enough people to form groups, they will form factions and go to war. His experiment illustrates the darker side of human nature by controlling for as many factors as possible.Early in the experiment, the subjects attempt to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the political and social order of modern British society. Ralph, the natural leader, and Piggy, the detached intellectual, attempt to hold parliamentary assemblies, build living quarters and schedule common duties. However, as time passes, Jack and his \`tribe' break off from Ralph's chiefdom in order to avoid all forms of thankless toil and drudgery while enjoying superior opportunities for \`fun' lifestyles. Jack is solely interested in hunting which for him encompasses plunder, tribute, and glory. Ultimately, murder, mayhem and debauchery ensue. Through free will, the boys drift towards humanity's darker nature. Golding's experiment demonstrated that evil cannot be blamed on someone else or another culture because we are all inherently capable of evil.Golding wrote Lord of the Flies in the wake of World War II. The cold war was in high gear and people were still wondering about how the Holocaust could have happened. The book represents an effort to answer the question, \\"Why do humans keep doing such awful things to each other?\\" During the story, the reader is reminded of the outside world of adult war. Although not expounded upon, the reason the boys are stranded on the island is due to an atomic war that led to the boys being evacuated on planes. Later in the story, as a sign from the outside world, a pilot is shot down, apparently dies in the crash, and lands on the island. The dead body becomes the unseen mystical \`beastie' that the boys fear in their nightmares. For Golding, war is a societal evil. Golding reduces the greater evil to its lowest common denominator to show that war is not caused by an evil leader or evil country; the enemy is within."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"First off I really want to state how dissapointed I am that I did not enjoy Lord of The Flies more. The concept is one of the best in the history of literature: The balance between democracy and human nature is challenged when a group of upper class school children are stranded on a remote island and must struggle for survival and order. Genius! Golding is a good writer, but there was something missing from his writing that kept it from being as gripping as the works of Orwell, Huxley, and even Joseph Conrad (which this book is often compared to). I read 40 pages of this a day and when I stopped I never had the desire to go on and find out what happens next. Nor did I really care about any of the characters. I'm not sure if it was Golding's intention to make these characters two dimensional, but I honestly couldn't differentiate many of the children from the other: with the exception of Ralph, Jack, and Piggy.Saying that the novel does have alot merits. Golding really takes advantage of this setting, and has a great gift for detail. When I was reading this, I really did feel that I was toughing it out in the jungle. Also The pig head scene and the last 50 pages are fascinating, intense, and classic. The problem is that we have to go through 100 pages of Piggy shouting \\"I've got the conch!\\" and one tedious fire argument after the other to get there. Like I said before, I love the themes to this work, and love books about the dark side of human nature. Which is why I am so saddened that I didn't like this more. I know Lord of the Flies is and will continue to be seen as a classic among numerous literary enthusiasts, and I respect their opinion. I just don't wholeheartedly agree with it. Maybe I should watch the film."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The story of how some kids survive the life on an island is told brilliantly by William Golding.

It was often referenced in other book discussions in classes and I had a very general feel for the overarching plot of the book, but I'd never actually read it. So, I finally did.For those who somehow haven't heard of the book or know anything about the story, it basically involves a bunch of British schoolboys (probably aged 6 or 7 through early/mid-teens). During wartime evacuation, the kids all crash land on a deserted island and are the lone survivors (no adults). Timeframes are somewhat ambiguous but over time, one of the kids, Ralph, becomes a \\"chief\\" of the group and comes up with plans for survival (shelters, food, etc) and escape (keeping a signal fire going with green wood/leaves nearby to send up a flurry of smoke). As time goes on, order is pulled apart either from youthful desire for fun over work or from coercion from Jack Merridew and his group of boys, \\"the choir.\\"The general plot of the story is interesting and reminded me a little bit of Robinson Crusoe and his desire to bring civilization and order to his little island. This book had more psychological themes going on though since there were many people on the island and they were all either very young kids or young teenagers pushing into self-consciousness and evaluation.The book provides interesting insight into the thoughts and desires of kids as they work towards adulthood. These kids are generally younger than what one might consider a \\"young adult\\" but they're forced into a very adult situation. We get to see a number of different reactions. These range from the strong desire to maintain order and civility by creating and enforcing rules based on ideas from the adult world to the youthful desire for fun unbridled now that there are no adults to stifle entertainment to the completely savage nature of play as the kids revert back to their savage natural state in the wild.Most of the people who saw me reading this book were quick to let me know how much they disliked it. I can see the reasons for distaste. The themes are harsh and uncomfortable. The end result of the story, even though it has a \\"happy ending\\", are does not provide a happy, enthusiastic view towards humanity.A lot of the writing style was very descriptive and evocative and just plain lovely to read. A lot of the theme and tone of the book was very unsettling and hard to read. This juxtaposition left me feeling mixed about the book. While I may not like the story or what it proposes to say about humanity, I can certainly appreciate the message it's trying to convey and the way it does it.There's a lot going on in this book and I certainly don't feel like I've unpacked it all. At the same time, I'm not particularly eager to go back and read it again to try and unpack more. I saw some definite commentary on humanity, on \\"civilization\\", on war, on psychology, religion, etc. I can see why it's taught in schools and see how it could provide intense discussions.However, I worry that some of the themes and concepts may be lost on too young a reader. And it may not even be an \\"age\\" thing as is shown by some of the events in the story. Just like some of the kids in the story were not ready for what they were forced to undertake, I would worry that if a child is too young or emotionally/intellectually immature, they may not recognize the message and allegory in the story and will either leave thinking it's just a fun adventure and (who knows) will strive to go out hunting boars themselves, or they could come away emotionally troubled without a good outlet to deal with it.I'm glad I read this. Not one of my favorites, but very thought provoking. I have no intention to hand it to my 11 year old to read (even though he's begged me to let him) but I'll gladly discuss it with him if/when it's assigned to him in High School."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Ever fantasize that you are on an island free from the restraints of society? William Golding has taken that scenario to the nth in this story of a bunch of English boys, plane wrecked on an island during WWII.We see the fabric of society slowly and most assuredly ripping as the rules are discarded one by one.

If you read it then, try it again now that you are all grown up and can view it with an adult mind.If you haven't read it at all, well every thinking homo sapien should read it at least once.If you are interested in the relevant socio-psychological interpretations that abound about it, look at a couple of the other reviews here. I'm not going to go into a deep interpretative analysis of the various themes etc as everyone else is doing a good job of them.All right, one thing they do seem to have missed is that the title is taken from a pigs head on stick, swarming with flies, which is used as a representation of evil and engages in an hallucinatory dialogue with the Simon character (who is a kind of religious entity, almost christ-like).

This classic book explores the events of a group of boys trapped on an island from a plane crash. The story is not only of the struggle to survive in nature but to survive eachother.

But, with further reading and understanding of the book, I really came to love it. I wouldn't hesitate in calling it my all time favorite novel. On the surface, Golding seems to be merely telling a tale of a group of boys stranded on an island. However, a closer look reveals Golding's true intentions of depicting the world and war as depraved and corrupt. He has an extremely pessimistic view of human society and this can be seen through some of the actions of the boys. I would also like to say that Ralph is a great character and the movie is one that should not be missed!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Two things make this book tough going: its slow start, and its use of flowery language. You just have to plow through the first few chapters to get to anything interesting, and there are times that you just dread the fact that the dialogue is dying down and you're about to be &quot;treated&quot; to one of Golding's run-on descriptive passages. Nevertheless, it is worth it. When things pick up in the middle of the book, it becomes easier to see how the flowery language is there to create mood, and to show us, not what the island is like, but what it is like to a group of lost, scared boys. Once you start to be able to follow the mood Golding is trying to create, that's when this story about the pulling away of the thin veneer of civilization that humans wrap themselves in and the revelation of the savage with-in really unfolds for you. And that's when you realize what makes this book so powerful and enduring."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this book has many symbolisim,and it is mainly about human behaviors.

When I actually began to think about it, I realized how relevant Golding's work is to our species.

Some may find it sickening, some may find it boring, some may find it confusing; I found it beautiful.

Although it's been 50 years, his story remains timeless. It deals with the pure essence of what it is to be human, and how it is to loose that humanity. The event begins as a group of boys find themselves alone on a deserted island after a severe plane crash; they are quickly drawn toguether by a conch blown by Ralph. Since the very beggining of the book a conflict of interest is noted between Ralph, the leader; and Jack, the hunter. This conflict does nothing but expand and broaden, until finally all hell breaks loose. Lord of the Flies is more than a story, it's a walking breathing epic of symbolism, as colourfull, lively and destructive as the human race itself."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I was in high school a lot of my friends had to read \\"Lord of the Flies\\" for English (like it seems most people do) but for whatever reason my teacher did not have us read it. So, after hearing good and bad about it I decided to give it a try.I am sure everyone reading this is familiar with the story, but even if you already know it, nothing prepares you for actually sitting down and reading it. In fact, I would say that it worse when you knew what would happen. Golden presents an interesting character study that can be taken in numerous directions. As soon as the story opens we see who is who and the individual character traits for the boys and it quickly becomes apparently which boys will turn. This is not to say that the book is predictable- it's just (for lack of a better reference) like watching a car crash in slow motion.I would recommend this to anyone. It's a very easy read and the story is one that you can interpret in all different ways."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I found this listed when I searched for children's books for 4 - 8 year olds, showing up with things like Good Night Moon. I would not want to discourage anyone from reading this book, because the story is classic, but I simply think it's worth mentioning for any parents who might not know: this is NOT something to read to your 4 year old. As mentioned in other reviews, it is very dark and possibly upsetting. Animal Farm, which comes up along with this is also a wonderful book that is better read in Junior High than First grade."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a poignant, allegorical novel which offers an interesting view on human nature. Something raw and primitive in humans exists, it says. Golding artfully describes the boys' gradual descent from civilization to savagery from the day they arrive on the island.The boys end up on the island in the first place because they were to be evacuated. There is an accident of some sort and they land on the island. So begins the story...things will happen on the island to boys like Ralph, Piggy, Simon, and Jack that are unforgettable and sometimes tragic.One thing I would like to point out: Another reviewer who also used a kid's account says:Everything seems to be going well on the island until they discover the body of a dead pilot and mistake it for a terrible monster.Really, nothing ever went \\"well\\" on the island. From the beginning, there was a loss of life (a littlun with a birthmarked face). There was tension between Ralph and Jack during the election for chief. And even before that, imagery and other literary devices (such as foreshadowing) hinted at darkness which lay ahead. The reviewer is suggesting that had the corpse not been seen, everything would have ended happily. (S)he seems to be forgetting that the reason the corpse was thought of as a beast was because of talk of a beast (as well as shortsightedness). The boys were descending into barbarity; the \\"beast\\" was only one event which catalyzed the transformation.It is also a poignant coming of age story, where the boys understand what being a human can mean. It is a loss of innocence for many of the boys. Ralph's ordeal is followed in particular. The reader also sees the others' struggles. Yes, one ought to feel sorry for Jack as well, who, through bloodshed & other things, has now opened his eyes to the world, which is often ugly.All in all, it's a memorable tale. Some have evidently read it as nothing more than an adventure tale. But, it has much more than a simple chain of events. Golding's book is laden with messages, if one ponders upon his writing."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"\\"Awwwwwww\\" screamed the Littlun, \\"It's a beast\\". The older boys reassure them that it's only their imagination, because that's all the littluns have for comfort. English boys stranded on an island with no first aid kit, nor any food. They have to try and stick it out and build some sort of a community until they get rescued. But along this journey, survival becomes betrayal, and back stabbing. Ralph, the main character, convinces everyone that they all have a part in living, and having some part of getting saved. But the rebel of the island, Jack, has a different plan. Becoming obsessed with killing and ruling above everyone, including the leader Ralph. They try, Ralph's plan but all fails and chaos strikes, with Jack leading the way.

First all the boys crash on this deserted island after being shot down by a bomber. Within a few days they burnt down half the island killing a boy and broke up into groups with a killing machine and a democratic leader. Needless to say they start by killing the weakest and last killing the smartest. The only problem with this is that they are only twelve year old boys who at the very least could have a civil war within a matter of days.I think Golding had a great point of what a society would do to itself and he showed the power children had which was in fact, just a minor display in comparison to the great civil wars within our own countries. The only deal with this is that it wasn't very believable. Aside from that he perfectly displayed his point. He portrayed every character as a crucial member of society. You have Ralph who's the democratic leader believing in order, Jack who was the dictator or person that believed in his own way, Piggy the smart one who had all the right ideas, and Simon who was the more spiritual one who rather would do his own thing and believed in helping others and looking out for the smaller weaker children. You could see this in each person and connect in some way because Golding always displayed them doing the very things you saw them out for. At any rate I would at least say read it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book lord of the flies written by William Golding was a very good novel. It was a revelation to the real world. Golding is an awesome writer with a brilliant mind, he uses allegories and everything is a symbol. All of the characters stand for something or a certain group. For instance jack stands for the bully and piggy stands for intelligence and civilization. The conch stands for order and authority and the paint the boys put on their face stands for chaos and savagery. My favorite part of this book was the death of Simon. It was so brutal yet it added so much meaning and mood to this story.In this book the author is showing us how we as humans behave and how our actions affect us. How we are all savages in reality even though some are worse than others. This book shows how the island was like a miniature world and how humans would act. The intresting part about this book was that at the time it took place a war was happening. The events related to what the adults were doing at the same time. I think that you should read this book in order to understand correctly our nature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A book of little boys who are trapped and turn on one another, good story line but where was the story. The story is told from a view that all mankind will resort back to animal ways unless &quot;properly guided&quot;, without any possibilities that it could turn out good in the end. True the boys had their fears about the &quot;unknown&quot; but mankind is not only motivated by these thoughts and this is the underlining message of the book. If you do read this book just keep in mind that we as a society are still capable of reasoning without having to resort to violence."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book two years ago for a grade 10 English class, and have not had the chance to reread it, but I do remember it well. The premise is not especially exciting initially, but it becomes a living parable of terror.I find it interesting that the author used boys as his subjects rather than little girls, or both. But would this have changed the outcome? That is something you must decide for yourself. Also, when finally &quot;saved&quot;, the naval officer is confused as to what the boys are doing exactly, and yet Ralph knows exactly. Perhaps children are not as intellectually inferior as we are assumed to be.Though chilling, I highly recommend this book, as it gives a startling clear view of broken society. It's pessimistic, but perhaps, all too realistic."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"On completion of reading this book I felt that it was unfinished. I went through so much struggle with these young boys only to have someone come save them from themselves. I felt that this book promoted a socialistic ideas; portraying the metaphor that humans cannot rule themselves, they need the government (or in this case, adults) to come save them. What a disapointment! I found Lord of the Flies to be extremely irritating to read. I might have to read it again when I'm older like others have recommended. This book is worth reading, but be ready to have the hair on the back of your neck stand up!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Certainly a text of vast philisophical importance, Lord of the Flies is first and foremost a riveting and rapid read. The descent of the unstoppable rollercoaster of terror allows the reader to experience firsthand madness, sadism, torture, survival, and killing. One of my favorite books, and one of the scariest I've ever read. Its all about entertainment, folks."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think this book is easy to read but hard to understand. Though it is hard to understand, it is a good book to read. It's a story about these kids that get stuck on an island and have to survive for a long period of time. They learn to find food, keep warm, and not to go crazy. But after a while, the kids will be separated and do there on things. This book is about survival and how to get along with everybody. Also to keep cool in bad situations. I think people that have time on their hands should pick this book up."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The basic idea behind this book is Freud's theory of the id, ego and superego. Ideal for armchair philosophers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's classic seems to be misunderstood by many readers. I do not feel that The Lord of the Flies was a book advocating atavism (the return to primitive instincts) nor a book about male bonding. The Lord of the Flies deals with &quot;man's essential illness&quot; -- the potential of all human beings to exhibit an evil nature. &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is the English equivalent to Beelzebub, another name for the devil. In the book, Simon's obvious similarities to the Christ figure further the validity of an interpretation of this book as a representation of the continous conflict between good and evil within human beings -- &quot;at once heroic and sick&quot; -- and the implication of societal restraints, or a lack thereof. Reading this book will provide valuable insights into human nature as well an engaging story."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The main reason why I didn't like this book too much was because I couldn't relate the way that the people lived. The lesson that I got from this book was that real friendships are hard to come by. Real friends are those who cares and treats you for the real you. Even though real friendships are hard to come by, there will be one of them for at least one time of your life. Don't throw that away. After reading this book, I feel lucky for the friends that I have because not everybody will have the same luck that I have had of having them."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this novel a long time ago in its Russiantranslation (a reasonably good one), but it goeswithout saying that the original is vastly superior to any translation.The entire novel is symbolist - from the very firstsentence to the very last, and in this symbolism lie both its strength and its greatest weakness. The problem is: it is *too* neatly symbolic, all symbols fit too perfectly into the author's preconceptions. This book is definitely a fable (as opposed to fiction), but for a fable it is a very good one."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Here is my literal interpretation of Lord of the Flies.It is a novel about children, and one of the few novels ever written about children that does not turn them into creatures of myth. Think about it. In becoming adults, we assume a very distant and elegaic picture of the beings we once were.Happy.Carefree.Innocent.All of which is so much bulldust. Happy? Childhood is a period of time spent in constant waiting for the transformation to adulthood. No, we weren't happy. Carefree? Hardly. Reckless and foolish, perhaps, but every child has its worries: we all remember the monster under the bed. And innocent? A child is innocent up to the period when it encounters other children. Bang - end of innocence. In group formation, we learn the real truth of the world. And that, really, is what happens on Golding's island. There is plenty of analysis to be done on the allegorical nature of the story, and its laid on thick symbolism. But it also succeeds merely as a tale, something that might have happened. And we read on, horrified, ensnared by complete and utter _plausability_. And as a final word, it is not that surprising that Lord of the Flies should remain such a controversial work, school reading assignments notwithstanding. As someone who I've inexcusably forgotten once said, &quot;If you make someone think they're thinking, they'll love you; If you _really_ make someone think, they'll hate you.&quot;"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book when I was in seventh grade, and it made me want to read. I'll be minoring in literature next year in college. A contemporary classic, perfect for anyone who wants a quick, but enriching read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the book Lord of the Flies by William Golding, the true nature of human beings comes out. The book starts out with a group of innocent schoolboys that crash land on a mysterious island.. The boys begin playing and having excitement all the while loosening themselves from the morals that society has taught them. The choir leader Jack becomes obsessed with hunting and satisfying his immediate wants whereas the chief Ralph becomes focused on the long-term goals of the group. One night while all the boys were chanting to the beast, a boy named Simon stumbled out into the middle of them and was killed in a fit of fear and confusion. Soon afterwards the boys split into two groups, the savages and Ralph's group. The two groups get angry over a conflict involving fire and in the process another boy is killed. The savages embark on a hunt to kill Ralph soon afterwards. The island is set on fire and just when it looks like Ralph will be killed he stumbles into a naval officer.There is one major theme throughout this story that Golding tries to show. It is the question of where the roots of our instinct come from. Throughout the book the question of whether civility, or savagery are more deeply rooted in humans. Golding implies that in certain situations, humans become cruel. They are violent and fearful of things like the beastie. The book points to the conclusion that humans are cruel but society shapes us into being more humane. The civilized Ralph, and the savage, dictator-like Jack represent the two sides of the conflict. They are both in a constant struggle and just like savagery, Jack beats out Ralph in control of the island. The killing of Simon shows the loss of almost all civility on the island.In Lord of the Flies, Golding uses symbolism to show the influence of society and the breakdown of those ideals. Piggy's glasses show the intelligence in society, as seen when they start the fire, \\"His specs-use them as burning glasses!\\" When the glasses are broken, it shows the loss of intelligence and rational thinking among the boys. The fire that is used to attract ships represents what left of civilization that the boys have, for example, \\"Any day there might be a ship out there and if we have a signal they will come and take us off.\\" As the book goes on the boys take less and less care of the fire. Eventually Ralph and Piggy decide not to keep a fire going, showing how even they no longer see society on the island. Finally, the beast represents the evil inside every human being as the Lord of the Flies explains, \\"You knew didn't you? I'm part of you?\\". The only person on the island to realize this is Simon. When he attempts to tell the other boys, he is savagely killed in a bloody dance, only furthering his idea about the cruelty in humans. That is how symbolism is used in Lord of the Flies.The book Lord of the Flies was interesting and would be an excellent book for people to read who realize the problems of society or just want a good book to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book \\"Lord of the flies\\" starts out with a group of Brittish boys that are stranded on an uninhabited island. Things start out great and the boys assign eachother jobs and responcibilities. The leader of the tribe is a boy named Ralph. But soon the boys become to interested in hunting and Jack (another boy in the tribe) decides to start his own tribe. Ralph is ok with this move because he thinks that Jack will come back to the group soon. But Jack doesn't ever come back to the group and ends up killing Simon (a member of Ralph's group). Jack's tribe is becoming violent and very savage- like. When Ralph confronts Jack's group about restoring peace and finding ways to get off the island, another member of Ralph's group gets killed (a boy named Piggy). Now Jack's group wants to get Ralph out of the picture and try to kill him, but right before they are going to do him in a Navel officer comes onto the island and stops the madness.I belive that the theme of this novel is evilness in chidren. This is the main because it is stated throughout the entire story. Golding shows and belives that children are born with evil and society makes us nice and polite. Golding also symbolizes this concept in many ways. One of these major symbols is Jack. Jack is relitively nice at first but as the story progressives and more chaos and fear is developed he becomes more agressive and evil. Another symbol is Piggy. Piggy was the symbol of intellagence and knowledge. When he was killed, it was Golding's way of saying that without rules and guildlines evil will always conquere good. After reading the book I could say that I realy enjoyed the book and it got me thinking about what life is realy about."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's book LOTF should be a \\"classic\\" for many things such as its left feeling of shock, and its questioning of mankind's existence or purpose. To begin, when Piggy is killed, it is heart-wrenching, \\"Piggy's arms and legs twitched a bit, like a pig's after it has been killed.\\" (pg. 165) Roger unleashed a gigantic boulder that crushed Piggy. His blood washed away in the ocean. Next, Simon's death was very depressing, \\"The water rose further and dressed Simon's course hair with brightness. The line of his cheek silvered and the turn of his shoulder became sculptured marble.\\" (pg. 140) Simon was gruesomely murdered. He was found at the bottom of the cliff, dead. Last, most of the boys became hunters, \\"Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!\\" (pg. 138) This shows that being a savage is part of mankind. The majority of the people are hunters that just want to cause harm. Therefore, Golding's book should be a \\"classic\\" for its shock, and questioning about mankind.Second, Golding's book LOTF should be a \\"classic\\" because it shows insight into mature of human experience, makes a social impact that might change legislation, and the book has unique languages. To start, it is a dog eat dog world, \\"Which is better--to be a pack of painted Indians like you are, or to be sensible like Ralph is?\\" (pg. 164) Ralph won't fight to kill, but the savages have no problem killing Piggy. You either kill or get killed. Then, democracies are better than dictatorships, \\"...Which is better to have laws and agree, or to hunt and kill?\\" (pg. 164) Ancient civilizations with dictatorships never lasted as long as democracies like Greece and Rome. Jack and his savages run a dictatorship, while Ralph runs a democracy. Next, all the boys have a British accent, \\"We musn't let anything happen to Piggy, must we?\\" (pg. 106) Musn't is British jargon. Also works like asthma changed into \\"assmar\\" in the book. In all, Golding's book should be a \\"classic\\" for its insights, social impact, and unique language.Again the book LOTF should be a \\"classic\\" because it causes the reader to re-think their beliefs, and it questions conventional or standard ideas. First, the book questions evil in boys, \\"Shove a palm trunk under that and if an enemy come...\\" (pg. 96) The boys don't even have true enemies, yet they prepare for battle. Evil starts to grow in them. Next, if adults can stop the children's war, \\"I should have thought that a pack of British boys...would have been able to put up a better show then that...\\" (pg. 184) Who is supposed to stop the adults' wars? As soon as an adult showed up the boys ended their fighting. Finally the book questions standard ideas like boys getting along with each other when their lives are on the line, \\"Ralph showed his teeth at the wall of branches...snarled a little and waited.\\" (pg. 177) Jack wanted more power and used it for evil. There are certain people who go against the standard ideas. All in all, Golding's book LOTF should be a \\"classic\\" because it makes you re-think your beliefs, and it questions conventional and standard ideas."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies takes place on a deserted island during World War II. There is a plane carrying a group of school boys to safety from the war zone area. The plane is shot down. The boys find themselves on the island alone with no adult supervision.The major characters in this book are Piggy, Ralph, Simon, Jack, Sam and Eric. The boys elect Ralph as their leader and develop their own form of government. Because Jack is power hungry, Ralph decides to let him and Jack's choir take the role of hunters. It is their job is to hunt and provide food for the rest of the tribe.Now, one of the younger kids on the island thinks he sees a beast at night. The other boys laugh at him and say that there's no such thing as a beast. However, even the older boys become afraid at the possibilty of a beast. Eventually Jack and his hunters find hunting thrilling becoming obsessed with it. As stated in the novel, \\"The two savages raised their spears and spoke in time. The chief has spoken\\", said the savages.(p. 141). This leads to conflict between the two groups. Jack and his hunters value hunting more that Ralph and his tribe.Ralph and his tribe value the signal fire which they decided was key to their survival before rescue. Ralph states, \\"We've got to keep the fire going. There was something good about a fire overwhelmingly good. How else are we going to be rescued?\\" (p. 163). Then one night while the twins are keeping the fire alight, they see a strange object. This object frightens them and tricks them into thinking the fire is the beast. In reality the \\"beast\\" is a dead man moving around in his parachute. They are fooled by the wind blowing the man, thinking it is the man moving on his own. One of the twins reports back to Ralph. Fear strikes the tribe. Jack and his hunters want to kill the beast. Ralph decides to go with them to investigte the beast. The trio of boys are scared off by the same thing that the twins saw.As fear envelopes the tribe, Jack and his hunters break away from Ralph's group. A kind of war is started when Jack and his tribe control a part of the island and Ralph control the other side. While they are hunting, Jack and his hunters kill a pig and cut its head off as an offering for the beast. The pigs head symbolizes savagery. The boy's fear of the beast causes them to do savage acts.Meanwhile, Simon decides to see if the beast is actually real. He climbs up onto the mountain and discovers the dead pilot. Simon realizes that he must tell the other boys about what he has seen. On his way back to the beach he sees the pig's head on the stick.Upon seeing this Simon has a dream and faints. As he reaches the beach to tell the others what he has seen, he is killed by the boys. The other boys from Ralph and Jack's tribes are having a feast, dancing and celebrating their power over the beast.Because all the boys have a type of mob mentality they mistake Simon for the beast and kill him. The next day Piggy and Ralph decide that they have to go and talk to Jack and try and get their fire back. Remember, Jack and his tribe stole Ralph's and Piggy's fire from them during the night. Piggy ends up being killed and Jack and his tribe chase Ralph all over the island. Jack and his tribe end up destroying the island because they lit it on fire.Ralph finds a navel officer who rescues the boys. I think the point that Golding is trying to get across is that mankind is evil. He is letting us know that evil has always existed.I enjoyed the novel . The symbolism made sense to me. Evil really is a fear that we all deal with. To use this language was creative."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's Lord of the Flies is one of the most intense and disturbing novels I've read. Golding truly shows the brutality of human kind in his main themes such as, there is no hope for mankind and, man is the beast. Simon, the Christ figure in this story, is shown the truth about mankind when it reads, \\"However Simon thought of the beast, there rose before his inward sight the picture of a human at once heroic and sick.\\" Who or what brings our inner evil out? In the book Jack is the force that brings out the beast within the boys. This theme is restated to Simon when the Lord of the flies says \\"You knew, didn't you? I'm part of you?\\" If Simon is the only one who really knows the truth then, why is he killed? Perhaps the killing of Simon states that, mankind does not want to accept that we are indeed evil. Is there really any hope for us?No hope for mankind is another theme that William Golding states. The naval captain judged the boys as innocent and harmless. The captain said to Ralph \\"Fun and Games,\\" but Ralph informs the captain that two kids were killed. If the captain saved the boys from their supposedly harmless war, will God save mankind as well? Does he also think, that mankind is just having \\"fun and games\\"? Also the conch in this story represents civilization and power, but the conch is destroyed by Roger. The hope of civilization and mankind is crushed by a beast figure. Because we are the beast, there is no hope for mankind."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"What a book.This book deserves the 5 stars because it contains everything that a reader could ask for in a true classic.With only 184 pages of simple words, Golding has created for us a book so powerful that seems like the ultimate resolution for every quandary, however trivial.

Just thinking about them literally makes me shiver.I may not be an 'as-experienced' adult reviewer like some out there, but William Golding and his words, and the truth in them, hit me hard."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book peers into the dark side of human nature in a way that is honest and direct.

If you like books that leave you thinking, you will enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"One of the most influential and important novels ever penned, \`Lord of the Flies' may be even more poignant today then when it was initially released. Telling a very realistic and moving story set in a very unrealistic backdrop \`Lord of the Flies' works on almost every level of literature to provide the reader with an all around emotionally gripping experience, and one they won't soon forget.As a plane carrying a group of young children is shot down during warfare the valuable cargo is spread out over an uninhabited island. The boys quickly must for their own civilization with only a sliver of hope to ever be found. The story mainly focuses around three very different boys. Ralph is the chosen leader, a boy who possesses common sense and an open mind. Piggy is his self-ordained advisor. He's the smartest of the boys but the most nervous and thus becomes the easiest target for the ruthless. Jack is one of the more ruthless, a born leader mostly because of his strong presence. He immediately attaches himself to the idea of hunting and becomes infatuated with the prospect of spilt blood.There's a scene in the novel where Ralph and Piggy lament over not having any adult supervision, not having a grownup tell them the course in which they should plot. Sitting back after reading this impressive classic and one will realize that adult supervision, or lack there of, was not the problem. The problem was that these boys grew up way too quickly. The problems that ensued were a direct result of their acting as adults, pursuing leadership and power and respect and authority. The clashes between Jack and Ralph and Piggy were all over power, over who had the right to rule and who would follow who.The novel opens with a glimmer of hope, that maybe just maybe with all the innocence in adolescence they may be able to survive in cohabitation without debilitating consequences, but almost immediately those hopes are smashed as the personality traits of the three main characters are uncovered and problems within the group begin to surface. The conclusion, as grim and tragic as it is, is a conclusion that is almost expected and best left to the readers discovery.\`Lord of the Flies' is classic for a reason. It's brilliant literature with meaning for all of us today. As we all may know full well, there's a lot we can learn from our children, but sadly, there's a lot our children learn from us that can be detrimental."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"What would happen it there were no more rules and if there was no one to answer to? Would we remain civilized? Probably not. This is the situation a group of school age boys find themselves in and they soon find themselves resorting to their baser instincts. Some even begin to go a little mad.This was the first book that I read that I actually enjoyed. The scene that sealed it for me was when one of the main characters began to hallucinate that the severed head of a boar was talking to him. That scene was so vivid it felt like I was watching a movie.This book would be great for young boys who don't like reading."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's Lord of the Flies is an excellent book, despite my first impression that it was extremely sadistic and gory. By the time I was nearing the end of the book, I could not put it down. Golding's literary genius allowed him to incorporate several important symbols, interesting characters, and relevant themes into a relatively short book. The story is suspenseful at times and is always interesting. I wish Golding were still alive so he could write a sequel about the boys' lives after leaving the island."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding mercilessly shows Homo \\"Sapiens\\" as it is.

On the one hand, it was extremely exciting and fast paced in its general plot and description, and this made it fun to read. On the other hand, it was full of dark, ominous, foreboding, and at times downright terrifying symbolism. I am normally not a big fan of excessive symbolism, and this book had more than I had ever encountered. This alone would not make me dislike a book though. I found myself genuinely loathing the savages, and this, while it drew me into the book, also made me hate reading it. I coulnd't shake the feeling that something terrible was going to happen, and when it did the feeling didn't go away. All things considered, I certainly feel that this book is superbly written and does a wonderful job of conveying its message. However, I coulnd't stand the fact that the message was basically that humans are inherently evil. I couldn't disagree more, and while I may be labeled a deluded optimist, I can't bring myself to believe that some schoolboys on a desert island would end up killing each other. I found the thought most disturbing and depressing, and that was my overall impression of the book.All in all, this was a wonderfully done book with a clearly conveyed message, and I am glad that I read it. However, I disagreed with the message, and found the book to be quite disturbing. My review couln't be much more mixed up, could it? I would suggest that you read this book, but be prepared to be shocked and detested."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I really liked Lord of the Flies(I liked even more when I found out that one of the Simpsons episodes were inspired from it). I read this book late last year...it is about an all-boys scout getting into an airplane crash and getting stranded on a deserted island--with no adults supervising them. First few days work out so-so but then it starts turning into cave-manism(if that's a word) and then later on canabalism(almost). This book really teaches a lesson, about people, how they really are. And it's about 3 kinds of people; the good, the bad, and the evil."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is actually the only book I read that we were suppose to read when we were in high school.

I could picture myself in these kids shoes trying to survive, struggling for leadership and trying to stay cool when faced with totally anarchy. A great book for high school age boys if you are trying to get them hooked into reading. Very fast paced with little down time. Could be a one sitting read. What a great story."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read some of this book in high school, but read it in its entirety recently to see how I felt about it as a 32-year-old adult. I enjoyed it somewhat.It is a good plot concept in general, with lots of opportunity for analysis and psychological scrutiny. However, oftentimes I had a difficult time believing that the characters were children, because they seemed to behave a little too adult for their age. The writing was a bit verbose for my tastes, although not excessively so. Because of this, it didn't suck me into it's world entirely, and it wasn't something that I was very enthusiastic about finishing, except to find out how it ends.Overall, this is worth reading if you have any curiosity about it, but it may take some determination to get through it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I gotta say, I loved this book. Leaving all the school reviews behind of foreshadowing and such, I really could associated with all the main characters and see it through thier eyes (except Simon, not much of a mystic myself).

It's IMO, a real reflection of human nature. READ IT!

I'd recommend it to people above the age of 14 because it's very wordy, and it may take quite some patience to get through it.Golding is a very verbose writer. He can spend an entire page detailing one quality of the island. It gets to be a little annoying sometimes, especially when the sometimes unnecessary details take the reader away from the story, and by the time Golding gets back to the plot, you've forgotten what the characters are doing and why. I will admit that sometimes, the wordiness got to be bad enough so that I'd skip over paragraphs with no dialogue and continue when the first character spoke, and I'd find that I didn't miss anything by not reading three entire pages on how the beaches shimmered under the noontide sun.But the book really picks itself up at the end, when Golding stops using so many details and the book concludes strongly. The last few pages are stronger than every page before it.Plus, Golding tells a great story through the book. No matter how much detail he uses, he is still a great writer, and this book really shows the symbolism he can use to build the settings, quirky and sometimes risky allusions to then-current events, and the ways the characters each served a role in giving the island its personality.A powerful read - definitely great for a class! It requires a lot of thought and even more patience. It's worth it by the end, though."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I personally really love this book.

There were two parts in particular, two of the main events, that as I was reading I literally felt sick to my stomach and had tears in my eyes. This book is really quite disturbing and I realise now that really it was a big ask to get a bunch of 15-year-olds to read and watch this and perhaps if my memory was better I could tell you why it didn't affect me like it has today but alas I cannot but I must say I also wonder why not, maybe it was just too disturbing and I blocked it, who knows?

It's always a little odd when you re-read books you read as a child, and find you've missed out on a plethora of content. ..At its core, this book is about the struggle within man; to live under the governance of civilization or to follow ones own desires, at any cost, and by any means. It's a question many of us face everyday. Most of us abide by society's rules, because we grasp the immediate benefits of doing so. Civilization guarantees a certain level of saftey, comfort, and happiness - if only at the expense of minor inconveniences. But what if all such guarantees were stripped away? Would we still behave, or would things quickly deteriorate?This book poses that question, and asks it of school-aged boys - people not yet inhibited by a lifetime of authority and rules. The result? A few try to rebuild and a few revert to more \\"primitive\\" states. Power struggles ensue, theologies are constructed, and even taboos like death and murder are demystified. The end of innocence and the thirst for power.The glamour of short term glory is pitted against the promise of a paramount but illusory goal - guess which one wins? This book can be read as a simple narrative, a philosophy, a social-experiment, an adventure story, a psychological treatise, or as a parable. It is intriguing at its least and brilliant at its best. My favorite character is Simon, a boy who tries to warn the others that ultimately, for man, their is no \\"beast\\" to fear - only the beast within."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this is a great book that shows the fallacies of human nature. i really enjoyed it and it has a great ending. everyone should read thsi book"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Categories ossify. Sure, they seem helpful at first. But soon enough they harden, and all you see is the name you've applied instead of the thing itself. Nowhere is this more evident than with literary fiction. To many, it's something with which teachers bore students, a stultifying sort of story that you ought to know about but don't actually need to read. More vexing is that quite a few of these ignored works have genre roots. Take William Golding's Lord of the Flies, a novel whose bloodlines contain post-apocalyptic, war epic, survival story and horror.The Communist assault on England has become so ferocious that Royal forces are evacuating children from the mainland. But soon after a flight of young boys lifts off, a nuclear strike decimates the airport. Then enemy fighters shoot the plane down, and it crash-lands on a deserted island. A tropical storm sweeps the wreckage (and a good number of the passengers) out to sea, and the survivors, a motley crew ranging in age from six to twelve, must fend for themselves in a world newly stripped of adults. They gather tropical fruit and hunt pigs with sharpened sticks. They start a small signal fire in hope of rescue. Soon a rumor begins to spread among the littlest boys about a bloodthirsty beast that slithers through the jungle, looking for what it may devour. The older boys scoff at such tales, though. They have more concrete troubles. Envy, rivalry and conceit have begun to fissure the bedrock of their new society.Literary fiction has earned the reputation of having fascinating characters that do absolutely nothing. But not Lord of the Flies. It moves, constantly and inexorably. Also, repeated readings reveal the delicacy of Golding's composition. He wastes nothing, nearly every sentence playing a needed part. A description of three boys rolling a boulder down a hill foreshadows a cataclysmic future confrontation. An older youth's willingness to pick fruit for the tiniest children reveals his unusual sensitivity, a sensitivity that may save or doom the island's inhabitants. And a fat kid's perpetual complaint of \\"What's grown-ups going to think?\\" over the group's immaturities adds a chilling irony to the novel's main theme, namely that, left to themselves, societies splinter.Though plot, setting and character hardly get short changed, theme really is Golding's primary focus. He wants to explore the problem of evil, the main reason for the world's suffering. It's a lofty goal, an easy one to blunder. Yet the depth of Golding's insight impresses. There is a beast the prowls the earth, but it isn't economic inequality or racism or sexism or any of the other isms. No, the beast is very near to us -- as near as breath itself."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"\\"Lord of the Flies\\" smells really sweet and as a fan of anything that is able to translate complex issues into simple ways I found Golding's work here to be incredibly great! It's really interesting to me about just how great classics like this one have the ability to reach the reader at various maturity levels allowing one to glean treasures through repeated reading over the years with each visit revealing even greater insights that may have been missed during prior visits. This to me is the definition of a literary masterpiece.Although I didn't have the privilege of reading this book in school as the powers that were at the time decided that for my year the books we had to study/read were Orwell's \\"Animal Farm\\" and H. G. Wells' \\"The History of Mr. Polly\\" I can easily see why for many other students this classic has been selected having just read it decades after my GCE \\"O\\" Level Literature paper. I can see many similarities between this book and Orwell's satirical masterpiece as both provide very good lessons about human behaviour under extenuating circumstances and about how the concept of \\"original sin\\" as originally described by Augustine in the 4th century B.C. is so close to the surface for humans and how conscious effort has to be made to guard against the ease of descending into animal savagery. Golding shows us why law and order/governance is absolutely necessary while Orwell shows us how the wrong kind of governance can also be undesirable. Just like \\"Animal Farm\\" this classic can be read at a number of levels and still be enjoyed from the very superficial adventure tale to the various deeper levels of complexity that you could care to dig into and hence extract the optimal degree of utility from your reading enjoyment. Elements from this novel reminded me of Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" as well although I feel Golding's work to be a lot easier read in terms of ability to extract the author's intended message. Golding's ideas live on and continue to capture the imagination in various guises such as in television e.g. \\"Lost\\" or even comedy in the movies e.g. \\"The Simpsons\\" remember \\"Emperor\\" Moe?This 50th Anniversary Edition hardcover version is also a treat coming in an attractive dustcover with raised gold print for the title and a few illustrations scattered within the text at the start of chapters as well as a section: \\"Notes On Lord of the Flies\\" comprising of an essay as well as another section: \\"Lord of the Flies: Selected Highlights of Critical Analysis\\" with contributions from various critics not forgetting the introduction by E. M. Forster. I also liked the rough-edged pages and the font sized for comfortable reading.An excellent classic that rewards repeated reading regardless of your age group given a worthy 50th Anniversary binding makes this a worthy addition to any library.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Not only is this book expertly written with an intriguing story line, it also contains vivid imagery and symbolism throughout. The book represents the very animalistic qualities of human nature and the settings in which it can be brought about. The novel is full of subtle symbolism, from Piggy's glasses, to the fire itself, and has an adventurous plot that is sure to keep the pages turning. The books central ideas and messages are conveyed accuratley and interestingly and do not disappoint. This book is a must read for all and is sure to become a favorite for those who embark on Golding's journey."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Mahmoud SarhanLord of the FliesWhat would happen if authority disappeared, people could do as they pleased and could fulfill their desires? CHAOS!! A recent example of the 2003 blackout in New York will suffice as citizens pillaged and raided stores stealing valuable and causing destruction. A more detailed example of lack of authority occurs in Lord of the Flies by William Golding, a thriller to say the least, takes the audience on an exciting adventure through the gates of social construction. Golding creates a world of chaos and freedom when a group of British school boys become stranded on a desert island. A struggle between the \\"rational\\" the fire-watchers and the \\"irrational\\" the hunters creates a whole new idea of complete freedom and independence. The boys split into two groups until the hunters lose all humanity and begin to hunt down the fire- watchers. The unusual plot makes the book a great read as Golding takes us into a possibly realistic situation revealing the human necessity of rules and boundaries. Lack of social control is a great theme in this book as wants and temptations cause selfishness and separation. I recommend this book to high teenagers and above allowing the readers to retain the full experience and meaning of the novel along with the ample symbolism and irony that occurs in Lord of the Flies. Golding is able to successfully show the fragility of civilization and what is needed to keep people in control. The major consensus that this book is an allegory of World War II makes sense as barbarism and war take place of cooperation and friendship."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I ordered this audio CD as an accommodation (academic support) for a special education student.

Which is better, law and rescue, or hunting and breaking things up?\\" (p. 162). Published in 1954, this amazing piece of work illustrates society and society's reaction to isolation apart from law. The knowledgeable Piggy, one of the many characters in the novel The Lord of the Flies, articulated this quote. This novel shows a group of young boys stranded on an island after their plane was shot down and the pilot killed. All by themselves, the juvenile, vigorous boys are trying to get off the island and get home ... or are they? Selfishness and a lust for power undermine the aim for rescue. While a few of the boys are working hard to obtain liberation from the atoll, several are obsessed with the thought of acquiring supremacy and relishing in the freedom and separation from their previous normal, boring lives with rules and adults.This story, furthermore, examines the hearts and motivations of mankind. The message is that deep down inside of us as humans is a bent toward evil. The author, William Golding, presents this point by demonstrating that when there is no one around to enforce law, evil comes out of the boys and, consequently, causes much mayhem and destruction. \\"The beast struggled forward, broke the ring and fell over the steep edge of the rock to the sand by the water. At once the crowd surged after it, poured down the rock, leapt on to the beast, screamed, struck, bit, tore. There were no words, and no movements but the tearing of teeth and claws\\" (p. 136). This quote shows how brutal and savage the boys have become. They strike with a mob mentality mistaking one of their own for the \\"beast.\\" Earlier in the novel, this very character makes a prophetic statement about the beast while addressing the group: \\"What I mean is ... maybe it's only us\\" (p. 77). He is saying that the beast, whatever it is, is the evil within themselves.Lord of the Flies is an exciting and riveting story that captures your heart. Some critics say the book ends rather abruptly, but others feel strongly that the ending is consistent with the author's purpose. The reader is left with a sense of contrast where instant law and order replaces chaos. Rich imagery and symbolism are discovered throughout the book and personal introspection is promoted. The book also causes the reader to take a deeper look at and analyze the true condition of the heart and soul of man and the role of society in maintaining morality. Lord of the Flies is an American classic and is written by the brilliant author William Golding. This timeless masterpiece should be read over and over again by every generation."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I really liked this book because it was so different. Some books are boring half way through but not this one. There was always something different and exciting happening. I imagined myself being stranded on an island, trying to survive and hunting wild bore. This book really keeps your attention."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Flies that Plague Us All\\"The most influential novel... since Salinger's Catcher in the Rye.\\" - Time William Golding's amazing novel, Lord of the Flies, is a thoughtful allegory that should be read and pondered by all people. The seemingly simple plot covers a world of intriguing themes and symbols. The diverse characters shape the storyline while at the same time represent ideas and concepts with deeper meanings. All should enjoy this marvelous novel.The book begins when a group of English schoolboys are stranded on a deserted island in the Pacific. A terrible storm causes their doomed plane to crash and with no adult supervision, the boys run wild. Initially, they elect a chief and call group meetings to discuss important things to do such as building shelters and maintaining a signal fire. However, as the boys bask in the joy of their new found freedom and find no limits to hold them back or adults to punish them for misbehaving, they begin their fall from the heights of civilization and order to the depths of chaos.In the novel, written after World War II, Golding portrays his views on society through symbolism and themes in the novel. One of the themes explores the nature of evil. The boys become very afraid of a beast that they are sure exists on the island. One of the boys, Simon, however, suggests that perhaps the evil is within them and not in the form of a beast. As the boys become more malicious in their acts toward each other, they undergo a terrible experience in which they lose their childhood innocence. They are no longer the good little boys who arrived on the island. Golding also makes a point about civilization and savagery. Towards the end of the novel, the boys signify that they have left civilization behind by smearing blood on their faces as war paint and making animal sacrifices. In addition to themes, symbols are widely used in the novel. The boys use a conch to call group meetings where each boy can voice his own opinion without interruption. The shattering of the conch signifies that the boys have lost their last shred of civility. By using symbols and themes to express his ideas, Golding has created a spectacular novel.Although the characters are only boys, they represent mature concepts. Ralph is the elected chief of the boys and is the image of kindness; he represents democracy. However, although his kindness is what gets him elected it is also his undoing. Jack is Ralph's opposite, using the boys' fear to govern them as a tyrannous dictator when order crumbles. Simon is quiet and spiritual; he is the one who realizes that the supposed \\"beast\\" on the island exists only in the boys' imaginations, and that the evil lies within the boys themselves. The scientist among the boys, logical Piggy, is the backbone of civilization. He helps Ralph make decisions as chief and is his loyal friend. A sullen, mysterious figure, Roger is probably the most feared of all the boys. He has no conscience, and without adults to administer punishment, Roger knows no limit to his horrific acts. By presenting the readers with these characters, Golding enhances his work significantly.Lord of the Flies is a stunning book that you should definitely read. All the elements of the novel hold the reader in a tight grasp all the way to the end. The themes and symbols are delightful to contemplate and certainly open one's mind. Golding's characters are very realistic and easy to believe. Readers aged thirteen and older should read this novel by all means."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is one of those novels that everyone should read.

The other boys, lead by stubborn Jack, wanted to hunt and kill.

Is it not human nature to rule and survive? Can the boys be blamed for losing their heads, especially under the conditions that they were in?This book was beautifully written, yet lacked absolute depth.

If you like long and adventurous books than this is the one for you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is generally read by students new to high school being slammed in the face with the shorter works of English that have been revered by academics. Such an introduction will often sour the reader's interest; deflate their desire to pursue a discourse with the fragile reality the author has set up. To those who enjoyed it the text can sometimes grow to take on a biblical veracity, spawning a cult of appreciation by the more pretentious of the youngsters who feel as though they'd accomplished something by getting something out of it. This is the perception of Lord of the Flies today . . .When I was assigned to read this book in school for some reason I decided to skip it. Who cares, I think I got a B on the test, and we moved on to Of Mice and Men or Death of A Salesman. Nevertheless, I found myself searching out this book again years into the future, possibly inquiring into the past over something I felt I'd missed.The result? A strong, swift book, sometimes beautifully written. On occasion a point is overexplained into the discussions and mired by the efforts of young boys speaking with an Oxford Graduate Student dialect. In other words, it sometimes gets pretty dull. The unreality of their speech is irrelevent, mostly, if only because Golding usually uses this technique to explain much of what is going on. It is a fine book among a long list of fine books about isolation, exile, lonliness, acceptance, faith, hope and civilization. If the book hadn't been so overwhelmingly sub-referenced I likely would have never picked it up and missed out on an enjoyable and profound--but perhaps getting tired as you begin to age--interesting little book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is one of the most brilliantly disturbing and terribly intriguing books I've ever read. Golding displays a gift of potraying darkness reminiscent of Conrad and even Euripides. The symbolism he uses is masterful. Very few writers would even think to use literal translations of Greek. Golding makes it the basis for an entire novel. The devil is in you and me, and Golding portrays this better than anybody else."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"After a plane full of schoolchildren escaping the horrors of post-atomic age Europe crash on a remote, hungle island, a series of debates, alliances, counteralliances, and hiearchies are established to create a rule of law and standards. However, once fear and psychological symbolism enters the picture, all is changes and this budding society of big-uns and little-uns, ranging from 6-12 year olds becomes encapsulated by an air of sadistic fog.Centering around the three main characters of Ralph, the elected conch-wielding leader, Piggy, the smart logical analytical scientist in the making, and Jack the hunter-gatherer adventurer full of blood-gutting passionate zeil. With these forceful characters in tow a series of events sets off a power-struggle that eventually yields to the emotional, non-rational, jumpy aspect of the human flesh in the name of Jack and his paint covered warriors gaining logistical control of the Island.After two viscious and violent deaths set off by stressful paronoia centered around the chances of getting rescued, the necessity to hunt for survival, mysterious forces and animals inhabiting the island (actually a dead human crashed by parachute), and the need to have a source of fire (i.e. Piggy's glasses), the death of Simon, who became possessed by the Lord of the Flies, an analogy to the dark side of human's dementia, he is killed in a frenzy after taking cover and protection inside the parachute layer. Afterwards, once Piggy seeks to reclaim his stolen glasses he is killed by Roger, a devious mischief maker.In the end, they are saved by a captain whose astonished when they admit to the death of two of their peers. Just as the Heart of Darkness revealed the dark forces unleashed by economic and resourceful greed, the Lord of the Flies showcases how this could come about from attention hording 12 years olds seeking to assert their status as leader and autocratic figure."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It has been years since I read this book but I remember that it is the book I hold the most emotional bond with. The characters touched the deepest recesses of my heart and held on. The strugles that Golding incorporates into this book are remarkable. They are realistic in the way that kids would possible go to such an extreme if a situation of isolation cropped up. I still want to burn the book, not out of hatred to the book, but out of anger toward Sam(or whoever it was I can't remember) who killed Piggy. I believe that it is a sign of a good book, when you WANT to destroy the book, not out of distaste with the writing or the idea, but out of distaste of the characters in the book, out of such a strong passion that you want to see the heroes enemies fail and not see the heroes fall.

It is kind of long but it is good."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a powerful story about a group of English schoolboys who have survived a plane crash and are stranded on a deserted island. In the beginning it seems like the boys will have quite an awesome adventure--they are completely on their own with no adult supervision. One of the oldest boys, Ralph, attempts to get the others organized so that they will have food, shelter, and a rescue signal fire.Ralph's logical approach to survival is soon challenged by Jack, the novel's antagonist, who is also in charge of the hunting. His desire for total power is quickly evident as he and his followers become increasingly wild, barbaric, and cruel. Their cruelty extends beyond simply hunting animals for food. Soon they are hunting and killing each other.While I did not particularly enjoy reading this book, I believe that the way the different characters are developed is interesting. Each of the main characters seems to represent an aspect of human nature and society. For example, Ralph represents the civilizing instinct in human beings compared to savagery represented by Jack. Simon, who is shy and more sensitive than the others, seems to represent the natural goodness found in people. Roger represents exactly the opposite--he is sadistic and very cruel. I think my favorite character is Piggy, because he is a very logical thinker and smart. Because I found this character appealing, his murder was very disturbing to me.Actually, the entire story was disturbing. It was hard to imagine that the boys waging this \\"war\\" against each other were so young--the oldest was only twelve years old. It was interesting to me that the more violent the story got, the older the boys seemed. I think what I didn't like was the implication that humans are innately evil. Goodness was portrayed as an aspect of civilization. As civilization deteriorated throughout the story, cruelty and violence increased. It seemed more natural to be evil than to be good. The severed pig's head (named the Lord of the Flies) mounted on the stake in the forest seemed to represent that innate evil. Since I don't believe that humans are naturally cruel and violent, I found this book difficult to read. It is not a book I would recommend."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The treasured classic Lord Of The Flies takes its readers through a remarkable journey of a group of English boys stranded on an inhabited tropical island.

It is about a group of British boys who get stranded on an island. At first the boys have good intentions, but as time passes those intentions change and they break up into 2 groups the fire-watchers which are led by Ralph and the hunters led by Jack. Ralph who becomes good friends with Piggy thinks more about being rescued and setting up sort of a community. Jack and the hunters on the other hand think more about getting meat and themselves. This book not only tells an exciting adventure story, though, it also describes on a deeper level, the thin line between civility and insanity, and how young children can become insane without some amount of authority and discipline."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is an important book of what happens in a society when there are no rules or any guide lines to follow. Ever since the boys were placed on the island they were destined to fail at creating their own perfect environment. The setting they are in starts out as a good fun environment to them but by all of the boys hunger for power it turns them against eachother and turns this so called \\"good\\" island, into a \\"bad\\" island.Jack is a representation of evil by how he thirsts for blood and meat as a opposed to being rescued. He would let the fire go out which is their only chance for survival just to cut open a pig. Ralph represents good by trying to create order, shelter and a way to be rescued. Jacks group takes over the island creating the human motivation for evil and hunting. Ralph being the only one left his motivation is forced into surviving as opposed to creating order. The whole island turns to chaos when just one person takes control. This person represents the devil figure and he takes down everyone on the whole island except for Ralph.

It also shows how human motivation can completely take over the whole human body and let barbaric things happen that would not happen in a normal oderly society today."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I liked this book a lot because it was funny and had good word choice.

It depicts, in chilling detail, how civilization breaks down when a group of school boys, none over 12 years of age, are marooned on an island, with no adult supervision.It can be read as an allegory for adult society in which there is no responsible supervision, for example, when the government appoints people to head agencies who have no experience, like Brownie, or appoints people to agencies that the government wants to destroy, or when the government appoints a person to represent us in the UN and the person has said the UN should not exist. Does this sound familiar?However, this book first appeared in 1954. It is a work of art. It may be just an artistic description of some school boys slowly descending into a violent abyss of their own making.Either way, it is a disturbing book. It shows, clearly, how thin the veneer of civilization is, and what ugliness lies beneath that veneer.I have read this book twice and was disturbed both times. I think it is still relevant.

Two college degrees and a lot of time later, I am not sure what I was thinking. What I saw in the book then, I can not find now. Coming from an era in which literature had a greater market, this book achieved notoriety. Released today, I suspect this book might be a failure.A plane crash leaves an undetermined number of boys on an island to fend for themselves. The idea that the children must live independent from adults is an interesting premise. While the story itself is interesting, it is difficult to identify with any of the characters. Ralph, the original leader of the group, is weak and a poor leader. His lack of focus and self-loathing make him hard to empathize with. Jack, the second leader and founder of the hunters/savages, is a megalomanical monster. More than anything, he needs a good old fashioned beating from his father. The most sympathetic character is Piggy, the obese and asthmatic voice of reason. Unfortauntely, the other boys would rather mock him than listen to him. When Piggy dies, I found myself wishing that the rest of the boys would starve to death, never being rescued. Unfortunately, the boys are rescued. Despite irrational fears and squabbles for power, the worst of the bunch are rescued while two other boys die cruel deaths.Perhaps this book is made for children to appreciate their parents. This would explain why I liked the book as a child. Unfortunately, the innocence of children throwing spears at each other has left me. Now I only wonder how much therapy these poor kids needed to get past this episode in their lives. It is still a good book, but your level of enjoyment is dependent upon your perspective. The child in me gave it five stars, while as an adult I give it three stars. Average: 4 stars."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought that this book was an excellent way of showing how kids survive when put into dangerous situations. It really gets to the heart of issues concerning child psychology. I recommend this book to anyone that has an open mind..."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is amazing in it's content because of the implications. It deals with raw morallity that makes you think and feel along with the characters. This is one of those books that you don't want to end."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book had me interested from the beginning until the boys were rescued. Many different level of conflicts is displayed here. Human vs. human's nature, Human vs. Fears...etc. I have to read this book as a requirement for Honor English IV. I must say that this book is engrossing. Sure, there are some that won't like this book, maybe it is so because they did not fully comprehend the story, thus they make hasty judgement. For me, I thinks that this book has tremendous literature values. Every single one of us should at least read it once."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Great read on several levels. Quick, manageable to finish, but the story sticks to the mind long after it's finished, begging to be peeled. The story seems overfamiliar in today's world, especially with 11 year-olds shooting others and tying small children to railroad tracks. When it was first published, it must have been mind-boggling."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a must read book for all 5-9th graders. The story about a buncha kids trapped on a island teaches you about society in general. Its violence, brutality, etc. Makes you wanna be work together instead of fighting each other. Very entertaining and interesting"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Although I read this some time ago I still remember the impact it had on me. &quot; Lord of the Flies&quot; must be read by the masses and loved. Though they are school boys Golding introduces a great glimpse of adult thinking. The boys become wild and they even have a desire to kill. The worshipping of the Lord of the flies is very well explained. You there, READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's notorious masterpiece calls into question everything we are conventionally led to believe - from the inherent goodness of children to the corrupting influence of society.A group of young boys, stranded on a desert island with no means of outside contact, serve as mirrors of the conditions of both human society and man's nature - at the beginning, democratic and virtuous, in the final pages living in anarchy and reduced to vicious savagery and violence.Never loses its sense of realism, the Lord of the Flies is a compelling portrait of the darkness of man's heart."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I first had to read this book for my GCSE English course, I thought it would be another dull and boring study text. This was not the case.The book centres around a group of English school boys who become stranded on a desert island. Even though it first seems that the story will follow the typical 'Coral Island' format, where all the children will have a fun time and become great friends, the novel actually develops into the opposite end of the spectrum.Being away from civilisation and morals enables the boys to gradually enter a primative way of life, which develops until nearly all of the children unite to become a savage tribe, and lose all form of individual identity. They turn to an animal like way of life, which leads to tragic and harrowing events.What I particularly appreciated about this novel was the way that Golding used the example of the school boys to explain the darkness in man's heart, and human evil. His ability to decribe events and emoti! ons makes the realisation that the savages are just little boys, even more horrible.Although this book can take time to understand (due to all the religious symbolism), I would highly recommend it to anyone from the age of fifteen upwards. Although this novel is not something to read if you want cheering up, it is interesting, insightful, and gives controversial ideas to the reader about religion and human behaviour."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read this book for class I'm taking in the fall. Because this was required reading, I expected to be blown away by the story. Unfortuantely I wasn't. I thought the messages he was trying to convey were indeed, profound, but I was not at all moved. It did not bring out any emotions in me at all while reading it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book two times- first of all, because i liked it very much, second- 'cause only this way you can see the most important details and symbols, and you begin to understand it. And, the third reason, i wanted to read it in other language, to compare it.This book is not a simple story of some boys trying to make it on a wild island. This is a very deep, psychological and symbolic book. It shows both the real nature of human, the process of &quot; going back to rooths &quot;, and the way the world is made. It has also very specific symbols, like the most obvious- the conch, or piggy's specs,but also more enigmathic, like the water spilled on piggy's hand, when passing the conch to ralph.If you start thinkink, how the British boys, proud of the fact being Brits , because &quot; British are best at everything&quot;, turn into Hunters-or rather animals,how they personality is forgotten and covered by paintings, how civilised little boys-children !-start to escape fr! ! om humanity and responsibility into mindless tribal dance, and manslaughter in the name of the &quot;community&quot;, you discover the truth about men. It is really scary, when at the final scene you realise, that Jack- the Main Hunter, the vicious Master-is a 11- old child !! This is a very, very good book. I loved the style - one day of reading-and the language, and some unknown elements. You really should change your poin of viev while reading this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It was during the war when a group of British boys were transferred to a safer place. On their way there, there plane crashed into a small, remote island. No adults; just children. They had no idea what to do. Them someone stepped up and took order into his own hands. But then things got out of control. Everyone starts to fight over things that really aren't important. But to them, it's survival. Chaos breaks loose over the island. And the one main question is, will someone rescue them before it's to late?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Simple cast of characters, simple natural dialoge, beautifully clear imagery. No wonder this has been made into a movie twice !You could read this book in an afternoon, but it the prose is so clear and visual that it really deserves to be read slowly and carefully.It's great coming back to this yeas later and see the characters wondering why they can't get anything done by having meetings. Perhaps some teachers stretch the synbolism too much - many of the issues are kids struggling with are &quot;grownup&quot; problems that grownup can't solve either.For this reason it is actually more frightening and disturbing for an adult than kids."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Well written and visually descriptive novel about the savagery of mankind. A group of young boys are stranded on an island. Leaders step forward from some of the older boys and two quickly vie for overall leadership.The boys quickly evolve from children to savages. There are so many underlying questions that the reader asks himself as the novel unfolds. The central question being whether the outcome would have been the same if these had been adults rather than children."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I have to admit when I first picked this book up and read through the first 2 chapters or so I was extremely turned off by the British writing style of Mr. Golding and his peculiar sentence structure at times. However, as I explored this novel further I became more comfortable with the style and learned to appreciate everything this book has to say. The theme of basic human nature leading to the destruction of a society is illustrated very strongly in this novel, and I like how the author presented this. Despite the fact that all the characters are children, Golding has managed to create strong and interesting characters that paralllel many people in politics we see today. A worthy read and an instant classic, the only reason for the 4 stars is that some people may not appreciate Mr. Golding's writing style."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is quite interesting and does indeed depict society to a great extent. its point to the fact that given a small population isolated form external influences will bring out the primeval and basic instinct with which we are all born...in other words we revert to forming our own society, based on our so called strength at the time aka aggression. In &quot;polite&quot; society today this is largely masked and the aggressor does not literally kill the weak, but subdues, dominate etc by economic power."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read this book for summer reading, so of course, I waited until the last minute and had two days to read it and get it. I didn't want to read it so that affected my opinion on it at the time. I think that if I would have had more time and chosen it myself, I would have enjoyed it thoroughly. Overall I think it was very interesting looking at how Piggy and everyone formed friendships or enemies and how everyone evovled."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is one of the great masterpieces of english literature.

Tells of survival and what happens when the worse comes."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I cannot say enough about this book. There is so much depth in it and so much ot think about. There's more than just an innocence lost thing in it -like the choir leader, Jack, becoming the most evil on the island. I think Golding meant to imply that innocence is an illusion, as shallow as the choir boys' outfits. Being a substitute teacher for both high school and middle school, I would vouch Golding's implications hold true even for kids who aren't lost on desserted islands. Ultimately, the island signifies a pre-adolescent's experience, as being cut off from the world while admist a wild sway of new emotions. I'm glad this book exists, because peopel need access to eloquent articulation of youth's experiences."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I read Lord Of The Flies a few weeks ago, I was expecting something of GRAND proportion. I had read review after review and heard nothing but wonderful things, I picked the book off of the shelf with excitement. When I read it however, I felt like it was missing something. Don't get me wrong! This book was wonderful, a great ending full of suspense and drama, but it did fall short on how the boys got on the tropical island. More detail in that area would have given this book a five, no doubt"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A must read book for all ages young and old.\\"Lord of the Flies\\" is a book about a group of boys who were stranded on a remote island during World War II. Jack, Ralph, Simon and Piggy were some of the main characters in the book. Ralph, who is the leader for most of the time in the book, has a strong rivalry with a boy named Jack. Simon is sort of a \\"peace maker\\" in the whole book while Piggy is usually the brains behind everything. Throughout \\"Lord of the Flies\\", the boys will have to face hard obstacles not only phiscally, but mentally and emotionally as well. I feel that I could relate best to Piggy because he at times was very much needed but at other times no none whould care if he was there or not. This book is a book that will captivate you for years to come. I know you will enjoy it just as much as I did. Although the ending was a bit of a disappointment, overall, the book is very good. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes stories that are just great to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies is about an airplane, which crashes on an island, and a group of kids are trapped there. The book is about their time spent on the island. The main characters are Ralph, Piggy, Jack and Simon. As soon as they crash on the island, they start having many problems. At first everyone is good and picks Ralph as chief. Then things slowly start to turn bad when Jack and his hunters let the fire out and a ship went by without seeing the smoke. Jack takes everyone but Piggy, Ralph, Simon and some little ones and goes to the other side of the island and makes his own tribe. My favorite character is Ralph because he seems to be the only smart one with some kind of authority on the island. He is the only adult like figure on the island.Ralph shows the kind of person that will see a problem and try to fix it the right way. Jack sees a problem as an opportunity to take control and start running everything and making the problem worse at the same time. I see this everyday, even when I am in class. You have your kids that are like Jack and want to give the teacher and everyone else a hard time. Then you have people like Ralph. The person in class that sits there and does the work because they know that making things harder for the teacher, will only make things harder for them. I'm like two in one because if I see a chance to make a good joke, I make it. Otherwise I keep my mouth closed.I thought the book was kind of confusing because the author jumped around a lot. And didn't explain things as well as he should. The book went a little slow too. My favorite part in the book is at the end when the navy officer is standing there talking to Ralph. It's a flash back to real life. The only thing I would change in the book is the lack of information.This book is easy to get into in the beginning, but then slows down during the end. I spent a lot of time rereading parts in the book. The only people I think would like this is a younger kid because they don't care about understanding it or an older person because they have the knowledge to understand what is happening."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Its a story of some children standed on a island after their oceanliner sinks. The children are well disciplined upon their arrival on this island. But, that all changes. Its a tale of human nature and how we will revert back to some of the natural instincts that we as humans try hard to ignore. A grim look at our darker side. A excellant read, and a classic book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I never read Lord of the Flies in high school, so, I finally got around to it, near to my 30th birthday. It is a novel of great depth and symbolism. The characters all represent a portion of leadership: Jack- the warmonger; Ralph- the diplomat; and Piggy- the brain behind the diplomat. Some may say that this book is just a cynical view of human nature. But I believe it is just realistic. After all most of the boys that Jack scares into becoming a part of his tribe are young and therefore ignorant. This shows how most despots keep control, by denying their population with any real higher education (except for the privileged few) and intimidating them to stay in line. The outcome of the novel is tragic, yet a lesson in survival and civility: when might makes right, there is no progress and only fear."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"...The main character is Ralph.He is a military boy that gets stuck with other military boys.On their way home from the military the plane crashes on a island.None of the boys know what to do,some cry.There are about 16 boys.Ralph wants to get rescued the most.There is one boy named Piggy whos overweight and wears glasses. There is also a boy named Jack.He decides to go hunting with other boys and picks on Piggy.He leves the 16 boys,soon there are 8 boys with Ralph and 8 boys with Jack.Later Jack kills a pig,there is a feast...The moral of the story is if you have a problem try to resolve that problem.He lerns that rules are very importain.Ralph was forced into being a man because instead of being excided he thinks serious.This was an outstanding book I give it 5-5 stars..."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the book Lord of the Flies, the author William Golding shows the reader what it would be like to be stranded on a deserted island. This book is for thinkers that like peering into the savage part of our nature. Besides, it's about seriously messed up half naked British boys. This book has a great plot because it's about a bunch of psychotic kids killing others. This book was extremely intersting and had great symbolism. I gave this book 4 stars because it was a really good book but not the best."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is, in my mind, one of the greatest novels in the Englsh language. It is an errie combination; it delves into the dark philosophical content of Heart of Darkness in context of a childhood adventure story reminiscent of Peter Pan, and it blends the two perfectly. This confuion of innocence and evil adds a singular flavor to the book, which simultaneously chills and entertains the reader. Lord of the Flies is an absolute must-read for anybody of relatively mature age who is interested in examining the animal side of human nature. The book is thought-provoking, memorable, beautifully written, and entertaining. It carries my unqualified recommendation."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this is most definetely the best book i have been required to read in high school. \\"lord of the flies\\" symbolizes the evil within everyone of us and survival with no rules. this novel is defenitely worth reading- but not for children. this book hints at a different form of reality- where there are no rules, no compassion...only survival. it will make you doubt yourself and help you to see things differently. it's a very enlightening and insightful book, and i loved it!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Imagine you are stranded on an island with a large group of boys. What would you do? Well, that is exactly what the boys in The Lord of the Flies have to ponder. Four leaders emerge, but in different strengths and the best leader is elected. One leader knows what the people want, another one knows what is good for everybody and what should be done, another one is always helpful, and the last one who is elected knows what the people want and also what is good for them. The story starts out well with all of the characters loving the place, but then it is turned upside-down. There are divisions in people and what they should do which starts discrimination. Each group becomes independent and hates each other. Lord of the Flies represents every character as a real life person in a real society and shows how we are all born evil. Our society will never work out because of our human nature and our natural sin. The end, or the termination of society is extraordinarily gripping and powerful and dreadfully true. This book should be read and analyzed as it is read. In other words, this book is not to be read as an adventure book, for it is a very bad one, it is read to portray a very potent theme."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If you have ever read &quot;Animal Farm&quot; by George Orwell,then you will enjoy &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is a book that demonstrates how society deals with war, and also serves as a warning bell to society to show people what could happen if they don't react more civilized in a time of crisis. Golding symbolized this situation with children stranded on an island forced to live by themselves and under their own rules. This is a great book if like political/war novels or if like Goerge Orwell since both authors deal with the same topics."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding did an excellent job in letting the reader see that man is generally evil when left to himself. His uses of symbolism and irony make the book that much better and I would recomend it to any English class. I also like the fact that rescue is offered , but you are not sure what's left to be rescued from. Inocence is lost and the world is destroyed , but there is still Reason!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A novel full of action and adventure. Very detailed and specific description of the characters. Intersting through out the novel. A lot of literature tricks and hidden messages are at play. Great for disscusion. Simmilar to the book Coral Island."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This novel provides a vivid image of society in the most primitive form possible.The boys blood-thirsty rampages toward the end signify humans need for blood to survive and dominate their world.Truthfully this book may not be taken for face value alone for then it is left as only a action thriller and small one of that.But when the deeper thrill of seeing human nature in the purest form,one understands both the developement of society and the need to survive in it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book had so many hidden features that it was impossible to name them all. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who doesn't enjoy a good thought though. A few scenes were a lttle morbid and grafic for my taste and those with a weak stomach beware. A great book to do a report on no matter if its a review or an essay. Only make sure you have enough time to read it from start to finish with out stopping."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was just spectacular. It is however complicated to the under educated person, so i can understand why some people could find it a little boring. The book took the time to develop the key charictors while still leaving some of the charictors to the imagination. Golding really does have a great imagination."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Takes place on a deserted island, a group of boys struggle to survive the harsh nature of the island and moreover,their own avarice. This masterpiece reveals the natural instinct of every living thing under desperate circumstances; the symbolic factor is too strong for even Golding himself to fully grasp. From the glasses of Piggy to the wild &quot;beast&quot; , this is an excellent choice for all readers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is exceedingly well-paced and well-written, almost tailor made for class discussions. However, I didn't like it for a simple reason: its message is profoundly disturbing. Golding's view of mankind may be correct, which is even more scary."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I saw the movie and read the book. I thought it was realistic but horrible. It is gruesome, and the details of the killings are unnecessary. I rated 2 stars because it was a realalistic and made good conversation in my religion class. Send your comments of my review to my email please."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is one of those book with many hidden meanings that you need to think about while reading. Unlike many books done like this, Golding accomplished it well. The only reason I didn't give this novel 5 stars was because of the unrealistic way the author presented the boys in the novel. If all these boys had landed on an island, at the age under 10, with their parents dead, would they not breakdown? You cannot expect children after this traumatic experience to immediately call order and behave accordingly. Yes, I agree with the chaos part, but that should have came first, then the order. That is what would happen with real children in real life. Thank you"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I found this book to be very well written. I did not want to put it down until I had finished it. However, I don't like violence very much and there were scenes in this book that were so vividly described that I wanted to close my eyes. Anyone who has read a book knows this doesn't help very much.Overall, I found it very thought provoking in its exploration of the nature of man. I wonder if women would behave differently?"},{"Title":"Bank Shot","review":"Excellent product sent as specified and faster than expected - used but better than just 'good' condtion in fact.Bravo!"},{"Title":"Bank Shot","review":"the story itself is very good i always love this author's imagination.but this kindle edition has a bunch of typos.although it's selfcorrecting but nevertheless annoying."},{"Title":"Bank Shot","review":"Master criminal planner Dortmander is reduced to peddling encyclopedias door-to-door to the housewives living on Long Island when his friend Kelp tells him about a \\"sure thing.\\" Seems Kelp's nephew Victor is a former FBI agent who has noticed a perfect opportunity - a local bank is undergoing major renovation and so operations have been temporarily moved to a mobile home in a nearby vacant lot. All they have to do is hitch the trailer to a truck and they can steal the entire bank!Westlake created a wonderful character with Dortmander - a master planner of elaborate crimes who is cursed with a gang of not-quite-competent accomplices. If anything can go wrong with Dortmander's perfect plan, it will. The only thing that seems to save Dortmander and his friends is that the police are equally (or more) inept than the crooks. I just find myself cheering for Dortmander's crew, sharing their frustrations, shaking my head at their obvious mistakes, chuckling at their mishaps. This comic caper is the perfect antidote to a gray dreary day. I'll be smiling for hours just thinking about it."},{"Title":"Bank Shot","review":"The second novel in the John Dortmunder comic caper series, Bank Shot starts off a bit slow but once the caper actually begins is as good as any other Dortmunder novel. This 1972 first published adventure is also historically important as the novel where May, John's girlfriend appears on the scene and through a flashback memory we learn how the two of them met. Also the first novel where the Continental Detective Agency (a security guard company) has their laid back night interrupted by one of John's plans.Basic plot of Bank Shot is Andy Kelp's (regular gang member in the series) nephew Victor, who was kicked out of the FBI as he kept trying to get a secret handshake going, comes up with the idea to rob a bank housed inside a customised mobile office. Problem is the bank is wired to set off alarms in a police station not too far away if the walls and floors are broken into. So it's not too long once Dortmunder comes on the scene that the idea changes from robbing the bank to actually stealing and driving away with the entire bank. They will then get into the safe in a quiet place away from the scene and police. Like all Dortmunder novels, nothing goes as simply as first thought, Dortmunder and the gang are going to have to overcome sudden bouts of bad news, and Murphy's law hurdles such as the bank no longer having wheels.Once the caper begins, this equals any adventure the team's been on together. The first half doesn't move at the same pace as most Dortmunder novels and if someone wasn't familiar with how good and funny this series, or Westlake's independent storyline comic capers are, it's possible they wouldn't even get to the great writing of the second half. Herman a man who usually commits crimes on behalf of a black political movement was an interesting addition to the team before the bank caper started and the best parts of the first half of the book, but was a bit boring once the bank heist began. The other non regular, Victor doesn't add a great deal either, to the plot or the quality of the novel."},{"Title":"Bank Shot","review":"A fantastic follow up to 'The Hot Rock'. Dortmunder's old pal Kelp convinces him once again to plan a robbery that will make all of them rich! However, the only way to get the money is to steal the whole bank! I don't want to spoil it for you so I'll say no more. But trust me! This is even better than 'The Hot Rock' - crazier, more fun - a must read for fans of Westlake. Munch and his mother return (with mom playing a big part in this scheme); and now Dortmunder has a live-in love who gets caught up in the action too. For a short novel it packs in alot of action and great characters. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am so hooked on the Dortmunder series now that I have to read them all!"},{"Title":"Bank Shot","review":"This is but one of several novels by Westlake with Dortmunder as the main character; and what a character. He is marginally smarter than his colleagues in crime, but they are always screwing things up or having bad luck. He's always complaining and sort of expects the worst. They've made some bad movies about some of this series of books, but the books are wonderful. Read anything with Dortmunder in it - \\"Drowned Hopes\\" was probably my favorite, but \\"What's the Worst That Could Happen\\" and his most recent one \\"Bad News\\" are also classics."},{"Title":"Bank Shot","review":"A crew of low level con-artists and criminals decide that to rob the Capitalist and Immigrant's Trust Bank they need to steal not only the money but the bank itself.

He does not seem to be a very good lockman. He shows up again in Nobody's Perfect and inWhat's the Worst That Could Happen? (Dortmunder Novels).Overall, this is a good solid Dortmunder book but as the second in the series the team is not yet together.I have just discovered that Nobody's Perfect is book number three.

The premise of stealing a bank, temporarily located in a mobile home trailer while construction of a new facility is going on is certainly entertaining and humorous, the book even in its compact form drags on. If you love the antics of Dortmunder and his cohorts, you will probably like this as it follows the same formula as others. However, if you are looking for a humorous story that is more than absurdity then pass on this one."},{"Title":"Bank Shot","review":"No matter how painstakingly John Dortmunder plans his burglaries, there always seems to be some fly in the ointment. It is the nature of the foul-ups and the brilliant changes of plan that make the Dortmunder series so enjoyable.This time Dortmunder and his mixed-bag crew are planning to steal a bank. That's right, not rob a bank, but actually, physically, steal a bank.As you can imagine, to achieve such an ambitious task takes a fair bit of planning not to mention luck. Dortmunder is a master planner, so they've got that bit covered, unfortunately the luck side of the equation is a tad skinny, and this is where the laughs are provided.Donald Westlake is a master of farce, and Bank Shot certainly doesn't disappoint. This is a great diversion with an interesting caper brought to us by likable, amusing characters."},{"Title":"Bank Shot","review":"The Dortmunder Novels number at least six, though I haven't checked lately. This one is number two. The novels are basically about some minor criminals and Dortmunder himself plans the capers.Dortmunder is good at it and his plans are detailed. Donald Westlake appears to write the stories quite seriously and with a dry realism that almost connects them to real life. One can imagine the quite accidental things that people do and the silly mess-ups they cause. In his dry way Westlake makes them exceedingly hilarious.One finds oneself laughing loudly and uproariously at quite ordinary 'accidents of omissions', in other words people simply forgetting what they should do. Little events occur that seem to cause the most unfortunate results.Donald Westlake is well into the same area as Carl Hiaasen; Elmore Leonard is another, however Westlake's stories are of a lighter nature. He joins with similar writers of ridiculous, 'almost normal' events; 'lightweight criminality'; and you will definitely love his stuff."},{"Title":"Bank Shot","review":"If you share a bedroom with someone, don't read this book in bed! Keeping a room-mate awake by laughing aloud long and frequently could be hazardous to your relationship! One of Westlake's most preposterous and believable plots. (How does he do that?)"},{"Title":"Bank Shot","review":"Dortmunder, the premier robbery planner in crime fiction, begins the story by selling encyclopedia. I remember selling encyclopedia door to door and assure you that it can be a lousy job. But Dortmunder is between heists and needs the money. Despite a great sales pitch, the housewife calls the police and he is on the lam again (loses his expensive sales kit while getting away). Kelp, his friend and partner in crime, meets Dortmunder, gives him a ride, loses control of the car, and slams on his brakes causing an accident. A strange beginning for a strange book.\\"Bank Shot\\" is one of the most entertaining books I have read in years. This is a special crime mystery. Donald Westlake decided to write humorous crime stories about a master planner called Dortmunder. Westlake's idea is a marvelous success. Bank Shot is the second in a series of Dortmunder tales.Kelp, as usual, has an idea for a heist. He tells Dortmunder who is less than supportive, decides to try it because he is running low on cash. What worries Dortmunder is that: the bank is a mobile home, so to steal the money they must steal the bank; Kelp's nephew, who is a former FBI agent, wants to join the gang; and both Dortmunder's girlfriend and Murch's mom are suddenly part of the crew.Before reading the book, if I were to list all that could go wrong with a \\"pre-planned\\" bank robbery, my imagination would never yield the startling and hilarious events in \\"Bank Shot\\". I highly recommend the novel to readers everywhere."},{"Title":"Bank Shot","review":"John Dortmunder is a careful guy who is always looking for a reasonable way to make crime pay. Between major jobs, he's pulling the old &quot;give me a deposit for the encyclopedia&quot; con, working door-to-door in the suburbs. During the recession in the early 1970s, he can earn a pretty decent living doing this. But Mae (his live-in girl friend) knows that Dortmunder needs something to occupy his mind. So when the crazy ex-FBI agent kid shows up with a nutty scheme to steal a whole bank, she encourages Dortmunder to plan it out. From that humble beginning, the humorous complications just keep piling on in unexpected ways!Donald Westlake is a master of setting up the absolutely ridiculous situation. He uses the Dortmunder character as a surrogate for the reader's perspective, so you can laugh at how you would react in the same situation. Like Jane Langton, he also likes to have fun with pointing out how people miss what is just under their noses.The book is also a satire on all of those great theft stories, like The Thomas Crown Affair, in which little is what it seems. The difference is that this is The Thomas Crown Affair Meets the Three Stooges. Dortmunder's gang is as rag-tag a group as you can imagine, but they manage to keep stumbling forward.I particularly admired how the same story element of the bank's mobility is reused time and again for different plot and humor developments. Mr. Westlake is a most imaginative writer!One of the book's most interesting themes is that a piece of good luck is always met by a piece of bad luck, and vice versa. These reversals take the story off in all kinds of unexpected ways (not unlike the unfolding of The Sting).The basic plot revolves around a quite clever idea, using a bank office located in a mobile home as a large version of the letter in &quot;The Purloined Letter.&quot; If you were planning to steal a bank, where would you hide it? I know that my drives will never be the same in the future. I'll be looking for places to hide banks!Mr. Westlake does a marvelous job of keeping the reader in suspense about how the story will end. I suspect that few will guess the book's final three scenes.This audio cassette version of the book is very well in presenting the dry humor necessary to carry off the wonderfully witty fictional pictures Westlake draws in your mind.After you finish this story, I suggest that you think about places where you could accomplish your goal better by taking on a larger goal. For example, if you want enough money to retire at age 55, how about setting a goal of being able to create more wealth whenever you want? That idea may sound ridiculous, but public companies can issue more stock . . . and have more cash . . . in all but the worst market environments. So starting a company that can go public could better fulfill your retirement goal than just focusing on the retirement goal itself. Where else can raising the bar be helpful?Can you take your best shot to the bank?"},{"Title":"Bank Shot","review":"I have read most all of Westlake's Dortmunder books, and I would have to rate this as the best. It is incredibly funny and clever. But what ever you do, don't see the horrible movie based on the book and starring George C. Scott. What a terrible shame that that mess of a movie was made when the book offered the perfect film vehicle"},{"Title":"Bank Shot","review":"Sure, lots of thieves can rob banks, but it takes Westlake's own Dortumunder to steal the bank itself. I laughed out loud on many pages, and could not put it down when I got to the &quot;Murphy's Law&quot; of endings! I have read most of the Dortmunder series, and I look forward in every one to hearing what the &quot;regulars&quot; are discussing in the bar..some of the funniest writing today!"},{"Title":"Bank Shot","review":"This is the first of the series featuring Dortmunder and his crew of thieves. The seies started in the early '70s and I believe continued into the 21st century. While some are better than others, they are all funny and clever. This particular bool was made into a mo0vies starring Robert Redford."},{"Title":"Bank Shot","review":"Every time I read a Westlake novel, I'm amazed at the detail he includes about each heist. I bet he was a very mischievous, funny person. Thank goodness he left a sizable legacy in the form of his 100+ books. I plan to read every single one, since they are all (so far, anyway--I've read at least five) so damn enjoyable.In Bank Shot, Dortmunder and the gang make off with an entire bank--albeit a temporary one in the form of a trailer. This one started out slow for me, but once it got going (about the time they made off with the bank) it really took off. Saying too much more would spoil the ending, but if you enjoy witty, funny crime novels, this one is for you."},{"Title":"Bank Shot","review":"I read all the Donald Westlake books way back when they first came out in Paperback. Now I am starting them all over on my Kindle. They are just as good the second time around. Dortmunder, and his fellow criminals, decide to steal a Portable Bank. It is a trailer that is being used till the old bank can be refurbished. You will laugh at loud at the crazy things they do. The characters become real to you and you will be rooting for the crooks. Love it!"},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"The historical events dealt with in the story are not well known in my country, Australia, although we have hundreds of thousands of Greek immigrants. This story used well timed humour amongst a background of tragedy, human goodness and on the other hand, depravity to make it an unforgetable read. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"This book begins and ends with wonderful characters. It starts with a humorous and picaresque portrait of life on a sleepy Greek island and the absurd politics of the time (WWII). But then the island is swamped in modern warfare and the second half of the book is quite tragic. Yet the characters remain powerful and backed by a sense of history. I was transported, moved and taught something about life."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"Funny, sad, and heart-warming without being corny. The characters and the sometimes borderline surreal-ness of their lives reminded me a bit of ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. If you like Marquez, you'll like this book. Be patient at the beginning though - you won't realize how good it is until after it's over. But the ending felt a bit contrived. Anyway, great stuff."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"I adored this story of love, lust, fear and war set in the Mediteranean. Perfect prose and intimate detail left me begging for more from this author, and as I finished the book I found myself turning to the front to begin again. I will not forget Captain Corelli and Antonia and their extraordinarily beautiful tale."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"Corelli's Mandolin is a beautiful love story repleat with an accurate historical background, lively humor and poetic prose.

It's the best novel we've ever read and laughed and cried throughout it. We either loved or hated each of the charecters and were drawn into their lives. We realised the sadness of living in war times. However we felt the brutal beating of the pine martin Psipsina was unnecessary. We also found it disrespectful when a stray cat was given the same name."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"This book starts badly and gets progressively worse. By the time I had finished this &quot;book&quot;(!), I just felt compelled to register my disgust throughout the world. I really do not see what all of the fuss is about. It is just too farfetched, I mean, all the book is, is &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; set in the backdrop of some God-forsaken island that no-one has heard of. In closing, I would just like to say that I think that this book should be &quot;nitrogenated&quot; over, as Dr Iannis so succinctly puts it."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"I admit, I almost gave up on this book. The first 100 pages or so seemed to drag. Luckily friends encouraged me to continue reading it. Am I ever glad I did. Never have I been so moved by a story. It was funny, it was sad. The prose was beautiful and at one point, I actually cried, -in the thousands of books I have read, I have never once shed a tear.Read this book. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"Yes, like many people I struggled with the first few chapters, however do persevere, because you will be richly rewarded. I know a lot of people have criticised the ending but I found this book to be so refreshing and uplifting. Extremely well researched it is an essential read. I beseech you to ignore the pseudo intellectuals who have somewhat smugly mocked this book (they are probably jealous) read it, you will laugh, cry and learn about the inhumanity of war."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"It was all exceptionally well written. But in all honesty a man who had fallen so much in love with Pelagia and who had gone through so much with her and with her family and friends etc, would not have returned just for a glimpse of her only to disappear for 30 years...that was unrealistic. If it had been me I would have run over to her and embraced her!!"},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"This book is just beautiful. It deals with the subject matter with a lightness of touch and subtlety of language, makes you smile through the tears, brings home the true awfulness of war, but shows you joy and laughter and happiness all the same. Read it, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"Captain Correli's Mandolin could have been one of the best novels to come out of England this decade. De Berniers' characterisation, humour and plot structure are nearly flawless, and the compassionate humanity of this awesomely talented writer held me spellbound from the first. De Berniers does not flinch from setting his story with a hard, political edge - rather, he embraces the opportunity to excellent effect. The terrible sufferings endured by the Cephalonians during - and more shockingly after - the Second World War, were as frightening as they were believable, and I am glad to have been given some education in the history of the region. Characters, also, were confidently drawn, and De Berniers did them the service of portraying them as real, flawed human beings. In short De Berniers had it all: plot, humour, politics, injustice, tragedy, resolution. Then, for a reason forever unknown to this correspondent, Mr De Berniers ruined (I do not use the word lightly) an! otherwise excellent book. The cause of the separation of Correli and Pelagia is unquestionably the most implausible and laboured scene I have ever read: I was left gasping with disbelief when I realised the demands the author was making on my credulity. Another problem with the last pages is that the reader is taken on a tiresome whistle-stop tour of the sixty years following the end of the war. It is clear that the dreadful ending does ruin an otherwise excellent book, so I must advise anyone who has been turned off the idea of reading it: please do read it: it is an excellent novel. Just put it firmly on the bookshelf when you're eighty pages from the end!"},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"A superbly crafted story of a woman caught in the throes of transition from deep tradition to the modern world. For Pelagia Iannis the cost of transition is heavy. Daughter of the village's widower doctor, she is caught up in global forces beyond her ken. The imperial ambitions of Italy's dictator, Benito Mussolini, bring the Italian army of occupation. Among the troops is Captain Antonio Corelli, artillery officer and musician. An unwitting and hesitant imperial minion, he is billeted in the Iannis household. Although the doctor urges passive resistance, Pelagia, although committed to a partisan youth, is drawn to Corelli's musical talents and unworldly charm. De Bernieres weaves an intricate tale of love, war, humour and pathos with unrivaled skill. His characters sparkle with realism, an aspect permeating this outstanding work. His descriptions of the interactions of the differing nationalities and ideologies ring vividly true.As he builds the story through the characters and events, de Bernieres gives little away. There are continual surprises as events twist and bend the characters. Some break, others find a means to extricate themselves from a tangling fate. Pelagia bears the main burden throughout. Her love for Corelli, after a fitful start, blossoms, then is tested by the swirl of events. Other characters come into her life, remain or depart. All make some impact as de Bernieres adroitly builds her role. Each chapter becomes a minor tale in its own right, with all tied together flawlessly. Characters and events are imparted with meticulous detail, yet, like a Mozart opera, not one word would bear excision.If you like a story that successfully ranges over a variety of issues and people, you will seek far and wide to surpass this tale. De Bernieres' skills in portraying life's complexities, yet maintaining reader attention and interest are peerless. He has clearly build his work on thorough scholarship - there's even a source list at the end. His sweeping view will leave you exhilarated and breathless, but fulfilled.

At first he is osctracised by the locals, but as a conscientous but far from fanatical soldier, he proves in time to be civilised, humorous - and a consummate musician. When the local doctor's daughter's letters to her fiance go unanswered, the working of the eternal triangle seems inevitable.I first decided to read this book when the movie was about to be released but now I find that it is quiet different - it is much better.

Although I found it hard to get into I can safely say that this is the best book I have ever read, and I doubt that I will ever find one as good as this. It is very provocative and gives an enjoyable and interesting insight into life and the effects of war. It contains humour, romance, tragedy and enables the reader to identify with the characters. It is compelling from beginning to end and is a veritable piece of art. I recommend it to anyone who has an interest in history, life or wants a good story. I absolutely love it."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"At sixteen years old this book was the first piece of conventional adult fiction that I decided to explore.

They are simply not up to the standard set by the rest of the book. Maybe an editor wrote them? It struck me that somebody said &quot;OK you've got 80-100 pages left, so wrap it up Louis&quot; ...so it ended up a bit flat. However, the first 400 or so pages had everything and I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book so much up to that point."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"This story is perhaps one of the finest literary works to emerge this decade, second only to Birdsong. It is a very moving novel, a tribute to the character and bravery of MANY men. The language itself exemplifies a mastery of language, imagery and subtlty of depth. De Bernier uses this skill to craete a beautifully expressionate novel that tells a harrowing tale of War. I would most definately recommend this to any reader, especially those who have been reluctant to read some of the trash produced over the last few years. I thoroughly recommend this with five out of five!"},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"Having just finished the book and read the reviews, I wanted to put in my &quot;five stars&quot; worth -- and back up the rave comments of so many other readers. But WARNING! If you haven't read the book yet, then be careful about reading these reviews YET, as some of them give away the ending -- THAT ending, that so many readers found wanting. Actually, I, too, found it somewhat contrived, but was willing to suspend my disbelief, with gratitude to the author, by thinking, that, yes... perhaps... a man of Corelli's deeply artistic temperament, may just have acted as he did. And the final para is a lovely picture of the three young ladies on the scooter. I laughed out loud in many places, so often that I was once kicked out of bed by my wife, for disturbing her sleep! The &quot;eye wars&quot; scene, and the one where Corelli is day-dreaming about Vivaldi's convent girls with Psipsina in his lap, are a scream. I did wonder though why Pelagia could not understand Corelli's wanting to set to music her crocheting fingers, or seeing that a piece of music could be &quot;puce&quot; in colour. Anyway, a deeply satisfying read, that has it all and has stayed with me -- now I'm enjoying its being read on BBC radio, and looking forward to the movie!"},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"You can read other reviews here and they all complain about the ending. Well, the ending doesn't live up to the rest of the book, it's true. But don't let that put you off. The book as a whole must surely be one of the most remarkable, insightful, beautiful and profound books ever written. Set primarly in a tiny Greek village on the island of Cephallonia, and told through the eyes of maybe half a dozen characters, this remarkable tale explores the effects of war on simple people as they struggle to preserve their lives and their loves, and to understand the meaning of happiness, life and death. Dr. Iannis is wise; his daughter Pelagia is strong; her fiance handsome but weak; her soulmate charming and well-meaning (though the ending suggests perhaps not worthy of her); the village priest a drunken buffoon,...and there are others. The notes on the back of the book quote the Observer's review: &quot;...an emotional, funny, stunning novel which swings with wide smoothness between joy and bleakness, personal lives and history...it's lyrical and angry, satirical and earnest&quot;. I guess that really says it all. One last note, though: Here in New Zealand on the annual bookstore's reader's poll, this novel made the top 10 in 1998."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"Second only to Hugo's &quot;Les Miserables&quot; and that for plot only. De Bernier's use of English is exquisite, what a beautiful language it is at the pen of a master. His expression of the characters' feelings is compelling and the feelings he evokes in the reader, swing from bliss and unbridled joy to devastating sorrow, with almost everything else in between. I had tears in my eyes most of the time, one way or the other. The ending does stretch one's credibility, but the book as a whole is an absolute must."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"In England this book is being passed hand to hand and gathering fans at every turn. It is as good a read as I have had since I finished all the Robertson-Davies books."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"This is a great book with strong characters and a riveting story which evokes thought about life's rich, historical context. The characters are so real and well-developed they seem like you truly know them. Some are lovable, some are charming, and some may be detestable, but all are unique and interesting. The story is fascinating... set in a small village on a greek island where the reader experiences the village's sleepy existence, its turbelent military occupation, and the outcome of those (and other) events. The history of the island and characters evoke thought about life's rich, historical context. It shows how history shapes nations and races and how personal experiences shape individuals. Importantly, it also illustrates how each individual plays an important role in defining both the present and influencing the future."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"This novel has it all - great characters, the folly of war, humour, sadness and a pine marten! It is also about a very sad time that I (a fanatic history buff) knew so little about - the Italian occupation of the Greek Islands in World War Two. Take some time to lock yourself away for an all in one read - it is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"I picked up this book three times, and was disappointed to get bogged down &amp; turned off in the first 80 pp. the first two. But god, the third time, it stuck, and I was able to continue, and I'm still experiencing aftershocks. An intelligent, literary, lyrical novel - I wept copiously over Carlo while reading a local cafe and wasn't even embarassed. I share the general consensus that the ending was a disappointment (and I wasn't expecting a happily-ever-after) in that the mungeing together of so many years into so few pages was clumsy, but my love for the rest of the story makes me forgiving. I refuse to see the movie (the dreadfully miscast Nicholas Cage and his atrocious accent - ugh!) and encourage anyone who is curious after seeing the preview to read the book instead. The most moving novel I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"My grandfather brought this book for me from England, saying that he had heard great reviews about it. Though a little aprehensive at first, because I know how his book selection can be, I found myself in love with this book. I couldn't put it down and would stay up late into the night hoping that Corelli would return to Pelagia. I am 15 and have given Captain Corelli's Mandolin to my English teacher to read because it is a truly inspiring and great book. It shows the the torture of lost loves, and beauty when the two lost loves are finally reunited. I fell in love with this book, and now I wish I hadn't read it so fast, but instead, savored every last word of it. The vocabulary used is tantalizing, making this book a masterpiece. He joins things together, never once mentioning something that didn't have some sort of importance later on down the road. Everybody should read this book........I have a long line waiting after my English teacher!!"},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"This will go down as one of my all-time favourite books. Such a masterful mix of comedy and tragedy is rare, indeed. In parts I couldn't stop laughing, much to my sleeping husband's annoyance as I read it late into the night. Then unstoppable tears would flow. De Berniers's obvious love of his characters, his painstaking research, his use of challenging vocabulary that often sent me gleefully into the dictionary, his masterful unfolding of plot -- all combined to keep me in continual awe of his writing. And now, about THAT ending: Yes, there was a definite shift from the intricate details of most of the book, which covered a relatively short period of time. But to cover decades in that same detailed style would be utterly impossible! (Unless it becomes a multi-volume epic, which I believe in this case would be unsustainable.) I was impressed, actually, that De Berniers was able to give enough details to make the unfolding of those decades not too rushed. It was like travelling on a speeding train through the landscape, but stopping long enough in some places to get one's bearings, get a decent feel for the time and place, and even go into some shops and have a nice meal and a chat with the locals. I LIKED the way De Berniers constructed the &quot;bridge&quot;, then, from the war to the present, to what we can see and experience on the island of Cephalonia today. As far as the culmination of the love-story is concerned, without giving away the ending, I found it satisfying and realistic. The characters remained essentially consistent, although circumstances and their lives had drastically changed. The criteria for a good ending, as far as I'm concerned, is that I feel satisfied, that it feels &quot;right&quot;, and that I couldn't completely predict it, although some hints were pointing me in that general direction. It met those criteria for me."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"Man, this was one great book. I can't remember the last time a novel invoked such passion. But that ending -- humph, it's like de Berniers just got tired of writing. Don't get me wrong, I love a tragedy as much as the next, but the author's reasons for Antonio's actions in the book's final 80ish pages are wholly unbelievable and bordering on insulting.AND to expect us to believe he had trouble excepting Carlo's secret -- give me a break!This truly is one GREAT book, but I'd like to think the last 80 pages were written by someone else."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"This book was, quite simply, one of the most enjoyable and enduring I've read for a long, long time. Like a lot of people, I keep thinking there's a book inside me just waiting to get out but I don't think I'll ever be capable of such a masterpiece. Indeed, I don't think I can find the superlatives to express how good I felt it was. I think what makes it so beautiful is that there are so many lovable characters - people that are developed so well in the text that you know them inside out. I felt as if I had lived among them. The circumstances that befall the small Greek island and its inhabitants are so sad and, at the end, it was almost enough to make me weep. Not sadness borne out of the cruelty of the war but of the sadness that came with the love of the central characters. I've lent this book to two friends who both said it was brilliant. A little note for new readers - I found there was a part of the book near the beginning where I had to &quot;stick with it&quot;. It's the narrative that explains the Italian/Greek roles in the Second World War. But it's essential (at least it was for me) to fully enjoy the whole book. Read it, you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"I found this book to be refreshingly different, but immediately entertaining. It carries its momentum from beginning to end. The reader feels that they are there with each character and place, so vivid are the descriptions. What can be very entertaining parts to the book can quickly turn to savage and often brutal events, so I would imagine is war! This book deserves all the praise it receives, it could not disappoint."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"Locking the majority of his Magical Realism tricks in a box, Louis De Bernieres' \\"Captain Corelli's Mandolin\\" is a slightly more serious, yet still somewhat magical, look at World War II and its devastating effect on a small Greek isle. What looks to be a disparate collection of compelling yet not related stories- a silent yet thoughtful Italian soldier lost behind enemy lines, an elder Greek doctor and his feisty young daughter, a young Italian soldier privy to manipulation and indoctrination, the dynamic and romantic Captain Corelli himself, among others- slowly wind their way through the dark days of World War II's beginnings and eventually find themselves stranded on a war torn Mediterranean island.Mixing history- both of Greece and the war itself- Bernieres slowly creates characters and a narrative that seems to take on a life of it's own. The first third of the book jumps from scene to scene, styles shifting, tone changing as different narrators pick up the story. As the events and the people themselves begin to converge, Bernieres downplays the literary tricks and let's the emotions of the characters dictate the direction of the novel. Without getting too graphic (but nonetheless not ignoring the harsh realities of war), \\"Captain Corelli's Mandolin\\" focuses its energy on one relatively small community and shows the devastating effects of war on it, both during the present and in the indeterminate future.As with all Bernieres works, however, hope lurks, and while this novel in no way celebrates war, it does attest to the strength of the human condition and how it can remain optimistic and charitable in even the worst of times. \\"Captain Corelli's Mandolin\\" is an ambitious work that entertain, educates, and forces one to think about war and its effect of humankind."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. I had the pleasure of reading this book whilst on holiday in the very same locations in the Ionian islands where this story is based. As someone with a strong connection with this area, I was so impressed with how De Bernieres understood and translated the feeling of this part Greece, through the characters and their setting.The perspectives on some of the history presented have been hotly debated, especially by local Greeks whose families endured the war there - and for this reason, I recommend reading something about their perspective for a balanced understanding of this very sensitive topic.However, this should not put you off enjoying the literary quality of this book - and the author's incredible capacity for sharing how love co-exists with the best and worst of what humans are capable of.Even though there are some beautiful scenic moments in the film, the book is a far richer experience....and richer again if go there yourself and see the sun glistening on Ionian sea with your own eyes...."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"Make no mistake about it. This is not a romantic novel and even though one cannot help but get carried away with the romance that gradually develops in Pelagia's life this is rather a humorous novel for even within the romance itself and the harsh reality of the war that is soon to overwhelm the life of every character there is plenty of humour making the entertainment value of the novel undeniably high. Just one reservation about the actual plot of this book or rather not so much the plot itself but the way the novel actually ends. It makes one wonder whether the author was having second thoughts about this since the end seems rather contrived and quite detached from the development of the rest of the plot, particularly if one considers the point in time at which Captain Corelli escapes from the island of Cephalonia."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"Like other readers I struggled with this book for the first two chapters, but after that became entirely engrossed and I was so glad I stuck with it! Louis De Bernieres has truly written a masterpiece. I kept checking on how many pages I had left as I didn't want to leave the idealic island of Cephallonia. The characters created are incredibly warm, real and very funny but just when you least expect it you are shocked to read graphic descriptions of war and its devastating effects. This will be a novel that you will always remember. A true literary masterpiece that entertains every step of the way."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"I was so glad that I saw the movie before I read the book. It comes nowhere to matching the richness of the language and characterisation. And one of the main characters - Carlos is almost completely omitted.It is a wartime story inhabited by real people whose lives are invaded as well as their beautiful Kefalonia. It is a love story - the Captain's insecure love for the doctor's daughter and the hopeless love of Carlos for the Captain. Louis de Berniere shows us the fears and doubts of the invaders as much as the invaded. The Italians are artistic and musical lovers of life and women - far removed from the harsh Nazis who arrive following Italy's surrender.Happiness, sadness, anger, frustration, hate, love - they're all there. It is as good as the hype. In a different league to the film - which I did actually enjoy."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"Truly a breathtaking novel. I am from Grece and the character and flavor of the book captures the small idealic life on the Greek island. I loved how the author interspersed Greek words and phrases in the novel, i.e. Lemoni means lemon. The historical parralells in the novel are wonderful, the earthquake did happen. Grab this book and read it before the movie. When you see the movie, the book will blossom in your mind. Even better go and see this island, you will not want to leave."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"The book takes you back in those years were things were simple and you did not need much to aprecciate life. Through historical events shows the transformation of places and people's lives to a struggle for both survival and maintainance of dignity. A war can tear people apart but can also bring enemies together through feelings and emotions that know no teritorial differences. The amazing thing is that stories like this one, have taken place through history and this is precisely what makes this book so wonderful. We are reminded through this book, feelings and emotions that everyday life has taken away. This is a book that helps to understand the Greek way of thinking, but i believe that everybody can find part of his/herself in it. I am not an expert in criticizing books but i don't believe that you have to be a proffesional to understand the impact of a book on yoursefl. I just hope you all enjoy it as much as i did."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"I was introduced to the novel through my English course. Admittedly I wasn't overjoyed at the prospect of reading such a large novel, but it wasn't long before I was completely engrossed in the story. As a love story it excelled all others I have ever read, as a historical war story it didn't contain too many facts to really weigh the reader down, but similarly didn't contain too few. De Bernieres' depiction of war left me realising just how much of an affect it has. As a teenager I wasn't fully aware of the atrocities of war, but as I came to know the characters I really began to understand their pain. This is one novel I have no doubts I will read again, and will, without a doubt, recommend it to my friends. It is a beautifully written book that I defy anyone not to cry to."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"Surely one of the best books I've read to date. Bernieres' use of the language is captivating, full of insight and very poetic at places. A must-read for all who cannot miss a good story about love, life, death and politics."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"I kept thinking to read this book. I am thankful that I put it off until I was on vacation. I purchased the book in Corfu, Greece an island in the Ionian Sea that is very much like the island of Keffalonia. It is in fact mentioned often in the book. The history of the two islands, the way of life and the thinking, not to mention the food, the music and the language are all connected.I was consummed with the book. The people were very real and very accurate. The knowledge of the Greek way of thinking, the way the author caught the Greek soul in the story line, the jokes, the way Greek people use their language to uplift, to mold, and to hurt, and the very powerful use of humor to depict a very sad and horrible time in history make this book a thrill and a valid history book.Many people are angry that the book brings up the evil deeds of the English Army, the Italian Army, the Communists and the Facists. The real issue is that history needs to be told. The evil that humans use against other humans needs to be told. If we pretend or &quot;whitewash&quot; history to make ourselves feel better 50 years later, we only fool ourselves. If we use history to improve ourselves and our actions towards others we have become real people.Thank you to the author for his hard work and his bravery to stand and say, this happened. If you don't like what happened, or you are ashamed of your connection to the evil, then, recognize the great opportunity you have been given and make the future a better place. To deny what happened to feel better about yourself or your family or your political party is to take the truth and bury it deep, and evil will continue."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"One of the few books I have read more than once, it captures the essence of the human spirit, the timelessness of true love, and the inescapable irony of the human condition. The rich history of this small Greek island caught in the middle of the chaos of war unfolds impartially through the eyes of each character. Capt. Corelli and Pelagia will dance off the pages and into your heart in this comedic, tragic, romantic, unforgettable tale."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"Not much else to say, apart from that this book is not only a fantastic story, but technically magnificent. Anyone who doesn't enjoy it must have a heart of stone. Louis de Bernieres, I bow down to you."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"An acquaintance in Japan recommended this book to me many years ago. I picked it up and have never forgotten it.Some have said that the first two chapters are difficult to get through, but for me this was not the case. I found that they set the tone of the book perfectly.De Bernieres is in absolute control of the language in this book. He is also in absolute control of tone. His depiction of Il Duce is so scathing and humorous, but at the same time seems to be a good read of Mussolini.At the same time moving and hilarious, Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of the most perfectly written books I have read.de Bernieres' prose is unrivaled in its fluidity, clarity, and intelligence. He changes tone like nothing I have ever seen. I laughed out loud while reading on a public bus, and before I arrived at my stop, I was almost in tears from the moving narrative. Read this book and you will count yourself lucky.However, I recommend not seeing the movie, despite what your curiosity might urge you to do. My curiosity got the better of me and I was deeply disappointed.Of course, how do you capture perfect prose in a movie?"},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It is the only book ever to make me laugh out loud and cry in the space of a few minutes. I have given the book to many friends to read over the past year and every female friend has said that she fell in love with Captain Corelli! This book is impossible to put down - I have had to buy another copy as the first had fallen to pieces! If you want to lose yourself completely inside a story then this book is the one for you."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"Friends who know I\`m interested in war history recommended this book. But this is not war history. This is a rather banal love story mixed up with a lot of bloody details. If you are looking for the real stuff, go somewhere else."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"This has to be one of the finest books that I have ever read. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"I found this book an effort at first, after years(I admit it) of easy-to-read paperbacks and magazines(and the telly!). It does actually require the old brain-cells to come to life and do the job they were intended to do- think. By the time I was 1/4 of the way through, though, I was utterly engrossed, and racing through the pages; at the expense of everything else. I almost dropped it in some soup I was cooking at one point, so loathe was I to put it down for anything. It is no exagerration to say this author is a genious and nothing I could say about this book could ever do it justice so just read it. Oh, and don't let the 'hype' put you off as it almost did me- I bet like me you'll get about 1/4 of the way into it and you'll have to read on because all of them, from Corelli &amp; Pelagia right down to little Lemoni and Psipsina will have engulfed you totally."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of the best books that I've ever read. Bernieres created a wonderfully woven story of passion, history, politics which resulted in a clear sense of place and time. It made me laugh out loud in one chapter and shed tears in the next. The characters were well developed and more so in this book than in any other, I truly felt for them. However, I have to say that the ending was not of the same quality as the rest of the book. As I read it I felt as if he were trying to cram it in. This amounted to almost five decades being wedged in the last few chapters. All in all though, I would still highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"As a 15 year old, I was a little reluctant to read this book and was afraid I would have difficulty understanding it, but it is worth all the struggle! This is definitly my favorite book I have ever read and I will certainly read more of Louis's novels. I laughed and cried throughout the whole story and found myself slowing down at the end to savor the book. I loved the ending and although it WAS a bit contrived, I still found it suitable. I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"Romance, history and beautiful language this novel has it all. The characters are well developed snd grow with the story. Tragedy and pathos are interwoven in a rich bold tale which updates the Romeo and Juliet theme. None the less, even though the first chapter is linguistically challenging, through gentle perserverance a glorious story evolves. A must buy."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"This was the best book that I have ever read. After having read it, I couldn't stop thinking about the characters lost and all those years of seperation between 'Barbara C'relli' and his 'kotitsi'. Pelagias life really made me come face to face with reality and sometimes I wondered 'why couldn't things just stay the way they were?' Unlike Louis de Bernieres, I really can't find the right words to express my feelings about this book; sometimes I think back to it and cry whilst other times I remember the more humourus stages such as Stamatis and Kokolios, psipsina, Iannis and the priest (but then I come to remembering that they were all lost lives and I get depressed again). A beautifull story! I'm going to read it over and over again but this time, I'll leave out the last few pages and try to pretend that those events didn't occur."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"It was my girlfriend who suggested that I read this book. Having just written my final year dissertation on experience during WW2, I was reluctant to be rerminded of my studies in my summer holidays! However, I have never read a book that has brought me to tears before....the lost love, the grief at departure from a loved one....blissfully romantic, and enthralling....How has someone called this the &quot;worst book I have ever read?&quot; If you know how it feels to be in love with someone you have to leave, or you just know how it feels to be in love....read this book, for I defy anyone with an ounce of emotion not to be moved to the point of tears every night before bedtime!@@"},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"This book was truly beautiful. It's true, the last 80-100 pages are written at a very different &quot;pace&quot; from the rest of the novel, but that really serves to demonstrate how relative the passage of time is -- how it can race by, or crawl by...Wonderful characters, very well-rounded and COMPLETE human beings. Nobody is perfect -- but that's life!This is not for the reader who likes straightforward plot-driven stories that are utterly realistic, with predictable endings. Not AT ALL. It's for the lover of magical realism, of blurred realities, of characters who seem to take over from the author, and build their own stories...Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"I had almost forgotten what it is like to be completely hypnotized by a novel. But Captain Corellis Mandoline does exactly that! And yes: its all there: humour, tragic, the lot. But most of all: the supreme beauty of an otherworldly kind, to be found also, for example, in the music of Schubert, Jacques Brel or Billie Holiday. Surely one of the best books I have ever read!"},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"an absolute masterpiece.....i have never read a book which was so rich in its prose, in its content and at the same time unputdownable!"},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"This is a wonderful book; beautiful, realistic, magical, and unbelievably sad. In,for example, the book's gradual transition from the idyllic beauty of the island at first, to the bleakness and the hardship that follows, we can see the real effect of war on people's lives; how some things change and some last, and how neither occurrence is guaranteed. Along the way, we also get insights into not only the central characters' lives, but also of the other characters or even figures of power, as well as the historical background told in a striking, interesting manner.This book had me crying throughout the entire last day that I read it; however, while this to me shows that it must have been great to be so moving, I also do fall into the group of people who did not like the ending. Partly, I admit, it was because I found it too sad; too cruel, like a Hardyish twist of fate, that the child that gave meaning to Pelagia's life after Corelli's departure should have been the reason he stayed away. But partly, I also felt that de Bernieres' condensing of nearly half a century's story into the last quarter of the book was unnecessary, and the events somewhat implausible. Having created such a wonderful world of characters (sometimes when reading it, it seemed more real than ordinary life), it seemed a waste to leave it behind.However, the book itself is an incredible piece of writing, and one of the best books I have ever read. The rating I have given &quot;Captain Corelli's Mandolin&quot; could be counted as full marks for the main bulk of the book, and considerably less for the last quarter/fifth of the book."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"As someone who has been known to consume novels in mere hours, I rearely buy books - I borrow them instead. After countless recommendations, however, I picked up a copy of Louis de Bernieres' novel in an airport bookshop, and read the first sentence, to me always the yardstick of whether a book will be worth the read or not. 25 minutes later the shop assistant was asking me whether I wanted to buy it, a smile on her face. I did, and never have I been alternately amused, entertained, moved, educated and captivated by a novel to actually read it through to the finish without interruption - of any kind. I was near silent for the entire plane journey - an eight hour flight. The only sounds I made were stifled, tearful laughter, and stifled, tearful sobs.Words will not suffice to describe Captain Corelli's Mandolin. Written in a richly lyrical style by a man in utter command of language (and not just English), the humour is infectious, the story compelling, the characters so fully fleshed it is almost as though you know them personally - and this of course means that the tragic events which do eventually follow strike home on the heart like nothing you will have read before or will read again. Tears do not roll down my cheeks that easily, yet Carlo's heroism has stayed with me weeks afterwards, as has Corelli's spirit, Pelagia's beauty and Doctor Iannis' indefatigable spirit.Yes, the last 70 pages add an epilogue that seems a touch out of place - maybe John Madden's film will address this - but nothing can detract from the humanity that has gone before, or the pathos and the sheer beauty of de Bernieres' prose. This is the greatest novel I have ever had the fortune to pick up and anyone with a romantic bone in their body should have it as compulsory reading. In a word? Wonderful."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"This novel is one of the best books that I have ever read. In my short 16 year-old life, I have not yet read any book even remotely comparable to the emotions and afterthoughts I have experienced throughout my reading of this novel. It is not only a semi-historical novel, it is a demonstration of the humour, tragedy, human fallacies and qualities in a time of conflict. The happenings de Bernieres describes are vivid, breathtakingly colourful...sometimes I wish that I myself could experience the lives of Pellagia or Corelli, just to feel what they felt at times of intense happiness, sadness or love. Although the beginning may be unattractively slow, or long-winded, don't be put off, because you'll definitely be missing out on the wealth of literary ecstacy later on....the ending, I'll just say that you shouldn't expect anything; but ultimately, it is more realistic than any other corny movie ending where &quot;everyone lives happily ever after&quot;. Anyway, I believe that ANYONE should read this book. Life would less exciting without it. :)"},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"As an A Level English student, I have to read many books for my course, however, I have never been so moved by a novel as I have when reading Captain Corelli's Mandolin. It forces a large variety of emotion from it's reader. Moments of delightful comedy can be followed by deep tragedy; in the space of two chapters you will find yourself laughing out loud to crying with sympathy.The narrative of the novel is extremely interesting. There is not one overall use of narative. Instead each chapter moves from the view points of characters from all perspectives of the story. Louis De Bernieres puts particular emphasis on the 'little people' of history and we realise that it is in fact those 'little people' who are the true historical heroes. This form of narrative provides a completely unbiased record of the war. Situations in the novel are actually based on true life situations which makes the novel that bit more personal.De Bernieres also cleverly combines many different themes in the novel, the most important of which (in my opinion) is that of mythology. This creates the message that history contines throughout our own lives and also the moral message that we never learn from our past.It is difficult to define this novel into a certain genre as it combines so many. It is not only a war novel, it provides romance, comdy, tragedy and many more. If I could give one piece of advice to a reader, it would be to give this book a chance. Many people in my English class found that though the book had a very slow start, it was in fact the most beautiful book they had ever read and by the end of the novel, they understood why the beginning of the book had been quite difficult to grasp.Captain Corelli's Mandolin is an extremely refreshing, original novel that also provides some intensely tragic and sensitive moments. It's a must on everybody's book shelf!"},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"I decided to read this novel out of interest both as a musician, and as an A-Level English Literature student. After two chapters I was hooked, and could not put the book down. The thing that puts this novel head and shoulders above all the others is the brilliant characterisation - as a reader, you begin to care for Pelagia, the doctor's daughter; Mandras, her fiance who has been left physically and psychologically scarred by the war; Carlo, the brave but gentle Italian homosexual; and of course, the eponymous Captain Corelli. The writing style also plunges the reader through a range of emotions. The book goes from being hilariously funny, to poignant, to brutally shocking. You cannot help but laugh at a chapter written entirely from Mussolini's viewpoint, in which 'Il Duce' demands that the temperature of Italy be lowered in order to increase the resilience of the Italian youth! Likewise, when an Italian character has his head split by a Greek bullet, and asks Carlo to break the news to his mother, the poignancy is unbearable. De Bernieres' description of Corelli's music is so vivid, you can almost hear the pieces he plays, and the depiction of battles is also brilliant. This book will open your eyes to the fact that not all of the Fascist troops in the Second World War were maniacs - some, like the fictitious Captain Corelli, were ordinary people caught up in a savage conflict."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"I was put off buying a copy of &quot;Captain Corelli's Mandolin&quot;, due to its popularity (it even appears at the end of &quot;Notting Hill&quot;, in Hugh Grant's hand!), but I regret not having read it soooner. There is a very good reason for its popularity. Quite simply, it is a literary work of genius. Despite my young years, I have read many novels, and I have never been so moved. It is sad, without being depressing; historical and political, without being dull; romantic, without being conventional and, for want of a better word, &quot;soppy&quot;. It is a novel which embraces the very epitome of the word &quot;perfection&quot;- I have even written to Mr. de Bernieres to commend him, something I have never done before; no author has even made me contemplate doing so until now. Some readers disliked the ending: I can understand their point of view, due to the sheer frustration and tears provoked, but there was a good twist of the plot, albeit somewhat cruel for the reader! Several times, I had to put the book down, to compose myself, that I may continue. I shouted! I roared with laughter! I sobbed! Once, I was crying for 10 minutes solid, laughing through my tears, in spite of myself. I have SO much to say about &quot;Captain Corelli's Mandolin&quot;, but frankly, a) I have no words that can be compared to Mr. de Bernieres' and b) I would hate for someone to read my review, and to get their hopes up too much. Please, just read this book. It is a fabulous yarn!"},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"This book definitely does live up to a great deal of its hype - it is moving, funny, very human and certainly gave me a real insight into the lives and tragedies of \`ordinary' civilians during the Second World War. But ... did anyone else have trouble with his women characters? I know a lot of people were displeased with the ending (me too; I think Corelli should have come back sooner or not at all -- as someone says earlier, the last 80 pages are fairly dire -- but even early on in the book, the way Pelagia dumps Mandras because he comes back all skanky - are we supposed to be on her side? And isn't it a disappointment that after Pelagia raises \`her' Antonia to be such a free thinking independent woman she winds up some bourgeouis, seemingly empty-headed trophy wife? I had a REALLY hard time with the women in this book, I'm afraid. Still, it feels like nit-picking when, honestly, overall, I'd recommend it very highly."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"Apart from his irritating habit of putting six-syllable words into the mouths of peasants, Louis de Berniers has penned a masterpiece. This work is both enchanting and humourous in a bitter-sweet combination of dispair and mirth. This is a story depicting humanity at its best and its worst, lubricated by humour which ranges from dust-dry to slapstick.De Berniers revels in the richness of the English language and like a child shuffling through mounds of autumn leaves, delights in kicking up a flurry of new words and expressions to challenge the reader, but always delivering 'le mot just'. Unlike some authors who delude themselves into thinking that peppering their prose with long words found by thumbing through a thesaurus can pass for literary skill, this author clearly has the warp and the weft of the language at his command.One last point. Those reviewers who whine that the ending is not to their liking should confine their reading to the works of Enid Blyton. Life does not always provide endings that make you go 'ahhh', and neither always should good literature.If you can aspire to good literature, I commend this book to you wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"In my life so far, the enormity of 17years i have NEVER read a book that was so beautifully constructed. The characters are perfect, and the beautiful island of Cephallonia leaves a taste in the mouth that lingers for months afterwards. Carlo, Antonio, Pelagia, and Dr Iannis are wonderful, and each in there own way unique. This is the only book that as soon as i finished i immediately began again. My only word of advice is not to watch the film, which pales in comparison to the book!A book that puts things in perspective!The best i've ever read!"},{"Title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"Pelagia has grown up on the peaceful Greek island of Cephallonia with her father, a widower and rather eccentric doctor who has taught her to be strong and independent. She takes for granted, somewhat ruefully, the fact that she will marry a local boy and settle down to a quiet life of her own.Instead of her quiet life, Pelagia finds herself touched by World War II. Her fiance leaves to fight, hoping to prove himself worthy of her. Meanwhile, Cephallonia is occupied by German soldiers as well as Italian soldiers, one of whom is quartered in Pelagia and her father's home.Pelagia and her father try their best to hate this Captain Corelli, who is an Italian soldier and therefore one of their oppressors. But as he continues to be charming and even seems apologetic about his place in their lives, it becomes harder and harder to cheerfully make his life miserable.I loved the middle of this book. I found it funny and engaging in many parts. I especially enjoyed the story of Carlo and the events that led him to Cephallonia. It was interesting to see how the characters and the island changed as a result of war, and how such an idyllic setting could be tarnished. I liked the determination of Corelli to charm Pelagia, and the pace at which their relationship developed.However, I found the beginning and the end of the book to be weak. It was hard for me to get a handle on the characters at first, as the story kept jumping from one to the other, and didn't start off with any context to make things easier. The ending was disappointing to me as well. After such a detailed story of Pelagia's life and the building relationship with Corelli as well as the development of her own talents and ambitions, her entire adulthood was simply skimmed over. Her descendants were made of cardboard, seemingly added in not to round out the story but just to prove that time had passed her by. A vibrant character was reduced to a caricature of a weepy grandmother, which I found unsatisfying. The Pelagia and Corelli plot twist also left me feeling empty, like this book about a young woman finding her place in her world was all a waste, as she ended up pining away in unhappiness."},{"Title":"Complete Guide to Greeting Card Design and Illustration","review":"Gives any aspiring home greeting card maker the tools to spark your own creativity.

We are both beginner skaters, my daughter has just turned 7. I found this book to be extremely helpful for the beginner. I found some very good advise on warm up exercises as well as what to look for in skates and correct body positions on skates. It is very easy to read and understand, although I have done the reading. I am sure we will both benefit from the information. There is also information for the intermediate level and advance level skater which I am sure we will benefit from once we get to that level. I highly reccommend this book."},{"Title":"Kids' Book Of Figure Skating: Skills, Strategies, And Techniques","review":"This book is fantastic for KIDS, but as a skating PARENT, I preferred FS for Dummies."},{"Title":"Kids' Book Of Figure Skating: Skills, Strategies, And Techniques","review":"This book has its good qualities and its confusing qualities. When I first read it, I loved it. It presented figure skating in a clear, easy to understand way--or so I thought. As I kept reading, I started getting confused.First, the good stuff. It tells a little about the history of ice rinks and the Zamboni, and how rinks dealt with cleaning the ice before the Zamboni was invented, which I found interesting. It has a good section on choosing skates that fit, and how to lace your skates properly. It's the only skating book I've found that goes into warming up before you skate, so in that regard, it's invaluable, although some illustrations of these stretches would have been even nicer.Now, the not-so-good stuff. The way it teaches you to get up off the ice after a fall is NOT the right way. It has you push up with your hands on the ice, which puts you at risk of having your fingers skated over by other skaters. It also teaches crossovers and swing rolls as beginning moves, right after you've learned the snowplow stop. I've been in classes for almost four months now, learned the snowplow stop in week two, and I still haven't learned crossovers or swing rolls.Another error is the numbers it gives for having your blades sharpened. According to the book, beginners should start with 1/2\\" radius and more advanced skaters should use 3/8\\". Therefore the more advanced you are, the shallower you want your radius. According to the professional who sharpens my skates, the opposite is true: the more advanced you are, the deeper you want your radius. Therefore, beginners should start with 3/4\\", and only very advanced skaters should use a radius of 1/2\\".This book is also confusing with what it considers beginner, intermediate, and advanced. If you only skate occasionally, it has you learning techniques that are for advanced students. If you are committed to skating once a week, this book considers you an intermediate skater and teaches you even more advanced techniques, things like spins and jumps!Overall, I give this book three stars. I'd recommend it for its advice on choosing skates, lacing skates, and its warm-up exercises. If you happen to be learning any of the techniques it teaches, you can use its advice on those moves to supplement your lessons. But don't try to teach yourself the skating moves it says are for your level, because it's very confused about what constitutes a beginner versus an intermediate or advanced skater. And definitely don't listen to its advice on sharpening your blades, because you'll end up with a radius that's too advanced for your skill level!"},{"Title":"Kids' Book Of Figure Skating: Skills, Strategies, And Techniques","review":"I've never found books to be too terribly useful until I came across this one. I work at an ice rink in my local town where I teach basic figure skating and coach hockey. My boss had a copy of this book and I started to look through it just for tips. I found so many things that I had wanted to learn - the mohawk, three-turn, and waltz jump - as well as things I hadn't thought of. If you want to advance your skating skills, no matter what your goal, this is the book for you. There is everything from stretches and balanced diets, turns, skating techniques, and even pairs skating. It's a wonderful learning tool for all ages (definitely not just kids!!)"},{"Title":"Kids' Book Of Figure Skating: Skills, Strategies, And Techniques","review":"Every skating parent should buy this book - even before you buy skates. You will refer to it again and again, as will the developing skater of any age. Rikki Samuels is a fountain of useful information, and she has written it down to make a book we have needed for a long time. There is helpful advice for every sapect of skating, from how to lace your boots to how to choose a coach and beyond. I have seen my skating friends young and old devouring it like a rich (organic!) chocolate cake. :)"},{"Title":"Kids' Book Of Figure Skating: Skills, Strategies, And Techniques","review":"This book was not quite what I expected. My daughter is still a beginning skater (Freestyle 1), yet after paging through it, I found 3/4 of the book to be irrelevant to her level. The small portion of the book that would be helpful to her begins on page 161. I would only recommend this book for parents/children who are thinking about beginning skating, or have just begun to take group lessons."},{"Title":"New Essays on Sister Carrie (The American Novel)","review":"i felt the story was long and borin"},{"Title":"New Essays on Sister Carrie (The American Novel)","review":"I was forced to read this book for a combination honors English, History class. We were studying the Guilded Age and the teachers felt this novel would help to portray exactly what people went through. Needless to say I was very bored. The descriptions are so intense and Dreiser's style of writing was not enough to keep me awake. There were certain aspects that I enjoyed, however the majority of this novel was comprised of verbose sections. This book did not really meet my expectations and I was not very satisfied. However, I was told that you might need to read it 5 times before all of the meaning would come through. I wouldn't give it the time."},{"Title":"Economy","review":"Take a deep breath and then open your mind to a powerful new approach to understanding our economy. The Ultimate America provides step by step, logical, easy to read facts about our monetary system, defying everything we've ever learned from our politicans and the media . . . and it really makes sense! I love being challenged. The Ultimate America challenged my ability to think beyond what I've learned from the Democratic and Republican platforms, and truly understand federal income, debt, taxes, spending and what it all means to our economy and to our quality of living. I read The Ultimate America twice, and it has really changed my way of thinking."},{"Title":"Economy","review":"This book challenges many commonly held perceptions about our economy.

It was extremely eye opening and a little scarey; exposing the myths and realities of our economy and the politicins who control it.

So every now and then I come on here in search of new titles for her. When I saw this one I thought she'd love it, it's from Little Sister's pov after all, and Ella's a little sister, too! Whenever we read the other Little Critter books that Little Sis is in, Ella is quick to point out that she's unhappy or wants that toy or cat in the window, etc., so I thought, great, a book all about sis and what SHE wants to be when she grows up! Girls everywhere will rejoice! Well, it's an adorable little book, and written in Little Critter style from Sisses' pov as says, I was not disappointed, VERY cute, but my Ella was! She wondered where the heck Little Critter was to be found and scowled at me for buying such a book that excluded him. Now she has asperger's, so sometimes changes in her world just upset her, and I didn't think about this getting to her when I bought the book, so I wasn't going to have her dislike affect my review of an overall good book, she was just upset it lacked Critter and if you have a child very used to things who don't like change, you may want to consider that before buying this book as well. But it is a cute book! I think maybe Ella may eventually warm up to it but its a good think I ordered others with it that she was quite happy with! I fear the day I run out of Little Critter books! Maybe she will have moved on to something else by then, lol"},{"Title":"When I Grow Up (Look-Look)","review":"Little Critter's sister tells about what she plans to be when she grows up. She imagines herself being able to have a variety of occupations when she gets older. I teach ESL (English as a Second Language). I found this book when I teaching about occupations. All children seem to love Little Critter, in this case his sister, so they are motivated to want to read about the occupations mentioned in the book. The pictures are great, full of lots of clues about the words on the pages. There is a minimum of text which makes it easier for children who are just starting to read to manage. I like the book and would sure like to get more copies to use in Guided Reading groups."},{"Title":"When I Grow Up (Look-Look)","review":"When I Grow Up tells of a predicament that often faces Little People; because LittleCritter's little sister is weary with being too little; she daydreams about all the extraordinarythings she is going to do when she grows up. She envisions becoming a graceful and grand ballet dancer, or a courageous high wire walker, or a speedy race car driver, or a truck driver, or a world-famous doctor, or ...I teach six year olds who do not always have well developed speaking skills notwithstanding the fact that English is our native language. Children frequently have a good bit of trouble trying to relate ideas, plans or thoughts.The illustrations offered by Mercer Mayer on the pages of When I Grow Up are so well done, child pleasing and full of lots of clues relating to the words on the pages that my students are provided impetus for their discussion. I find that my students are often well able to put into words more of what they want to say as I turn the page and they view the illustration. As time goes on during the school term the kids are able to go on to more verbalization without need for relying upon the pictures.Little Critter's sister communicates her numerous and varied plans to the reader for what she will do WHEN she grows up. I use When I Grow Up as a discussion starter in my First Grade class room as we talk about different types of jobs available for grown ups. In an area where almost everyone is involved in the oil fields or fast food, it is handy to have a child pleasing book to use to help children develop the perception that there are many achievable occupations open in life including, but not limited to, oil fields or fast food. Little sister envisages herself engaged in any number of interesting and miscellaneous career choices when she gets older.With a bare minimum of text on each page; Little People who are beginning to make sense of the squiggles we adults call words on each page often feel very self-assured to take the book to read to a cuddly buddy in one of the DEAR offices.I have found First Graders, whether those I knew 20 years ago or those today, all love Little Critter, and his family. First Graders today continue to enjoy Little Critter, sister and all of the works created by Mercer Mayer.I teach in an area where books may not be readily available in all homes. I begin reading Little Critter/Mercer Mayer the first day of school and read the books all through the term. My students often bring one or another of the Mercer Mayer books from the book basket right to the last day of school.When I Grow Up is a work my \\"grown up\\" First Graders never fail to identify with. Most of my students have little brothers and sisters, plus they themselves generally are also little brothers and sisters. Osage County First Grade well recognizes the quandary facing Little Critter and little sister.Mercer Mayer's Little Critter books in general, and When I Grow Up in particular, are magnificent works filled with marvelous illustrations and child pleasing developments. While the books are for the most part slanted toward the pre school set, not every preschooler comes from homes where books and reading are practiced. TV games and raunch are often more recognized than are various children's authors, or the books they have written. I like to fill in that gap when possible.Art work illustrating each of Mercer Mayer works are filled with detailed features and are gently presented. In the works are found tiny critters that recur from page to page - a cricket, a frog, a grasshopper, a mouse, a spider; each of them is incorporated into the visual tale. When I Grow Up has its own set of tinies, the kids and I look for them from drawing to drawing, and page to page.When I Grow Up is, as are all Mercer Mayer works, all about reiteration. As Little Critter keeps doing the same kind of thing over and over in many of the books, Little Sister is doing the same thing over and over this time. Words are repeated over and over. Adults often become weary with all the repetition, however, little readers flourish with repetition and learn through repetition.Osage County First Grade listens to the stories, choose When I Grow Up for DEAR reading time and use the illustrations as starting points for their own drawings. When I Grow Up is an exceptional work filled with child friendly graphics, duplication, and text children CAN read. When I Grow Up is a book we use for social studies discussion regarding occupations and possible job choices beyond the most common or what is right in front of our nose. Happy to recommend.Molly MartinReviewer"},{"Title":"When I Grow Up (Look-Look)","review":"Right now my daughter has 5 books that she carries around with her at all times begging for us to read to her 24/7. One of those books is \\"When I Grow Up.\\" We've must have read this book to her about 1,000 times. We line up her \\"favorite\\" books on the window sill next to the rocking chair and have her pick out a book one after the other. She always picks this book as the first book and last book to read. I make funny noises or comments for each of the occupations...ie: When she says she'll be a truck driver, I will pull my hand down and make a HONKING noise and then say, Get out of the way. My daughter just cracks up. And when she is a race car driver, I make speeding car noises and then a screaching noise to make the stopping sounds. She loves it and says, \\"You're funny mom.\\" She LOVES it and I would recommend it to any toddler."},{"Title":"When I Grow Up (Look-Look)","review":"My little two year old granddaughter loves the Mercer Meyer books.

Individual customer service rep's(esp. if US-based) will empathize, take your report, and forwared it to the department of summary deletions.Anyway, if you want to get the copy with the most richly done illustrations that I've found, this one is it.My question would be: How'd you find it?"},{"Title":"The Pied Piper of Hamlin","review":"When I was about seven-years-old a family member gave me a recording, (78s) of the Pied Piper of Hamelin narrated by Ingrid Bergman. As I listened, I could see the characters in my head and never tired of the story.A month ago I bought the book for my eight-year-old granddaughter who lives about eight hundred miles away from me, because I was afraid with the passing of one more generation, the story might be forgotten.It is a lovely book, written by Robert Browning more than a century ago. The drawings are perfect, given the dated language used in this book. And the story has a simple message, about honoring our promises.Sadly, my granddaughter glanced at the book and was clearly not interested. I wanted to read it with her, intending to make clear the English used by Browning.So, a tale almost twelve hundred years old bit the dust, at least in our family it did.But if you are a lover of this fable, it is worth your time to try it out on the children in your family. They will be the richer for it."},{"Title":"The Pied Piper of Hamlin","review":"Ok.I HAVE NOT READ THIS BOOK.I hope that you don\`t hurt my reviews for this,but in a way,I HAVE read this book.I am in this play,so I have read this script.And since the play is going to be on Saturday,(5th) and Sunday(6th) and also for the next weekend,I have to read this script over and over and over again.I think that this book is a very good book.In the play I am Miss Applebee but I think that this book is very good it must be."},{"Title":"The Pied Piper of Hamlin","review":"\\"Rats!They fought the dogs, and killed the cats,And bit the babies in the cradles,And ate the cheeses out of the vats,And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles,Split open the kegs of salted sprats,Made nests inside men's Sunday hats,And even spoiled the women's chats,By drowning their speakingWith shrieking and squeakingIn fifty different sharps and flats.\\"Robert Browning (1812-1889) first published his poem \\"The Pied Piper of Hamelin, A Child's Story\\" in 1842, based on an old German legend which may or may not have had some basis in historical fact. Browning was a serious poet; even in a poem filled with playful rhymes written specifically for children, he did not \\"dumb down\\" his language, but expected his readers to do a little work in understanding some of his \\"big words.\\"Kate Greenaway (1846-1901) was one of the most famous and popular illustrators of children's literature in the latter part of the 19th Century. She had grown up loving Browning's poem, and shortly before his death she requested and received his permission to republish it accompanied by her own illustrations. This edition was initially published in 1888 under the imprint of George Routledge & Sons, which was at that same time in the process of splitting between Routledge and Frederick Warne. Starting in 1889 all subsequent editions carried the Warne imprint. The book continued to be popular, and Frederick Warne has issued reprints from time to time, well into the late 20th Century. This Warne edition is not in print at present, but used copies with various reprint dates are available from Amazon Marketplace sellers.However, two different reprint editions are currently available, each with the complete original text and illustrations, and each presented with loving care from an eminently respectable publisher, in well-made but modestly priced editions. The Dover reprint (ISBN 0486296199) is full-size, in a sturdy paperback; the Alfred A Knopf/Borzoi/Everyman's Library reprint (ISBN 0679428127) is part of their Children's Classics series, in a very sturdily constructed hardcover with sewn sections that will not crack with use, but the page size is somewhat smaller. Both are beautiful books, and either is an excellent value.As noted in the Editorial Reviews above, there have been other editions of \\"The Pied Piper,\\" with different illustrations, and at least one seems to have been issued with the poem itself \\"retold\\" to make the language simpler; neither of those reviews is discussing this original version. Some readers may prefer one or another of these different versions. But anyone wanting to stick with Browning's original full text and Greenaway's original charming, muted and subtle illustrations should choose between the Dover or the Everyman's, or visit Amazon's Marketplace sellers to look for a copy of the Frederick Warne."},{"Title":"The Pied Piper of Hamlin","review":"BUY THIS BOOK!! They hardly ever make them like this anymore! Just the type of book you remember from your childhood. Beautiful cover, layout, and illustrations. The poem is lyrical and mysterious, appropriate for all ages. A small jewel."},{"Title":"The Pied Piper of Hamlin","review":"This book would be a wonderful treasure for the pictures alone. Kate Greenaway, noted children's illustrator, has created a magical world of beautiful children, innocent faces, and romantic, nostalgic costumes. The colors on these pages are breathtaking, and the details (although Greenaway is always faulted for not drawing hands and feet well) are superb. This story is not for very young children, as it contains some troublesome themes. For the older child, perhaps 7+, the story might provoke some interesting post-read family discussions about honesty, trust, and the actual state of the children at the end of the tale. This is even a beautiful book to give to adults, as the messages about human nature can be appreciated on a deeper level."},{"Title":"The Pied Piper of Hamlin","review":"When you look at the preview of this book under the \\"Kindle\\" tab, all those great 19th century color illustrations are there, and they are goreous. It is at least half the reason I decided to get this editon rather than looking for it in a Robert Browning \\"Complete Works\\". I know, its free, so what's the big deal. The problem is that I see the Kindle, especially in color, is a great tool for delivering books to kids, and there are other similar classic kids books where all the great illustrations are there, intact. And, this is faulty marketing. It is promoting something you do not get. Again, I know, it's free. But I'm still disappointed, and you will be too, if you want the classic art work for children."},{"Title":"The Pied Piper of Hamlin","review":"This is the &quot;orginal&quot; version of the classic story. Browning's poem is much less a children's tale about a rat catcher than a brilliant study of human psychology, salesmanship, and charisma. Newer re-writes of the story tend to miss the point entirely. Browning's nuances, combined with the older language and somewhat sparse illustrations, makes this book much better suited for adults than younger children."},{"Title":"The Pied Piper of Hamlin","review":"I picked up this book because it was mentioned in another book I read recently (The Mark Of The Angel). On page 24 of that book: &quot;The Pied Piper&quot; has been his favorite story ever since he was a boy. Well, I clearly felt I was missing out. I never read the story when I was a boy. I know I'd heard the title many times...so my curiosity got the best of me. Well...I've read it. It's a simple fifteen minute read...but worth re-reading another time. It's a very profound poetic story that should be read under a shady tree because it should be read slowly...realizing its uniqueness. I think I'll gift it to my nephew who will be turning 8 years old on November 2nd. If you're in the mood for a poetic story...you must check it out...even if at a library because I'm sure it will be there. It's a Childrens' Classic...C'mon...relive your childhood!"},{"Title":"The Pied Piper of Hamlin","review":"The Pied Piper of Hamelin is a very different children's classic. Few other children's picture books tell a story in Victorian poetry. The book isn't just original; it is excellent. I have always enjoyed Robert Browning's poetry, and this is no exception. I was surprised at how easy it was to read this book compared to some of Browning's other verse, and it was pleasing to read, especially considering that this is focused toward children. I loved all of the poetic techniques used by Browning. His iambic tetrameter in couplets works very well for young readers, and I loved his use of anaphora and internal rhyme. The story is, of course, brilliant. It is the usual folk tale that every child has heard and needs to hear. It teaches its lesson, and Browning's version is even more entertaining than other versions. Also, the illustrations by Kate Greenway are fabulous. It is impossible to imagine this story in Browning's Victorian verse without Greenway's Victorian artistry. This is a true children's classic, it should definately last for years to come, and it makes and excellent buy for children or for libraries."},{"Title":"The Pied Piper of Hamlin","review":"A very lively, poetic version of a classic tale.

Ever since I was a kid. Reading Baum in published order is an ever ongoing project with me. Now I'm not one who wants to take apart the wonderful stories and put all the elements into little boxes and find out what they are make of, but this book does something that is just the opposite. It takes the stories and looks at them in the order in which they were written! This book is a wonderful look at the &quot;periods&quot; in the Baum Canon. This is a great look at how say something like the Life and Adventures of Santa Clause and Queen XiXi of IX relate to each other. Great writing and research makes this book a MUST for any Baum collector."},{"Title":"Double Your Brain Power: How to Use All of Your Brain All of the Time","review":"This book falls into the category of books that claim that a few mental exercises can make Einsteins out of all of us, that the Einsteins and Newtons of the world are not that much different than the rest of us. While I don't agree with this belief, I do believe that mental ability can be improved through exercises and I found many of the exercises to be interesting and helpful. I had a problem with the author's demonstration of how these exercises can help the reader. In the introduction, the author has the reader read a section of text and then she introduces a &quot;Brain Power Doubler&quot; for the reader to use while reading a second section of text. The &quot;Brain Power Doubler&quot; is supposed to allow the reader to read the second section of text in less time than the first section of text even though the two sections are supposed to have the same number of words. When I went back and checked the number of words in both sections, I found several times as many words in the first section than in the second section, which had more to do with the time differences than the exercise."},{"Title":"Double Your Brain Power: How to Use All of Your Brain All of the Time","review":"I picked this book up in a &quot;bargain bin,&quot; so my expectations were rather low. Unfortunately, they were fulfilled.The actual practices in the book are rather good. Some of them I've seen before and practice in my daily life. But the book itself tries to back them up with the saddest examples of cargo-cult science and unverifiable &quot;case studies&quot; I've seen this side of _The Peter Principle_.One example: the author is trying to convince the reader that near-perfect recall is possible to achieve. As a convincing argument, she puts forth the fact that the average desktop computer has near-perfect recall, and scientists have stated that the modern computer is many years away from being able to emulate or compete with the human brain. Therefore, a human should be able to do anything a computer can! This kind of sad logic can be found in every chapter.Intriguingly, the author includes a chapter on how to read critically. The fourteen techniques are all good, if not groundbreaking. The irony, to me, was that this book as a whole fails every test--from relying heavily on (flawed) analogy as noted above, to vague attribution (aside from a rather light bibliography, there are is not a single endnote backing up any of the many &quot;scientific studies&quot; referenced), to appeals to authority (the author likes to drop the name of Isaac Asimov as a &quot;personal friend&quot;) and &quot;emotionally loaded arguments&quot; (the exuberant infomercial theme evident in the title is carried throughout the book).All in all, if you already have a habit of reading or thinking critically, you will find this book hard to read. If you can hold your nose past the garbage long enough to read about the techniques, you may find them interesting."},{"Title":"Double Your Brain Power: How to Use All of Your Brain All of the Time","review":"This book was terrible.

They even let me do a booksigning...a really great experience!"},{"Title":"The Abyss","review":"I picked this book up solely because of the endorsement by Stephen King on the cover (\\"I loved this book. The Abyss is very close to being great.\\") By the time I had finished, I wished I had ignored Mr. King. I found the book not enjoyable in the least.The story's premise is interesting enough, if not exactly original. A group of coal miners deep under the Tennessee ground in one of the country's deepest mines begins to experience strange phenomena. As they dig deeper, they uncover artifacts that seem to have no business so far underground: strange looking thorns, odd rock formations. Some of the men notice a smell of sulfur; others see things moving in the shadows from the corners of their eyes.On the surface, the town of Bethel begins to undergo weird changes as well. Red liquid that looks and smells suspiciously like blood flows from the city faucets. Animals begin acting strange, even hostile. Things start to fall apart for no apparent reason and decay more rapidly than they should. And people start to change too, in subtle ways at first, but then more and more blatantly.When a hermitlike old woman who has lived in Bethel longer than most recalls that similar things happened a long time ago when the mine was new, a small band of citizens wonders what foreign forces are affecting their lives. And by the time the horrifying answer becomes unquestionably clear, it's too late to do anything but run.The biggest problem with the book is the over-the-top writing. Mr. Cunningham tries to hard to construct sentences in as poetic a form as possible, resulting in a mishmash of flowery prose that describes too much and says too little. Characters present another problem, as not one is likeable. The protagonists drink to excess, are promiscuous, curse, and constantly demean each other--and this is before the mine's evil influence begins to have its way with the town. The town itself, with its shambling buildings and depressed residents, presents a dreary picture of what hell might actually be like long before the more stereotypical fiery variety is unleashed from the deep pit outside of town.Loose threads and meaningless subplots abound, and many scenes are confusing. The author strove so much for descriptive writing that he at times seems to have forgotten to tell the reader what's going on. The story has no apparent climax, and the ending, while not exactly predictable, is far from satisfying.The depictions of hopeless sexual promiscuity and vulgar language alone are enough to render this book unreadable. When these are combined with poor writing and an underdeveloped story, the book becomes first tiresome and eventually dreary. While some might argue that the depression I underwent while reading parts of this book constitute an authorial triumph, I found the entire reading experience to be unremarkable at best and downright wearying most of the time. Stephen King's opinion notwithstanding, I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Abyss","review":"Don't make the same mistake that I did and read this book at night. I have read many, many horror novels and this may be the scariest one ever. Years later, I still get chills when I think about some of the scenes in this book!"},{"Title":"The Abyss","review":"Few books are as haunting as this one. A chilling foray into the what if genre that never lets go. The slight shallowness of the characters leads the reader to care greatly for them and to feel their pain, their sadness, their terror. If you wish to read one of the darkest portrayals of Armageddon (and perhaps the quickest) I suggest seeking this book out. Hopefully it's out of print status will change."},{"Title":"The Abyss","review":"This book could have been a good horror story. The story line was good actually. But by the time I got thru all the vulgarness and [...],I was totally disgusted. I am not a prude by any means,but when I finished this book I threw it in the trash. And then ending was a huge letdown as well.It leave you thinking \\"What the heck is that all about?\\" Sorry I couldn't give it less than 1 star."},{"Title":"The Abyss","review":"This book is appauling. I love horror books but this one is written in such an amateurish way that I am sure that Mr Cunningham must return either to his previous job as an art expert or take up a new proffession as an extra on the next Flintstones movie. Truly a waste of time."},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"This novel is a travesty. That Ms. Barrett would even presume to complete the work of one of the greatest English authors is audacity personified. This book is extremely boring and seemingly plotless. If you're looking for a satisfying completion to this novel choose &quot;Sandition&quot; by Jane Austen and &quot;Another Lady&quot; instead. Ms. Barrett not only fails to deliver the wittiness and sharp insight of a Jane Austen novel, she also fails miserably at attempting Austen's style of writing. Truly a disappointment, to put it mildly."},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"Jane Austen's fragment is a delightful story which is ruined with the first sentence Julia Barrett writes. In it she has Charlotte repeat the joke the narrator has just told. The language becomes convoluted and flowery. All the characters sound like Sir Edward Denham but without the poetry quotations. There is very little action of any kind in the book. Jane Austen's characters fade into the background and the new ones introduced by Barrett take over the story. Charlotte, Lady Denham and Sidney Parker seem to change character completely as soon as Barrett takes over the writing. She takes six or more pages to say what Austen would have put in a couple of sentences. What plot there is bears little resemblence to anything Jane Austen seems to have had in mind."},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"I am always eager to read completions of Jane Austen's work, unlike those who find it unthinkable that anyone should touch the gems she left behind. I find Ms. Barrett's work disappointing, however, because it appears to me that it lacks the subtlety and charm so characteristic of Jane Austen's: the minimal changes of place and scene, the delicate development of character through conversation and observation, the wry humor she employs and the focus of thought and action through the eyes of her primary characters. This Charlotte is too full of inconsistencies of characterization and plot (Lady Denham throwing lavish entertainments? Lurid tales of piracy and gambling?) for me, and I didn't enjoy reading it. I liked Sanditon by Another Lady much better - I think she did a lovely job of capturing JA's essence and finishing the novel in a manner more consistent with it's original author's style and pattern."},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but it pains me to say that is was terrible. I am mystified why the author chose to call the book Charlotte because after JA's portion, Charlotte is rarely mentioned. The rest of the story is a collection of rambling, tedious speeches by minor characters. The story becomes ridiculous when the author introduces piracy and horse racing into Sandition. It ends with the inevitable, but unbelievable uniting of Charlotte to Sidney. It is unbelievable because they have barely had 2 or 3 superficial conversations in all of the author's addition to JA's fragment. Don't waste your time on this one, check out Sandition instead."},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"Even casual readers of Jane Austen understand that all her writing exists within a certain range. All her novels contain some variation of certain plot elements - the hero, the female rival(s) for the hero's affections, the decoy hero, the wouldn't-marry-him-even-if-he-was/even-though-he-is-worth-10,000-a-year anti-hero. Austen's genious was not in original plotting, but in her use of this formula to explore character, human nature and society. The opening chapters of _Charlotte_, those penned by our beloved authoress, set up all these elements brilliantly. Unfortunately, when Julia Barrett takes over the narrative, we find no social commentary (forgiveable perhaps since Ms. Barrett does not live in the society described), but more importantly, a plot which ambles about as non-sensically as a drunk who has lost his sense of direction. The heroine spends most of her time outside the hero's company, and a considerable time outside of Sanditon and away from most of the characters introduced. The characters clearly intended by Austen as rivals disappear from the pages between their introduction and their marriages, approximately 90% of the story. I can hardly critize Ms. Barrett for not writing in Austen's style or with Austen's formula. I only expect such deviations to be done well, in a manner that is internally consistent with the characters introduced, which _Charlotte_ is not."},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"As a lover of all things Austen, I was very excited when I first came upon this book. But this completion of Sanditon is incredibly weak. The plot wanders aimlessly, although &quot;wanders&quot; is perhaps too favorable of a term since it implies some momentum.Worse, the characterization is frightfully dull. The previous Sanditon completion in the 1970s by &quot;Another Lady&quot; is vastly superior, fleshing out very memorable characters and making you really care about Charlotte. By the end of this book, I didn't care about any of the characters as they were so frightfully dull. The climactic conclusion was more like an afterthought; perhaps the writer(s) wanted to be done with the book as fast as I did.Avoid this debacle and track down the completion by &quot;Another Lady&quot; instead."},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"As a JA lover, I was excited to receive a copy of this book, and eager to like it. Unfortunately, that was impossible, as Barrett's continuation on Austen's chapters is exceptionally poor work. Barrett introduces extraneous characters for no apparent reason, wastes pages outlining their motives and mental states in tedious detail, and then leaves them to accomplish nothing in particular. You know something is seriously awry with the plotting and pacing when the heroine's relationship with the hero hardly makes an appearance until the final 2.5 pages of the book!The writing, too, is extremely disappointing, with convoluted sentence structures and seemingly random chapter closures. Worst of all, the work completely lacks Austen's understated and sparkling wit.I strongly recommend skipping this work altogether, and reading &quot;Sanditon&quot; instead. It's a charming and satisfying completion of the JA fragment that, unlike &quot;Charlotte,&quot; remains true to Austen's original characters and prose style."},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"I found this novel terrible and was a waste of time. I can't bare reading another page after chapter 11 where Austen had left it. This is by far the worst novel I've ever read. If you want to read the completed version of Sanditon, I would suggest Sanditon by Another Lady. It's a good novel and was well done compare to this clumsy one. This novel is not at all worth reading."},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"I am a big Jane Austen's fan, and I love to read the continuations and sequels. However, I had trouble finishing this book. The break in the writing between Austen's original text and the addition is glaring. The style changes, the characters change, the plot leaps wildly. It's almost like two books -- the author shouldn't have bothered keeping the original text. She probably would have done better rewritting it to fit her own style. I highly recommend reading the other Sanditon continuation by Anne Telscombe instead. It does a seamless job of continuing and the characters stay in character."},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"I received this as a gift because I am a huge JA fan. I read it through to the end because I read all books related to JA. I cannot believe this book has a rating of 3/5 stars. The plot, as continued by Barrett is absurd in the extreme, and, as others have pointed out, inconsistent and capricious. There is almost no dialogue, a distinct departure from Austen's usual style. A smarmy, confused, verbose narrator conveys most of the \\"story line.\\" Adding insult to injury is the unnatural and awkward writing style. Barring a few grammatical constructions and vocabulary changes, Austen's language is not so different from our own. Barrett would have us believe that people, in truth, fly everywhere and use the conditional every other word. Would that eager JA readers could but be warned away from this unhappy collection of words!"},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"This is the most credible of the sompletions of Jane Austen's SANDITON. There is good character development and the Parker brothers in particular are dealt with well. Well worth a read."},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"Those of us who adore Jane Austen are rightly fearful of attempts to pick up where she left off. But Julia Barrett is on to Austen's devastating wit--the critical and amused eye that she casts over the social landscape--and the result is a lovely read."},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"The great thing about JANE AUSTEN'S CHARLOTTE is the way Julia Barrett picks up Austen's most admirable start and continues undaunted by the broadness of its sweep. This novel is marvelously carried forward just as Austen conceived it--with all its characters brought to life. Charlotte and Sidney Parker's minimal but fine romance is superb!"},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"Julia Barrett has done a wonderful job capturing the imagery set out by Jane Austen. Austen would be proud, and if she were still with us, would probably be posting her own rave on Amazon!"},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"Critics have noted how Jane Austen's ambitious last manuscript was unique to her, in that it gives not a hint as to how the work would develop and conclude. Whereas the design for the whole of THE WATSONS, for example, which she abandoned, is clearly predictable, as are most of her other plots. The wonder of this new completion of SANDITON is that Julia Barrett brilliantly imagines the evolution of Austen's art, sees its new spirit, her increasing response to nature, to locale, to the changing broader world of the Late Regency period of 1817. Courtship and romance is no longer the main thing! CHARLOTTE is a brave undertaking, almost miraculous in execution. Bravos to Barrett!"},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"Julia Barrett's completion of Jane Austen's last novel, renamed CHARLOTTE must have been an irrisitible challenge to Ms. Barrett who has previously paid homage to Austen by daring to evoke the language and the ethos in replicated sequels to the master's most famous works. This requires a devotion as well as an affinity to that period:an understanding of the spoken word of that era. Then with this unique skill Ms.Barrett recreates the emotions, the play of interaction in society,which becomes an holiday of words unlike our functional, at best, verbal exchanges. Ms. Barrett's vision has been realised in this rare and courageously written narrative. CHARLOTTE is especially interesting for it serves as a journey away from our daily interests. Someone might remark Ms Barrett inhabited Jane Austen's milieux in another life!"},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"I truly enjoyed this novel, as much as I did its predecessors \\"Presumption\\" and \\"The Third Sister\\", I think, though each of the three had its own individual, special delights.

Julia Barrett definitely has a \\"felicity\\" with language much like the \\"great lady\\". I loved the turns of phrases, the chapter beginnings, the extremely insightful observations on human nature, both its strengths and foibles, and above all, the way she, like her wonderful predecessor, makes the characters individualistic and memorable without a lot of physical description or observation.And, the satirical asides and situations in \\"Charlotte\\" seem to have more contemporary resonances than in the previous novels or even in Jane's. I was constantly smiling and even laughing out loud at Lady Denham and Mr. Parker and how they got caught up in the seashore health fads and get-rich-quick enthusiasms of the \\"new day\\" dawning in England in the early 1800s.

Barrett really did open up \\"Charlotte\\" to the rest of the world, hinted at in her two previous works as well by the \\"great lady\\" herself in her later novels, but she also somehow maintained the high level of wit and charm and intelligence that are so enjoyable in her mentor. So, kudos and many thank yous for another very enjoyable visit to Jane Austen land. As with a few other books I've really enjoyed, I'm sure I'll take them down in a couple of years to re-read. And, I'll definitely recommend them to whomever I run into who seems capable of enjoyment of such a high order.

I had prepared myself for a let-down when I passed from the first twelve chapters, written by Jane Austen, and embarked on those Barrett wrote. Who can complete with Jane Austen? No one can, of course, but Barrett has the wisdom not to complete. She doesn't try to ape Jane Austen. She keeps her own integrity by writing in a style and manner that harmonize with Jane Austen's. You turn the page from Austen to Barrett without a jolt, and the narrative runs on smoothly and neatly.Whatever Jane Austen herself intended to do in 'Sanditon' (as her twelve chapters are usually called) is a secret she took to her grave. Julia Barrett has of course followed Austen's clues in particulars, but more importantly she perceptively realized that Austen was distinctly moving in a new direction, intending to write a novel quite different from her earlier ones. A writer with less skill and insight, less perspicacity, would have ignored this and wrenched the narrative back into Austen's familiar old pattern. Julia Barrett has trusted her own instincts, bringing real inventiveness and originality to 'Charlotte.' Her boldness provides surprises and is vivid with a sense of fun that captivates the reader!"},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"While Julia Barrett touches on the language \\"spoken\\" in Jane Austen's novels, it's not expressed with any feeling or wit. The words seem to be a jumble of Austenique words placed to look good, but not sound good. After chapter 11 the book goes into a million different directions, is narrated from several characters points of view, leaves almost no room for the main characters (Charlotte Heywood) views to be expressed, her feelings to be voiced and is just plain messy.In most of Austen's novels, you have an opportunity to see the relationship grow between the main charactor and her \\"intended\\". In Charlotte, you wonder how they fell in love at all. They rarely see one another, they rarely speak and when they do, it's mostly short and nonsensible.Then there is the plot line, or rather shall I say lines for there are several (thank you Mr. Collins). There is the plot to save Sandition by gaining a physician, by adding a Crescent, allowing racing gentleman and their horses (and then the sub-plot to this to keep them out)and then the smuggling and bootlegging. Dear me! How did anything get done? I confess, I got bored and just scanned the rest of the book! Honestly, I was disgusted.If you love Austen's last novel and would like to see how she may have ended it, let me recommend a book far superior to Charlotte. Instead try Sandition.Sandition does tend to get a little flowery in some places. Charlotte Heywood does tend to get a little flustered and unable to speak her mind around Sidney Parker. However on the whole, it's a much more convincing end to Austen's last attempt. The characters actually grow. They learn. Here is an example.In Charlotte: Arthur Parker is an \\"invalid\\" who learns that perhaps he is not so invalid and then spends the rest of the book remarking to his intended, also thinking herself an invalid, about how herorically he withstands his difficulties with stomach ailments. To which she agrees and says that they only can know how much each endurs to live with this horrid desease. And then they proceed to expound on how proud they are over their problems and attempt to live with them. (sigh).In Sandition: Arthur Parker is an \\"invalid\\" who realizes that perhaps, not only is he NOT an invalid but that there are people fairing far worse then him and do not complain. He falls for a young woman who truly is fragile but makes no complaints, only attempts to live each good day she has to the fullest. He learns from her what it is to be healthy. They both grow and support each other in a common goal that gets them out of a smoke filled tea room and into the fresh sea breezes. He collects and she draws what he collects. He learns to protect her (instead of whining over his bouts and supposed illnesses) and she learns to be stronger.Sandition is also a book in which you can actually SEE Charlotte and Sidney fall in love. You can watch her struggle over \\"does he or does he not\\". It's a much more delightful alternative to all the \\"our herione\\" and \\"our hero\\" and \\"my herione\\" and \\"my hero\\"'s that go on in Charlotte (if I read one more of those I thought I would choke).So, to sum up? Don't Don't Don't waste your time, money or energy on Charlotte, but DO get Sandition. It's a welcome addition to Jane Austen's library."},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"As I was reading this book, I could tell to the sentence exactly where Jane Austen left off and Julia Barrett began. The plot became confusing, and characters began to be inconsistent. Lady Denham, whom Charlotte finds to be very mean (stingy) suddenly decides to fund a lavish entertainment. Sidney Parker enters the scene just before the break, and it is implied that they will see more of him in just a few hours. However, somehow Charlotte doesn't see him again until the aforementioned entertainment, a chapter or two later (even though she is staying with his brother). The rest of the novel is incredibly fragmented, with whole chapters dwelling on some of the very minor characters, with practically no character development of the two protagonists, whose love story covers at most five pages. Instead the novel dwells on some very unlikely developments involving horses, gambling, and smugglers. It was a very disappointing read. _Sanditon_ was a much more satisfying completion."},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"Words cannot discribe how disappointed I was with this book! Having read and re-read all of Jane Austen's books many times, I can say that Julia Barrett added little to no value. The work was better left un-touched."},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"I have often wondered what would have become of Sandition, Jane Austen's last work had she finished it before her untimely demise. I heard that several authors have written a completed version of the aforementioned novel. I decided to pick up Charlotte because Julia Barrett entertained me with her novel called Presumption, a Pride and Prejudice continuation starring Georgiana Darcy. Ick! This book is bad, very bad. Talk about inconsistent! The eleven chapters that Austen wrote of Sandition (no one is sure if this was the intended title for the novel) center on Charlotte Heywood and her impressions about the town of Sandition during her stay at the Parkers' estate. There we meet the sort of colorful characters that have become Austen's signature style and their attempts to turn Sandition into a touristy place that would rival Brighton and others. Austen introduced a few couples and some romantic possibilities between Charlotte and Sidney in narrative and dialogue that are witty, insightful and entertaining. Then enters Barrett's takeover of the storyline and new characters and situations are introduced that, to be frank, have nothing to do with what Austen had in mind.This \\"completion\\" of Jane Austen's unfinished effort is a disgrace. The characters' actions are so incongruous to what Austen created in those short eleven chapters that it is offensive to even presume to let the reader think that these alterations belong in a Jane Austen classic or that they are in any way consistent to the aforementioned work. Charlotte, Lady Denham, Thomas Parker, Sidney Parker, Clara Brereton and Sir Edward Denham show no resemblance to Austen's characterization. There was a complete overhaul once Barrett takes over. Thomas Parker is the worst alteration here, in my opinion. I couldn't believe the character assassination! The storylines aren't any better. The whole thing about the gambling and bootlegging is ridiculous! I have no idea what Austen had intended for the rest of this novel, but I'm sure that she would have never written something so preposterous. The writing style is rather strange. Everything seems to be fragmented and we are only shown bits and pieces of the subplots here and there. It is all very bizarre. Charlotte is so underdeveloped once Barrett takes over the writing that I'm none the wiser about her by the time the novel ends. Ugh! I'd never read a more frustrating attempt at completing an unfinished effort by a beloved author. I had based my decision to read this on Barrett's Presumption (pun intended). The aforementioned novel wasn't great, but I thought it was a fair continuation of Pride and Prejudice. This, however, is just awful. I have nothing against the author, but she shouldn't have touched this one. I have purchased Barrett's The Third Sister (continuation of Sense and Sensibility) and might as well give it a whirl. I only hope that it'll be better than this one. As for reading any more completions of Sandition, I think I'll give the one written by \\"Another Lady\\" a whirl. For I have heard and read great things about that one."},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"This was a dull read that I had to force myself to finish.

My eight year old cousin could write a better continuation of this book. The diction and use of words in the novel make confusing and difficult to read. I was more than half way through the book and could hardly continue. The plot of the story stopped where Jane Austen had stopped. Julia Barrett dwelled too long on the thoughts of other characters and avoided the main character. The writer would not get on with the story. I suggest the novel Sandition. It is far more superior than this book."},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"I love all of JA's work, and have also read many sequels/continuations with varying degrees of enjoyment. But this is by far the worst. It has nothing of JA's style, wit, irony, insight into human nature, etc., etc., etc. The people who gave this 'work' good reviews must only have read the fragment actually written by JA or must be shills for the publisher. For more detailed comments, I recommend reading any of the many reviews which gave 1 star, which I assume they did because they did not know one could give zero, or the amazon web site won't allow it; if you find this review listed with the generous rating of 1 star, then you will it is the latter."},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"When I saw &quot;Charlotte&quot; on the shelf, I was intrigued that there might be one more manuscript that I hadn't heard of. It turns out to be a very readable retread of the &quot;Sanditon&quot; text that has been published in other forms.The author does a good job in recreating some of Austen's signature style, but it seems that the skeleton plot she received did not help her to adequately fill the 240 pages. Some chapters were full of the wit, satire and excellent characterizations typical of an Austen book--others just jumped quickly to cover plot points, and seemed slapdash.I would be curious to go back to other versions of &quot;Sanditon&quot; to see if they were more successful. As I said, this was a diverting text, I read through it in only 3 sittings--but it didn't have the depth of a &quot;Persuasion&quot;, or the excellent characterizations of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, or the conflicts and satisfying conclusions of any of her books."},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"After PRESUMPTION and THE THIRD SISTER, I had high expectations for Julia Barrett's latest work, and she has surprised and delighted me once again.I always wondered what might have come next from Jane Austen. Here I was astonished to see her turning her sharp eye to a seaside health colony as it struggled for success in her 19th Century England.And Charlotte is a heroine who is much more mature than even her Anne Elliot in PERSUASION or Elizabeth Bennet of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. She is savvy! I loved the way she could spot the literary nonsense that Sir Edward Denham delivers, the snobbery of his sister, Esther and the pretentious airs of a Lady Denham--to say nothing of the Misses Parker with their hysterical illnesses and their fervor for 'good works'.It's a sardonic sketch of a Sussex health spa that Austen laid out for Barrett, and she wittily and wisely sees where it all must end!Reading Charlotte felt like being back reading Austen herself.And don't forget the romance. Charlotte and her Sidney Parker's adventures are worthy of all Jane Austen's earlier pairings. I loved it!Siohhan Terry"},{"Title":"Jane Austen's Charlotte","review":"Here's a true realization for that tantalizing opening of Jane Austen's last novel! Critics have always agreed that SANDITON would have led her into new territory. Not only would it have taken her out of her bit of countryside into a bigger geography, but invited her to venture further into the realities of her Regency world. The Sussex coast bring her into the mania and speculation of the new health faddism and more.Julia Barrett has taken Austen's themes up boldly, and carries them to the conclusions she had in mind. And, Barrett's done it with bravura, wit and style. Better still, all this serves as a background to what always concerns Austen: that age-old game lovers play."},{"Title":"The Lost Girl (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of D. H.

Truly compelling in it's intricate details of a young woman trying to find herself. Literally. She goes on the 'universal' self journey and discovers that she was lost and finally finds her identity and sensuality in the man she loves. D.H. Lawrence has a wonderful way of not wrapping up the ending in a nice,neat little package. As always, Lawrence is the ultimate man of mystery, sensual needs and desires. A &quot;must read&quot; for those who love to read Lawrence and for those who never have!"},{"Title":"The Lost Girl (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of D. H.

Meaning, floucing from one man to another, flirting, playing, getting engaged then dashing away for fun. And just like JEANNIE GERHARDT, this old man gets herself in trouble.But the most fascinating part of this book is it's glimps into her background. How she was brought up in a wealthy and rich household, only to try out different occupations against her father's wishes, then ends up as a lower classed female in life. Very tragic."},{"Title":"The Lost Girl (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of D. H. Lawrence)","review":"This book was given to me on the last day of High School in 1972 by a girl friend. I've kept this book ever since and it ranks up there with my all time favorite books even though I agree with one other reviewer that this is not the best example of Lawrence's work. However, with that said, this book also has a heart and tenderness that really meant something to me. I'm amazed no one has ever written a screenplay of this work since it's worth it. It was the only book Lawrence ever won a prize for, which says something about it. Take a chance and read it."},{"Title":"The Lost Girl (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of D. H. Lawrence)","review":"I really loved reading this book (on my Nook) with Norah Jones playing in the background. It's a really tragic and romantic love story without being too...gushy. I admit that the ending was abrupt, a bit jarring. But, by the end of the story you will (probably) be happy anyway.My only complaint was that Alvina sometimes behaves sporadically, and Cicchio is unpredictable. I found that Simone de Beauvoir explained D.H. Lawrence's style well in \\"The Second Sex.\\" It would be helpful to read that first to understand Lawrence and why his characters (particularly Alvina) behaves the way she does."},{"Title":"The Lost Girl (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of D. H. Lawrence)","review":"After plowing through a couple of his novels, I think it's fair to say that I am not a fan of D.H. Lawrence. In some sense, I see his appeal. Certainly, it is easy to see how his frankness about things sexual--not just in physical descriptions but in the emotional and intellectual impact of sexual relations--made him controversial during his time. And, in fact, his mourning over the things lost to industrial advancement and the Great War still resonates. On the other hand, his characters too often do not do justice to his themes. Lady Chatterley and Mellors are brilliant characters when they speak like humans and not mouthpieces for Lawrence's philosophy.On the other hand, Alvina Houghton, the title character of this novel, is too much of a cipher for her to be useful as a protagonist. Alvina is \\"lost\\" throughout the novel. First, as the forgotten daughter of a foolish father. Second, as a young woman headed to \\"old maid-hood\\" through her twenties and into her thirties. Finally, as a new, pregnant wife in her thirties left in a small Italian town as her Italian husband goes off to fight in the war.The problem is, the motivations for her choices are next to impossible to understand. She fears being an old maid but rejects suitors for reasons that are not clear. After the death of her father, she runs away with a traveling theatre troupe because she's attracted to the Italian actor. She gives herself to him but then runs away to a safe job as a nurse where she becomes engaged to a doctor who worships her in his way. Then, she runs away again with the Italian. It is all plot and no character substance.This is one of Lawrence's early novels and in some ways is more readable than his masterpiece, Lady Chatterley's Lover. The story charges along easily without the thematic depth of Chatterley. It's easy enough to get through. On the other hand, this is a classic example of a novel that would be out-of-print if the author were not famous for other things."},{"Title":"The Lost Girl (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of D. H. Lawrence)","review":"I found that the first half of the book enjoyable, but the second half not so. From the moment that she meets with the 'Red Indian' troupe the story descends into the unbelievable."},{"Title":"The Lost Girl (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of D. H. Lawrence)","review":"In a very famous context, D. H. Lawrence is himself famous for using a word beginning with \`f', a word that is infamous rather than famous. Mentioning this word and then repeating it got the author into some serious trouble that was not resolved until decades after his death. In this book, The Lost Girl, Lawrence is clearly preoccupied with the word and the novel is very much focused on it and its associated act. Its anticipation, achievement, consequences and perceived implications seem to be the very stuff of the heroine's life, but in this book the word never actually appears. So, like Lawrence, let's use a euphemism, but let's also be more direct than the writer. Let's use \`fabrication', an activity that is central to the work of any author.The Lost Girl is Alvina Houghton. The surname is pronounced with an \`f' sound in the middle, not an \`o', so its first syllable rhymes with \`fluff', not \`now'. She is the daughter of James, a shopkeeper in a small Derbyshire town called Woodhouse, in the north English midlands. James has a shop selling Manchester goods, the mass produced textiles of the late nineteenth century. He is not the best businessman, however, and his activities shrink over time. His daughter, Alvina - that's with a \`y' sound in the middle, not an \`e' - is rather plain-looking and apparently not too interesting either. She thinks quite a lot about fabrication from quite an early age, but she is a determined spectator when it comes to relationships. Her counsel, especially after her mother dies, is from older women, some of them determined spinsters.After some prevarication, Alvina eventually trains as a midwife. The skill offers her a chance of independence, but she chooses to revert to her preferred state of familial dependence. After all, Alvina will probably inherit her father's business. Thus she continues her arm's length relation with life.There is a short affair with a local man, a rather goofy figure who goes on to Oxford University and probably lives long enough to make a packet. But clearly the safe option is not for Alvina, who equally seems utterly afraid of risk in any form. She clearly cannot bring herself to the fabrication she privately craves and so the affair, surely destined for marriage in the eyes of the locals, comes to nought.Women close to The Lost Girl die. Others remain like perched birds watching over events. And, when James decides to leave the shop and sell off the little coal mine he also owns there is much consternation. There is even more to chirp about when he announces he is going into the entertainment business by opening up a little music hall, especially when Alvina declares that she will play the piano. Until this point, she had not mentioned being a musician. It is worthwhile remembering that we are in age when playing the instrument was almost part of any single woman's trousseau.And so the music hall presents its act, a motley crew of Red Indian impersonators, including a German called Max and an Italian called Cicio. Initially, the show packs them in, but the passing of time sees interest start to dwindle. But suddenly new opportunities arise for Alvina to think of fabrication, and fabrication with foreigners involved to boot!And so the story of Lawrence's The Lost Girl eventually fabricates its way from Derbyshire, and we leave Alvina in what looks like a new - though very old fashioned - life in changed circumstances. She seems now completely enslaved in her chosen womanly role, but we are at the start of the First World War and surely the role of women in society is about to change for ever.The Lost Girl deals with many of Lawrence's recurring themes, but its fabrication is often rather clumsy and its style often less than comfortable. It is, however, worth seeing through, if only to realise just how much both Lawrence and his fabricated characters - especially the women - are still locked in a soon to be changed mind-set about gender roles and social class."},{"Title":"The Lost Girl (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of D. H. Lawrence)","review":"I enjoyed this novel by David Henry Lawrence but when you consider where it ends and the characters it ends up focussing on, you realise that you have been taken on a huge journey.

Then a traveling stage production with a cavalry trained Italian horseman, and romance to follow. Definitely worthy of a Merchant Ivory or BBC Period drama production. I'm surprised this novel hasn't had any adaptation of film or TV movie production. Ciccio, the quiet Italian suitor is far more appealing and interesting than the male characters in \\"Women in Love\\".And the ending wasn't as bleak as \\"Women in Love\\"."},{"Title":"The Lost Girl (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of D.

The stories are entertaining and do a good job of holding one's attention, plus the author attempts (with varied success) to weave in actual science here and there. I say the books are good for young boys because the protagonist is of course Tom Swift, and the format the adventure-story favored by many young boys, but the character Anita does offer a strong (but almost tomboyish) female role as well.In the third story of the series, Tom must protect an alien space probe recovered from Io, one of Jupiter's moons, from theft while seeking to communicate with the artificial intelligence within. The story sets up the later works in the series as the probe helps Tom develop a hyperdrive and thus launch space exploration well beyond the moons of Jupiter."},{"Title":"The Alien Probe (The Tom Swift Series #3)","review":"This book is a continuation of the first two in the series, \\"The City in the Stars\\" and \\"Terror On the Moons of Jupiter.\\" In \\"Terror\\" Tom and his friends Anita Thorwald and Benjamin Walking Eagle and the intelligent robot Aristotle encountered an interstellar probe from the race called the Skree. The probe is called Aracta and it brings news of the existence of a drive mechanism which makes travel between the stars possible and a request for help in the Skree's battle with another race called the Chutans.In this story, Aracta is stolen by the villain of the previous story and flown to the asteroid belt, where the evil David Luna takes control. Luna is a rich, powerful and ruthless tycoon who is the Swift Company's main rival. With the help of the quick-thinking Aristotle, Tom and his group are able to escape with Aracta. The story closes with a discussion of the structure of the star drive and the possibilities for aiding the Skree against the Chutans.I found this book to be better than the first two; Tom is once more the capable inventor, which is the whole point of the series. Another improvement was that Tom's father only has an incidental role at the beginning; in the first two books he was too much of an imposing father figure, which tended to diminish Tom."},{"Title":"Eyewitness Travel Phrase Book: Danish (Eyewitness)","review":"This is a great little book!

Anderson was an extremely sophisticated writer who won 14 major awards, including multiple Hugos and Nebulas, for his fantasy and science fiction. He was probably best known for several multi-volume \\"future history\\" series that combined space opera with themes drawn from politics, warfare and commerce. Humor also played a major role in many of his works, especially in his very popular Dominic Flandry series.War of the Wingmen is an early novel in the Polesotechnic League series, which also included Trader to the Stars, The Trouble Twisters, Satan's World and Mirkheim, among others. The main connecting element is the character Nicholas Van Rijn: a fat, garrulous and curmudgeonly entrepreneur who runs a major interstellar trading company, and manages to get in and solve complex problems on numerous far flung worlds. In Wingmen he finds himself marooned in the middle of an ocean on a world called Diamedes, with the beautiful and sophisticated companion Lady Sandra Tamarin, and the young, earnest and impressionable Eric Wace, Van Rijn's agent on this planet. Unfortunately, they crash-landed into the middle of a war between two \\"races\\" of winged feline warriors, the Drak'ho and the Lannach, and are captured by one of them. The only human outpost on Diamedes is thousands of miles away, the natives have no motorized means of transport, and all local foods are fatally toxic to humans. The crux of the matter: how do they get to the outpost without getting killed in the war.Anderson carefully draws in the background, and we soon understand the geography, history, ecology, economics and culture of both warring sides, while getting to like and identify with the leading characters on both sides. The war began because an ecological event forced the sea-faring, fish-catching Drak'ho to follow migrating fish to the waters just off the coast where the Lannach lived. Cultural and religious differences compounded the suspicion between the Drak'ho and Lannach, and the war began immediately. The problem for Van Rijn: how to play one group against the other, using all of his diplomatic, oratorial, and scholarly skills, to bring an end to the war, get one or both the combattants to help them, and thereby save the lives of the humans, who were in immanent danger of starvation.There is plenty of action, lots of ingenuity, and much humor in the prosecution of the war and unfolding of Van Rijn's machinations. Taking a cue from The Great Gatsby, Anderson lets us see Van Rijn not only with our own eyes, but also from the viewpoint of his Nick Carroway, young Eric Wace. This adds an extra literary dimension to the novel, and is very rewarding.In sum, War of the Wingmen, in spite of it's title, is a sophisticated, exciting and enjoyable romp on a distant world, and as much worth reading today as it was in 1958."},{"Title":"War of the Wing-Men (Vintage Ace SF, G-634)","review":"When I read this book I was only twenty years old. In general, I think that the plot line and characterizations aren't so good, but the story has a certain charm and style that resemble some old sci-fi classics of the 30's, like Flash Gordon and The Red Purple Monster. That is the most positive point of the book; but Anderson did other better works, like, for example, Tau Zero and Unlimited Orbit."},{"Title":"One Hungry Monster : A Counting Book in Rhyme Board Book","review":"This is a good book for a child with little patience when it comes to reading.

The fortitude and sensitivity of this no nonsense man. The closeness of his immediate and extended family is wonderful to read about and the love and respect given to each and every member of the family is lovely.

The clay in the creek would occupy the young ones for days on end and the walk to school was filled with such interesting fresh discoveries every day. Even as children they could deal with snakes and read the elements by observing nature and the animals.

This story is set just over the next hill from my friend's home. It is a short read, taking perhaps an evening or two, depending on one's distractions. It quickly became, however, one of the most inspiring books I've ever read.There is a depth to humanity that we like to think exists but rarely have so clear an example as humbly laid out in this book. It consists of two parts; first, Bernard O'Reilly's 1937 experience in finding the wreck (and two survivors) of a small airliner after ten days of fruitless searches by government resources. The second part of the book (written in late 1940), moves back in time to tell the tale of his family's history first in New South Wales at the turn of the century, followed by their eventual move to become the first settlers on an enclave of land that, three months later, was closed to further settlement and became Lamington National Park in Queensland.This book is both remarkable and an incredibly inspiring look at life in Australia from 1900-1940. Moreover, it's not just about Australia or any nationality but about the fortitude of pioneering families in any landscape, whether it's in America in the 1800's, Australia in the 1900's or anyplace human kind deems worthy of building a life from nothing but wilderness.

This second edition (2000) contains a number of extensions w.r.t. the first edition (1985) and some sections have been rewritten.

Young takes the reader to eleven Pacific sites where war is about to change everything. He puts us on doomed Wake Island where Major Devereaux is ordering his Marine bugler to sound &quot;Call to Arms&quot; as an invasion force looms offshore and bombs devestate. We are with more marines in North China, embassy guards, who must surrender or die on the spot. The bugler sounds &quot;Retreat&quot; for one last time and then breaks his bugle across his knee and hurls it away. We are aboard the PanAm flying boat &quot;China Clipper&quot; as it desperately tries to flee Wake Island already under attack. We are on indefensible Guam when an ill-equipped handful of American Marines, mindful that no U.S. Marine unit has ever gone down without a fight, march off to make a stand agasinst an invasion force of 5000. The Marines are armed with 1903 Springfield rifles, two .30 caliber machine guns, and a few.45 sidearms. They are assisted by Insular Guards, native Chamorros who also carry ought three Springfields but theirs are stamped &quot;&quot;Do not shoot. For training purposes only.&quot; We are at Clark Field in the Phillipines where B-17s are caught on the ground by aerial raiders. We are abandoning the ill-fated 2100 ton lumber schooner &quot;Cynthia Olsen&quot; torpedoed and sinking off Hawaii, the first U.S. merchantman to be sunk in World War Two but not the last. Reading this book will remind you how lucky we are there can never be another be another Pearl Harbor. Oh, sure! (review taken from my review in&quot;Vapor Trails&quot;, news letter of the Mass. Chapter of the 8th Air Force Historical Society of which I am editor and publisher.)"},{"Title":"First 24 Hours of War in the Pacific","review":"Most of us associate the beginning of World War II with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Actually, Pearl Harbor was only one of numerous attacks carried out by the Japanese that day. Their true objectives were the mines of Malaya and the oil fields of Borneo--Pearl Harbor was a side-show which was necessary to keep the United States from interfering.In this book Donald J. Young vividly describes the other events of December 7, 1941, giving minute by minute details seldom found elsewhere. He describes the inept responses of our (U.S. and British) military forces to attacks which should not have come as any surprise, but did. In the last chapter, he fills us in on the reaction in Washington, where the Japanese attacks may actually have solved a problem for President Roosevelt.For the serious WW II historian this is a valuable book. For the casual reader this is an interesting and entertaining book, particularly if you are already aware of some of the controversy surrounding the events of the day."},{"Title":"A Vision of Paradise: Robertson Ward and the Mill Reef Club","review":"This book is very personal--my late mother- and father-in-law were two of the founding members of the Mill Reef Club (they are both buried on the island in St. Philip's Parish) and it's wonderful to study the old photos and see the genesis of one of the most beautiful places anywhere. Robertson (Happy) Ward created something unique and lovely in the club itself and in the houses--the open uncluttered living spaces, the soothing pastel colors and, always, the inviting views of the beach, the bougainvillea, the expanse of impossibly unique blue of Caribbean water. If there is a paradise, for me always it will be the remembered aspects of the club; the mornings under the huge thatched umbrella on the beach when everyone gathered to visit--periodically getting up to walk into the shallows to cool off. In the struts supporting that umbrella were stored flippers, snorkeling gear, forgotten sunglasses, suntan lotion, odds and ends. Residents and guests, visitors invariably found their way to the umbrella--an ever-elastic gathering that was the focal point of the farthest end of the beach from the club. Everyone made the long walk along the sand, back and forth to the club, admiring the houses fronting the water--those pastel creations that looked almost edible. It was an intimation of what heaven might be like. And this book offers portraits of the original members, insight into Ward's creative gifts, and a singular view of another time in another place."},{"Title":"A Vision of Paradise: Robertson Ward and the Mill Reef Club","review":"I really enjoyed this book by Elizabeth Ballantine.

I stood by my policy of keeping an open mind no matter how extreme it may appear to be. I have been doing a lot of reading on the different ET's who have been working with us. Just finished reading another book on the Arcturians. When I started to read this one to see how their stories compared, it took me completely by surprise. The other book pales in comparison with this one. It concurs with the material in that book, but has a lot more detail, and appears to be a lot more accurate. This book had such a strong impact on me that I could only handle small amounts at a time. There is a lot packed between the lines. The energies that pour out of it are very evident. This book will hold your attention all the way. You will realize that you are one of the most fortunate beings in this World to have the good fortune of reading this book. It will change your life. I especially enjoyed the detailed tour of their Spacecraft, and how they transmute the different energies. The Arcturians are one of the most advanced and benevolent group of beings watching and gently guiding us into the 5th dimension. It also provides you with some very powerful techniques for clearing your mind and developing your psychic abilities. You will appreciate the power, the protection and the gifts presented to you by the Arcturians. I would love to share this new discovery with others who may be interested in the Arcturians. Please feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions. Thanks !bobmck@thegateway,.net"},{"Title":"We The Arcturians: A True Experience","review":"A personal contact/encounter experience with 2 beings calling themselves &quot;Masters of Light&quot; led me to seek out who they were, and they are the Arcturians, Masters of Light, Energy and Aura. I had NO idea this book was published so long ago, and many, many things written about them, coming from them, I can assure you, are true. I found myself, still, totally amazed to meet them, and am awed by the gentle, loving God-like presence and energy they emminate. The drawing in the book which shows their face, is a close resemblence, but misses the importance of the nose structure that radiates and glows while they are communicate. That is their facial focal point. I 100% believe in the descriptives of the rooms on their spacecraft. I am also very greatful for discovering this book, so I could learn more about who they are, and what their purpose is in aiding the planet, along with co-operation from the Galactic Federation, and the Brotherhood who is doing the work of Jesus in guiding the planet towards her ascension. You get a real feel for their loving energy and consistant message of helping humanity. I have found no other books that bring forth this feeling, than this wonderful book."},{"Title":"We The Arcturians: A True Experience","review":"From page one I could not put this book down.

As they say, the more I learn, the less I know...and I love it that way. What this book did was to point my way on the journey, and validate the steps I have taken so far.Not recommended for general reading.

The uplifting information raised my consciousness and hopes for the future."},{"Title":"We The Arcturians: A True Experience","review":"We the Arcturians is a must read. There are many triggers for remembrance. The book has helped me to understand many past experiences and has made my spiritual journey much easier. The information provided regarding higher vibrations and how we are all in control of everything that happens to us is conformation that; yes we are spiritual Beings having a human experience."},{"Title":"We The Arcturians: A True Experience","review":"This is a meaty book and a credit to Dr. Milanovich to have asked the kinds of penetrating questions in her contactee channeling twenty years ago that still hold the interest of readers today. This is not one of those wimpy ascended master books that talks in circles causing you to fall asleep and ask later \\"Did I learn even one thing from this book?\\"Dr. Milanovich started automatic writing very unexpectedly in 1985 and after a couple of years getting her bearings: \\"In the fall of 1987, I sat at my computer one evening and decided to ask more questions of my unseen friends. I stated the first question and requested that \`the Being most qualified, and only one who was in the Light' come through. (By now, I had learned a lot about protecting myself.) To my amazement, the transmission that came through stated that those communicating were Beings from Arcturus, who were riding on a Starship that was situated to the southeast of Albuquerque.\\" She initially dismissed this as some kind of joke, later with the coaxing of a friend she resumed contact several months later and this lead to the material for the book.There are ten chapters titled: The First Encounters, The Visitors, The Revelations of The Elders, Language Systems on Arcturus, Educational Systems on Arcturus, The Land They Left Behind, Starship General Divisions, The Training Program, The Mission, and The Future. Each holds a number of surprises that breaks stereotypes and supplies insights of value both to general readers and to UFO investigators. These are not the wispy hello, goodbye chapters you see in some books, they are typically 20 pages or more with a succinct intro by Milanovich--The rest of the chapter is usually in a Q&A; style with substantial answers. Starship General Divisions is the longest chapter, an 80-page tour of their mothership. The speakers are humble and respectful.As you make your way through the book, you are gradually introduced to the Arcturian lifestyle, based on a set of values diametrically opposed to the one we live on Earth. The Arcturian code prevents them from assisting us unless we ask first so as to honor our free will. They live a fifth-dimensional existence rather than the third- dimensional sort we live here on earth and the differences are spelled out in a level of detail you are unlikely to find elsewhere in chapter 2--The Visitors. They live by high spiritual principles not by the materialistic principles of bribery, corruption and powermongering so common on Earth today.The most important chapter in my view is chapter 9--The Mission in which they spell out why they are here in such numbers at this time in the Earth's history. Each of the Beings who sent messages had something to say about the mission, each from a little different point of view. The Beings used the term New Age in the book instead of the more current term New Earth. One of them said:\\"We have been called to Earth at this time for a purpose much greater than to observe our sisters and brothers falter and stumble as they make their way into this new Golden Age. We have been called to assist, because we are already existing in the dimension that you are approaching. Therefore, we have a greater responsibility to all of humankind than to sit back and pass judgment, observe transitional pain without assisting, and allow the masses to make mistakes as they venture into the unknown.We are here to help make this transition as easy as possible, and to assist all those who wish to come through this portal of time.\\"Another:\\"We are aware that many souls on Earth will not be ready for this new information. We are also aware that there is never, in the course of Earth events, a good time to bring in new information. Earthlings have a tendency to resist change and the new, and do not wish to progress into unknown realities and the beauty of other dimensions.\\"Another:\\"We would like for this document to be read as the comparison of two different worlds. We would be honored if some of the readers did find rejoicing in their hearts, in discovering the systems that we have designed.\\"Asked what can people of Earth do, diet changes were suggested:\\"The foods to avoid are sugars, bleached flours, caffeine and substances that dramatically alter the mind spectrum. Foods, such as red meats, are of the lowest vibration that the planet has produced.\\" Meditation was also suggested.These are very short highlights from a 60-page chapter.Curiously enough this book is not a lone voice predicting a dramatic vibrational frequency shift and corresponding lifestyle change of earthlings that so choose. Many other such New Earth philosophy authors started popping out of the woodwork at about the same time, 1987, the year of the harmonic convergence. Each has a message and a style suited to its own audience, the basics are there for all to see. No rigid timeframe is given."},{"Title":"We The Arcturians: A True Experience","review":"This book started off interestingly enough, but it lost me towards the end. It truly did become a push for Christianity, urging the reader to find Christ through Christianity before it's too late. I have no problem with Christianity, but genuine New Age material generally does not push organized religion or encourage one to follow a deity- OR induce fear what-so-ever. I have no doubt the Acrturians exist, and even agree that they are helping mankind on many levels. However, the Arcturians in this material urge the reader to give their power away to a Christ and a God way up there in the sky, when really what we should all be doing is looking for the god within ourselves.There is quite a bit of doom and gloom in this material and I gained little new knowledge from it. The Arcturians in this book urge the truth seeker to raise their vibration and start working towards a 5th dimensional existence (or else be left behind in 3rd dimension) yet they offer no tools to get there- other than meditate and stop eating red meat, white flour and sugar. I did not discern that this material was of the highest vibration. If you truly want your socks blown off, read the Kryon books. Kryon offers many tools for advancement and the love just bursts off of the pages. You will find truth and enlightenment on every page, and not a single guilt or fear induced message exists in the Kryon materials. Kryon empowers the truth seeker and the gifts will come rolling in. Start with Book One- you won't regret it. Peace and Love."},{"Title":"We The Arcturians: A True Experience","review":"You have to read this book with an open mind and heart realizing that humanity tends to 'fight against' things that are perceived as scary. There are a lot of concepts in this book that may create fear in some. You have to feel what is being said through the heart center. Your intuitive sense knows the truth (whether the mind knows it or not). This book answered so many questions for me..questions I had had about feeling like I didn't belong, where I come from, etc. The truth of the matter is that the earth is changing in frequency and we need to choose to ascend with it, or to stay behind..this book talks about that too. Even 10+ years later the information is very relevant. Highly recommended for those who are just awakening or anyone already on the spiritual path."},{"Title":"We The Arcturians: A True Experience","review":"Great book for those who want to become more aware of other dimensions and ways of being.

The bottom line is that it's already there, waiting for us to pick up and take.This book truly changed the way I look at the concept of alien intelligence.

Even my acupuncturist thought it was whack. I spent weeks reading and re-reading this book, waking up at night, drinking Quick, taping pages to my walls. I didn't get it--if this was the message, why wasn't I getting it? Then I realized: I didn't WANT to get it! And then I got it! Suddenly the transmissions came through loud and clear. I felt every strand of hair stand on end. A vision appeared. It was Jesus, but he looked strange. He was wearing a t-shirt and cut off jean shorts, and he had a beer cooler in hand. I asked him if he was Jesus. He said yes and he told me he wanted to give me something. He said he needed me to store something, to protect something. He put the beer cooler in my fridge and looked at me over his shoulder, then he kind of gave me this wink, like I was in on this HUGE thing with him. I didn't know what to say. we hugged for a while. He said he had to go back, that he was just stopping by for five minutes and that his energy in material form would disrupt the planet's magentic something, I forget. I didn't want him to go. We were best friends. He opened my window and flew away in the air conditioning updraft, and I swear that as he was going, he looked back and said, Spread the message, love and peace to all.

It is the transcript of a dialogue between a group of three women on Earth and a group of beings, mostly Arcturians (meaning from the star Arcturus), who are in a starship circling above Earth, here to help us reach higher consciousness. By comparing their lives to ours, the Arcturians teach us what we need to know to complete our mission here on Earth. Read this book with your heart open and let your heart listen for Truth even if your head is still thinking things like \\"This could be all made up.\\"By the way, it is very interesting to read this book knowing that it was originally written in the 1980s. We've opened and evolved so much in the time that has passed, and yet there wasn't much in the book that I felt like I had already conquered.One last note: Although the book never mentions a date, this book is very much tied into physical and spiritual changes happening in connection with 2012."},{"Title":"We The Arcturians: A True Experience","review":"I read this book several years ago when I was just beginning to explore metaphysics.

These beings apparently claim that they are from the fifth dimension of the heaven to help ascension process of the Earth, and yet as you read what they can tell us, there is scarcely anything to be told of decent siginficant spiritual message. The channels, the authors of this book, do not know how to extract more valuable information from their sources either, as they have no better idea of what to ask in the first place (the authors are interested in the costumes they wear and the spaceship they ride than anything else). Rather, it is read like The Travels of Marco Polo for the 13th century Europeans. Definitely a tale of a new world, and it intrigues much of your curiosity, but it seldom quenches the thirst of the soul. There are excellent channeled messages out there if you seek, and some truly magnificent contactee transcripts that open your eyes to the reality of this world and how to position yourself through this age of awakening. This Arcturian book, in contrast, simply works as another pitch of New Age pseudo-spirituality of now humdrum \\"love and light\\" and promotion of their coming messiah. Wake up people, not all new things are food for soul. Further, we have info as well disinfo in this world.

The essays are very well written and integrated, and are accessible to upper high school and college-level readers.Damon's position is that character education has been neglected because of &quot;false oppositions&quot; (either-or propositions), such as &quot;individual vs. the community,&quot; &quot;secular vs. the religious,&quot; and so on. These oppositions are false because each &quot;side&quot; of the argument stems from adult perspectives, not the ideas and imaginations of developing children. Additionally, advocates for each &quot;side&quot; fail to use the logic of &quot;both-and&quot; propositions.As Damon says, &quot;I have never heard of a youngster being harmed by witnessing another person's expression of spirituality, even when the form of spirituality is highly unfamiliar to the child. On the contrary, young persons are usually moved and fascinated...&quot; (p. xiii-xiv). This is an example of how he wishes to understand the development of children and adolescents in areas of moral and character development.The essays concern (1) how to transmit moral values when the transcendant American value is the &quot;autonomous self;&quot; (2) how character education is based on valid, scientific developmental psychology; (3) how to educate youngsters by &quot;moral exemplarity&quot; and by building a democratic community; and (4) how most Americans really are very united on the values that underpin character education.I hope you enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Bringing in a New Era in Character Education (HOOVER INST PRESS PUBLICATION)","review":"An excellent series of authored chapters, this book get to the heart of character education, the children and their potential to improve the world, while addressing the adult ideologies projected onto the topic as dichotomous arguments for and against."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"I found this book several years ago when my two kids, a boy aged 3 and a girl aged 2 were not talking. If I had listened to the 'experts' my children probably would have been tested to exhaustion, instead I used my BRAIN and evaluated their total behavior. When my son was 1-1/2 we moved to a new house and since he was getting into all the cabinets in the kitchen, I bought some of those child-proof locks to keep him out. He stood there and watched me install the first lock, and as I began work on the second door, he proceeded to figure out how to open the first door. So much for that. He also figured out how to turn on the computer and click the keyboard and mouse in the right order to get it all started up when he was about 3 years old.My kids were verbal in the sense that they knew a few words at age three - they could say mama or dada or no - but nothing approaching a sentence. They stayed this way until age 4 - at which point they suddenly started using more words and within a month or two graduated on to sentences. Now they are 5 & 6, good readers, talk very well, and excellent math skills - 3rd grade + levels.I think if Sowell's Einstein Syndrome is real (and I believe it is) as a parent you need to not only look at the total behavior of the child - do they get their point across non-verbally, can they figure out how things work, do they manage day to day pretty well. I think you also have to look at yourself as a parent - my wife and I have IQ's near 4 SD above average, and after talking to my parents, they told how I myself as a baby never really talked till after age 4 myself. I also come from a family of engineers (mathemetician/programmer myself) and phenomenal musicians - so all the factors are there.IF I had believed completely in the infallibility of the system and let them 'evaluate' my kids, all it would have caused is a lot of trauma and grief, tears and second-guessing. Instead, I just loved them, encouraged them and made sure they had opportunties to do lots of non-verbal things they obviously loved to do - play computer games, legos etc. In the end, it all worked out pretty much perfectly.If on the other hand, you don't fit the pattern as a parent and your child is obviously struggling in non-verbal endeavors as much as the verbal ones, then by all means, go submit them to the efforts of the experts. But, just don't ONLY use fear as a guide - don't ONLY use conventional 'social expectations' as a guide. If you aren't a socially conventional conformist as a parent, why is it any surprise that your children don't fit all the conventional 'normal' child 'guidelines' either ?I am beyond happy at how smart well-adjusted and happy my kids now are. This book helped me as a parent confirm that what I thought was true, actually WAS true. If your kids are like mine, maybe it can help you too."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. It was well written, easy to read but contained a bit to much anecdotal evidence for me. I enjoy reading about the stories the parents of late talkers had but they got to be a bit to much. The question I always had was how objective are these folks? I know that when my kids were little both my wife and I thought they were geniuses, beautiful and the best kids in the world. I doubt that we could have been 100% objective in our assessments of them had they been children like those described in this book.The reason I purchased this book is that both my grandson's were and are presently late talkers. The first said a few words prior to his 3rd birthday and is now close to 5 and shows almost all the traits described in this book. Until just recently I didn't know as much as I should have about my son-in-law's side of the family. I knew they were educated people but just found out about the mathematicians amongst them. I play the guitar and piano and my brother is a math wiz English major who also played the guitar. Our little 3 year old grandson still doesn't talk but he doesn't show as many of the traits as his older brother and although I'm still not worried, my wife, son-in-law and daughter are worried a bit. He has been diagnosed with autism spectrum or PDD and is going for several types of therapy as did his older brother. My daughter says the doctor told her that it would be highly unlikely to have two sons with the same problems. I guess if these so called \\"experts\\" would put down their checklists and actually try to get to know the kids and the families they may actually learn something. I gave this book to my daughter to read - hopefully it will make her feel better about what is going on.I often tell my daughter that had all these \\"experts\\" been around when I was a kid my two brothers and I would have been labeled retarded based on how we acted. We all turned out OK!!! In my opinion, the world is full of too many experts.Anyway, this book does give me hope that our youngest grandson will turn out to be as normal as his grandfather - he will just do it in his own good time."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"I cannot rave enough about this book!

Where most books and professionals are doom and gloom about this subject, the author of this book is thoughtful, respectful and has the evidence to back up the Einstein Syndrome. I am so glad I stumbled upon this book, it changed everything about my outlook of my sons speech delay and gave me great hope for the future when I had none before. All parents must read this if their child has a speech delay."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"Fascinating subject! Basically the author explains that many brilliant children do not speak until later than the \\"norm\\". This book describes the Einstein Syndrome and what children are most likely to have it. He describes the three M's of the Syndrome (mathematics, music, memory) and gives several accounts of children with this anomaly. He very simply discusses the theory that the brains of these children are using so much energy in the analytical part that they don't channel it to the talking part. It's not real in depth as the author is not a scientist. He also allows too much of his personal feelings come through,in my opinion. This book is easy to understand but possibly disappointing if you want to know all the nuts and bolts of the working of the developing mind.The author warns that not all children who speak late are highly intelligent. There are many reasons from medial problems to social/emotional reasons that can cause a delay in speaking as well. In fact, the author says that only 5% of late talkers are that way because of the Einstein Syndrome. He recommends--almost begs--parents of children who are late in talking to get them evaluated by highly qualified people. He has a lot to say on who is and who is not qualified, by the way. If the child doesn't speak because of high intelligence, there is usually no need to fear the delay and parents should just relax and wait. But in other situations, early diagnosis and intervention are critical.The first half of the book says the same things over and over and gets a little boring. It reminds me of a college paper. The second half of the book kept my attention much better. The book is not too long--only 177 pages. So if you skim the first half and read the second half you can read through it very quickly."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"This books is so very helpful. The fact that it was written by someone who actually had a child who talked late makes it even better. Tremendous encouragement to me that my son is normal. Some kids are just different than the norm, and I've seen his language skills really beginning to develop rapidly now. Sometimes, all those \\"experts\\" aren't right and it's so good for parents to get \\"another opinion.\\" Mr. Sowell has written a great book for worried parents (who've been made worried by the experts who make money off of labeling children). Buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"This book offers interesting observations about a system that is increasingly quick (too quick) to diagnose children autism. While more is known about autism today, this use of the \\"autism spectrum\\" has obvious risks - Namely, if you make a spectrum wide enough, you can put anyone on it.Our three year old daughter, a late talker with speech difficulties, has been diagnosed with autism - yet she exhibits a number of atypical behaviors for an autistic child. She is affectionate, funny and makes pretty good eye contact. She doesn't obsess over things either.Several professionals have told us that she is smart - quick to solve difficult puzzles, good at following directions, and on target for motor skills.Two psychologists have expressed doubt about the autism diagnosis after spending a lot of time with her. We now doubt that this is autism as well.But as this book points out, when you are a hammer, everything looks like a nail. And that is what so many doctors, psychiatrists and other professionals are doing with the autism spectrum - They toss every kid on the spectrum. If your kid has autism, accept it. But be open to other possibilities - namely that your kid is a late talker. Its hard to know what to do - even with helpful books like this one."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"It made me feel a whole lot better that there are other parents out there experiencing the same problems and feelings that my husband and I are having. We are the parents of a bright three-year-old, who is speaking on a 1 1/2 year old level. He has a vocabulary of about thirty words right now, and he uses them correctly and in context. However, he is far behind his age group. My son and our families had many similarities to the children in Mr. Sowell's books, \\"Late-Talking Children\\" and \\"The Einstein Syndrome\\". However, I don't agree 100% with everything Mr. Sowell wrote, and I would never use one man's opinion as gospel. Use this book as advice to be listened to and judged by an informed mind and a parent's heart. Research, read, talk to professionals, but also listen to your gut where it concerns your child. Mr. Sowell makes a good argument for that.-----------------------------------------------------1/21/2013HISTORY: Our son was DX'd with PDD-NOS at age 3 1/2 at a private evaluation (highly recommend that parents get an independent evaluation - do not rely solely on a school's evaluation). He scored high on an IQ test during this evaluation, which the doctor told me was significant. At the time, we had just pulled our son from the preschool disabilities program at our local school district, which we felt was not providing him the program he needed. In the fall, he went back into a more appropriate setting for the next two years until he reached Kindergarten age. During this two year time period, our son was additionally diagnosed with ADHD, which we addressed with behavior modification, change to the \\"Autism\\" gluten free/casein free diet, and finally when those played out, tried drug therapy with success. He then entered mainstream preschool with a 1:1 aide to assist him in staying on task.UPDATE, 10 years later ~ My son is now 13 years old in 7th grade mainstream classes. He has an excellent vocabulary, although he speaks with somewhat of a hesitant speech pattern. He has an Autism diagnosis, with the most significant impact in his social skills. He has trouble making friends. However, we are working on this with therapists. The take away I had with Sowell's books was HOPE. That my son would get better, whether he did it at his own pace, or if we did it through the education system and doctors. Either way, my boy has been on Honor Roll and on the track team this year, has attended sleep away camp and is very bright."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"Many people need a book like this and need to understand that the children, usually boys, as described by Thomas Sowell exist, but I'm happy that the baton of the work is being passed to Steven Camarata. In the meantime though, Sowell has attained a very high status among some parents who speak highly of him and their children who fit the \\"Sowell profile\\". I don't think it needs to end there though.Sowell became aware that there are many boys who are intelligent, who speak late (and who come from technical families, but that came later), after he mentioned his own son in his conservative column. Parents began writing to him about their own children and asked his help in finding someone to further their understanding of their children's speech issues. He sought specialists and researchers interested in compiling the data but couldn't find anyone who wanted to do it. Happily, from the data as it currently stands, these children will likely have excellent prognoses.Unfortunately, I found Sowell to be judgemental of \\"semi-professionals\\" and of parents who have to utilise school district services for therapy for their children. Sowell never fully defines a \\"professional\\" nor does he suggest how those of us with balking insurance will get all the coverage we need. He is, rightly, dismissive of physicians who quickly diagnose children with Pervasive Developmental disorders or autism based on short screenings.I appreciated the section that discusses brain allocation- how the brain might work on one task at a time to the lying by of working on other tasks. I would like to see a more scientific, rigorous approach to this as it relates to speech development.He is correct in suggesting that some children respond poorly to speech therapy, but I don't believe that dismissing all therapists because of this is the right path. I know that my later speaking children both responded to some therapists and disliked others.I like to think I trust the range of normal development and my ability to understand my children, but if a parent is worried, this book might be good resource for them. Hopefully, better work will be coming out in the next few years."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"The book essentially describes our three and a half year boy. The first chapter is almost a biography of him. We have gone through some of the same frustrations that other parents have had (especially with an incompetent audiologist). The book confirmed what we always suspected that our boy is a very bright and very analytical child (very good with computers, etc.) that just happens to be a late talker. We will have him evaluated by a pediatricain specializing in a development clinic just in case but we are convinced that there is nothing wrong with him. This is a great book!"},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"I firmly recommend this book to anyone with a child who has a speech delay or has been diagnosed with autism (although the child is very social).

Sure, this book was entertaining; these kids are indeed fascinating. But after reading the Einstein Syndrome, it was clear that my boy is not one of the children Sowell is describing. Overall this book left me with more questions than answers on the subject of delayed speech.If you actually want to do something to help your child, and not just read about other kids who turned out to be super-intelligent engineers, buy \\"The Late Talker: What to Do If Your Child Isn't Talking Yet\\" by Marilyn C.

This is a book that gives parents real answers about how to help their speech-delayed children."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"I purchased this book because I am interested in the topic of language generally. I found Sowells book to be basically a collection of anecdotal information strung together without any real conclusions drawn from his \\"data.\\" The sample study was incredibly small, which might explain his hesitancy to cast any general conclusions. But ideally *some* analysis could have been done."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"I purchased the book because my grandson is 16 months old and doesn't talk. He does say \\"NO\\" alot. He is very bright being that he knows what you are asking him to do and he does it, but doesn't talk. It concerned me. I have spoken to may mother's who have children the same age, and many of them don't talk either. I don't think it is the norm. Maybe things have changed.

The first half of the book is interesting in that tid bits of actual research data is presented, but it takes a wrong turn towards the middle of the book. For example, This is an actual quote from the book \\" Some professionals, and especially semi-professionals like social workers and school personnel, have airs of \\"experise\\" and an arsenol of jargon and dogmas...\\" Sounds like the author is describing himself.The author also shys away from early intervention...

Yes, we all know of the many \\"Einstein\\" type children that didn't talk until after typical ages. But as an early intervention specialist that deals with parents on a daily basis, many who are not ready to deal with their child's diagnosis or accept that a delay is present, this is just allowing them to further refute the fact that their child may need intervention. What child has actually ever \\"suffered\\" from receiving speech/language therapy???? My own son had an articulation disorder (which was obvious) & during the evaluation, did not answer questions, therefore scored as a child with a severe language delay. I didn't believe this was the case as I was a special ed teacher, trained to determine expressive language delays & based on all the available data (Kindergarten teacher interview, standardized assessment score from K, the initial SLP that worked with him throughout K, psychologist who attempted to assess a VAD, etc... I knew he probably didn't have a language disorder.. To be sure however, I let him receive language therapy.....6 months after he was in the program, his test scores jumped to age equivalency. Did he suffer from this, NO, however he did benefit from learning to trust others to ANSWER questions in testing situations & not worry about being wrong."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"First of all, I am quite offended by this author. I am a licensed speech-language pathologist with 30 years of experience in the public school system. I am currently working as a special education coordinator in (heaven forbid) a public school system. I read about children and their issues/concerns/characteristics continuously. This book was recommended by a parent and I was very excited to read it. I was not prepared for the assault on speech-language pathologists and others in the public schools of America. I truly wish the author would do a more thorough investigation of our credentials and our job performances. We are not in the business of &quot;creating business&quot;. Believe me, we have plenty to keep us busy.

He loves puzzles, and surprises us with his ability to understand language, even though he's not really using it yet. He's currently approaching his second birthday, and has a few words; and uses sign language sometimes, so he's a bit different than the \\"worst\\" cases in these books (I say worst in quotes, which you will understand better if you read this book). He does not have any of the social problems exhibited by children with autism, so it just didn't seem right when some of the \\"experts\\" were tossing around this diagnosis as a possible answer for us.My son seems to have been misdiagnosed as needing speech therapy by one particularly misinformed speech therapist who worked for a profitable local treatment center (she didn't know some basic, basic stuff about early childhood development that I knew from reading a couple of books on the subject).We had him reevaluated by a state program and we were told \\"he is a bit of a late talker, but fine everywhere else\\". We were very impressed with this speech therapist - she knew her stuff.If you read this book, you will see that my son is pretty much the perfect example of the cross-section described in this book.One final note, and the author says this as well: do not take this book as the end-all / be-all of your searching for an answer as to why your child is a late talker. Please have them evaluated (I would recommend a state program - they have no reason to \\"under-evaluate\\"), but also read this book to recognize some of the shortfalls of such an evaluation. In the end, you must make the choice about whether your child needs therapy.This book finally gave me some peace-of-mind that my son will be fine. We will continue to have him evaluated, but we do so with a bit more knowledge and understanding that many kids like him wind up to be just fine.Children are so much fun to watch grow up, and this book restored some of the \\"fun\\" to my parenting that had been lost in worrying that there was something wrong."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"We went through the entire process of testing and speech therapy and our son did terrible. He wouldn't even try to stack three blocks for the evaluator and refused to even pick up the crayon to demonstrate his fine motor skills. We were told he was retarded, had brain damage from lack of oxygen at birth, would never learn to speak or that he had Pervasive Developmental Disorder. We were understandably devastated, what parent wouldn't be?I was at the end of my rope when I happened on this book and it changed my world. I finally had something that justified my lack of belief in the diagnoses of the \\"experts\\". Like the children in the book our son figured out the child locks in the kitchen at six months old, he loves legos and puzzles, his father is a System Administrator and plays the piano, our son is myopic too. It was eerie the similarities, kind of a Village of the Damned thing.The school district wanted to put him in a class with 'similarly' disabled children. We saw some of these kids; droolers, self stimmers in wheel chairs and autistic kids in helmets rocking in corners and I was horrified and scared, how did it come to this? My son did not belong with these forgotten kids and I was worried what would happen to him if he was put into a class with all of these sad, damaged children.But when we told the school we wouldn't put him in the special class, it was like turning down a Network Marketer, they kept calling, stopping by and trying to scare us into putting him in there, \\"he could lose his chance to progress,\\"\\"you are doing irreparable harm keeping him from school,\\" etc. Scary and intimidating.He is seven years old now and reads at a ten year old level, he can put together a seven hundred piece lego set alone and fixes things around the house with his father's tools.But we still have to fight against the prejudices of friends and family who think our son has Aspergers or PDD because of his narrow focus on projects (he will sometimes spend hours working on a lego project). They don't see his sociability and his love of reading, robots, dragons and painting.But, I do think you have to be as objective as possible as a parent. It is seductive to think that your late talking child will just 'grow out of it.' We found a good speech therapist and for the first time, at age three and a half were able to speak with our son. His speech still isn't as clear as children his age, something we are working on.The reality is that most late talking children do not go on to successful careers in information technology or engineering. Many have delays that affect them the rest of their lives and will need years of specialized therapy to compensate. The children described in The Einstein Syndrome are a narrow, specialized subset of late talking children. I agree with Dr. Sowell that getting tested is essential. There can be medical reasons for late talking, deafness for one.BUT if you have a child that seems different from the diagnoses that they have been given, I would suggest reading this book, you might be surprised, as I was, at how closely your child fits the pattern of Einstein Syndrome children."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"Our son was under the autistic umbrella. Even though he had many of the qualities, it did not seem to fit quite right. I found this book when he was four. He could play piano and build amazing structures but did not speak more then a few words. He fit the profile perfectly. We continued with speech and occupational therapy until he was six. He is now ten, has many good friends and does very well academically. He no longer has speech and language skills issues. He loves classical music (Tchaikovsky & Gershwin in particular) and thrives in math and science. He does well on tests and is an excellent speller because of his acute memory. He indulges in fact books, building Lego structures, plays baseball and wants to be an architect. He now has zero autistic qualities and no sensitivity issues. His teachers can not believe he was ever under the autistic umbrella. I agree that this book can be a potential danger for parents who are in denial, but the book warns against that danger in the first chapter. I currently work with autistic children who are in both preschool and elementary school. There is an obvious difference between the children in this study and the autistic children. It is the parents responsibility to be realistic. This book is a life saver for the parents that children really do fit this unique profile."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"This book was instrumental in helping my husband and I discover why our son wasn't talking (he finally spoke his first word at 3 1/2 years and he's speaking normally now at 4 1/2 with slight articulation issues). For all the reviewers that say this book is \\"potentially dangerous\\" the author is not saying this description fits ALL late talkers, just a certain subset. Our son was one of them. We made an appointment with the Dr. Camarata and he verified our son had an expressive language delay. Our pediatrician, local school speech therapist and two private speech therapists could not figure that out...it took this book and Dr. Camarata for us to finally get an answer.

So many of the things mentioned in this book fit him to a T."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"A FANTASTIC read... The \\"twist\\" is that it bases the core reason for late talking on heredity ~ specifically tying in close family members with analytically-thinking/based careers and abilities (engineers, scientists, mathematicians, pilots, musicians, etc.) I didn't know this when I purchased the book and wanted to share that specifically. We got a lot from the book because our daughter falls into that category (otherwise the book may not have been as useful to us). \\"The Einstein Syndrome\\" provides great insight on \\"why\\", what can be done in the meantime and on \\"early intervention\\".

I've had her evaluated by two separate pediatricians, had her hearing checked, and had her evaluated by a developmental specialist. She is \\"typical\\" or \\"advanced\\" in all areas, barring language. She understands you perfectly well, and the 15 phrases she has, she is able to say very very clearly. In other words - she's bright, and developmentally typical, she just doesn't talk yet.We do fit in the description of the Einstein Syndrome subset; my family is composed largely of musicians, my husband's family are mathematicians. But, my daughter is still a little too young to see just how well she continues to fit this pattern. This book has been fairly reassuring that my daughter is not the first or only child to simply not talk.However, I don't think any parent should use this book as a sole excuse to not have their child evaluated. Read it with a critical eye for your life and your child, and also research other possible explanations for your child's lack of speech...only if you research many possible alternatives can you really be sure you're making the right choice for your child."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"This book was comforting in that it explains why some children are late talkers. Often, there's a lack of understanding from parents and relatives on why children talk late. Parents get blamed in a lot of these cases by people who don't understand that not all children are the same. Whether your child is bright but talks late or whether your child talks late because of autism, you, the parent, need to find out. If you want to learn some strategies you can use as a parent to communicate with your child, then I would recommend a book called More Than Words by Fern Sussman."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"This book is anecdotal and not research based, but I enjoyed reading it. I have really struggled with feelings of guilt and second-guessing since my son was about three years old. He was extremely speech delayed and his school had labeled him as mentally handicapped. In my heart then I knew this was not true. He may not be a talker, but he can figure out things out without being shown. This book inspired me to start looking outside of the schools to find services for my son. He is now labeled as ASD (which I am neutral towards). Bottom line, hearing about other children that didn't fit the mold for development and grew up to be successful gave me a lot of hope. I no longer second guess my instinct.

I was concerned that he exhibited all of the symptoms quoted by the \\"experts\\" for a child with PDD-NOS. Little did I realize that taking him in for a free evaluation by the state would lead to School Psychologists and counselors demanding that I enroll him in their \\"enhanced\\" programs. After one psychologist accused me of being \\"in denial\\" I sought more information and found \\"The Einstein Syndrome\\".This book helped me understand the political and bureaucratic and academic machinations which are creating this bogus \\"Autism Epidemic\\" expecially in California. This book offered my wife and I real hope at a very dark time in our lives.I've waited almost 2 years to post this review. My son is now a playful, intelligent, affectionate, TALKATIVE 4 year old getting ready for kindergarten. All of the Autism/PDD \\"symptoms\\" completely disappeared on their own.

My son is currently getting straight A's and is enrolled in the school gifted program and is doing great in an accelerated math class.I'm very proud of him, he's the best son any father could hope for.The bureaucrats and educators in the school still occasionally harass him. They try to discipline him because they feel he looks or acts odd, not for any genuine reason. I have let the principal know that that I stand behind my son. I have come to feel that there's a real problem with misguided young (feminist) educators in our schools (especially in California). They don't seem to understand boyish behavior, especially behavior of the type that is characterized as autistic, and so they are try to label these children as diseased. There's money and careers to be made by these diagnoses, so it is sometimes difficult for parents to withstand the pressure of these \\"experts\\".Without this book I wonder I would have had the courage to stand up to those educators who pushed so strongly to have my son put ina class for mentally disabled students. Instead I stood my ground and insisted he stay in the normal classes, and he has thrived.Thanks again, Einstein Syndrome."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"The Einstein Syndrome is an informative follow-up of Thomas Sowell's Late Talking Children. Since my daughter and I share all the characteristics that Thomas Sowell writes about, it is quite refreshing and supporting to read about his and Professor Stephen M. Camarata's research. Sowell is a much needed pioneer on the research of bright late-talking children that share various characteristics such as: outstanding analytical abilities, and/or musical abilities, outstanding memories, strong wills, delayed toilet training, close relatives in analytical occupations (ex. engineers) and/or musical abilities, and other interesting characteristics that he describes in his book. Sowell writes about the frustrations a parent can go through with professionals misdiagnosing, to friends and family unthoughtful comments, to schools mislabeling for their own funding purposes. Sowell gives insightful examples of late-talking children and adults who talked late. He goes on to discuss the controversy on early intervention for this particular group of children. He does suggest that a child be evaluated by two separate independent professionals, to skip the &quot;free&quot; school district evaluation, and at the same time be an advocate for your child. Thomas Sowell encourages research and studies on the Einstein syndrome as well as more inovative and challenging educational approaches for these children. My gratitude goes to Thomas Sowell for writing such a wonderful book and if everyone must have a label, my daughter and I will take the Einstein syndrome."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"This is the Follow-up book to Sowell's &quot;Late Talking Children&quot;. The first book was mostly anecdotal evidence, but this book includes far more data, from more scientific research. He worked with Dr Camarata, a speech and language pathologist from Vanderbilt university for the research of this book.Yes, as before, many people will criticize this book, as they did the first. The people who will criticize this book are either the para-professionals that stand to lose money from unnecessary therapies, or the parents of children with serious issues who read no further than the dust jacket, and don't read the book with a critical enough eye to realize whether or not their child actually fits this special sub-set of late speakers. We have a strong family history of speech delays, and math intensive careers. Both my husband and father in law fit the profile, as engineers, both late speakers. I am such a strong advocate of this book, as I am a mother of 3 late speakers who fit the profile so closely it is almost scary to see it in print. It is as if they have been watching my household. All 3 of my late speakers are now speaking, and all share the extremely advanced mechanical and spatial perception skills addressed in the profile.If your child is not speaking, and you see a spark of intelligence in his eyes READ the book, and really analyze your child. Don't just say, &quot;Well some kids grow out of it, mine will too&quot;, take a serious look to see if your child does indeed fit the profile. If your child doesn't fit the profile, don't criticize this line of research, as this is a REAL sub-set of late speakers, even if it is not where your child is. If the child DOES fit the profile, there are a great many support groups out there for parents of these odd little guys."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"As one of the \\"semi-professionals\\" Sowell references (a Floor Time therapist working in a not-for-profit Los Angeles clinic), I found Sowell's book compelling and interesting (I read it in one sitting) but incomplete. Along with Sowell, I agree that a baffiling amount of bias and incomptence can be found in a variety of schools/programs/clinics designed to treat children with special needs. I myself felt inadequately trained/prepared by my clinic before being assigned to cases. However, unlike many of the other \\"semi-professionals\\", I have a desire to learn as much as possible about the study of speech delays (particularly Austism and PDD).Specifically, I picked up this book because of a 2-year-old client I am currently seeing who seems particularly bright but who has been identified as 'at-risk' for Autism on the FEAS scale. He currently recieves almost 20 hours a week of 'early intervention' services and both his parents and I worry that this much therapy may be innapropriate for a child of his age and functioning abilities. At the very least, Sowell's book reminded me of my own limitations as a diagnostician, the importance of positive, open, sympathetic interaction with parents, and the importance of embracing a client's individual differences while developing their intervention program.However, although Sowell presents a compelling case for the existence of a subset of 'late-talkers' whose development is possibly further compromised by intervention services, his book offers little practical advice for parents of such children other than telling them to seek evaluations from a variety of clinical and medical experts. He makes little if no reference to the importance of factoring a child's receptive language ability and a child's ability to signal a want/desire using complex gestures in determining the likelihood of future 'spontaneous' language abilities.Additionaly, Sowell makes several one-sentance disclaimers about not offering parents \\"false-hope\\". However, it seems likely that there are more parents of special needs children like the one on p. 145 who might interpret Sowell's theories as an endorsement of a 'wait-and-see' attitude."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"I am a proud father of a late talking child and I am grateful for this book as I know many other parents who read this book are who also have late talking children. After I read this book I told my parents about it and much to my surprise my mother told me I did not speak myself in full sentences until I was about 3 years old. Conventional wisdom is not what this book is about which is why some readers do not come to terms with the reality of this subject. This book clearly states that majority of late talking children do NOT have the Einstein Syndrome and goes on to say that the child should be evaluated to determine the cause.The point of this book is to enlighten people about the fact that many of these late talking children are exceptionally bright who go on to become successful adults which is contrary to conventional wisdom that may indicate something is wrong with these children. The pattern explained in this book is key to understanding this phenomenon which is not explored enough or correctly by medical experts who sometimes are quick to label a child as having ADD or being autistic. The children examined in this book all have very unique characteristics and their parents and close relatives are in very particular fields. All the data that was collected in this book is identical to my family's situation. My father is a high level musical instructor and I am a senior analyst in computer technology field. My son is almost 2 and a half years old has only a handful of words and is yet to put a sentence together but he is extremely bright. He has some social anxiety with strangers. He is extremely strong willed and on occasions throws big tantrums. He also has some allergies. He is really good with puzzles and in fact puzzles are his favorite thing. He constantly figures out how to take apart the safety gates I install in the doorways which also something the author mentioned about his own son. He knows how to work the TV/DVD player and my laptop and many other things that point to the fact that his brain is developing differently and he is analytically advanced but is behind in speech. I point all these characteristics out which are the same with other unique children mentioned in this book. We do have a great speech therapist but went through two other ones who did not click with our son so finding the right speech therapist is extremely important. He is currently making good progress with his speech as he seems to pick up a new word in every session the speech therapist works with him. He also goes to pre-school 3 days a week and even though he is not able to communicate with his peers or teachers he is able to get his feeling and actions understood with his gestures/eye contacts and a few words that he says. It is clear to me that he will start talking when his brain is developed to handle speech as mentioned in this book regardless of all therapies. Of course Einstein was the extreme case of a late talking child who became one of the greatest minds this world has ever known but there are many other great minds who were late talkers as it will be the case with many future late talking children.I have no doubt in my mind that my son will grow up to be a successful and happy person as I am who also was a late talking child. I did have some social difficulties as a young man but now I have a very loving wife with two wonderful children and a great career. I did not receive any speech therapy when I was a child. Today's society and so called experts have created an unfair pressure on today's children to start talking at a certain age. Early intervention is not always the answer and not all children are the same.I also ended up in the engineering/analytical field as did many of the adults mentioned in this book who were late talking children. I am also another living proof of this syndrome and a testimony to this research and this great book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is open-minded and is willing to understand what this book is really talking about. One should also apply their common sense and intuitions when dealing with a late talking child as all children are different and so is their physical and mental development."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"If you have a child that is late with speech development, seems frustrated with communications, strong willed & defiant, prone to tantrums, good at solving puzzles, loving but sometimes aloof, concentrates on some tasks, ignores requests to perform other tasks, not the least interested in potty training, exhibiting some autistic or PDD tendancies but having exceptional memory and suprising intelligence, then you need to get this book. Don't be put off by reviews of the professionals, the book has some information that will help concerned parents bypass those professional egos and cut to the main issue, how to best understand and help your child."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"I came across this book right as I was becoming concerned about my son's lack of progress in developing expressive language even though he understood everything we said and could communicate very well non-verbally. Right away, I recognized my son in this book and it gave me hope right when I needed it the most.I worked in schools as an occupational therapist for several years prior to having my first child, and have worked extensively with speech therapists. The book does often portray school personnel in an unflattering way, but this portrait comes from many parental accounts of their bright, late talking children being misdiagnosed and the heartbreak that followed.Now that I'm a parent whose child is being evaluated rather than the evaluator myself, I can see both sides of the story. This book has been very valuable to me, as it has reassured me and encouraged me to trust my instincts about my own child. It has also helped me to focus on the many positives of my son, rather than dwelling on his slow progress in developing speech. It has meant a great deal to me to know that my son is not alone, that there are in fact many children out there who are bright children who talk late. One of them was born 30 years before my son, and she went on to write this review!"},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"This book explained my son to me. He is 3 years and 9 months old and just beginning to speak conversationally.

Thomas Sowell reminds us parents that we are our children's best advocates and that our knowledge, feelings, and opinions about our children do count. Even if your child doesn't fit the profile, the book is worth the information on handling the professionals."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"This book is NOT a dangerous read. Dr. Sowell clearly states that speech therapy can be beneficial, but to be selective. A wrong diagnosis is as close as your local school district! Truly, these semi-professionals are interested in having a steady stream of new prospects, so caution is in order.This book is a must-read for all parents of late talking children. I could not wait to read this book! My son fits this profile perfectly, and yet I knew that before reading this that he was very intelligent. He was not autistic, or in the autistic spectrum. He did not suffer from any other delays, speech being the only one. Now, he is six years old. He is an articulate, reading, six year old! After waiting four years to hear him talk, his progress has been remarkable. This book discusses brain maturation, reasons for the delay, and what to do about it. A book of hope, and reason. Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"Our family benefitted from this wonderful book, The Einstein syndrome. Albert Einstein said he did not think with words, but in pictures. Albert spent several months at Cal-tech, possibly Dr Sperry the top brain scientist studied Einstein.A \\"picture-thinker\\" is in a different world and has a world of trouble communicating because their mind is different. Could it be that these children need understanding and patient parents to help their minds develop? They think outside-the-box. Read any book by Dr. Sowell, clearly he is a deep out-of-the-box thinker. I am a shallow-thinking out-of-the-box thinker. I hate to read, but love to learn, and I think with an impossible to describe strange picture, symbol process. These children (often boys, but not always) will do very well if not interfered with and allowed to develop.To the reviewers that say \\"dangerous\\", they have not read this book. No Physician would say that about this book. What effective treatment exists? Please forget ritalin, read this book and help your son. You will not regret it, neither will he."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"This is a great book! An invaluable resource in navigating this winding road of having a late talking child. Book was in perfect condition, bought it used. Received in little time after ordering."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"As the father of a bright, but late talking three year old boy, I read this book with interest. There is of course much here to give hope to the worried parent of such a child.My fear is that for some people this will be all they need to adopt a 'wait and see' policy. The boundries of high functioning autism and eccentric personality are not well defined, particularly in the young child. I have come to believe it is much wiser to address speech delay and it's commonly associated behaviours aggressively. If all turns out well by the age of five, so much the better. If however your child does in fact lie somewhere on the autistic spectrum then you will have let him or her down by doing nothing at this early stage.Lastly, my personal experience of speech therapists and other professionals working with late talking children is quite contrary to what Mr Sowell writes. Most are seemingly inundated with work and often it is left to the parents to push for the services their kids are entitled to."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"\\"Everything...is going to be...all right.\\" (Words of comfort spoken by the ridiculous \\"Affirmation Doll\\" showcased on the television show \\"American Inventor\\")This book tells scared people what they want to hear. Unfortunately, pretty words don't change reality for kids with developmental disorders. I despise this book because of how much harm it can cause! Ignoring a gash in your leg won't make it go away, but may lead to an infection. Denying your child's issues is just as unhealthy, and can cause life-long difficulties.This book encourages you to compare your child and your family to an Einstein profile, and if the match is there, just relax and wait for your child to grow up and learn on her own. For some children this course of action could cause them irreparable developmental damage.My son is 3 1/2 years old and still cannot speak more than the first letter of a word (\\"puh\\" for please is about as close to a word as he can do right now). He fits the profile for an Einstein Syndrome kid, as does our family. I am an engineer with a math minor who plays the piano and guitar; my wife has a college degree in music, although she considered majoring in physics. Once you consider our extended families, it's hard to find a family that fits the profile better than ours.Yet I'm convinced that our son would not have made much of his recent progress if he had not received the attention of the therapists this book tells us to avoid. Our son has benefited greatly from the early intervention services he has received from caring, knowledgeable professionals. If I followed the advice of this book my son would be worse off than he is today, and would be even less likely to one day live a \\"normal\\" life.We have witnessed none of the drawbacks of having our son \\"labeled\\" with a diagnosis. His diagnosis has never caused anyone to treat him with any less consideration than they would under other circumstances. On the other hand, his diagnosis has opened doors to resources that would not have been available otherwise.If you avoid going to the dentist because you fear he'll say you have a cavity, you might enjoy this book. If you think you can turn junk food into a gourmet meal by giving it a fancy name, this book is for you. If, on the other hand, you tend to face reality and to seek help where help is needed, then this book will be of no more use to you than an Affirmation Doll would be."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"I purchased this book after my child was diagnosed with autism. Our family fit the \\"Sowell profile\\" to a T: intellectually gifted family, musical, work in science related fields, etc. I clung to this book hoping it pertained to my child because it fit so well. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of autism was correct. For two years I was in denial. There very well may be a subset of children who are late talkers, I do not dispute that; but these children are very rare. The tone of the book portrayed school systems and early intervention as if they were only driven by their desire to find more autistic kids and get federal funding. The book also states that it does not want to give \\"false hopes\\" but that is exactly what it does. All of Mr. Sowell's case studies sound surprisingly autistic, so my child fit in well with the descriptions. I hope that people who decide to buy this book and will read my review and be cautiously optimistic instead of foolish like I was.~UPDATE: 1/8/12~I stumbled upon this review & it made me kind of sad thinking about what a \\"bad place\\" I had been emotionally when my daughter was diagnosed. I wrote the original review almost 7 years ago and was in deep despair at that time. Things have certainly changed in 7 years :-) While my daughter definitely has autism and is only slightly verbal (she talks, though not conversationally) she is the light of my life and the joy of my being and I would not trade her for the world."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"The book had been recommended to me - the grandmother of a \\"late talker\\". I was happy to find it on Amazon- a great price. The service was good- shipping fast. Just a perfect buy! Thank you Amazon!"},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"This book is both exhausting and empowering.It is exhausting because the author uses more anecdotal evidence gathered from such places as people who called in to radio shows he appeared on and online chats he has led than scientific studies. Also, every couple of pages he bashes home the point that not all late talkers are autistic, and yet throws around the \`A' word incessantly in talking about how so many authority figures are quick to label such children as such. In Sowell's world, every late talker is labeled autistic at some point; in our experience with our three-year-old daughter, the word was thrown out in the context of, \`We don't THINK she's autistic.' (We did have an awful, incompetent speech therapist at one point, though; such a thing, it seems, is required in navigating the wonderful world of speech delays.) He would have done well to balance this out with the actual symptoms of autism so people who are not sure can check their children against a more comprehensive list rather than deciding based on cherrypicking from a menu of symptoms.It is empowering because it has made me think of my daughter in a different way. Instead of focusing on the fact that she happens to be slower to talk than her peers (okay, she tested in the first percentile), I have come to enjoy watching her learn, celebrating what she CAN do. She'd barely turned two and was categorizing her blocks by color. She loves books and inventively acts out what is read to her, and even recites back (in her Esperanto) what she's heard after the lights are out. She can spot the tiniest detail half a block away, insistently matches her hair bands to her clothes, can't get enough of puzzles and can operate electronics with shocking expertise. She has better rhythm than most drummers, and is fascinated with calling out letters and numbers she sees on signs and around the house. She's stubborn. And oh--she's affectionate and clearly has empathy. And oh yes, she has near relatives who are engineers, artists and professional musicians. Is she an Einstein kid? Who knows; she's not solving 200-piece puzzles and hasn't dissected anything, but she's not disinterested in either. Not all kids who are late talkers are Einstein kids, and not all Einstein kids are autistic.Sowell--an economist, not a speech pathologist--postulates some interesting ideas, most notably that is that the real estate in the brain overdevelops (relatively) in some areas in contrast to those speech-producing areas. Causation is unclear, but pathological studies have shown a literal size difference in such areas where one trait is favored over another. This is something I would have liked to have seen more of in the book. In the end, Sowell succeeded in posing stories and situations that have no resolution. Three stars."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"It is more of a case study book than an informative book. I was looking for more of an overview of delay situations, but this book still has a lot of useful information."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"After reading this, and reading all the different reviews, the same conclusion comes up. Each individual child is different, so you can't assume every child is going to fit this profile. Please... parents... seek professional help early if you see your child is developmentally slow. Don't wait, the longer you do, the more harm it can do to your child. Early intervention is key to giving your child strategies and therapy to help them with whatever issues they've got. Go to a speech language pathologist, an audiologist who specializes in childhood disorders, and get many tests done. Do it NOW! You'll never be disappointed that you did it too soon, but you will if it's done too late."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"I found this book facsinating and spoke so directly to my situation it seems.

This book seems more an homage to the author's late-talking son, who clearly was too busy formulating a solution to the Middle East crisis to speak to his parents. It is merely a collection of anecdotes of bright people who tended to speak later than other children.If you're looking for \\"help,\\" this isn't it.

If they only read about disorders, they are only getting part of the story.This book has given many parents hope, in a world that currently has a doomsday trend with late talkers."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"My child was not speaking a word at ages two or three. I enrolled her in an \\"early intervention\\" program with the state at age two. A speech therapist came out and tried to encourage my little girl to speak. My little girl had no interest in talking, just the toys this woman toted to our home. After six months of therapy, my little girl was no closer to speaking than before the introduction of therapy. At age three, children have to graduate from the \\"early intervention\\" program. I did not want to continue with the state, so I enrolled my little girl in a private practice speech therapy program. Concurrently, my pediatrician suggested occupational therapy. Again, I had someone come to our home and test my little girl. The woman \\"expert\\" stated that my little one had \\"borderline\\" sensory issues and once therapy commenced, my little one would be \\"pissed\\" because that's what was required. Also, a brushing technique. I did not feel this was \\"expert\\" advice. At the urging of the private practice speech therapist, I decided to take my little girl to an apraxia \\"expert\\". Supposedly, this person is the top apraxia \\"expert\\" in the country. After testing concluded, the apraxia \\"expert\\" preceded to tell me that my little girl had PDD which is a form of autism. She told me that an intense therapy regimen was required for two/three weeks. My little girl would be in a room with autistic kids and would essentially be strapped down so that she would \\"have to learn\\" to speak. My only instinct as a mother was to protect my little girl from all these \\"experts\\". In addition to the \\"experts\\", her school teacher wondered if my daughter had sensory issues because she did not like messes (leaves on the floor) or the vacuum. I turned to books, magazines, anything that dealt with late talking children without autism, PDD, etc. Amazingly, the only book I found was this one. I am a voracious reader as is, this book is the most important book I'll ever read as a parent. It led me to Dr. Camarata at Vanderbilt. The only person I spoke with besides my pediatrician that actually has a medical degree as well as a Ph.D. The doctor tested my little girl at age three. Keep in mind, she had never even uttered the word \\"mama\\" or \\"dada\\" in her entire life. Dr. Camarata consulted with us and answered all of our many questions. He is in the midst of writing a book, and I can't wait to read it. The subject regards autism, which he is one of the country's foremost experts. Dr. Stephen Camarata is a widely respected name especially with the Autism Speaks organization. Now, at four years of age, my daughter is speaking in full complex sentences. Supposedly, people will not even surmise she was ever a late talker by first grade. Many of these kids don't speak until three-six or even later. She is very social, but I think will always have an independent streak. She is no longer afraid of the vacuum, as many children are at that young age. In fact, she loves to use our central vac herself. She still doesn't like messes. Unfortunately for me, this doesn't translate to her room! Regardless of her developing auditory/receptive skills, her visual skills are extremely strong and essentially overcompensate for now. She taught herself sight reading at age three, the alphabet at 18 months. Another good book to read is \\"Upside-Down Brilliance\\" which really dives into the ADHD issues and visual spatial skills. I'm so passionate about this subject, because many kids are getting labeled and medicated needlessly which is such a detriment to them. As for the children that truly have PDD, autism, etc. it does a great disservice to them. Bottom line....see a true expert and educate yourself."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"[This book is a companion followup to \\"Late-Talking Children\\" which is also by Dr. Sowell. Most of following is taken from my review and comments regarding the earlier book.]Dr. Sowell has done all parents a tremendous service, but this book is especially helpful for those parents who are questionning their child's development. He reminds us that \\"every child is different.\\" We've all heard that expression used to catch the vagaries of the development process, but you'll never realize how hollow it can ring until some childcare type tells you that they think your child may be developmentally delayed. This book helps deal with the certainty that your child *is* different and puts it in perspective. It should be read along with the earlier book \\"Late-Talking Children.\\"This text augments the earlier one with more scientific documentation and more of a discussion about \\"early intervention\\" and \\"testing\\" and their potential dangers. Dr. Sowell also focuses more on the role of a child's own wishes and motivations in \\"testing\\" at young ages, something I've not seen elsewhere.After two years of self-study in this area, I still found a great deal to learn in these books. Most of all, I found a lot of hope and perspective regarding kids that don't sit up and elocute at 18 months.The best advice in this book: take your children with you everywhere, expose them to everything possible. When they're ready to communicate, you'll have lots to talk about. My son is still working his way along, but we've made great progress, as others have, by letting him have some space and grow at his own pace.Another great idea reinforced by this book: Don't assume that your child doesn't understand or is behind because they don't speak. I've seen childcare \\"professionals\\" that make this mistake every day.Finally, this book hints at the danger of over-assessing children and the problems of the incentive structures within public schools. I have seen first-hand how problematic the opinions of pseudo-professionals can be, and how unscientific things can get. This book contains a better discussion of this than the first book, and documents the current trend toward assessing first and asking questions later. There exists incentives on the part of school officials to over-diagnose \\"PDD\\" and autistic-spectrum, and we've found that many of the folks doing the evaluating really have no idea what they're talking about. More funding, it seems, flows to those districts & schools who have the most children with \\"special needs.\\" This book helps put all of this in perspective, although it doesn't dig out the basis of all of it, which I believe is probably IDEA.Most importantly, this book helped me help my son, and that's the important thing. We are in debt to Dr. Sowell for bringing this issue to light."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"As a parent of two developmentally delayed children, this book was a sourch of hope and insipration.

Professionals might not like it, since it tells you that some of them aren't very good at what they do, and advises you to keep looking until you find the right doctor or therapist.While it focuses on a specific sub group of children who are completely developmentally normal except for expressive language, the information and anecdotes are a good education for any parent with a child that has development issues.It is also well written and very easy to read. Those familiar with Thomas Sowell's political and economic writings will find the same readable style here."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"I requested this book for Christmas to allay the concerns of others for my firstborn child. At the time, my son was 26 months old. He had a spoken vocabulary of fewer than 10 words, but he understood what we were saying, could obviously hear, was obviously bright in other areas, etc. So, my husband and I were unworried, but others were not. So we bought this book, which presents the message that some perfectly normal children just talk later and there's no need to worry if they're otherwise normal. It even allayed the concerns of the most concerned family member of all after she read the book before wrapping it for my present!This book does NOT say that no parent should worry if their child is late talking. The author points out that there are many different reasons children might talk late, but his purpose is presenting what he calls the Einstein Syndrome, bright children that are late-talkers and will talk in their own time. Much of the information contained in it is based on the results of a study of 235 families with bright but late-talking children conducted by Professor Stephen M. Camarta of Vanderbilt University. This book is well-written and easy to follow. Information, including analysis of the study results, is clearly presented. There were many characteristics these bright, but late-talking children had in common with much greater frequency than the general population. My son fit this profile almost perfectly, including having a father and all three uncles working as engineers, and a mother that is gifted in math.That late-talker of mine is now 7 and very normal for his age. He is reading on a 4th-5th grade level and talking up a storm. As a mother now of five children, with friends that also have young children, I understand much better now how far my son deviated from the 50th percentile in language development, but I also understand much better how broad the range of \\"normal\\" is. Parents of late-talking, but otherwise normal children (i.e. good comprehension and hearing), should find this book very reassuring both for themselves and for concerned family and friends. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"When I read The Einstein Syndrome it was amazing how much of my son I saw in it.

Your child may not fit in the Einstein syndrome, but if he/she does, then this book is an absolute must!"},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"We inquired about this book, following concerns about our grandson and his lack of interest in talking. All those that met him, expressed concerns to his mother that he was autistic. However, there were many things that he did, that were definitely not autistic. This book set us all on the right track, and gave the mother the assurance that her son was ok, just different. There are many things that he does, that is way beyond the average two year old, that does not involve talking. There are many insights into the raising of children, that would be well taken by ALL parents, because all children are different in their own way. The one thing that we would have liked to have seen in the book, somewhere, was information regarding a parent support group, to assist the parents that are dealing with these special children, in uncharted territories. I know that our daughter would certainly benefit from being able to communicate with someone with her own experiences. I did try contacting the two names in the book, but was not successful. The book helps to keep the \\"professional\\" suggestions and concepts in perspective, but there is considerable pressure placed on the parent, by those that think they know better than the parent. Your book reinforces the concept that the parent is the one with the most insight into the child, and those insights should be treated with respect and consideration by others. Thank you for an excellent guide for working with unusual children."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"I bought this book few months ago. My 2 year old son was an exact match to the characteristics of Sowell's late talker - number and alphabet skills, exceptional puzzle skills, and superb memory.

Reading it, was like reading an autobiography of my son's life and mine. Had it not been for this book, both of our lives would probably look a lot differently. It is written beautifully, it is easy to understand, and it is a must for any person who has been told that their child is autistic, has PDD, apraxia, dyspraxia, hyperlexia, etc. and instinctively knows it's not true.

It discusses the reality of the politics and business of therapists and special education that, in some cases, can hurt, rather than help these children."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"I found the subject of late talking children very interesting and intriging.

He has been checked for hearing as well as an overall analysis of his motor skills, social interests, etc., and has come out with an above average rate. We are just interested in how he progresses over the next year or so to see if he has above intelligence.

As the months go by, thomas sowells diagnoses for such children is becoming more and more apparent in my child.This book costs only [$].

Easy to read and understand."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"This book did much to put our minds at ease over our nearly 4yr old who shows normalcy and even high aptitude in all areas except...he doesn't say more than a handful of words. Mr Sowell is an awesome writer, I have enjoyed many of his books!"},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"There is one thing that I would vehemently disagree with that Sowell wrote. Just as he was getting into an explanation of a certain paradox (why is it that most people who are mathematicians play some sort of musical instruments but that black people are more likely to play an instrument but are rarely mathematicians), he made one assertion that was quite wrong: That learning to play jazz piano takes a minimum of training. That is just incorrect. Fools like Ornette Coleman notwithstanding, being PROPERLY trained to play jazz is a full degree course (just like classical). Just different.That said: This book was a refreshing change from his other books in which he goes over well worn social/ political/ economic ideas. (There was a bit of preaching about the decline in educational standards since the 1960s-- though I could see their relevance to the issue at hand.) This book was actually something *new.* Moreover, it was his actually doing original research into something instead of just making existing knowledge easier to understand.In some ways, the economist in him came through with all his warnings about the vested interests of \\"experts\\" in the field. He stated his case so fully against people making diagnoses outside of their area of expertise that you could almost see him foaming at the mouth as he wrote. In other ways, the parent in him came through by explaining a very likely course of events for a person who might go through this process as someone who *has* gone through the process.Also fun were the letters/ stories in which the parents were able to speak for themselves.A lot of Sowell's (slightly windy) commentary could be extended to dealing with many other types of children who will need to be diagnosed (for whatever reason) by professionals (of whatever quality and of whatever stripe). Point #1: Make sure that your diagnoses are independent of one another. Truly independent. Point #2: Understand that sometimes diagnostic categories are overly broad and can be stretched to include ANYTHING. Point #3: You can't make an expert understand something when his income depends on his not understanding it.Even if this book was about 50 pages longer than it needed to be, on net balance I still think it's worth having in your Kindle just so that you can have a strategy ready if you ever to have to deal with professionals in the context of your child."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"I bought this book with several books about autism spectrum after my son was announced to be on autism spectrum because he started talking at 2 and 7 month. I read all the books and found this book helped me most. My son's doctors saw my child as a speech-delayed child who refused to cooperate on any task. They ignored that he is in a bilingual environment, he loves reading and he picked up those 20 words in 2 months without any therapy. As a late talker myself, I know it is not right to label a child with autism just because he is late talking. I started talking at the same age as my son, and quickly picked up. By 4 I was talking no stop. My family background fits the profile perfectly. My parents are engineer and teacher. Both I and my spouse are scientists and play music instruments. My son is extremely strong will and has excellent memory. Now he is surprising me everyday with new words. He is still behind but he has an amazing learning speed, thank for his good memory.I give this book four start, because parents with real autism child may use this book to put themselves into denial. I suggest parents buy this book also do research on autism before switching the autism label with the Einstein syndrome."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"The content is excellent; a valuable book devoted to a neglected subject. Unfortunately, the print quality was terrible. Even though I returned the first book that I received, the replacement was the same, numerous pages where the outer inch of printing was blurred, and for all practical purposes, unreadable. Very disappointing for a product from Amazon! Even though I advised Amazon of the nature of the problem on the first book, they didn't bother to check the replacement book."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"I am surprised that a man with Sowell's academic credentials didn't do a better job of presenting (extremely limited) research. The two \\"research studies\\" he refers to are his extremely informal one with only about 50 subjects and another vaguely described one by Stephen Camarata with about 250 subjects. The point of this book is that there appears to be a subset of late-talkers with above-average math and/or mechanical and/or musical abilities and they are usually boys. Sowell objects to how these children are frequently labeled with \\"disorders,\\" especially autism. I don't know much about this, but it was my understanding that autism is a wide-spectrum disorder and nothing in this book proved to me that many of these \\"late-talking\\" children Sowell writes about aren't simply borderline cases. It wasn't very reassuring to me - the very mathmatical mother of a bright but speech delayed 23 month-old. But Sowell admits that he is not an expert in this field and it seems that he has collected, analyzed and presented more information about this group of children than anyone else. But what I found objectionable about the book was his hostility towards teachers, speech therapists, and the like. I'm sure some are good and some are lousy, but to describe them as \\"semi-professionals\\" suggests to me an extremely biased mindset. He also takes quotes from parents who disagree with him that he finds on the internet and tears them apart. One in particular was from a mother who explained that she didn't want her son to just be good in math. She wanted him to enjoy drama, peotry and liturature. Seems reasonable to me, but Sollow apparently can't tolerate any suggestion that these children might have shortcomings, however minor. This attitude might be more understandable if he extended his tolerance of different aptitudes to other categories of children. But he describes a child with an I.Q. of 98 as being two points below normal! Overall, it was worth reading and I give Sollow credit for tackling the topic. But I hope more information about this cluster of abilities/delays becomes available."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"When you have a kid on the autism spectrum that isn't talking/developing appropriately, sometimes things work out OK on their own. That's pretty much a summary of this book's contents.However, all too often, they do not work out on their own, and any parent that buys this book because their child isn't talking/developing appropriately, and decides to do nothing or delay testing and treatment, is making a regrettable mistake.True, some kids talk late and turn out fine. But all too many don't, and even children that are \\"on the borderline\\" can fall far, far behind unless Parents make an effort to address the situation.Early intervention is key in helping kids on the Autism spectrum. If you're worried about your child, go ahead and purchase this book, but look at OTHER books on the matter, and think carefully about what you need to do to ensure your child's needs are fully met."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"I personally thought this was a fantastic read. A little history; my son was a late talker. Couldn't string two words together until 4 1/2 years. Was at the 1% for speech. His IQ was around a full scale of 65. That's around the retarded range.This book at the time was one of the only books available on this subject and it gave me a ray of hope. I always knew he was smart, he was building robots at five, but the teachers thought I built them. Well, as you can imagine it's difficult to convince people of your childs intelligence if he can't string a sentence together. He was by the way diagnosed autistic, add, then pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified.Well, anyhow a fantastic read which I hope causes further research in this arena. My other recommends are Upside down Brilllance, and Left brained in a Right brain world by jeffrey Freed. My other favorite is How the brain learns by Sousa.My son is currently 10 by the way, his father is a pilot (consistent for this book). He is gifted in math and performs very well on visual spatial tasks. He talks like a normal kid now and loves science. Parents trust your insticts with your kids. My son is a wonderful, social, intelligent boy. Your story may not end like mine, but perhaps there's something to the self-fulfilling prophesy. I always expected he'd get better and he did. THe schools wrote him off as soon as they saw his IQ and that he couldn't talk. But, what can I say how well would you score on a french IQ test if you didn't speak french? His IQ in math subtests) has jumped over fifty points between 5 and ten."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"I bought this book and it took me about 6 months to get up the nerve to read it. I wish it didnt take me so long. Mr Sowell comes right out and says that he is not an expert in this field. Everything written in this book could have been about my son. It had reasured me that my son is not the only one with this dilema and that although he might not be \\"normal\\" what ever normal is. He should be fine. Mr Sowell's whole purpose in this book in my opinion is not to diagnose every child but to inform us that there is the posiblity that there is a subset of children who have this disorder. A disorder that not many people know about and they need extra help but not to take what the school districts tell you as gospel, you as the parent know your child best and to leave no stone unturned until you get the answer that satisfies you. Yes there is a posibilty that the diagnosis is autism but I dont believe that reading this book will give you false hope."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"Beware of the \\"Autism Spectrum\\"! Does your child like math, puzzles, and building things? Does your child like to be alone sometimes? Guess what! He/she is not necessarily autistic just because some might want to label it so. This book is a healthy antidote to the idea that everyone should develop exactly the same way, and that anyone who doesn't has a problem.I fit the profile of this book completely. I have many scientists and musicians as relatives, didn't start talking until I was 2 and a half. At that time, my family doctor told my parents that I was profoundly retarded. Nowadays, I would have been labeled as autistic (especially since I actually liked to play alone once in awhile). I grew up to be just fine (a scientist with a pilot's license...I fit the bill completely). My son also didn't start talking until he was 2 and a half. However, he was affectionate, didn't have physical signs of real autism (like hand flapping or ritualistic actions), and did seem to understand a lot more than he was saying. A year later, he is talking just fine, and loves playing with daddy.As Sowell himself points out, if your child isn't talking by age 3, there might be something. Maybe there is a hearing problem. Maybe it really is autism. It's worth getting checked out. However, take anything anyone tells you with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"I agree with many other reviewer that Einsten Syndrome has limitations; in fact, the author recognized that fact. It is also similar to Late Talking Children. However, it is another lifeline for parents who may be battling a school or health care system which is not always well oiled in that it invites parents to take an active part in their child's development. I did not find that Sowell rejected evaluation and has even suggested testing for both hearing and speech, in conjuction with a pediatrician, at the appropriate time.His most important point om Einstein Syndrome is that it is up to the parents to oversee the testing, to guarantee that their child is well-treated as in individual during the process, and that the experience is positive for the child and the family. Having worked in many health care systems, I can say that there are many qualified experts out there; some parents, however, may need information and guidance to help them deal with those who are not. This book is for them."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"This book is controversial and has been called \\"dangerous\\" - but it would only be to those who read it to see what they want to see. Nowhere does he discount the usefulness of speech therapy, nor does he advise against seeking assistance and evaluations. On the contrary, he advises strongly to seek out independent evaluations.Sowell is writing about a group of children who are extremely intelligent AND who talk late. He is very clear that most children who talk late do not fit the \\"Einstein Syndrome\\" description. But one doesn't need to have a child who falls precisely in this category to take something useful from this book.The most important thing I got from it was to be skeptical of the various labels SLPs and school districts are so quick to put on children, and to seek out an independent evaluation for my son. That is, someone who had nothing to gain by labeling him, someone who would not be gaining a new client and therefore more income.Additionally, Sowell illuminates our society's quickness to label all children who don't fit into the norm as having a disorder, whether it's in play preferences, temperament or language development.I did see a lot of my son in this book - I had highlighted page after page and called my husband at work when I read about a 2 year old child who was moved to tears by Mozart, who could count to 100, spell various words, etc but not have a sequential conversation...could have been my 27 month old I was reading about. For that moment of catharsis, as well as the practical stuff, this book was invaluable to me."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"Thomas Sowell is an economist. He writes excellently about politics. But he needs to butt out of a field in which he has no expertise, especially when his conclusions are so profoundly irresponsible.Thomas Sowell's own child had language delays. It's as if he is protesting too much -- he wrote a whole book so the whole world would know his child was perfect, after all. Then there are a whole bunch of incomplete andecdotal reports of other bright children who talked late, and why. The reader has no additional information about these children's level of functioning in other domains. How do they socially? How do they function in school? How is their executive functioning? Are we sure they really talked late? Are their pediatrician's reports? He does not even define what he means by \\"talking\\"?For the purposes of his book, he should define talking in order to be able to demonstrate what it means when these children \\"talk late.\\" After all, \\"mutism\\" is an actual disorder. Is he saying they never uttered a sentence? Never gestured? Never pointed? Or did these children really go years and years without uttering a syllable? When did anyone notice that this was an issue, contemporaenously or in retrospect? It would be useful to view the comments and concerns of their pediatricians.Throughout the book, Sowell talks about Labelling, as if Labelling were an evil to be avoided. But what is so mystifying is that speech therapy is painless. Its effectiveness is well-established. Labelling will not keep the kid out of the CIA in 25 years. What is Sowell advocating? A child who can't tell you what he wants gets infuriated and frustrated, demoralized and unhappy. That's why the child should get speech therapy. And Sowell is selfish for gambling on his child's neurological future to -- let's face it -- save his pride.For babies, it matters less. They're tired, lonely, scared, hungry, wet, cold, hot or something hurts. Almost all of it can be remedied by feeding, changing, cuddling and soothing, unless it's a medical problem. In contrast, toddlers, they have more complicated needs. They don't want grape juice, they want milk. They don't want their noodles touching the sauce. They want the purple truck. It's his turn to play on the slide. The TV is too loud. He wants to watch Teletubbies, not Mr. Rogers. It is only fair that a toddler be able to engage in age-approriate verbal communication for that reason. There is no defensible reason to prevent a toddler with a communication problem from getting help in being able to communicate.I would also note that with very specifically-delimited exceptions, none of which seem to be encompassed by this book, there are very few happy loners. Some kids give up because their social skills are bad, but most people are social animals -- whether they enjoy the company of one or two trusted people or they are total social butterflies. A child should be taught social skills at an early age so that he can make the choice on his own terms, not because his social skills are so poor that society makes those choices for him. That renders a child miserable and powerless and, by the time he is in middle school, a target for bullying.And anyone who has witnessed children of any intellectual level who are frustrated because they can't get their basic needs met -- due to a lack of ability to communicate them -- would understand that this is a matter of compassion, not dogma.Meanwhile, the authors offer no justification of any kind for their position that these children should be denied help."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"A great book that introduces a subset of late-talking children to an audience that usually only hears about normal kids vs autism spectrum disorder kids. A refreshing viewpoint that does not necessarily explain all or even most late talkers but certainly is a relief to the small group it does apply to (and the author is upfront and honest about this fact). The theory he presents for your consideration: resources in the brain are used up by once section at the expense of another. Analytical pursuits, mathematics, music; these will flourish while language skills suffer. But the language suffers only temporarily (unlike late talkers who have autism or PDD) and those gifts in music, math, and analytic thinking and ability stay for a lifetime. No intervention needed (in fact, it can do more harm than good for THESE SPECIFIC CHILDREN). Most are boys, most potty train late, most talk quite late (starting to speak anywhere from 2 - 5 years of age), most have a family history of engineers, mathematicians, pilots, musicians, and those in similar fields. Most do not exhibit the typical signs of autism or PDD but show signs in addition to simply talking late that can easily be misdiagnosed as autism or PDD by professionals (and non professionals) who are too quick to judge, have ulterior motives, or are simply unaware of this subset possibility. A great read for anyone who wants to broaden their understanding of late talking children and what may or may not be at the root of the problem. I think every speech therapist and pathologist should have to read this book in addition to the other books they usually use in their studies. Too many people are scared of this book, claiming it gives false hope to parents of children who have problems like autism or PDD (or general apraxia). The book is intriguing and does not pretend to have all the facts and talks of a very specific subset of late talkers. What would scare me more is the professional on the other side of the fence guaranteeing you that your child has autism/PDD/etc at this age range (2-5 years of age) when it is clear to anyone with their head screwed on straight that no one fully understands these conditions either - and to diagnose with certainty in this age range for such conditions is absurd. I will add, the PDD spectrum is so broad most of my older family members would fit on the spectrum. But of course back when they were growing up no one was chasing them with that label. Make it broad enough and we'll all fit it in!"},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"Four months after being told that our son was autistic we came across a newspaper column by Dr. Sowell. After reading Einstein Syndrome, and many books on autism, we became convinced that he is not autistic.The book explains how many \\"professionals\\" dont distinguish between autism and autistic traits (many of which are quite commonly found, e.g., the ability to intensely focus on an activity). The reason it is important is because the remedial action for autistic kids is very inappropriate for those who possess a few isolated autistic traits.This book is highly critical of speech therapists, but in a reasonable and fair way. In our own experience we have come across 5 speech therapists. Out of these 5, three have been great. The other two have showed an intense need to come off as experts, jumped to conclusions, and tried to sell services clearly unsuitable for our son.On technical merits alone it would not be a 5 star. The writing could have been better. And the science is anecdotal (but still very plausible). I must add that much of the research on autism also appears to be very anecdotal.However, for charting out the best course for son, no other book has been more influential."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"This book was wonderful....grandparents, and parents both have read it, and will be passing it along to the pediatrician. We are lucky, our pediatrician, although hadn't heard of this book, knew enough to tell us to stop worrying, and that our son is what is considered a late talker.(Something this mother had never heard of, and couldn't understand how a child cannot talk, but work almost every tool and gadget in the house, and still the doctor say he's not autistic, and not mentally retarded...then why doesn't he talk?) HOWEVER, this book took the concern away....filled in the gaps, and gave this mother the information needed to make the INFORMED choice to let nature be. Also took all the stress and tension out of our home. Being able to read a well documented book while raising our child has made all the difference. OUT OF FOUR BOOKS ORDERED THIS WAS THE ONLY ONE BASED ON FACTS, ACTUAL STUDIES WITH REAL LIVE PARENTS AND CHILDREN! The other three books are collecting dust. Can't say enough good about this author."},{"Title":"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late","review":"I found this book a fascinating read.

He loves dismantling toys and putting them back together. His father is a technical whizz with computers, his uncle a civil engineer. My son displays all the characteristics described in Thomas Sowell's book except that he is an extremely socialable child, infact rather a comic, loves cuddles and has lots of friends. He is also very strong willed and refuses to hold my hand unless he chooses to! I will wait and see if I have a genius on my hands. I will also be extra careful about what, if any, speech therepy he receives in the future.

I thought this book was beautifully written and wonderfully sensitively wrought. The writer's very unique writing style sustains a tremendous level of poignancy and sensitivity throughout the story, but the author manages to achieve this without ever compromising the story at any point. It remains immensely readable and compelling to the end. In particular, the beautiful relationship drawn between the protagonist, Peter, and his sister, Ruby, is so beautifully drawn that I think it could quite easily go down in the annals of literature alongside such famous sibling relationships as the one in George Eliot's The Mill on the Floss. The book is a series of interconnected stories, beautifully held together with bridges of pure literature. The stories follow Peter, a second generation German, as he tries to make sense of his life in small town Canada. Inevitably, though, his history as a German, and all of the associated feelings of guilt enter into the fabric of his, and his families, lives and emotions and forces each of them to come to terms with the weight of history. The way in which this is achieved is so moving, so finely crafted, it brought tears to my eyes, and furthermore, it gives a very important and valuable perspective to another group of people who also suffered as a result of WWII. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in history, who enjoyed reading Anne Michaels' Fugitive Pieces or to anyone who enjoys fine literature."},{"Title":"Sports Illustrated Book of Fencing","review":"90 pages short.

My son is an artist (painter), and it's already helped him expand upon his interests (he now helps teach painting to little kids as community service) to help him appeal better to scholarship judges and committees.

However for almost no cost yet lot's of time, you can save money on college utilizing scholarships. Maybe not a free ride to Harvard, however perhaps $3,000 to $7,000.I would also emphasize local organization (Chamber, Rotary, etc.), local churches, and corporations can be excellent sources with less competition. Tuition discounts for students that apply to colleges, which they are usually in the top 25% of the student population SAT scores at that college is an excellent strategy that can easily save thousands.Angelo J.

Imagine, having someone else pay to send your kids to college. That may have been an overreaction. Surely anyone else that has college-bound kids should sympathize.The book is well organized and written on a level that will not challenge a high school student. However, there are tips for a wider audience including the very young, older returning students, graduate students, and students that fit into special groups.Clearly, the competition for scholarships can be intense, but with a logical game plan engaged in consistently, an applicant's effectiveness can be increased. The one consistent theme in the book is that a steady approach will lead to success.I will take issue with a combination of techniques mentioned in the book. Kaplan suggests that students get their recommendations in electronic format so that they can print them out as needed. He also suggests that you solicit \\"small\\" changes to recommendation letters to make them \\"great\\" letters. I feel this may present many an ethical challenge to some applicants. To be clear, he does not suggest manufacturing recommendation letters.He also provides access to his companion web site to add extra punch to the process.In the final analysis, it is hard to argue with his success, and Kaplan was very successful on his own behalf.

This story focuses on the life of Richard Hunter, a poor bootblack from New York City. It is a classic story about a young boy without parents who works hard and is honest. The honesty and hard work pays off for him when he does deeds for people in high places.In Ragged Dick Richard Hunter's honesty brings out the best of people. The wealthy people give him extra attention for his deeds and notice his honesty. For example, he receives money for a shoe and cannot get change so within a few days of the business interaction, he goes to the work place of the man and gives him the change. It also represents respect for his elders.Story number two of the series is Mark The Match Boy. This too has good morals starting from the youth. This story displays the innocence of a boy coming into the real world. Mark is a boy who is deprived of love. He has no living mother and no family. The purity, which he displays to Richard Hunter, is charming. In this story thievery motivates the conflict. The story display Mark as a by who is similar to The Catcher in The Rye as where Holden Caulfield does not let his sister be corrupted by the real world, Richard is doing this to Mark.These two stories should be read by not only the youth, but by everyone. They focus on universal morals such as honesty and trust. I can say nothing negative about this book because it is well written, to the point, and very appealing. Not only is it motivating, but also it brings out the best in people and it could change your view on the less fortunate population."},{"Title":"Ragged Dick and Mark, The Match Boy","review":"i think everyone should read at least one horatio alger book, since he so helped shape american morals at the turn of the last century. his very name is a constant catch-all for the american rags-to-riches machine. i inherited my grandfather's set, and, even though one can call these books formulaic, moralistic rot, they capture a spirit and a time in simplistic, bold language that is readable, entertaining, and a fresh peek at cultural history through a primary source. Add to this that i am a teacher who is having my 8th grade boys read it (yes, in part for a laugh), but they are digging it. More than i could have anticipated. Read one paired with Nathaneal West's &quot;A Cool Million,&quot; which parodies alger, for a real bully debate about americanism."},{"Title":"Ragged Dick and Mark, The Match Boy","review":"Elizabeth AnastasiMark The Match Boy by Horatio Alger is about a young, poor, orphaned boy forced to make it on his own on the streets. He gets through many obstacles and troubles that come his way with integrity and honesty. Mark shows honesty and integrity throughout the novel. When his friend Ben, who he met on the streets, told him to lie to his customers about the price of his matches to make more money, Mark wouldn't do it. Even if it meant he would go hungry that night,he said he would never accept money if he didn't earn it; that is why he doesn't like begging. Maybe it was fate or pure luck, but Mark catches a break when he learns he has very wealthy extended relatives searching for him. This story will broaden your idea of what is important in life. At the end of the book, you are left with the question; is he just lucky, or is there such thing as fate?A reason why I liked this book so much was because it was very easy to understand. No matter if you are rich or poor you can appreciate the struggles of being less fortunate or the desire to be wealthy. The characters are realistic and the actions they do are as well. Everything that happens in the book is something that could happen in real life.Another reason why I liked Mark the Match Boy so much was because it was an easy read. There was no embellishment added to the reading. Because of this, it seemed as though each chapter was its own story. The author speaks to the reader to help them understand and follow the story. Even if you haven't read Ragged Dick, the story that preceded Mark the Match Boy, like I didn't, the author relates back to it so you can understand the entire story better.I recommend Mark the Match Boy because, Young or old people can be thankful for what they have. This book will open your eyes to what you really need in life and what is really important. After reading this book you will value morality, integrity, and honesty."},{"Title":"Ragged Dick and Mark, The Match Boy","review":"Mark the Match Boy is the tale of a young, poverty stricken boy who makes it through life with his good morals and honesty. Mark, the main character, lives with a gaurdian who puts him on the streets to sell matches and make profit for the both of them. When Mark finally works up the courage to run away from his temporary home, a string of good fortune suddenly comes upon him. Mark is taken in by a very nice young man by the name of Richard Hunter, the main character from author Horatio Algers previous novel. The two characters seem to go hand in hand with eachother, and are very easy to relate to. Everything seems to go Mark's way, especially the surprise ending which contains a very good twist.I would, without hesitation, reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys to read. I would also reccomend this book to anyone who has had some bad luck recently. Mark the Match Boy comes with the life lesson, work hard, mind your business, and treat people with respect, and you shall recieve the same. Possibly a little good fortune to go with it."},{"Title":"Ragged Dick and Mark, The Match Boy","review":"I enjoyed reading this book for several reasons, the first being that it was easy reading. I was a junior in college and all the books that I was used to reading were in some sort of foreign language that I could not understand. Ragged Dick was a very simplistic, yet interesting book that I could not put down. The second reason that I enjoyed it was because it talked about real issues during that point in history. Ragged Dick had to struggle in order to get the things that he needed to survive, but in the end it was his manners and his personality that enabled him to prosper as much as he did. I read the book twice and it was still good to me.

They are quickly paced, strong in plot and character development, full of witty dialogue and humor and, most importantly, carry the message of the value of hard work, determination and never giving up.

His later works (such as &quot;Mark the Match Boy&quot;) never matched the success of the first of the series, but even at the end of his career (when his books were almost completely formulaic; not that they ever weren't, but they got significantly worse over time) he was still highly regarded as a popular author for juveniles.These stories have mostly historical interest now, but they may be good for a laugh. (And if you're just curious, several Horatio Alger works are available on the net from Project Gutenberg.) I can't in all honesty recommend that someone just randomly buy an Alger book without already knowing what they're getting, as the stories are awfully trite and filled with the moralizing one would expect from a Victorian-era manual intended for young men. &quot;Work hard and succeed&quot; may be a valid message, but Alger's heroes had far more luck than would ever befall a normal person. [Dick might still be looking for a job if he hadn't happened to save a businessowner's son from drowning... Oops, I just gave the story away. Double oops, I just gave *all* of Alger's stories away.] The plot in all of his stories is identical, they're full to overflowing with coincidence, the dialog is horribly stilted even for the era, etc, etc. And yet...I'm not quite sure how I got interested in Alger's work, but I've pretty much read everything he wrote--it's rather a morbid fascination with just how *badly* people can write, and yet people will still read it, and worse, think it's good.As for this specific edition, it's probably one of the few versions of Alger's work that are in print, so what choice do you have?"},{"Title":"Social Programs That Work","review":"Hello...My name is ally crane and i am Jonathan crane daughter!This book is a great book if you want to know about social programs that work and things like that!It is very well written and gives the reader a lot of info.

P.S. it is dedicated to me...lol!My real name is alyssa!"},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"A month ago I eagerly began reading this book, as I had heard from several sources that it was considered one of the best American novels of the 20th century. Having finished it, I can now say that I have read worse books and I have read better books. This novel does touch on many important aspects of life in America -- how Americans live and work, the values that we hold dear, and the characteristics that make America unique among all the nations of the world. At several points during the book, I felt an expectation that the narrative was on the verge of vaulting into a truly profound and elegant statement about the themes that make up its story. Unfortunately, in a text of about 600 pages, the author succeeds only three or four times. I must say, with disappointment, that I expected more from a book of such lofty reputation. Still, those few passages which do succeed are exceptionally good.Historically speaking, the novel uses two of the most important episodes of the 20th century as the basis for the storyline. The first is the stock and real estate market crash of 1929, with its precedent speculative mania and the ensuing economic depression. Wolfe provides very wise and eloquent commentary about the bankruptcy, both moral and financial, in which America became trapped during this era. The second episode is the pre-WWII oppression of Germany by the Nazi regime of the mid-1930's. Given that the true magnitude of the atrocities committed during the Holocaust was not yet widely known at the time this book was written (1937-38), I was impressed with the premonition of impending evil that Wolfe captured so vividly in this book.Around these two major events, the author weaves a story that moves somewhat awkwardly between different sets of characters that seem to have little connection to one another, other than the fact that they are known to the main character. After I finished the book, I read a short biography of the author, Thomas Wolfe, and I then realized that You Can't Go Home Again is largely autobiographical. This knowledge helps to explain the somewhat disjointed nature of the plot and the author's apparent oversight in introducing certain central characters without ever explaining to the reader *why* they should be considered important. For example, the editor in the story, Foxhall Edwards, is a straight characterization of Wolfe's real-life editor Maxwell Perkins. Wolfe simply states that Edwards is a great friend and counselor to the story's main character without ever giving the reader a concrete passage which demonstrates this relationship. Then, at the end of the book, the main character writes a long letter to the editor explaining his need to &quot;break clean&quot; from the editor's friendship. This is all very eloquent and accurate from a real-life perspective, since Wolfe did in fact experience a very close relationship and subsequent parting with Perkins. The problem is that the reader, confined to the text of this novel, never really gets the sense that the relationship between these two men is in any way special or important. There are several other characters in the story who suffer from the same lack of development.I read an essay on Thomas Wolfe which described his writing style as &quot;torrential explosions of adjectives and adverbs&quot; and I must agree with this assessment wholeheartedly. Wolfe tends to use many synonymous words or phrases to describe a single idea. Sometimes this style works well, at other times it seems burdensome. All in all, this book is a worthwhile read and I am glad that I took the time to read it. I can not say, however, that it lived up to all of my expectations."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"Yes, it's overwritten,overlong, and the guy just can't do New York - he's a hick. But in a way the length is part of what Wolfe is trying to do. It's incantatory, rhapsodic, celebratory of American vastness. No wonder he influenced Kerouac. Some of the stuff about the Jacks' party had almost homeric echoes the way everything was described as so wonderful - then Wolfe gets on his prophetic soapbox and starts his denunciatory incantation.But steer clear of this one - life is too short."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"This book starts off great. Characters are very interesting. Very descriptive. But then Wolfe gets too descriptive, to the point of boredom. I agree with those who said parts of the book could have been deleted. I actually did skim and skip through parts of the book."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"The plot of the book was very interesting and I think that it holds a special appeal for aspiring authors. However, parts of the book are extremely drawn out, and Wolfe feels the need to tell the reader every small detail about the character's life, without seeming to care whether it is of any significance to the reader. So although the plot is good and the character's well-developed, it is not fast-moving and I think that many people will become bored and restless through certain parts. However, if they keep reading it soon picks up again, and I feel that the book is worth reading even though it has this negative aspect about it.Another good thing about the book is that it does an excellent job of capturing the American spirit that persisted at the time it was written. During the novel the Great Depression takes place, as well as the beginning of World War II. The novel shows the social decay of this era and emptiness which envades American citizens' hearts when they realize that all the money they put so much worth in is nothingness now. If for nothing else one should read this book for an accurate picture of the time period in American history.Be aware of a lot of sexism and rascism throughout this novel, which shows the time period it was written in and hopefully shows us how far we have come- if not in reality, at least in the art of writing. I recommend this book for its plot and its setting, and if you like to read a book such as this and you don't only look for an on-the-edge-of-your-seat success story (and you can resist taking offense to some ugly comments), and especially if you are looking for a book that represents a time and a place very accurately, I think you will really like this book. It definitely has a great literary value and has stood the test of time in the hearts of many readers and lovers of literature."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"I only read the first like ten pages. It was super boring so I stopped. Glad I borrowed it from the library."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"This book rates umong the worst books I have ever read. Wolfe goes into unnecessary details about everyone mentioned in the book. As a reader, I do not like to waste my time reading the life history of a person who has no impact on the story. I found myself wanting to just skip over these parts instead of reading them. They seem to be completely irrelevant to the story. The book would be better if it followed the life of the main character instead of characters who mean nothing. Overall, there are about 100 pages of good reading, while the other 600+ are a waste of time."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"This Kindle version is loaded with distracting typos, on every page. Not worth the price."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"I guess it makes one feel intellectually in touch if he can praise this book. I guess I will never make it to that level, because I think this is one terrible book. I read approximately 100 pages on the traits of Fox Edwards, therefore, I was a little upset when I found out it was for no reason. I read with interest the last few pages where I found out that Wolfe's editor had to piece together several parts of this book, and then he had to write many pages in order to tie this mess together. All of this occured after Wolfe's death. I believe this is a collection of ramblings from Thomas Wolfe. I am sure that I can be attacked verbally for not understanding the meaning of this great work, but if it was truly a great work, I would not have missed its significance. Please, play with the kids, walk around the block, start drinking, but don't waste your time on this book."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"Every sentence is over-written. Seems to have been written to please the author and \\"literary\\" critics, but not the reader."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"Don't waste your time with this nonsense. I slogged my way through this novel a year or so ago, hoping there was something of value here. There was not. It is boring beyond what mere words can ever say. I'd rather cut my lawn with a pair of scissors than read this book. It would take less time and be more enjoyable."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"Thomas Wolfe's book &quot;You Can't Go Home Again&quot; is undeniably an immortal American classic. What is truly impressive and unique about Wolfe's writing is not only the intuitive incisiveness with which he articulates human thought and emotion; but just as astonishing, is his ability to articulate these things with utter and precise clarity.There is not one sentence in his book that does not make total sense upon first reading. If it seems not to, it is only because the reader has skipped a line. With a vocabulary that is vast, but which he uses with unique precision, Wolfe tells the story of George Webber, a writer, who is in essence, Thomas Wolfe, the writer. Wolfe ultimately sees himself as an artist that is an observer of human thought and action. But in addition, one that has an obligation to do what one can, to stamp out ugliness, violence, injustice, inhumanity, and so many other wrongs that rear their heads in society from time to time.Yet, even with this extraordinary brilliance, clarity, and understanding of the human condition, like all great writers and great artists, he leaves the reader with a question. If clearly, it is his understanding of his personal duty, his personal philosophy to work to do what one can do, to end injustice, then why, is he, personally, always running away? As the book is a picture of one always on the move, always observing people, always changing venue, but wisely with great proficiency and efficacy, storing these experiences away as he seeks his understanding of the human condition; he is constantly yet on the move. And so, how does one work to stamp out injustice, if one is always running from the place he is at, and believes &quot;He can't go home again?&quot; This then becomes the challenge to the reader as well. And thus, the questions of the &quot;meaning of life&quot; are never fully answered. How really could they be?For those who wish to see an example of one man try to find those answers, with the clearest articulation I have ever seen in any book, one should read Wolfe's book as soon as possible. It reads moderately quickly, due to Wolfe's amazing clarity. And it does articulate many of the answers to many of the questions that all thinking people ask themselves as they go through life."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"I've been reading these other reviews and I've come to the conclusion that most of these folks just don't GET Wolfe. They keep talking about this being &quot;wordy&quot; and &quot;drawn-out&quot;. Hello..Thomas Wolfe could write three pages about a man staring out of a window and have me in tears, contemplating the meaning of life. He's rarely about the story. He's always about the beauty of the moment. For sheer power of description and fearless romantic vision no one has come close to Thomas Wolfe.No one moves me like he does."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"Wolfe weaves, very deliberately, in and out of images and situations from his own lost generation in this, his last novel, largely autobiographical. He was the most lyrical writer of his time, this book no exception, and although at times it's obvious he struggled with structure, Wolfe gives the reader the unique ability to truly understand each of his characters as multi-dimensional and on numerous levels. There's a bit of George Weber in all of us, searching for something we know we've either lost or never found, times when we feel alone, and the world is so large. If you've ever read Fitzgerald, you will enjoy this novel, and even if you haven't, you should. It's a timeless classic, with a theme so prevaliant in literature and society even today, and stated so clearly in the title."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"Before you read \\"You Can't Go Home Again,\\" make sure you have read \\"Look Homeward Angel.\\" Wolfe's novels are essentially romanticized autobiographies, and although Eugene Gant and George Weber are not exactly the same character, they both represent the author struggling with incredible but unfocused talent, trying to find his home in a world that is inhospitable to his genius. If you are at all the creative type, these books will resonate profoundly. If not, you might find them a little contrived. If you are *Southern*, you absolutely *must* read these books.It's honestly difficult to do justice to Wolfe's poetry with a simple review, but I can say that no Southern author even approaches his writing ability, save Faulkner. These two books form the literary pillars of my creative ego; they are at once tragically self-conscious and fervently optimistic. It's such a shame that Wolfe died young as he did.A final note--before reading the chapters about the party in New York, look up the artists Alexander Calder and Joan Mir&oacute;. You'll find that an otherwise hilarious scene is actually a scathing satire of contemporary art. If you at all share his sentiments, you'll have trouble staying in your chair."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"&quot;You Can't Go Home, Again&quot; is really not so much a work of fiction as an autobiography in which the names of characters have been changed. Wolfe seemed unapologetic about the baldly autobiographical nature of his work. However, some may perceive his autobiography as evidence of a certain lack of creative reach and an aversion to creative risk-taking on his part. Wolfe's life was so deeply and richly lived in a relatively short period and so lyrically written that his autobiography reads as vibrantly as fiction. There are moments when Wolfe is brilliant and dazzling in describing moments of almost biblical epiphany. I suppose it's a good thing for Wolfe that he dove so deeply into his own life as it was tragically brief but intensely experienced and elegantly articulated: he managed to cram a great deal into his short lifespan. Wolfe reads quite a bit like Proust and in this novel the sentences in some places are nearly as long as the syntax of Proust. Wolfe could well be considered the Proust of the American South. Writers will especially value this work and it pays to read to the end as Wolfe's last novel is particularly revealing in its power and optimism and lyricism at its close: &quot;What befalls man is a tragic lot. There is no denying this in the final end. But we must deny it all along the way. Mankind was fashioned for eternity.&quot; In the end Wolfe finds a comfortable home upon a promontory point in America's literary landscape. To understand the life of the writer in America at the outset of the 20th century during a Golden Age for the novel I recommend this worthy and enduring gem of that era."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"After reading Look Homeward Angel, I became enthralled by Thomas Wolfe's verbose use of the English language. I set out to discover another tittle by the famed North Carolina author. At first, I found the sure depth of You Can't Go Home Again daunting. But as I began to explore the pages that lie within, I found myself becomming increasingly drawn to Wolfe's new found literary style. It seemed that age had found him closer than ever to the ultimate perfection of his craft. The impurities of his first novels, which could easily be seen as the product of his feverish insecurities, have been all but erased. He takes the reader further into the heart of the English Language, than any other author of my experiences. Each sentence seems to leap forth from the page with true vigor and color. You feel as if you are being led through an elaborate tour, which spans the distance of the globe, while diving into the churning bowels of literature's purest potential. It does however, lack the keenly crafted story lines of today's market. It is obvious that Wolfe has taken little heed in fufilling the alleged requirements set by authors before his time. Instead the style that accompanies him throughout his domestic and foreign travels, and throughout the heart of his most rewarding and demanding personal relationships, is something wholly his own. It must be read to grasp, for its many pages span a plethro of subjects. It is for the reader who is looking for a work of art, which is true to the authors most profound, honest, and concise emmotions."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"This is the fourth, and last, of Wolfe's novels - which together make up a chronological account of his life, and the lives of his friends and his family, although all under pseudonyms. They were the only novels he ever wrote, and are all an utter delight to read. They can be read separately, they don't really work as a series in the proper sense of the word - but once you get hooked on Wolfe, you'll want to read them all. &quot;You Can't go Home Again&quot; is his best, in my opinion, and consists of several anecdotes, or short stories, which together make up a beautifully written, heart-achingly fine novel. This is the kind of stuff to make you want to run out on the street and tell people you love them. Passionately recommended. Check out the three preceeding novels, &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot;, &quot;Of Time and the River&quot; and &quot;The Web and the Rock&quot;."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"Thomas Wolfe was not a good novelist, but he was a GREAT writer. As I tell my American History students, no one ever put words together in the English language more beautifully than Wolfe. I've read through - at times skimmed through - all of his books. This is the only one I found interesting as a novel. BUT the prose-poetry which pervades everything he wrote is so extraordinary as to be heartbreaking. One reads and reads, and suddenly one encounters the most breathtaking passage, and then another, and another. In You Can't Go Home Again, the eloquence comes on virtually every page. And the conclusion, with Wolfe's paean to his former editor, Maxwell Perkins, and his reflections on our America, is overwhelming."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"What happens when you write a book that is so autobiographical that you not only alienate your entire hometown, but earn their hatred? &quot;You Can't Go Home Again&quot; is a very poignant tale that captures America between the time of the stock market crash of 1929 and the rumblings of WW2. Though the book drags out at times (an insufferable cocktail party seems to consume almost three chapters!), the excellent writing makes it all worthwhile.As one who did not experience the Great Depression and the rise of Nazi Germany firsthand, this book brought me closer to it than any history book could because these events were seen from the vantage point of ordinary people. The writer (George Webber) pens a successful novel about his hometown that so accurately portrays the scandalous activities of his townfolk that he becomes persona non grata. Shunned by his family and friends, he has a choice to make: Stay with his rich lover and her high-society friends in New York or make his own path in the world while retaining his artistic ability.His travels take him from Brooklyn to Europe, in particular, Germany where Adolph Hitler has taken power and he witnesses firsthand the disturbing changes that take place.The character development and fine prose more than compensate for the slow moving plot lines (which is why I gave it four stars instead of five). This is a good book for lazy summer reading. Not a book to rush or skim through. I was fascinated by the attention given to developing minor characters such as the Oriental sculptor neighbor or the friend from back home who was at the tail end of a professional baseball career. You will learn a lot about how ordinary people dealt with the Depression or the rise of the Nazis. You will see the sad but hopeful plight of Americans during the Depression and also the hopelessness that good people had in Germany when Adolph Hitler seized power. I look forward to reading more from Thomas Wolfe."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"To put it simply, You Can't Go Home Again is one of the best books I have read in my life. Wolfe writes with a beautiful, haunting and musical prose. The journey taken by George Webber, the book's protagonist, is that same journey that we all make. To create and grow and move forward cannot be done without moving away from one's past. The story of George Webber is the trunk of the book, off of which grow many different branches each of which reveal more and different things about Webber and his world. I cannot recommend this book enough, A classic for all times."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"This book could have been written in 50 pages, maybe 55. Thomas Wolfe, obviously, a gifted, talented writer who conveys a point using 25 similes where one would do. He is anti Hemingway. You can easily skip 20 pages anywhere in the book and not miss a thing of any importance. Characters are so over analyzed that you would think you grew up with them.It has a juicy beginning about a writer, George Weber, whose first book is published to rare reviews. The book is about corruption, petty politics, racism in small town in North Carolina and how the author exposes their hypocrisy. But he is heart broken when the town retaliates with venom as his comeuppance for telling the whole world their petty doings.Then the book drifts into his love affair with a married woman, his travel abroad, first to England and then to his favorite land, Germany. But dark clouds are on the horizon as his beloved Germany is falling in the hands of Nazis. His encounter with racism of a different kind as witnessed in a train journey from Berlin to Paris is narrated in heart wrenching detail.The book ends with an open letter to his best friend, his editor where the author pours his heart, a kin to a suicide note. Most believe this book is Wolf's autobiography. With all due respect I would rather read the other Tom Wolfe."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"Does anyone have the guts to evaluate honestly????

I realize we all have different opinions, mine is that the only reason one would claim to like this book is that they are 'cultured'...i have no specific comments to make because this novel has no redeeming thing about it (and because I read it 5 years ago and no way in hell am i going to go through that again just to give a fair review).

It is a dauntingly ambitious novel of massive scope that can at times seem overwhelming. The story follows George Webber, a young writer living in 1920's New York City. Webber is charismatic and realistic, full of all the insecurities and conflicts that define us all. He is socially awkward, hungry for fame but terrified of the spotlight, yet brilliant and driven. Over the course of the novel, Webber achieves fame and recognition, but also finds something greater within himself and in America. He wanders to England and Germany, living under Hitler's shadow. He sees injustice, death, love, hate, and returns to America with a new hope in his nation's promise.The huge scale of this novel can seem daunting, and Wolfe's writing is a never-ending stream of thought, jokes, critique, and revelations. The novel is saved and made truly engaging by Wolfe's incredible grasp of the English language. He is scary good at writing. Every line is fluid, conversational, and beautifully written. In the end, the engaging stories, near-poetic writing, and far-reaching themes combine to create a truly moving book. George Webber can never go home again, and neither can Wolfe. All we can do is press on with them and see what we can find."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"absolutely wonderful...surely one of the greatest novels to come out from America."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"This is an excellent piece of literature. I found it not only interesting to read with extremely lifelike characters, but it was extremely insightful and discussed many ideas that affect people. I found the character of George Webber to be one of the most lifelike characters in any book I've read, Wolfe's characterization is excellent. Throughout this book you see Webber grow and change as a person, I found that very interesting. I especially enjoyed book 6, which is about the nazi control in Germany. I found that to be a sad, yet extremely interesting portion of the book because it shows to some degree what the German citizens felt about the nazi control. As a whole, I enjoyed the book very much. I only gave it 4 stars because it was a bit too wordy, the plot dragged in spots and Wolfe discussed some ideas in far too much detail. However despite that I still found it to be an excellent novel."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"Just like Look Homeward, Angel, this book tell a story of Wolfe, thus - a story of a true artist, an ideal of what a writer is or should be. It's huge and its sentences span across the pages, but in its magnitude is its beauty. A conclusion to Wolfe's career, You Can't Go Home Again is a powerful testament to the spirit of writing, that never dies, never get dissolved in the mundane reality, that is always flowing like a river and blowing like the wind."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"While this is no \\"Anna Karenina\\", the book by Thomas Wolfe is definitely a cut above the ordinary. A wry and ascerbic humor pervade the book, which is very sharp and ornate in it's use of language, almost baroque, almost too much for my taste at first. As I navigated it's contents, however I became enamoured of this language, which was nothing if not characteristic of real and singular style.On substance, it delivered rather nicely also, and I was most struck by the enduring social themes, the great issues that confront society at an ethical and a moral level, and how very little attitudes had changed from the 1930's, when this book was written until the 1990's, when I had read it. For example, on the attitudes towards homosexuality, both by the enlightened and the aghast, as well as the roles that homosexuals played in society, as an object of scorn among many of the commonfolk, as well as an object of amusement and curiousity among the elite, seemed little changed in half a century - not really a hopeful lesson, but one that stuck with me, nevertheless about the glacial pace of social reform and the stubborn perpetuity of predjudice and ignorance, passed down from generation to generation.Well worth the read."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"It amazes me that the description of the book on the back cover of the edition I read (and the Amazon description on this site taken from it) is wrong. It states that \\"When he returns to that town he is shaken by the force of the outrage and hatred that greets him.\\" This doesn't happen at all! Webber had finished the book when he visited his hometown but it had not been published yet. He felt the wrath of his hometown via letters and phone calls later when he returned to New York. Did the publishers even read the book!?OK, got that off my chest. Regarding the book, a reader must be prepared to really work to finish this book. The writing often soars but there is only a semblance of a plot, and not enough to carry a casual reader. The 10-page passages describing particular characters are certainly in-depth, but ultimately unrelated to the story. I kept feeling that if I was reading this at the time it was published, I would recognize many of the characters as based on real people or common stereotypes of the day, but they were lost on me 65 years later.What somewhat salvaged this book for me, ironically, was Wolfe's analysis of society at a very difficult time -- the depression and the run-up to WWII -- set against our current atmosphere of failing banks and industries, recession, loss of freedoms, etc. His insights are as pertinent today as they were then."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"Wolfe is an extraneous writer. He wants to tell us about everything from the protoganist's deceased dog, buried three summers ago, to the aunt who died when he was a child. Each comes with a complete history. While some of these tangents of Wolfe's can be fascinating, most of the time it just slows the peice up and makes us want to move onto something faster, something with a better pace. With all this color, all these descriptions of extraneous subject matter, I think we as readers become blinded to the writing's main intentention.

Then just let the words ring out in my mind. Notice that Wolfe builds slowly like a symphony until there is a creshendo (sp?) moment and the emotion and the setting come together in a way that only a few writers can achieve. For instance in the cocktail party scene. George is observing all the urbane goofyness (hee hee) around him and you can tell he is repulsed and drawn to the peoople at the same time. This dissonance exsists in him and it really drives him mad. We see him get very melodramatic in his mental ramblings until the party no longer exsists. He is asking the eternal questions and the answers just wont come. O! George you are a serious fellow! Till by the end of it all he throws his hands heavenward in despair and rage. Then bam! we are back and we see our boy standing in the middle of the party in this pose. . That is great stuff. Never equaled. Never done better. It blilds and builds and then well.

But it is a book that must be read word by word, no skimming. And it is not an easy book to read. Wolfe writes prose; a dozen words to describe what one author would take two. But if you are willing to make the effort it is a beautiful story (autobiographical) of a man from a small town who becomes an author and writes of this town. He returns to find all is not what it was and some didn't appreciate his writing about them. Hence you can't go home again."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"This one of those rare books that once you get into it you are captivated. Wolfe's character developement and descriptions are his greatest atributes as an author. His desription of the Japanese man that lived in his building is so poignant. The cockney accent of the woman who was his maid while living in England was one of the best ever written as well as humorous. I felt as if I had met these characters personally. I encourage everyone to read this book or get the book on tape. Do not miss this Great American Classic. I read this book ten years ago and I have never forgotten it."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"Mr. Thomas Wolfe had courage. The courage to attempt showing every ounce of his personal experience in the pure, naked, and sometimes brutal light of truth. This he did with a just hand toward both the the extraordinary and the mundane alike. Extraordinary experiences, especially those well written, will be read by most any literate person they are presented to, but when an author plunges into the world of the mundane, the realistic and dry fabric of every-day reality, he looses audience. It is a shame too, for a fresh, intelligent, and honest perspective of the every-day experiences in life which are taken for granted can renew our appreciation for our own lives and cause us to look at what we may have been missing all this time; the infinite variability of experience that makes us individuals.This book looks into our hearts--into the heart of America, and askes each of us who reads it, &quot;What will you do now to make us better--to make us whole?&quot;."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"this is the single most beautiful and honest literary piece i have ever known. it is simply stunning and true. If you are the kind of person who just wants a story, a plot, then this book is not for you. The message is not in the story but in the journey. In each sentence there is the beauty of clear and simple truth. Thomas wolfe, that beautiful, kind and brilliant man, poured his soul into this book and that makes it so much more than just a story."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"As I read Thomas Wolfe's novel, I was struck by how relevant the book is to present-day America. While the novel is a commentary on pre and post Depression America, it is a most uncomfortable reminder that we have failed to move very far as a country and society in the last 60-70 years. As wolfe wrote: \\"...it is not only (the) outward forms that we must look to find the evidence of a nation's hurt. We must look as well at the heart of guilt that beats in each of us, for there the cause lies...and if we do not look and see it, we shall be damned together.\\" (p. 312, hard cover)How very prophetic it is that today as a nation we have gone blind to what we are doing to other people in the world and to ourselves. Wolfe sets the stage early in the book as he draws the verbal picture of the man at the window of \\"The Distributing Corporation.\\" He never moves, he does nothing but stare. He notices nothing. It is like an Edward Hopper painting depicting detachment. For Wolfe it is a metaphor for a country that has lost its soul.This is a must read as a source for gaining a glimpse at the America of the Past and the America of the Present."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"Let's see now ... have you bought in to the \\"PowerPoint,\\" bullet-ed, \\"concise\\" notion of literature (i.e., stupid, undeveloped, soul-less notion of expressing what it is to be human?) --In THAT case, you will find the works of Thomas Wolfe (as you find the works of Marcel Proust or Thomas Mann) a great big bore. Otherwise ... you will NOT find them a bore; but the very opposite of a bore:--a source of inspiration, of joy, of excitement, of the quintessence of life."},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","review":"This book was an upper and a downer for me. It's an upper because Wolfe does an outstanding job when it comes to character development. Sure, some readers don't have the patience or interest to get into the descriptions of background characters in a novel, but Wolfe really paints such a beautiful portrait of those that stand out in George Webber's mind. These characters really caught my attention, and the novel leaves me wanting more in the sense that Wolfe draws you in to the lives of these interesting characters, then ups and leaves them behind, not to mention that he leaves them behind during historical turning points.But I think that Wolfe wants us to feel this way about the characters because the main idea in this story, which for me is the downer, is that the mind's eye is tricky, and when we reflect on the past with the mind's eye, it deceives us into thinking the past is better than it really was. We see this with Webber's disappointment when returning to Libya Hill. He was so excited to see the town of his childhood, only to find it a shell of what it used to be. Most people can relate to this event. I know I can. I remember my hometown being so unique and special, and then returning to my unique hometown to find that the specialness about it is gone and replaced with Lowe's and Best Buys. So when I go home to visit my family, I can't go home again. Same thing happens when Webber goes to Germany and sees it for what it really is when he was going there with the romantic idea of what it once was. It's so sad that with time, we all become so pessimistic. So I think he developed these characters so intricately to a point so that we have fond feelings for them while Wolfe protects us from what they really are and what they really become. At the point in which Wolfe leaves the characters, they are interesting and beautiful and perfect.Overall, the story was bittersweet but captivating. The characters themselves were the heart and soul of this novel, and it is an endearing and thought provoking read."},{"Title":"Orson Welles: A Biography","review":"There are many biographies of Orson Welles but only one was written with his cooperation. Welles never wrote his autobiography past his childhood, so along with This Is Orson Welles, this is all we have to judge his life from, using his words. Despite the book's many flaws, most glaringly without details about many of Welles's most important films and with only bar and the fact that Leaming does seem to be very obsequious toward her subject, it still captures much of his personal life, especially with Rita Hayward. Overall, the book is intoxicating and a very compelling read considering the many other biographies about Welles, most of which are full of hyperbole and outright lies about the man, his life and his work.To get the best idea of Welles, read this book along with This Is Orson Welles, to get an idea about Welles's ideas about his movie and stage careers, Citizen Welles which is a fair overview of his life without hyperbole and Whatever Happened to Orson Welles, which focuses on Welles's career from the 1960s to his death. All of which add up to get a real picture of this man who created some of the greatest films of the 20th century and wanted to be a mystery above all other things."},{"Title":"Orson Welles: A Biography","review":"On the whole an entertaining read but Leaming's gossip-column style and unabashed idolatry grate before long. Leaming saves her best prose not for Welles' legendary charm or artistic genius, but for his various appendages. &quot;The only way to make the plane was to hitchhike,&quot; Leaming writes, &quot;but when Orson extended the long tapered thumb of his extraordinarily beautiful hand, the only vehicle to stop was a garbage truck, into which Welles and company promptly crowded.&quot; Such flourishes, as well as the index, which is surprisingly clever--under Welles, (George) Orson there is an entry entitled &quot;false noses used by 350, 353, 401, 424&quot; are the gravy on this meat loaf of a book. Eat up!"},{"Title":"Orson Welles: A Biography","review":"Orson Welles was a genius of a film director, actor, producer, writer, and anything else he wanted to do but it didn't mean that he wasn't difficult. On the contrary, his genius may have allowed him to be a difficult man in real life. Even though he left an enormous legacy in his films, he was the master and is still regarded by directing one of the most highly regarded films in cinema history, Citizen Kane, loosely based on Randolph William Hearst and his life. Barbara Leaming's biography is more towards praising him while he was still alive rather than berating his behavior at times. This biography might be the kindest of Orson Welles around. While there are other books about Welles, this book is well worthy of reading anyway. Orson Welles was a remarkable man whose legacy can never really be outdone."},{"Title":"Orson Welles: A Biography","review":"June 10, 2002The first problem with Barbara Leaming's biographyof Orson Welles is that it principally relies onthe absolute worst source imaginable: Orson Welleshimself. Anyone who knows the details of Welles'slife, career and character even a little knows thatthe man was a liar. Not a malicious one, to besure--his was more of a child's capacity forprevarication, born out of equal parts insecurityand need for attention--but a liar nonetheless.The second problem is that while Leaming is aserviceable writer, she is not particularly worldly.She's certainly not objective. She seems to belongto that cosmetically clever but ultimately narrowbreed of communicators: the gossip monger. Sheloves anecdotes, and swallows Orson's whole.All the requisite facts are in this book, but otherWelles biographies have served the man and his artbetter. The single greatest irony about this bookis how smarmy, superficial and childish its subjectcomes off in this, the work of his most flatteringbiographer.It's too easy to spot Welles toying with Leaming,and he doesn't come off very charming or impressiveby extension. He sees her coming from too far offand feeds her lots of junk, too much of which sheprinted."},{"Title":"Orson Welles: A Biography","review":"I have read several books about Orson Welles, including biographies, critical reviews and essays. What sets this volume apart is the biographer had complete access to Welles and the cooperation of his many associates.While the biography is thorough, some readers may complain that it is not entirely free of meandering. Of course, others may argue that the digressions on the part of Welles may be the best parts. Too many people recall Welles as the overweight commerial pitchman for Paul Masson wines and as a late night television guest. I was surprised to learn, therefore, that the first book that Welles (as a high school student) authored was a popular instructional manual for coaches on successful basketball techniques! Leaming reminds us that in his prime, Welles was a handsome and much sought after celebrity who managed to conduct romances with many of Hollywood's top female stars. Thrice married, Welles' most notable bride was Rita Hayworth. He also struggled against considerable odds to produce a dozen motion pictures inside and outside of the studio system while begging for the funds to complete his projects.Welles was a prolific writer who continually revised his scripts (much to his producers' dismay), punched out a syndicated newspaper column and produced a novel. Contrary to critic Pauline Kael's influential essay, Welles did have a hand in writing the screenplay of \\"Citizen Kane.\\"Great fun."},{"Title":"Orson Welles: A Biography","review":"Barbara Lemmings' biography on Orson Welles is one of the most gripping accounts of the late, famousradio, tv and screen personality. It delves deeply into his youth and life before he shocked the worldwith Citizen Kane. The most fascinating aspect of this book is that it was written with the assistance ofWelles, therefore it is almost an autobiography with areas and events fleshed out by Welles' contemporaries,business associates and friends. Hearing Welles comment on events in his life puts a different spin on thelegend and no doubt makes the reader rethink what ever opinions s/he had on Welles. One possible down side for filmbuffs is that production information on Welles' films is scantly touched on, but considering this book is abouthis life as whole, not just the brillinat films he intermitantly made, one shouldn't be too disappointed. Oneexcellent point of the book is the production detail in which Welles' final film, The Other Side of the Wind, a possible masterpiecewas put together, then unceremoniously taken away from him and lost (which is the story of his entire film directing career) to the world. After finishing the text, one willbe left with a sense of wonder, sadness and disappointment in regards to Welles' life which turns out to be tragic in nature"},{"Title":"Orson Welles: A Biography","review":"I have always been a fan of Orson Welles on radio and television. Having collected a ton of radio broadcasts on CD and audio cassette and having watched most of his movies, I appreciate the genius of his work. I picked up a copy of this book recently and am amazed at the amount of research put into it. An aspect of Welles rarely discussed is his magic career. At the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention this September in Aberdeen, Maryland, I plan to attend the presentation about Orson Welles and his magic career so I can watch rare footage and films with Welles, and get an even deeper insight to his trickery. Book comes recommended."},{"Title":"Orson Welles: A Biography","review":"Sifting through hundreds of hours of personal interviews with the enigmatic Orson Welles in the years before his death, Barbara Leaming presents an uneven and obsequious biography. She is entirely dependent on her interviews of Welles for the bulk of her work and seems to have spent little time in developing differing views on Welles. Perhaps Welles, who always wanted to dominate his surroundings, found Miss Leaming compliant and ready to write the biography Welles desired.The author succeeds best in painting a picture of the rise of Orson Welles. His mother, Beatrice, not only introduced young Welles to Chicago's artsy society, but to her friend Da Da Bernstein, who considered Welles to be a prodigy at an early age. Bernstein was Welles' first mentor. As a teen, Welles was sent to the artsy Todd School and acquired another mentor, the drama teacher Roger \\"Skipper\\" Hill. Soon, Welles' career on stage rocketed and he landed on Broadway at 18 acting and producing. He was a wonder. On top of this, his powerful, distinctive voice landed him on radio, where he made his money, leading to the radio caper of \\"The War of the Worlds\\". Hollywood called and \\"Citizen Kane\\" and \\"The Magnificent Ambersons\\" soon followed.But Welles' career stumbled afterwards. Very few of his movies made money. His directorships of movies were erratic and his relationships with the studio bosses were desultory. Thus, Welles became a vagabond director and actor and often had to use his acting salary to supplement production costs of HIS movies. Always scambling for production money, what he did produce after World War Two were generally fly-by-night, patchwork movies, most of which were unmarketable. His career had peaked by his mid-twenties. By the end of his life, he was reduced to audio voiceovers and a three year stint endorsing Paul Masson wines of which he was fired for his arrogant meddling in the production of the spots. Welles always had to be in charge and bridled when under the authority of others.Miss Leaming leaves out details of Welles' career that he seems not to have wanted to discuss with her. For instance, Welles' acting in \\"Jane Eyre\\", \\"The Third Man\\" and \\"The Long, Hot Summer\\" receive less space in this book than Welles' poodle, KiKi. To a very annoying degree, the author interjects herself often in this book and in great depth. This biography is a case of a self-absorbed woman writing about a man who is even more self-absorbed."},{"Title":"The Kimono Inspiration: Art and Art-To-Wear in America","review":"This book is an art book, like the kind you can buy at art galleries.

The kimono already IS art to wear. It doesn't need to be dragged down by modernization.But that is not my only problem with this book. In the history section, written by Toshiki Wada, the editing is so bad that spelling mistakes are made and repeated. Also, Miss Wada needs to pick up a history book sometime very soon. Her grasp on the history of Japanese clothing is tenuous at best and the more bad history sections she writes (like this one and the one in &quot;Shibori&quot;), the more misinformation she disseminates to the English-speaking public.Ignore any historical information on the kimono written or &quot;edited&quot; by Wada.

If you don't break for lunch (or maybe even if you do)you will finish the 322 pages of this book before dinner. You will enjoy the reparte between the characters, you will wonder why Meredith Patton, age 15, is so determined to run away from a home that would seem to offer wealth and security, you will fall in love with a dog named Rosie and you will quickly figure out that you should not underestimate or mess with Ms. Sunny Randall.

This book reworks older, better Parker themes. Sunny is neither believable nor interesting. For once the prose drags and the dialog never achieves clever repartee.

This leads Sunny through attempts on her life and that of Millicent, and into eventually deciding the legal issues of who will face trial for their crimes and who will not. Although this veers us away from reality, Sunny is a wonderful character on a plain with Kinsey Milhone, V.I. Warshawski, and Kay Scarpetta.

Can't wait to see it in the movies."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"It is almost too easy to settle into Robert Parker's Spencer novels - a stolid, principled, tough and totally self sufficient PI with plenty of action and even some insight into the human condition. Not, however, particularly real. The surprisingly, pleasingly, first person feminine perspective has allowed Parker to explode the shell of imperviousness of Spencer's and seems to have liberated him to discuss the true nature of the common struggle. People live with contridictions and compromises and there is no such thing as the clear path to happiness. His protagonist &quot;Sunny&quot; is so much more complex and real than Spencer (tho I love Spencer and Hawk dearly). Sunny is imperfect, physically unimposing, non-self-sufficient and a completely captivating and exciting protagonist. &quot;Life is a bitch, and you work around it.&quot; Classic Parker - but sharper, closer to home. A great read and a step forward for one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"What fun this book was! My only complaint is that it was too short.

What this is, is what I hope is only the first book of a whole new series.Meet Sunny Randall, a tough but feminine Boston PI with an artistic soul and a Mob-connected ex-husband who she still loves but can't live with. Sunny has a great loft, a charming dog-child named Rosie with whom I am completely infatuated, and a fearless gay pal named Spike who not only cooks but rides shotgun when necessary. When Sunny is hired by wealthy, jaded, ultra-snobbish Brock and Betty Patton to find their 15-year-old runaway daughter Millicent, it doesn't take her long to locate the child on the mean streets of Boston and liberate her from her pimp. But until the question of why Millicent chose to flee the known, i.e., a mansion with staff and all the amenities, for the harsh and ugly unknown is answered, Sunny has no intention of relinquishing the girl to her parents. Millicent isn't talking aside from refusing to set foot back in her parents' home. Sunny takes the girl home with her to think things through, but it isn't long before two armed thugs show up at her door, compelling Sunny to dispatch one of them with a shotgun. Sunny is forced to move in temporarily with Spike to ensure Millicent's safety while she tries to figure out who wants the girl dead and why.This book is not only a first-rate detective story, but is replete with themes of the effects of love, betrayal, loss, friendship, and forgiveness on the human (and canine) heart.Sunny Randall is as earnest and hardworking as Anna Pigeon and Kinsey Milhone, though she dresses better; as tough and straightforward as Kat Colorado and V. I. Warshawski; and as funny as Stephanie Plum and Carlotta Carlyle. She's a bright and welcome new star in the female detective arena. Please, Mr. Parker -- give us more!"},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"O.K., so the detective is a female and the sidekick is gay and the setting is Boston and there's a dog in the picture and a woman-at-the-edge being rescued has a familiar ring, but Sunny Randall is not quite Spencer with a sex-change operation. And Parker's prose is so pristine that maybe it wouldn't matter. But for a tough-guy (but sensitive) author who writes about a tough guy (but sensitive) detective to try things from a feminine perspective and pretty much get it right is both an accomplishment and worth a tip of the hate from a longtime Spenser fan. Much of the working out of the story does seem familiar but it still is well worth the read.

It strikes me that she would like to be just like Spenser when she grows up, but will probably never get there. The story line falls to closely to some of Parker's other novels. Were I not a die hard Spenser fan, I might have liked it better. If James Bond does not have to get old, neither does Spenser. I would also welcome another Jesse Stone book with more development of that character."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"First, I want to state I love Parker's books, most of the time. I've read just about everything he's written. However, the similarities between Sunny Randall and Spenser are just too numerous to make this enjoyable. This could have just as easily been a Spenser novel and it probably would have been better if it was. Parker wants to make Randall as competent as Spenser but when the going gets tough she has to turn to her male friends to help her out of jams. I'll probably pass on the next Sunny Randall novel if there is one. I think Parker has few peers when writing from the male point of view but when he turns to the female I think he could take some lessons from Sue Grafton."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Yes, it's an entertaining plot, but don't even begin to think that Sunny is really a woman - she is Spenser reincarnated without the personality or the wit or Hawk.

I prefer even some of the weaker Spenser novels to this one."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Obviously, Robert Parker can write. That's not the issue any more. But why does he choose to write the same book over and over again? Sorry, but just because Sunny is a woman, can't cook, and doesn't have a perfect romance doesn't make her that different from Spenser. She has the same &quot;moral code&quot; thing, for lack of a better term, and the whole Millicent rich runaway in distress from an unloved family is Paul Giacomin all over again, not to mention the one Parker did a few years ago, I forgot which book, as they tend to blur.I appreciate that Parker is branching out, with Sunny and Jesse Stone, as Spenser does become a bit perfect at times, as a character. But for better or worse, this is run-of-the-mill Parker.

We have Spenser, Jesse Stone and now Sunny Randall. FAMILY HONOR is the first in the series with Sunny Randall, private Boston PI, former cop; sound familiar. There are lots of similarities but this is vintage Parker and a very fun character and read. Sunny in this opener must find a missing teen from a wealth family, probably now a prostitute.

It was the worst book I've ever read. I finished it because I couldn't believe it was as boring and shallow as it was and thought, hoped it might change. Some men can write from a woman's point of view, but this author cannot or did not in this book. I feel he wrote it while watching a crime drama on TV. Nothing new, interesting. The dialogue was the most trivial and boring I've ever read in a book. The characters were flat, shallow and full of the Boston cynicism that is reason I left Boston. All the softness, love and caring was focussed on the dog. People are afraid to show themselves. I wouldn't want to meet any of the characters or the author!"},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Okay, all true Parker fans know that he only knows how to write a couple kinds of characters. So I expected Sunny Randall to act and sound a lot like Spenser (and Jesse Stone, and Philip Marlowe in Parker's rendition of Raymond Chandler). I also expected a Hawk-like character; no one is fooled by the fact that Spike is white and gay. If that had been the only problem with this book, it would have been okay - Spenser and Hawk aren't bad characters to repeat. But the mystery was disappointing. Why is it assumed that all 15-year-old girls who run away from home are hooking? Or that her parents are to blame? Sunny takes these facts for granted, and it spoils the book's believability. Does anyone else recall poor April Kyle, rescued by Spenser in two different novels? Hey - maybe Sunny read those books too. Maybe they're required reading for a PI license in Boston. Come on, Mr. Parker - show us some imagination. We all believe you have one."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"It read like a merger between the Spenser novelsEarly AutumnandCeremony, (especiallySpenser: Ceremony, since Spike sounds like the same one in the aforementioned TV movie) but spun it around by making Spenser a short blonde woman who only got into the business to pay the bills between painting sales. Setting it in the same universe as Spenser and Jesse Stone did make it entertaining, and made me wonder if Parker'll ever do a crossover between all three."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"I am a great fan of Robert Parker's work but was disappointed by Family Honor. The story is similar to Early Autumn which Parker wrote in 1981. In Early Autumn Spenser is the detective and the child in trouble is Paul. The female detective in Family Honor is almost exactly like Spenser and the child in trouble is very much like Paul. It was an interesting story, but I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't read Early Autumn. If you read Family Honor and like it then read Early Autumn. You will love it."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"I read everything Parker writes and was delighted with his new protagonist Sunny Randall. Unlike Grafton and Evanovich who have created likable but semi competent characters, Sunny is as tough as Spenser himself. Now the ending is better than some other good books like &quot;The Firm&quot;, for example, but the Mafia sequence at the end was not convincing and why in the world did Parker want to save a totally miserable charachter like Betty Patton?"},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"I did'nt have great expectations for this book-after all Robert Parker as a writer has been coasting for years. His Spencer novels, while sometimes enjoyable, are so formulaic and predictable that they represent nothing more than the author's laziness and dearth of ideas. So, even though my expections were low, I was still amazed at the shoddiness of this book. It reads like it's nothing more than a obvious attempt to cash in on the female slueth segment of the market. All the parts are there; the character traits and habits that are supposed to make the heroine a unique and interesting person, the 1st person dialogue, the flip comments, the terse dialogue. Parker has done it before and with more style and craft. It is also rather insulting (and a sign of the author's lack of imagination) to realize that the major elements of the plot have been lifted from one of Parker's earlier Spenser novels (longtime fans will recognize it immediately). I've read Robert Parker since the early 1980's and I miss the wit and drive of his earlier books. The last several years seem to be ones of repitition and sameness with the only motivation being monetary. I frankly wish Parker would retire from writing genre fiction and not further sully the earlier better work he has done."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"I'm sorry, but this is the worst Robert B. Parker novel I have ever read! I am sorry that I spent the money on the paperback. I loved the Spenser novels, I even loved Night Passage with Jesse Stone, but this book was pedestrian, right from the start. The dialogue was so predictable, I could practically guess what Sunny was going to say. The characters were underdeveloped with no real depth. There was no thrill or excitement at the end of the book, like in the rest of Mr. Parker's novels. All I know is that I will be getting the next book he writes from the library!"},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"It seems to me that all Parker did was give Spenser a sex change operation and name him/her Sonny. Save your money. The best thing about this book is the dog, Rosie, at least she's the one that Parker talks about the most. Give me Spenser, anyday."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Parker introduces a new character, only she's not new. It's Spenser as a short female PI. She has Spenser's sense of humor, but is deeply imbued with Susan Silverman's consuming self-interest. The woman are all selfish (...). And she spews cliches made popular by the many Spenser books preceding it. Event he story line is merely a rehash of Early Autumn (one of Parker's finest). All in all, a disappointment."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"I enjoyed reading this Parker almost as much as I did the first time I read it-with Spenser as the detective! A pleasant time passer but can't we have something equal to Rachel Wallace again?"},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Yes, Sunny Randall is Spenser in a dress. But, it's not so much that the characters are the same, or that the plot is the same (which they are) it's that the /writing/ is the same. And we love that writing. The same witty dialogue. That same quick read. Those same kind of characters -- interesting, witty, and always sharp dressers. You can always tell who is a bad guy in Parker's novels -- they're the ones that dress badly. Richie and Spike (two of the men in Sunny's life) are worth the price of admission. If you are a Parker junkie (like me) buy it now. Otherwise, wait for it to come out in paperback or wait for the movie."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Family Honour is a good read for the devoted Spenser fan.

Sunny is a character perfectly capable of standing on her own, any comparison with Spenser aside. Her life is far from perfect and her ethics convenient enough to accomodate the unpleasant people she is dealing with, but her confusion and compromises ring very true to me and probably to many other women in my age group. Hard to believe she's written by a man.I sat in the library and read &quot;Family Honor&quot; cover-to-cover and enjoyed every minute of it. Sunny is likeable, honorable and very human, the plot is, as ever, fascinating, and as a Bull Terrier breeder and owner, I can tell you that Rosie is a masterpiece of true representation. I have this Mini Bull named Archie who is dying to meet her.If I'm looking for a complete escape, I can always count on Parker to take me right into another world for a good two hours, and be sure that I'll totally enjoy the trip."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Parker's new detective, Sonny Randall, is a Boston Private Eye of the female persuasion. Her cryptic responses and abrasive manner do not amuse as would the same comments from Spenser or Hawk. Cohorts Spike and Richie are great new characters, but Sonny's enchantment with the adolescent runaway is unfathomable. The flattened affect and apathy generated by this juvenile would alienate a lesser being. Parental abuses and undoing are too contrived.. All in all, this is not as comfortable a read as Parker's customary endeavors. Furthermore, Rosie is no Pearl the Wonder Dog."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"I was a bit reluctant at first to pick this one up, but in the end I am glad I did. It's a quick read, some humorous moments and references to a 200lb boxer with a broken nose. The only thing wrong with the book is the lack of an original plot. If you're a fan of Robert Parker, by all means you must have this one in your library. If you're a first time Parker reader, after reading this book, pick up either &quot;Night Passage&quot; or if you want the same plot different main character, try &quot;Thin Air&quot;.

I devour all of the Parker &quot;Spenser&quot; novels, delighting in his alliance with Hawk. The dialogue of those books is peerless, especially the repartee between those two.

I devoured this book in one sitting.However, when Sunny Randall encores, I'm hoping Parker will be kind enough to grant us a plot line he hasn't used (and, re-used) in his past offerings.Summary: typical Parker: a quick read; fun and mildly humorous; character (rather than plot) driven; if you've read one, you've read them all."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"While I am a die hard Spenser fan, I can grow to very much appreciate Sunny Randall and her crew (Richie &amp; Spike). I found the book to be written in the typical Parker style - witty and funny one liners and great character build ups, and of course having the plot take place in and around the Boston area is just icing on the cake. I appreciated learning more about who Tony Marcus is and what makes him tick. While this book reminded me of Thin Air, it was just different enough to have kept me turning the pages (I read it in one day). The only bad thing about Family Honor (as I find with all Parker books) is when I'm finished - and it usually takes me no more than two days to read his books, is I have now got to wait XXX months before a new one comes out. Please keep writing the Spenser novels and if it not asking too much, come out with at least two books (Spenser, Jesse or Sunny) a year."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"As a long time fan of Parker's Spenser novels I was curious to see how he would handle writing with the voice of a female protagonist. I found this book to be quite entertaining with the trademark Parker dialogue which always make his books such an easy read. Let's face it, Parker's books are wonderful brain candy not The Name of the Rose or The Celestine Prophecy and I'm about to commit heresy on Amazon by saying I was hesitant to buy this book in hardcover so I got it out of the library. I think Parker books are always best savored in paper back because you're talking about a mere 2-3 day commitment. I think we're in the Getting to Know Sunny Randall stage of the game in terms of this character as well as her sidekicks. I'm hoping that Parker has plans to flesh out these characters in subsequent outings. I thought Parker scored with Sunny's dilemmas over whether or not to ask for male assistance in some of her confrontations. I thought that a very realistic touch but are we going to be treated to Felicity-like agonizing over Richie vs. Brian vs. God Knows Who in the next book? With a so-so movie you wait for the video, with a so-so book you wait for the paperback. Wait for the paperback or visit your library on this one but once you get it in your hands sit back and escape, you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"I don't normally read airport books but this one caught my eye in LAX among all the other hyped up best-seller production line flotsam. I had never even heard of Robert B Parker,... but no matter.The plot follows the efforts of female private eye Sunny Randall to find out why a teenage daughter disappeared from a powerful Boston family. It has enough twists to keep the pages turning eagerly, the characters may not reach Tolstoy depths but there's enough texture and flavor to hit archetypal buttons and the writing overall is professional and enjoyable. It all resolves to a believably gritty but positive conclusion, give or take a few corpses. The high-minded conflict between white hats and black hats ends up nicely smudged, just like in real life.Above all, I found Family Honor warm-hearted and Sunny Randall a likeable and mostly credible heroine. These days, I'm steering clear of entertainments that leave me feeling bleak, however compelling they may be. I rate Family Honor as a good buy and my appetite is now whetted for some of the other Parker books that other reviewers rate even higher."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Robert Parker has done something that no mystery writer has ever done before, to my knowledge: He has turned his hero into a heroine. Sunny is clearly Spenser and vice versa. You can change the characters, but you cannot change the authors. For those who are enjoying the powerful trend toward female detectives, this is particularly interesting because it sheds light on perceptions about women. How would a woman go about accomplishing what a man would in a violent, tough world? I found the contrast to be interesting and stimulating. On the other hand, I am not sure I want to read two series about Spenser. More troubling is that Parker has Sunny rely on her mob connections through her ex-husband a lot. It seemed to me that he crossed an ethical line along the way that was unnecessary, and sets a bad example. Parker seems to suggest that the female Spenser can only make it if men help a lot, including the most corrupt men on the planet. Frankly, that is offensive to me. After all, much detection these days can use modern methods to search out answers, such as computer-based research. Why not create a real female detective for his next book? I think it would sell better and be more rewarding for readers like me. I also thought the plot was a little thin for Parker. At one point he assumes that the mob has gone so public that you can look them up like anyone else to find out exactly what they are doing. I doubt if that is, has been, or ever will be the case. Read this one for curiosity value if you are a Spenser fan, not because it is a mystery you would have otherwise picked up."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"As a reader with only a passing knowledge of the Spencer series, I found Family Honor to be a refreshing, fun read. I give much of the credit to Andrea Thompson, the perfomer of the unabridged tape who does a terrific job of maximizing the impact of Parker's one liner's and other humorous (if sometimes cynical) asides. Thompson and Parker combine to create Sunny, a nice addition to the ranks of the female P.I. As a detective, she's not all that unusual. It's as a person that Parker has created a person that I'd really like to spend time with. She's smart but has just the right levels of vulnerability. I could live without the dog, but I'm not much a of dog person.The underlying mystery (and it's solution) isn't exceptional but is interesting enough to keep this reader involved. A fifteen year old has run away from home. Finding out why she's run is ultimately more of a mystery than finding the girl herself. It brings in a mix of Boston high society, state politics and some local mob wars. Sunny's ex-father-in-law proves handy. There's a bit of romance too.Bottom-line: May be redundant for long time Spenser fans but a very enjoyable read for this new fan of Parker's work."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Yes, there's similarity to Parker's \\"Early Autumn\\" in that the detective sort of adopts a teenager who's aimlessly floating around, and yes, bits of the dialogue are identical to Spenser dialogue, but that's not really sufficient to take away from the enjoyment of this book.Sunny isn't really a female Spenser. She's less comfortable dealing with the gangster connections than Spenser is. While she's a good shot, she doesn't seem to be a true physical match for the bad guys.In this first outing, she's hired to find a missing 15 year old daughter, but on finding her also discovers that she'll be in considerable danger if she's returned to her family. The story goes on from there. We meet Tony Marcus who we know from Spenser books. And a flip remark is made at one point which indicates that Sunny knows of Spenser and his reputation.Parker likes to throw in little teasers. When we realize that the girl and her mother will each likely be visiting psychologists, we can't help wondering if one of them won't end up with that lady counsellor we know so well. After all, this is set in Boston.There's bound to be a bit of a tie-in with other Parker series and therefore, I recommend reading all Parker stories in sequence."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Robert Parker has a winner with his new detective, Sunny Randall, a divorced, former cop turned Boston P.I. who owns a miniature bull terrier and really wants to be a professional painter.

In the process, she gets help from her ex-husband Richie, the son of a mobster and her dearest friend, Spike, a colorful, tough gay man. Together this threesome make things happen. Parker has put together a terrific and memorable cast of characters and has no equals when it comes to his witty one-liners and irreverent dialogue. The story is fast paced and entertaining with a strong climax and satisfying ending. Sunny Randall is a fresh new character and hopefully, we'll be seeing more of her in the future."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Sunny and Richie were married for nine years. They had had a house in Marblehead. Richie refused the house. Sunny wrapped her paintings in order to move her things. Her mother said she was disappointed. Her father offered to help with a divorce or with whatever she needed. Families offer protection to their members. Protection is the theme of Parker's story.Sunny was a cop, her father was a cop. Richie resembled her father although he came from a crime family. Sunny moved to investigation and then to private investigation. She is hired to find a teenage runaway. The mother seems too perfect. Sunny is pursuing an MFA nights. She still paints and lives in a loft. The missing girl, Millicent, attended a girls school. The school provided a classical education. Millicent had been missing for ten days. At the school she had no friends, no interests, no achievements.Sunny discovered that Millicent had been to a youth shelter. The person running the shelter said that the kids seemed to have equal measures of defiance and guilt. Sunny needs her ex-husband's help to get her into areas of activity to find Millicent, (Milly). Sunny finds the girl through the connections that Richie Burke makes available to her. Since Milly isn't talking convincingly, Sunny has the the girl move in with her.It develops that others are looking for the girl. They have to go to the mattresses and move to a friend's apartment in the South End. An interesting subtext in the story is that families teach its members how to function, and that no one seems to have taken any time to teach Milly how to function.Parker writes that in Boston organized crime is an oxymoron. There are loose groups. When Sunny returns to her loft, she finds that it had been tossed. The insurance company sends a clean up team to the loft. Sunny is able to identify her primary interest as keeping the girl safe. Through the intervention of Richie Sunny could return to her loft and begin to solve the mystery. This is a strong and enjoyable effort by Robert Parker, writing from his strengths such as knowledge of the Boston environs and police networking."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"This was a great read even though the plot wasn't up to Parker's best, suspense wise. However, the characters he introduces are fun and compelling to read about and easy to get to know.I disagree with some other comments here that this parallels &quot;Thin Air.&quot; I see a direct parallel between Sunny and her teen age protaganist, and Spenser and Paul G. in &quot;Early Autumn.&quot; In both &quot;Family Honor&quot; and &quot;Early Autumn&quot; the young people are saved by the hero/heroine and a relationship developes which transcends the immediate case (book).

She is also a painter and pursuing a degree in the fine arts. The parents of Millicent Patton, a fifteen-year-old girl who has run away from home, hire her. Sunny immediately realizes that all is not well in the Patton household, as there seems to be no great concern or passion in her parents regarding her disappearance. It is also clear that Millicent is probably hooking to stay alive, as there is very little else that she can do.Although she is reluctant to seek his aid, Sunny asks Richie to help her locate Millicent, which turns out to be rather easy. Once Millicent is found, Sunny finds herself becoming a parent to Millicent and when two men arrive at Sunny's apartment, she blows one away with a shotgun while dressed in nothing but a silk robe that flows in awkward and revealing ways. There are many characters in the story, Spike the gay man who dresses like a dandy but is as deadly as a venomous snake. Mobsters and vicious killers are everywhere, and she actively seeks out their assistance, talking with then as an equal. Sunny also makes friends with cops, eventually having intimate relations with one.While she is female, Sunny shares many characteristics with Spenser; one of Parker's other great P. I. characters. She is sentimental and emotionally entangled much beyond what her job requires. Spike is very similar to Hawk of the Spenser series, a dear friend who stands by her even in the face of danger and without pay. Nevertheless, the combination of similarities and differences makes it a great story worthy of the Parker tradition of deadly sentimentalists."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Andrea Thompson, the pretty actress who was on NYPD BLUE for a season or two, does a worthwhile read.I just finished it--the abridged audio version--and wanted to send her a compliment.So this obscure review place will immortally do it.Her urban voice is pure sexiness, and complements Mr. Parker's intriguing composition.**The plot is interesting private \\"pussy\\" fodder, rather than private \\"dick\\" shtick, and Andrea makes this P.I.

No question, Parker is always a fun read, but this time around (you male readers may not understand this) he truly proves his skill. To step out of one's own skin and speak for a fictional character is the test and job of an author,but to accomplish this while stepping out of one's gender as well, shows extraordinary ability.

I'm not sure why that is, but it might have something to do with being bitter that they have spent time on something OTHER than the series that I so desperately love. However, Parker's newest is almost the same exact creation as Parker's oldest (Spenser). The protagonist is a PI in Boston who will work for free if the case merits the generosity. The protagonist also has the exact same sharp and witty personality as Spenser. The only real difference is that this new PI is a woman. And she can't cook. At all. Other than that, it's essentially a Spenser novel and man-oh-man does that make me happy. Two series for the price of one! Yahoo! So, if you're a Spenser fan, check it out. The plot is a LOT like one of the plots in an old Spenser novel, but who the heck cares? It's great!"},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Defining \\"family\\" these days depends on what person you ask and in what circumstances he or she lives. Trying to describe \\"Family Honor\\" presents the same difficulties for this reviewer and for the heroine, Sunny Randall, whose concept of \\"family\\" changes with her company... From her relationship with her mismatched parents, to that with her Mafia-connected ex-husband, Richie, to her single life with her friends, dog (Rosie) and painting, Sunny is a thoroughly modern gal-about-Boston, wearing a mask of self-assurance and independence but often losing it when confronted with being totally alone and without \\"family\\".In the aftermath of her divorce (resulting from her work as a cop conflicting with Richie's \\"family\\" relations), she becomes a private detective. She is hired by Brock and Betty Patton, a wealthy, affluent couple, to find their teenage, runaway daughter, Millicent. Finding Millie \\"hooking\\" and in danger from powerful thugs, Sunny becomes her bodyguard, supporting Millie's refusal go home and believing that she escaped the Patton household as a matter of self-preservation, not as an act of teenage rebellion. Getting to know a vulnerable Millie and seeing the damage inflicted by her aloof, dysfunctional parents exposes Sunny to unexpected emotions and her own fragility, regarding her own notions of \\"family\\". With her own life in danger trying to protect Millie, Sunny enlists her friends (and their shady connections) and her ex-husband's \\"family\\" to unearth a ambition-fueled conspiracy, based on sex, lies and photographs, with far-reaching political and social implications.Many reviewers have expressed dismay at Robert B. Parker for trying to make a female Spenser or for creating a lead character who is not Spenser. \\"Family Honor\\" is my first exposure to Robert Parker; I have never read a Spencer work (nor the more recent Jesse Stone novels). I think it important, however, to judge this book on its own merits.Simply, I hope Parker writes more about Sunny Randall! She is smart and driven but not without frailties, as a single woman, trying to re-discover herself after divorce, in a new career and new surroundings, sans Richie, all while acknowledging ties to him which are not broken. I found her confusion about her \\"ex\\" to be honest and refreshing; she recognizes a sincere loss without him in her life, although she can and does survive and prosper on her own. For Sunny, who tries to teach a helpless Millie about life in their time together, independence means embracing the freedom to make choices and to do things only for herself, such as learning to cook, working-out, painting and detective work. Richie, who once tried to stand in her way in these pursuits, recognizes and regrets his loss; they would make a good couple working together on some project in a future story. Occasionally, Sunny's \\"toughness\\" seems a bit affected and unrealistic - clever zingers and witty repartee do not always sway the rude and/or powerful - and a bit too much is made of the rarity of a female PI, but I think Parker may have been feeling his way through the female mind with Sunny's debut. I trust he will get to know her better in future novels.Sunny is very similar to Kinsey Milhone, in Sue Grafton's Alphabet Mysteries, and although Sunny doesn't have the same colorful past as Kinsey, I enjoyed her biting outlook on life and her place in it. I welcome Sunny Randall to the family of strong, female lead characters."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"...then read the Spenser books. Don't bother with this book.

A female hero who sounds and acts a lot like Spenser with a few twists to let us know she's a girl (she cries after blowing one of the bad guys away). She lifts weights, boxes, shoots, cooks, philosophizes, etc., etc., etc. Let's get a little more diversity here!"},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"I didn't know whether I would like this book, not being a Spencer. Spencer had become like a family member. Wow, was I mistaken. The Spencer series had become a little tired, the characters a little shop-worn. This book is a one sitting read. The lead character is a woman, which gives a slightly different slant to things. (I had wondered if my husband would enjoy it as much as I did. He was up half the night reading!)Hawk is gone and in his place, Spike, who actually has a vocabulary. The one-liners we have come to appreciate as a hallmark of Parker are in abundance. It is as though Parker woke up from a long nap and remembered how to write. This book is a delicious dessert that you eat too quickly and are sad when it's gone."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Hopefully after these characters are developed more we'll see a Spenser, Sunny Randall, Jesse Stone team-up. The pages of a book with these chracters and they're sidekicks would explode with ACTION!!!!!!!Just the interaction between Hawk and Spike would be worth the read. Mr. Parker did a great job with developing these new characters in Family Honor. I just hope you'll be able to give us enough of all of these great characters from this book and Jesse Stone and lets-not-forget Spenser. Because once again I'm hooked and anxiously awaitng for all of the above. I don't know if I should love you or hate you Mr. Parker for doing this to me. Long live Spenser, Jesse Stone, and Sunny Randall."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Unlike everyone else, I gave this book five stars. I won't go into the plot or compare it to other Parker novels. Suffice it to say that in my opinion Parker creates and develops real, living characters like nobody since since John D. MacDonald (the creator of the Travis McGee novels). I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Well, I have been mad all summer because all of my tried and true authors and their characters have been very disappointing, but somehow as predictable as this book was (Where is Paul now that he is grown up anyway?)I still enjoyed it. Maybe because plot has never been as important as character in any of Parker's books, and I liked all of these new characters....including Rosie with her &quot;watermelon eyes&quot;. It would be nice if the next one did have a more original plot line but I hope this series has a long life, because no matter what Robert B. Parker is one heck of a writer."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"I have read all of Parker's Spenser and Jesse Stone novels - I am a big fan. With reluctance I picked up Parker's first Sunny Randel novel. On the plus side I can see Helen Hunt playing Sunny in the movie, on the down side I fear the movie will stink as much as the book.After reading &quot;Family Honor&quot; I asked myself is Parker biting off more than he can chew? The book was poorly researched, and appears to be quickly written. The characters were one-dimensional and in many respects unlikeable.Nevertheless, if you are a Parker fan this will probably be a must read, hopefully this will be his last Sunny Randel novel."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Wouldn't it be great fun for Jesse Stone and Spenser to meet, and perhaps work a case together? Any chance of that happening? Hope so."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Sunny Randall is Spenser in drag, with the exception that when things get rough, she calls on her male friends to come in and provide the machismo. Despite one good scene when she goes up against a tough pimp, she's still too heavily dependent upon her ex for this to be truly enjoyable; Parker's sexism is too glaring. Nonetheless, it is about as enjoyable as any Parker novel: it's mental popcorn, meant to be consumed &amp; forgotten."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"I have read every Spencer book written by Parker and both Jessie Stone books. I enjoyed them all, some more than others but as a whole I like all of them. I even keep them and read some more than once, which is rare for me. Now comes Sunny Randall. It is the worst thing I have read that Parker wrote. All about a privite eye who finds a fifteen year old for her parents and then decides to not take her home until she can find out why she ran away. Sunny uses her ex-husbands mob family to get her into places and to see people she cannot do by her self. Spike is the answer to Spencers Hawk, I guess. I had to force my self to finish the book. I understand there is another Sunny Randall out in Hardback, guess who WON'T be buying it. I know Robert Parker could care less what I think if this book, but, I wish he would stick to the Spencer books which he does so well. This is about the same as Spencer and Paul in Thin Air. The names have changed but not much else."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Parker's dedication was, I concentrated on you Joan. He should concentrate on his writing. The computer enables fast editing and that is all he does. Sunny and Spenser are the same, just cross dressing the characters. Of course the gay guy is Hawk in a nice suit, and all the bad guys are the same. I bought the paperback for a flight home and was wishing for the plane to crash before I choked down another boring, boring page of the same old Parker has been doing for the past twenty years. What is worse are all the glowing reviews from the paid of reviewers."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"KIND OF HARD TO REVIEW A BOOK WHEN YOU HAVEN'T AS YET READ IT.

I have never been dissatisfied."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Sorry, Robert, you're lucky I gave this as many stars as I did. I found Sunny charming and delightful to read. The only problem is that she is a female Spencer, who I follow and love. Also, why do you suddenly take a stance against Republicans and fathers? The bad guy is really the father, a Republican (mean-spirited, I suppose as we all are), and a father to boot. You're showing your New England roots. But don't worry, I'll continue to buy your Spencer books, and even your Sunny Randall books, with the knowledge that in the latter I will have to put up with a somewhat tempered feminism. You're not, Spike, are you? That's OK, if you are. I liked the guy and you handled the character very well."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"The main character was insufferable. Parker has tried to create a male Spencer but fails miserably. She appears to be without fault and has an answer for everything. At least Spencer admits to feet of clay. The plot was implausible."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Like a great many people, I've been a Spenser fan for some years, now. And, I suspect, also like a great many people I have quietly been mourning the gradual decline in the quality of those novels. With very few exceptions, long term series do tend to fade after a while (think Cornwell, Grafton, perhaps even Bujold) and to do him credit, Parker has taken longer to fade than many others. But fade he has, so when Jesse Stone appeared on the scene I was pleased. I like Jesse. I look forward to his next adventure.Now we have Sunny Randall. Upon starting Family Honor, and realising that this was set in Boston, my first thought was 'cool! I hope she runs into Spenser!'. But having finished it, I'm thinking 'if she runs into Spenser, it'll be like sitting a character down in front a mirror and having it talk to itself.'I am surprised and disappointed by this book. It is pretty much nothing short of Spenser in drag, and I truly expected a great deal more from Parker. Dammit, he should know better! I am not stupid, I am not blind, and if he thinks I, and all his other readers, aren't going to notice the transparency of his setting, lead and support characters and plot then he is very foolish indeed.The similarities are, indeed, so obvious that for me they got in the way of the story. I was too busy having my intelligence insulted to really enjoy it, initially. But then that wore off. I did keep reading.Parker is an excellent writer, technically. No quibbles there. And if I had never read a Spenser novel, I suspect I would have found this a truly good read. As things stand, it was deju vu all over again.My other main concern is with the actual characterisation of Sunny. If she were a man, I'd have no problem. But she's not a man ... physically. Intellecutally and psychologically, however, to me she does feel like a man. It takes something more than wearing a bra to make a woman, and whatever that something is, Sunny doesn't have it.I will be very interested to see what happens when Helen Hunt takes on the role. She is a long way from being my favourite actress, but perhaps she'll be able to imbue Sunny with that spark of 'feminine' something the character lacks on the page."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Let's face it, folks, Sunny Randall is just a female Spenser, and this book is just another Spenser book with the names changed.Same characters, same dialogue, same PLOT, for God's sake! If I didn't know better, I'd swear that this was a cynical attempt on Robert B. Parker's part to cash in on the current popularity of female sleuth novels.Hey, and just so you know where I'm coming from, I've read and enjoyed every Spenser novel from The Godwulf Manuscript on. AND I think that Parker has shown that he CAN write something other than Spenser books by creating the Jesse Stone series, which is markedly different, although just as satisfying, as the Spenser series.Just my two cents."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"When you know from the outset that a writer wrote a book solely for the film rights, and wrote the main character for a particular actor, you can prepare yourself for what's coming. Such is the case with Family Honor, which was written for Helen Hunt. (It's already, of course, been optioned.)Parker is, of course, best known for the Spenser novels, but when he chooses to get away from them, more often than not his main character is a recognizably different person than Spenser is. Sure, Spenser and, say, Jesse Stone share a few characteristics, but you can tell they're different people. However, the main wisecracking detective in Family Honor might as well be named Sunny Spenser. The differences between the two (aside from the obvious) are negligible. Face it, this is a Spenser novel in drag. And as far as Spenser novels go, it's a pretty good one. Problem is, it's the attempt to change the character that grates on my nerves. Hopefully, now that Ms. Hunt has her film role, Parker will dump this line and get back to Spenser and Stone. ** 1/2"},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"I have read all of Robert B. Parker's novels except the Sunny Randall novels. I wasn't sure that I would enjoy Parker's writing about a female P.I., so I was pleasantly surprised when I finished &quot;Family Honor&quot;. Sunny Randall is 35, divorced from her ex-husband whom she still loves, and paints. She also owns a bull terrier named Rosie. Sunny is hired by Brock and Betty Patton to find their daughter, Millicent, who has run away from home. Sunny locates Millicent, but she refuses to return home. It seems that there are some other people who are looking for Millicent as well. Sunny hides Millicent in a friend's home while she investigates. I like the character of Sunny Randall and plan to read the next two novels while awaiting more Spenser and Jesse Stone novels from Robert B. Parker."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"But, to borrow from the Beatles, \\"you know that can't be bad.\\" Sure, Sunny is a wiseacre like Spenser and, like Spenser, she lives in Boston and loves both Charlie Parker and the bar at the Ritz. And Julie the shrink bears a passing resemblance to Susan the shrink. Rosie eats off chopsticks, just like Pearl. Sunny's ex-husband provides extra muscle, underworld connections, and makes people uncomfortable by remaining menacingly still, just like Hawk. And Millicent is a mix between April Kyle and Paul Giacommin. So I guess if you wanted to brand this work as derivative, I wouldn't be able to convincingly defend it. BUT I adore the Spenser books and have feared that as Parker's original PI grows older (he's in his 60s now) and retires, there would be no new Parker character to take his place. Now there's Sunny. I enjoyed this tale of sex, mystery, love and redemption. The plot was interesting, the characters comfortable and compelling, and the performance by Andrea Thompson was exceptional. (OK, she said \\"Betty Hutton\\" instead of \\"Betty Patton\\" once, but I thought that was funny.) I've heard that Sunny was created for Helen Hunt, but Parker has hit the jackpot with Thompson. If there's ever a Sunny film, she certainly deserves a crack at the title role."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"While not &quot;heavy&quot; reading, nor Pulitzer Prize material, I really enjoyed this book. I was introduced to the story with an audiobook (abridged), and didn't like the gaps, so I had to sign the book out of my library. Sunny Randall would be a cool person to have as a best friend, since she's witty and wise, and has a neat dog! I wish I could come up with those quick responses when confronted with life's little challenges, like Sunny can, which cracked me up. I will definitely read more Sunny Randall novels."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"I loved this book! Sunny Randall is the absolute best character that I've seen in a very long time. Sunny has got it going on, as does the author who captured the essence of &quot;today's&quot; woman: independent, corageous, with a life-saving sense of humor. All women will love the characters of this book."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Robert B. Parker 's Spenser novels have gotten stuck in a rut, a result of needing to keep the storylines consistent with the characters' past history. I continue to read them avidly, but they seem a little stale.All he has done here is to keep the same basic cast characters but change their names, genders, ethnicities, and sexual orientations. This simple gimmick actually works quite well.&quot;Family Honor&quot; reads and feels just like a Spenser novel--a fresh, rejuvenated Spenser novel, like the ones he was writing a decade ago. It's like seeing the same group of actors in a new sitcom after a few too many years of seeing them in the old one."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"A good effort by Parker but not as well executed as his other books featuring non-Spenser characters. Jesse Stone, by comparison, really seems like his own man. Maybe it's the Boston setting (complete with Spenser super pimp Tony Marcus) but I kept thinking I was reading a Spenser novel with occasional mind blows about skirt-wearing and diatribes on how hard it was to carry a gun if you weigh 115 pounds. - rob"},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Mr. Parker takes what he does best but down a parallel street this time with a female private eye. Okay, our lady detective definitely has a distaste for the diminutive, but she's pretty cool anyway. Parker steals some of the Spenser-familiar locales, the coffee and the doughnuts, and even a Spenser plot, but manages to do a pretty fresh little story from a very different perspective. The dialogue is witty, the plot twists are clever, the character interaction is charged, there is an marvelous dog in the action, and plenty of lowlifes and violence. Some of Sunny Randall's feminine angst is pretty much on target too. A fun and fast summer read."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Introducing Sunny Randall - tough newly divorced female detective, ready to take on Boston's organized crime, including her ex in-laws, who love her to death.

After finding the girl, she wonders whether or not she should return her to the family. Then the real fun begins, trying to discover why the girl ran away. Corruption at the highest levels of Massachusetts politics is not far away, along with kinky family activities."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Everyone seems to possess a different handle of what makes Sunny Randle tick. To herself, Sunny simply ends up being a big question mark. She lives alone although she loves her ex-spouse Ritchie deeply. However, her family represents law enforcement while his kin symbolize organized crime. For years, her father has tried to put her ex father-in-law behind bars. She quit the police force, becoming a private investigator. Sunny also works as an artist while attending school part-time.Brock and Billy Patton hire Sunny to locate and bring home their runaway teenage daughter, Millicent. Though she accepts the case, Sunny senses something is not right within the Patton household. Sunny finds Millicent hooking in Boston, but the adolescent refuses to return to the home of her parents. Unable to desert Millicent to the streets nor force her to go to her parents' home, the kind hearted detective takes her back to her own house. However, two thugs arrive, trying to abduct Millicent. As Sunny protects her new charge, she investigates why there is such a sudden interest in just what seems to be another runaway.FAMILY HONOR turns out to be Robert B. Parker's first tale starring a female protagonist. Anyone who reads it will think the author has been dabbling with female sleuths for decades. Sunny is a well-rounded individual with a marshmallow heart, an Einstein brain, and a need to do the right thing without hurting anyone(but does not play end for the Cardinals). In spite her being a soft touch, Sunny is tough, which makes her similar in nature to Spencer. Fans of Mr. Parker will relish the tale of a realistic, original, and strong woman starring in a will written who-done-it.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"I spent at least 3 hours reading this book, it read just that fast. It was a fast moving gripping story with characters working to stay true to their own beliefs, no matter what is being thrown at them.

Sunny Randall makes her debut in this yarn of sex, deceit and extortion. Not his best but getting his feet wet with this new female perspective, he makes more than a solid effort. (he gets the ball rolling in following tales) I'm grateful to Mr. Parker and his pen (figuratively???) If you are a fan...don't miss it. If you're not...WHY not???!!!!"},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"FAMILY HONOR lived up to its title as the pilot for this delightful series which felt at first like Spenser was toning himself into a female roar heard round the literary arena, while extending his slant on gangster Vs cop family backgrounds (in which neither is all bad or all good) in this Juliet and Romeo romance.I hadn't thought I'd be able to get into a female private eye series by Parker, especially after having become addicted to his 34 Spenser novels. But FAMILY HONOR was a perfect appetizer with appealing percolation. I don't doubt that Parker can carry both his new series (see my review of NIGHT PASSAGE, Jesse Stone # 1).It didn't take more than a few chapters for Sunny to split off from the long-wrought, well-writ Spenser mystique and into her own, as a full character... maybe with Spenser speaking into her ear as an angel from an alternate reality, for a while. I enjoyed the slips connecting to Spenser, i.e., how Sunny might deal with a particular hairy situation if she were a 200 pound, male boxer. In humorous yet realistic contrast to Spenser and Hawk types, Parker dramatized what a small female can do to compensate for not being a testy, taut, towering gorilla-with-gonads, in a plot which will had me smiling. I'm excited about this series; I enjoyed the upbeat feeling of this first offering in it. I relished hearing Randall use Spenser's trademark words in dialogue, like \\"some more\\" and \\"eek.\\"Reading the first few chapters of FAMILY HONOR I kept seeing Spenser in high heels, noting how uncomfortable they were, and wondering where/how to effectively house a big enough gun on a 115 lb, 5'4\\" body... as he seemed to be having great fun adapting to this recent female incarnation, shaking out the form and personality. Of course, that image alone got me grinning. By the time the intense ending called up, I was liking Sunny Randall every bit as much as Kinsey Millhone (Sue Grafton's P. I.).For this unique pilot, Parker designed a stylish, italicized prologue in third person observation of Sunny and Rosie, accomplishing an artistic, literary feel, giving a light-touch, sensitive contrast to chapter one opening into a first person narrative style with Sunny telling her own story in the classic private eye genre mode.The included cultural icons of cooking, dress, habits, and thinking were precisely on target with the copyright date of 1999, when the Great Chefs TV episodes were running hot and heavy, with their long-handled saute pans being shook (contents were no longer stirred on TV) above gas-lit burners on commercial grade stoves, featuring Spike, Sunny's gay, tough-guy chef friend.The plot here gave hints of EARLY AUTUMN (# 7 Spenser) and CEREMONY (# 9 Spenser) as Sunny took in a young teen, Millicent Patton, runaway, hooking daughter of her clients. Enlightening entertainment was easily obtained through Sunny's ways of dealing with and drawing out this young human lost in the sump and shrug of a lack of love.A few quirky questions came to mind as I began reading this novel:What might Rachel Wallace (# 6 SPENSER,Looking for Rachel Wallace) say about Spenser's (Parker's) ability to understand being female, if she were to read FAMILY HONOR. And what would she think about macho if she had read all 34 Spenser novels. Can novels help us understand that which we would have to stretch outside our bodies and into another form to get? I'd say they can, especially if penned by Parker.Rachel Wallace may have to give the gauntlet on this one. Spenser understands.Yet... can testosterone ever fully comprehend powerlessness...Maybe any person who has ever been depressed, grieved loss of a loved one, or desperately wanted something he couldn't have, for whatever reason, has the capacity to comprehend the initial feeling of hopelessness which sometimes comes at those times of leached strength and slow coming answers. We each have a spirit, though, which seems to believe that morning comes daily. Parker has made a good case that sunny weather can dog the footsteps of storms.Linda Shelnutt"},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"This is the first book I have read by this author and I really enjoyed it.

Yes it reads like a Spenser novel, is kind of a fun read if you're a Spenser fan (which I am), but here Parker takes out his Spencer cookie cutter and plops out a rather uninspired story. Nothing new here. If you like Parker -- his best novel is Love and Glory, which isn't a Spenser novel, but an excellent story."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Family Honor by Robert B. Parker is the first in his Sunny Randall series, and like all of Parker's books, it's sharp, witty and entertaining.Sunny Randall is a young and pretty cop-turned-private eye who is just getting over a divorce. Her former husband, Richie Burke, comes from a Boston mob family. Although they still love each other, the cop-mob conflict got in the way (Sunny's cop father kept trying to put Richie's father in jail). Sunny is hired by a prominent Boston couple whose 15 year old daughter has run away. The father has political aspirations but when Sunny starts digging, it turns out that the daughter has many reasons to not wish to return home. Sunny finds herself in the middle of a mob war that involves the Italian Mafia trying to move in on the Irish Mob.I don't think that anyone writes dialogue as sharp as Parker. Sunny is actually a female Spenser, and while Spenser has one sidekick (Hawk), Sunny is surrounded by a host of oddball characters. In addition to Richie, there is Spike (her gay bodybuilding friend), her therapist/friend Julie and her dog, Rosie. Sunny needs the assistant of all her friends while trying to solve this mystery and stay alive at the same time.As a Spenser fan, I'm not sure how close Parker comes to the success of his Spenser series with Sunny Randall. However, I definitely plan to read more."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Sunny Randall is more than a female equivalent of Spenser, though that's a convenient starting point. Like the Spenser novels, these are told in first person by a Boston private investigator. There is a similar wit about her as there is to Spenser. And Parker's writing style is very similar in this novel -- crisp dialogue, brief but important descriptions, and good character development for the genre. Also, as I found in the Jesse Stone novels, there is the occasional involvement of minor characters from the Spenser novels.But -- to a degree -- Randall thinks about the issues that surround her more than Spenser does (or at least Parker shares more of these insights with us). As Spenser sometimes will bounce ideas and theories off Susan Silverman about the psychological make-up of some his clients, Randall does the same about herself, both internally and with her friend, Julie, who is a psychiatrist.Don't get me wrong -- there's plenty of hard-boiled detective mystery here. But Parker continues to prove that he can write more than one-dimensional characters."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"You have to kind of respect the size of the cojones on Robert Parker to put out this book. Not only is the main character Spenser with breasts, but she has her own tough-guy sidekick like Spenser, her own cute dog like Spenser, and the relationship with her boyfriend ends up exactly like Spencer's and Susan's. What makes Parker the winner of the chutzpah award is the fact that the PLOT of the book is the same as the Spenser novel &quot;Early Autumn&quot;! I give this 2 stars because if you've never read any Spenser books it's a pretty decent read, but if you're a fan of the series, this is just Spenser rehashed."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"OK, I didn't want to enjoy this book. Though I am a long time fan of Parker's Spencer series, I have even gotten tired of it lately. At least this book has the advantage of saving us from more Susan Silverman cuteness. But, despite my preconceptions, I found myself falling under the spell of the familiar dialoge patterns and thinly disguised author's attitudes, and did, indeed, enjoy this gender bender version of a typical 'Spencer' story. Nothing inventive or new, but the old stuff is still entertaining enough for a good read."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"A friend gave me this book, and I really had no idea what to expect. When I opened it and found out it was the first book for a new character, I was pretty excited. Sometimes it's difficult when you pick up a book in the middle of a series, but here I was coming in on the ground floor. Yay!Although I'm used to a bit more action in the books I read, I have to say that it only took me a couple of days to read it -- it was VERY fast, very enjoyable, and also quite funny. Not necessarily laughing out loud funny, but there were so many times Sunny brought a smile to my face! As others have said, it sure would be nice to have a friend like her around.The book is light reading, but even so, at the end of every chapter you feel compelled to just see what's going to happen next. Mr. Parker, I salute you, and I'm certainly going to be looking for your other books. I can't wait to read them!If you're looking for some funny, caring characters you might want to know better (or might not want to!), this is a good place to start.

Parker has included the good and the bad from his earlier efforts. We see the effortless way he puts characters together with only a few words. And the way the characters interact-much like Spenser with Hawk and Susan. Sunny has her sidekick friends Spike and the lover with who she has the issues involved in all long running relationships. Nothing new here. Parker also uses his broad brush of few words with the usual character stereotypes the reader will recognize from the Spenser books.All these things aside, we are glad to get a new Robert B.

Unfortunately, he has already written this one. This book is a rehash of &quot;Early Automn&quot;, with chunks of &quot;Ceremony&quot; thrown in. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"I have been a huge fan of the Spenser books for a long time now and always look foward to the release of a new Robert B. Parker book. This new character is good, but lacks the spark (and wit) of Spenser.Sunny Randall is, however, a much more exciting character than Parker created in his Jesse Stone books. I especially enjoyed the interaction between her ex-husband and her gay friend Spike. They are so different and yet so alike.Despite the short-comings of this book, it is still a wonderful read. Nobody gives rich dialouge like Parker. And it is amazing how much excitement Parker can pack into the 3 page showdown between Sunny and the villian at Tony Marcus' resturant.It's just sad to have your appitite whet with Tony Marcus and Ty-bop and not have Spenser around. Well, I guess we just have to wait another six months ..."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Seems like i've read this story before in a Spenser novel. Disguising the detective as a woman didn't fool me, and I don't think it'll fool many others. And Sunny was completely unbelievable. Although, RB Parker did manage to make her into a male fantasy: gorgeous, perfect body, guilt-free casual sex, completely self-assured...yeah right. Haven't met too many of hose."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"I have been a Mr. Parker's fan since the beginning and have read all of his Spencer novels. I have also enjoyed his new Jesse Stone series so far and am looking forward to the next installment to both the Spencer and Jesse series. I have always enjoyed the sense of honor and sense of humor Mr. Parker's characters possess and the snappy dialogue. I am a woman and am also a fan of other series featuring strong heronines (such as Dr. Scarpetta in Ms. Patricia Cornwall's series and Anita Blake in Ms. Laurell K Hamilton's series) so I bought Mr. Parker's new book with great expectations. Unfortunately, I find that I am unable to connect with Sunny Randall's character. Mr. Parker's dialogue is as snappy as ever and Sunny Randall exhibits many of the admiral qualities that Spencer and Jesse possess. However, there seems to be something very subtley off about SunnyRandall's character that does not ring true as a woman. The story is strong, if slightly predictable but this subtle imbalance made it very difficult for me to immerse myself in the story. Overall, it was an okay read but I may have been better off waiting for the next Spencer novel."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"I had the pleasure of meeting Robert B. Parker recently at a book signing in Vero Beach, Florida. He was very entertaining, witty and seemingly intelligent. I bought his new book with anticipation of getting acquainted with a new author because of the many favorable comments I had heard about Mr. Parker. I found &quot;Family Honor&quot; to be a very shallow novel of poorly defined characters with limited literary qualities. Perhaps my timing for getting acquainted with Mr. Parker was poor, because I had just finished &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot; by Ken Follett. Comparing the qualities of the two books is impossible. I read for enjoyment as well as improving my mind. I found Family Honor to be a quick read of short paragraphs and much dialogue. The story is transparent and has no surprises. In summary, I found this novel to be a waste of time and hardly worth the effort. Mr. Parker is much more entertaining in person, and perhaps he should consider a career change and become a comedian."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"As it turns out, when Parker finally turns away from writing about (and in the voice of) Spenser, and creates a new character...that new character is Spenser, reincarnated as a small blonde woman. I don't like Sunny or the other characters in this book much, and I think they talk much more like men than women, BUT that said, I am still and always a pretty big Parker fan. Spenser was so much a favorite that I had a cat named after him (the detective, not the poet).As proved by Susan Silverman, the therapist who should be hospitalized for fulminant anorexia (and any patient in their right mind who would visit a shrink with an untreated psychological disorder...well, it's a book, so we won't get into that!), Parker isn't so hot at writing women. But he's great at crisp, clean dialogue and witty, sarcastic protagonists.Sunny's apparently (haven't finished the book yet) another in the EXACT (I mean, cookie-cutter exact) same mold as Spenser. In one sense, that's good; Parker writes better than a lot of people. In another sense, I wish he'd just stick with Spenser and his neurotic, self-satisfied shrink Susan. It's kind of eerie to read Spenser's voice attributed to Sunny Randall."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"I love the Spenser series, so I had high hopes when I picked this up. In many ways, it's a little too similar to Spenser. A female private eye, in Boston, knows the good guys, knows the bad guys. She's got a male sidekick who works in the Hawk role, and there's even a Susan-alike too. And a dog. So what's wrong?Well, so much for a female role model. She comments on the decorating of a room. She moans about ponies at parties. She moans about why Tony Marcus won't go take care of things for her ... she's told 80 quadrillion times that the girl is hooking and POOF of course she is. *sigh*My boyfriend had three words: &quot;I hate it.&quot;I tried to be open minded. I didn't mind the Paradise novels. It's good to get a different take on things, even if everything REEKS of Spenser and is set in the same universe. But REALLY! She's always going &quot;I'm independant. I can stand on my own. Hey, ex-hubby, can you talk to people for me? I can't seem to find a girl in one town even though I'm convinced she's hooking. Hey, Tony, why won't you just give her to me? I don't care if your employee has her and is making money. I feel it is Only Right that you hand her over just Because.&quot;ARRRGGGHHHHH.The writing is excellent. The characters and location are great. It's the minor plot flaws, and the huge character flaws, that bug me on this one."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"Why did Robert Parker give Sunny Randall (a daintier version of Spenser) her own book, other than to give Helen Hunt a job? The best character in this book by far is Spike, the gay restaurateur/tough guy. You have to love a man so comfortable with himself that when he's asked how he can bench-press 225 pounds, he nonchalantly replies, &quot;Fag power.&quot; Parker could do amazing things with this character, but instead he relegates Spike to Hawk status. Don't get me wrong--Sunny's okay, but Spike's the reason I'll continue reading this series."},{"Title":"Family Honor - A Sunny Randall Novel","review":"This is the first book I have read by Robert B. Parker so I cannot compare his newly minted heroine, Sunny Randall, to his previous protagonists or previous books.Sonja \\"Sunny\\" Randall is a 35-year-old chip off the old block. Like her father, she was a cop, but then left to become a private detective. She's tough and beautiful, but frankly there is little about her disposition that seems to evoke her nickname. She's actually a rather abrupt individual who is a little too much of a smart alec to be truly endearing. Her wit is clever, but often a bit abrasive and she prefers witty one liners to deep thought. After a while, the one-liners become tiresome and seem to be mostly a way for Sunny to cover up her own issues with a fiesty shell. She's a loner - in fact, it's what led her to leave the police department for private practice, and it's a large part of what led her to divorce her husband of 9 years, Richie, with whom she remains good friends. Her constant companion is Rosie, a miniature bull terrier who Sunny seems to like much better than most people, particularly children.The plot of this book centers around Millicent Patton, the 15-year-old daughter of a wealthy Boston banker and his socialite wife. When Millie runs away from home, Sunny is hired by Millie's parents to find her and bring her back home. It isn't long before Sunny catches up with Mille, but when she finds out what drove Millie out of the house in the first place, she has a decision to make: should she return Millie to her parents or not? The plot weaves the lives of Millie, Millie's parents, and Sunny directly into the middle of Boston's organized crime, and what starts out as finding a runaway teen ends up being an elusive contest to keep them both from getting killed.I still haven't decided if I really like Sunny Randall. She's just a little too fearless and flippant for my tastes. Also, Parker's writing style is rather terse. He seems to prefer language that spurts rather than flows, with prose that is often truncated. In fact, I don't think I've ever read a novel in which so many sentences had less than 10 words in them. It's OK for periodic busts of dialog, but as a steady diet in narrative and dialog, it isn't really my cup of tea. I often found myself feeling as though two or three sentences should have been joined by commas or some other punctuation besides periods.There isn't generally a whole lot of suspense here, as Parker reveals the answers slowly throughout the book rather than taking us breathlessly to the final few pages for the climax and resolution.Although it's nice to have discovered a new author in this genre, I'm not sure I can count him among my favorites. I will say this: he certainly beats James Patterson, but that isn't saying a whole lot these days with Patterson churning out mediocre books like a drive through window.If I were to award a letter grade, I'd give this book a B-. I'd also recommend starting with this book since it is the first in the Sunny Randall series, and the other books sort of build chronologically with many of the same characters appearing over and over again, such as Sunny's friend Spike, her ex-husband Ritchie, her sister Elizabeth, and her friend Julie, not to mention several repeat appearances by member's of Boston's underworld. If you like this book, continue on in the Sunny Randall series. If not, you'll probably want to pick something else since I'm now on my 3rd Sunny Randall book and have found the style of each to be essentially the same."},{"Title":"Graphic methods in structural geology, (The Century earth science series)","review":"I was looking for a more how to, step by step book.

Without the plot structure of the first three novels, Moody was able to go back through the story and illuminate some of the nooks and crannies that were touched on, but never explored; it wouldn't surprise me to find that a number of the pieces here had there geneses in fan mail or newsgroup questions.If you've read the original books (and if you haven't, read those first), you have a good idea of what to expect as far as the writing style goes. Those who've wondered about the living dead's method of killing in the novels will get their answer (no, they're still not eating people).

That being the case will have most of you scrambling to his website to read it. The kicker is that there are three more novels in the story that you must purchase in order to read them. The first one is in my opinion so mezmerizing a story that I could not just read the first one and let that be the end of it. The story begins in a common enough way almost to the point of being cliche. Upon later character development, it becomes apparent that we are not dealing with your average run of the mill type undead. And while the cliche types of violence will kill these zombies, you will have to read on to find out if you would really want to use them or not. This is the first Series of Zombie literature that I have read that actually shows you what it is like being on the undead side looking out in a way that is serious and saddening.

We really get to understand what happens in Canada and how the military in UK reacts etc. A must read if you have read the previous triology"},{"Title":"Autumn: The Human Condition","review":"The \\"AUTUMN\\" series is pretty strong overall, until this addendum. The series as a whole is not terribly original (see \\"Omega Man,\\" etc...) but the prose is excellent, and it is written in an absorbing, page-turning style, even if there is little original in its plot. This flashback addendum though is a big mistake, seemingly something added to milk the series. It focuses more on characters and attempts to shed light on them. But let's face it--what made the trilogy work was not characters but the page-turning suspense of \\"what happens next.\\" Here, we already know what happens next. Plus, the stories are, for the most part, not terribly interesting in and of themselves. I would underscore that many of the stories are simply tedious, and thin. They shed little evidence on character, add nothing new. They are simply rehashes of what we saw enough times in the trilogy. Even the one or two individual stories that generate some interest are obviously out of place in the timeline. There is no suspense. It just seems pointless."},{"Title":"Autumn: The Human Condition","review":"David Moody does a really good job at tying in all characters/plot in all of the Autumn series with this last book.

First, I read about Nic Danzinger's travels through the area in recent years. Next, I jumped back to the 1950's and '60s with Sir Wilfred Thesiger's--&quot;Among the Mountains&quot;. I finished with Chaffetz's &quot;A Journey Through Afghanistan&quot;. They are all brilliant but Chaffetz's book stands out as a scholarly piece and could well be used in anthropological circles for it's in depth study of the urban and nomadic Afghanis prior and during the Russian invasion. The recent drought that has affected the Hazarajat and Kuchi nomads of Afghanistan was brought that much closer with this book. I had bought this book in the late 1980's but between different trips to the Near East--I had fogotten where I left it. As a result, it took me 10 years to actually get around to reading it and after finishing it, I wondered why I hadn't cracked the spline earlier. Chaffetz' style can be a bit off-putting but his travelling companion is a perfect foil to David's abrasive personality. I would really like to know why Chaffetz was studying Parsi in pre-revolutionary Iran or was that just a cover?"},{"Title":"A Journey Through Afghanistan: A Memorial","review":"Chaffetz does an admirable job of describing northwest Afghanistan as it was circa 1975 and the effect that the country and its people had upon him. As one who had passed through the country in the late sixties, there was much I could recognize in both the stimulus and the author's response. Particularly gratifying to me was the &quot;update&quot; aspect - the provision of information from that particular time period, of which I had previously read and heard only the barest political and economic facts. Chaffetz ably uses history to inform and frame the life and times he experienced. A further enhancement is the author's knowledge of Farsi and the inclusion of translations into English of words, old inscriptions, and occasional couplets of Persian poetry. The title of this review is taken from one of those couplets. The book is evocative and commendable."},{"Title":"A Journey Through Afghanistan: A Memorial","review":"A very humane and sensitive account that explores the world view of people far from the beaten track.

Dip into it by subject or time period. And you'll love it. Of course it was written by a believing man with a great generous soul. But it's thoroughly documented, and has immense and timeless insight to offer on many subjects. For some, it might be a rich corrective to the mini-series, and movies about Jesus which portray his surroundings as so meager and primitive, with no sense of the grandeur of the Holy City, and the complexity and variety of the village life that Jesus might have known. Jesus didn't live in the Stone Age as motion pictures and documentaries would have one believe. He lived in the busy world of Augustus and Tiberius Caesar. And this book embraces that period with vast wisdom and knowledge. It is outdated, yes. But the period in which it was written (late 1800's) is no doubt partly responsible for it's profound simplicty and overwhelming charm. Happy reading."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This classic work is a goldmine of information about the context of the Gospels. Many of the events and sayings in Jesus's become even clearer when we understand the widespread Rabbinic teachings of His day. Edersheim's insight into the famous \\"Thou art Peter\\" is most interesting -- yes, Jesus was speaking Hebrew but he DID mean to distinguish petros and petra, because these names had also been incorporated into Hebrew and Aramaic. It's also very important to see how Jewish writers interpreted Messianic prophecies to see that the NT writers were following accepted procedure.For something more modern, I recommend Dr Arnold Fruchtenbaum's books, especially Messianic Christology."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"While somewhat outdated, The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah remains a magnificent reference to the historical and cultural setting to the days of Jesus of Nazareth.

I truly consider myself more then a casual reader of this magnificent work! That being said, my review...For the believing Christian, this is a must read. For the skeptic, consider yourself remiss to overlook this book and for the Non-believer, this work will renovate your thinking. Edersheim has put together a true masterpiece herein. His depth of research on the subject matter is totally comprehensive. A commitment of 7 years, in almost complete solitude, was made to the writing of this book by he and his daughter.Literally thousands of footnotes, drawn from nearly every major Jewish writing of the time, are listed on the pages of this book indicating the intense discipline and scholarly effort enforced by the writer. An impression of truth and trustworthiness almost overwhelms readers as they have literally noted in conversation with me as I have passed this book along to many friends and acquaintances.This book is a bon-a-fide \\"best effort\\" to set before it's readers the daily foot steps of Jesus of Nazareth so that His words and works may bring us to an understanding of Jesus The Messiah that will blaze with a brightness that will light every other understanding.Finally, to put oneself to the task of completing this book is an undertaking. However, as noted by Edersheim himself, we are called to look upon Jesus with intent and resolve before we will see him as the \\"God-Man\\".

The culture of Israel during the Roman occupation comes alive in Edersheim's writing in a way that goes beyond scholastic study by blending his own Jewish heritage, archeological fact, and keen spiritual insight. Any serious student of the Gospels or the Epistles would benefit from the insight of Mr. Edersheim because so much of the imagery in the account of Jesus is steeped in the culture of Israel as it progressed from Abraham to Herod. Used as a reference, &quot;The Life and Times&quot; is indexed according to verses and events and gives Bible studies the context for the illustrations of Jesus. Read as a book, Edersheim is ponderous, however, a contiguous reading would give a person a consistent Hebrew framework which the New Testament fit into 2000 years ago. &quot;The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah&quot; has become a fixture in my library which, second to the Bible, is now a standard starting point in my study of Jesus, the Messiah."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"In Bible school I had to use this book as a resource in writing several papers.

Could it be a Kindle issue?"},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"I do not intend to review content here. This new edition is so full of typographical errors that sometimes the reader will have to intuit what the author really wrote. It is clear that the proofreaders of this edition were not actually reading; they were simply following the little red lines under the \\"misspelled\\" words. This has resulted in some truly bizarre apparent statements by the author, unreproducible here due to copyright laws. Disclaimer-- I have not purchased this book, merely checked it out of the library."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"The author's preface is dated 1886. Biblical scholarship has changed a lot since then, most notably with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Nag Hammadi library. Many of Rev. Edersheim's conclusions will have been refuted in the 130+ years since this book's original publication.For me, the author was at his best when he was dealing with _facts_, such as the details of Jewish life and society in Palestine during the time of Jesus. Unfortunately, being an Anglican priest, he cannot resist the temptation to preach - so he spends pages upon pages telling us what the story MEANS instead of just telling the story. I enjoyed his exposition on the parables in Book V, but most of his preaching was tedious and overburdened with Victorian-era sentiment.Edersheim also argues incessantly (with other Bible scholars whom he often names in the text or the footnotes) in favor of the authenticity, earliness, and \\"Jewish origin\\" of the gospel of John - a position which to me seems indefensible. He also insists on \\"harmonizing\\" the gospels into a single continuous narrative while also insisting that all four are literally, factually, and unerringly TRUE. This approach does not hold water, and watching this otherwise talented scholar & historian flounder through a mire of faulty logic and circular reasoning has only strengthened my conviction that the Victorian dream of a \\"Gospel Harmony\\" is an unreachable goal. Edersheim must undergo strange intellectual contortions to hold to his belief that the gospel writers 1) never made mistakes, and 2) never made stuff up. In one passage he points out Luke's specificity of historic detail as \\"evidence\\" of the truthfulness of his tale, and a few pages later points out Matthew's vagueness & lack of detail as proof of his veracity. You can't have it both ways!! Edersheim never gives the Classical/Antique era's writers any credit for imagination & inventiveness. Furthermore, he seems to have no understanding of Non-Christian myth nor how good stories are told.The book is huge: 1,491 pages, not counting the index and the Roman-numbered pages in the introduction to both volumes (bound together in this one enormous edition but retaining their two separate paginations). As other reviewers mentioned, there are lots of typos, and the old-fashioned prose often bogs down. I felt every one of those 1,491 pages. This book took way too long to read ... but ultimately I'm glad I read it. It's a treasure-trove of information as well as misbegotten opinions. It is probably something that should be experienced by anyone who's got the interest in the subject matter, and the patience to turn that many pages - but its flaws are too numerous for me to award it more than 3."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This book was recommended by my pastor and because I wanted to know more about Jesus I ordered it and will order another to give as a gift.

He lived from 1825 to 1889.His best known work is The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah. As he said, he took seven years to complete this project. He isolated himself and devoted full time to his writing with only his daughter Ella as his researcher, proofreader and inspiration. This is indeed a tribute to a devoted daughter and skilled researcher in her own right.The volume of 1100 pages is not a devotional book. It has many devotional thoughts, but this is a scholarly work with historical details filling every chapter. You can tell by reading the extensive research and writing ability which into this tome.If you want to know about the times in which Jesus lived and glimpses into His life, then this book will be a good one for you. For example:The Gospels present a great deal of tension between Jesus and the religious leaders over rituals and the Sabbath. Edersheim explains this controversy where Jesus rejected the numerous ritual rules for everyday life and especially for the proper observation of the Sabbath. By the time of Jesus the religious authorities had created a burdensome system of do's and don'ts that even the devout hard a difficult time following. The Jerusalem priesthood was corrupt and the cleansing of the temple by Jesus was more than just a simple act.In addition, you are presented with graphic descriptions of the Herod Dynasty. King Herod and family left a bloody mark on Judaea before and after Jesus. It was a bloodline conceived in the worst possible elements of human nature. The Herods sought to build a second Rome in Judaea.If you have a serious interest in this subject, then I recommend this book to you. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"The edition of \\"The Life and Times of Jesus Christ the Messiah\\" that I am reviewing is the third edition printed in 1995. It is a burgundy hard cover with gold lettering.This may be the most thorough,comprehensive book about the land and times of Jesus. It covers religious thought and politics of the day.What the Messianic expectations were.This is a very detailed and well-documented chronicle of the Messiah's life.The Appendices in the back of the book are the best I have read.Mr.Edersheim also covers such topics as:Pseudigraphic Writings-Enoch,Jubilees,Apocalypse of Baruch are some.Rabbinic views,theology,and literature.Lists of the Maccabees,Family of Herod,and Roman govt leaders.The Law in Messianic times.Jewish Angelology and demonology.The Jewish history of exorcisms was interesting.The Fall of Angels.Some very helpful tools also found in the back of this book are the Subject Index,Scripture Index,and maps.I have read \\"the Complete Works of Josephus\\". This book is much better in my opinion! It covers a lot more ground and would make a great reference tool."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"While a little outdated now, The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah remains as both an excellent and massive reference work to the historical setting to the time of Jesus of Nazareth. Written some 70 years prior to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Alfred Edersheim's great work still offers highly valuable-and detailed-information on the Gospel and related events. One of the more striking features of this book is the appendix section which gives a list of 400+ Old Testament passages which were tagged by the ancient rabbis as messianically applied. An absolute must for any who wish to study the Jewish expectations of the coming of Messiah surrounding the days when the Carpentar from Nazareth walked the Earth. Place Edersheim's great work in your library, and you will find yourself going back to it time and time again."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This book is a treasure to read. Alfred was obviously a world class scholar. He adds meaningful depth to the scriptures as he follows Jesus through his time on earth. I find it exciting to sense Jesus being brought to life in beautiful English. It is a little daunting to bounce back and forth between the author's references and the text but it is well worth it. Alfred brings in many comments from both Jewish and non-Jewish scholars. He explores the scriptures with insights and depth challenging the reader to do likewise. This is a book for the serious searcher well worth the time and money.john s"},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This has been the standard work on the life of Christ for decades. It has some good insights into the life of Jesus, and it will help pastors and teachers of the Word in their search for information that will preach.The book has some weaknesses that keeps it from being the top contemporary resource on the life of Jesus. Number one: The book is not easy to read. It is technical and tedious, and demands alot from the reader.Number two: Edersheim operates under the assumption that everything he knows about Talmudic tradition was also true in the first century, and we simply do not know if this was the case.Number three: The scholarship in this book is more than a hundred years old. I think the best features of the book are the preaching tidbits sprinkled throughout the volume.Having said all that,I think that if you are looking for the best Jesus biography, you'd be better served with Jesus and the Gospels by Craig Blomberg. The scholarship is recent, the prose is engaging, and the volume compresses an amazing amount of information in its 450 pages. Buy that book, along with Darrell Bock's Jesus According to Scripture and Ben Witherington's The Christology of Jesus, and you should have everything you need."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"Alfred Edersheim is a scholar of unique perspective. He was born and raised a Jew but converted to Christianity as a young man. He provides insight into Jewish history and background to the gospel narratives like no one else I've read. A couple of problems with this work though, it can be very hard to reference. When searching for a particular parable or passage you have to search through the chapter headings one by one to see if you recognize the content. Furthermore, Mr. Edersheim is so unbelievably wordy it can be frustrating waiting for him to get to the point, but this is typical of late 19th and early 20th century biblical expositors. Overall this is a must in any self-respecting theologian's library."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This edition is not the complete text.

But judging from many others which I have completed and how this one starts (esp. the areas of focus within each chapter based on the titles of the chapters) I can tell I am going to enjoy these 900 (plus or so) pages as I read through them.

It includes submission to Emperer Tiberius Augustus in Rome as well as the cruelty of Pontius Pilot. If interested in biblical history it is a book at I would recommend.

Van Dulken selects and discusses \\"100 inventions that shaped the world\\", organizing his material within ten chapters to correspond with the ten decades of the 20th century:1900-1910 (e.g. aeroplane, air conditioning, and the vacuum cleaner)1910-1919 (e.g. Formica, neon lighting, and the self-service supermarket1920-1929 (e.g. the bread slicing machine, power steering, and television1930-1939 (e.g. the jet engine, the photocopier, and radar1940-1949 (e.g. the ballpoint pen, the computer, and the transistor1950-1959 (e.g. the geodesic dome, the microchip, and Velcro fasteners)1960-1969 (e.g. implantable pacemaker, the mouse, and the Workmate workbench) 1970-1979 (e.g. the artificial heart, Post-it notes, and the smart card)1980-1989 (e.g. cellular phones, genetic fingerprinting, and the video game)1990-1999 (e.g. cloning animals, fuel cells, and programmable materials)Van Dulken discusses ten different inventions in each of the ten chapters, providing detailed descriptions as well as explanations of the historical context in which each was devised and by whom. In the Introduction by Andrew Phillips, the reader is told that the inventions highlighted in this book \\"have benefitted people of virtually every nation. Some have helped combat the despair of disease, poverty, excessive (even unendurable) labour. Other inventions -- though less illustrated by this book --have contributed to the ravages of war. What comes forth so often, however, from the examples described here is the individuality and initiative which characterizes so many inventors who helped change the world between 1900 and 1999.\\" Quite true. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Mokyr's The Lever of Riches and Novak's The Fire of Invention."},{"Title":"Inventing the 20th Century: 100 Inventions That Shaped the World","review":"I've enjoyed this book over the years, both personally and professionally. It's a great book for students who come to the library to do historic patent and invention projects."},{"Title":"Inventing the 20th Century: 100 Inventions That Shaped the World","review":"It is for certain that the world has taken gigantic leaps and bounds during the past one hundred years, making up what we know as the 20th century. Author Stephen Van Dulken successfully summarizes the major historical events and technological breakthroughs, starting with the year 1900 and leading up to 1999, in his enlightening book Inventing the 20th Century. It is an easy, fast, read keeping the reader continuously amused with numerous ground-breaking discoveries and the stories behind them.Dubbing the 20th century as the age of \`energy,' Van Dulken crafts a highly entertaining text, giving us a brief glimpse of 100 influential inventions categorized by decade. During this century, we journeyed into space with invention of the jet engine, split an atom, created the transistor radio, cloned a sheep, and came up with the ideas of wind and solar energy.Each invention is introduced with a one page description of the how the idea came about, describing the patent process, as well as, a facing page of very interesting diagrams. The inventions are prefaced by a two page, stirring, historical, summary of the decade from around the world. Unfortunately, the majority of the history and inventions mentioned in the book are primarily focused in North America and Europe. Understandably, as the international super-powers, resources were more prevalent, as Phillips acknowledges in the introduction. However, it would be nice to see some inventions coming from less powerful areas of the world.As a whole,Van Dulken does a suburb job of giving the reader a panoramic view of the 20th century, re-introducing us to the past 100 years with an emphasis on the creative ideas people have developed. From the invention of the television to the Post-it note, each has impacted the world greatly. Van Dulken has re-invented our history through his book, allowing the reader to visualize how certain innovative ideas have come into existence, some changing throughout the years while others remaining static. Ultimately, we are challenged to meditate on technology and the exciting future before us. Where will we be after the next 100 years? We will just have to wait for Van Dulken's next fascinating book."},{"Title":"Inventing the 20th Century: 100 Inventions That Shaped the World","review":"The author, Stephen Van Dulken, has republished without reference or acknowledgment or prior approval of our substantial research regarding the origins and history of tiddlywinks performed in many prior years by me and Fred Shapiro.

But I find it hard to accept that Silly Putty and the Slinky fall into that category. His 100 inventions include many other inventions of questionable worth and pedigree, including several British ones that few Americans would recognize. In many instances the inventions cited by patents were not the ones that turned into the products that we are now familiar with, and his discriptions were often difficult to follow, in part because the auther writes more like a patent attorney than a historian or storyteller. The stories of many of the most significant inventions were already well known to me ---- their stories have been better told in other books, articles or documentaries that I've seen or read over the years. The more obscure inventions were not presented in any more exciting manner. The fault may have been in the author being limited by the format of one or two pages of narrative for each invention. The overall effect was that of a bland, incomplete and unsatisfying meal.

Fleeing a forced marriage in Scotland, she arrives on the doorstep of Rutleigh Hall seeking shelter as a distant relation, only to find that Knight Dennison, the Viscount Rutleigh, may be worse than the man she fled. True to his dangerous reputation, Knight threatens to toss the penniless, flame-haired impostor out-until she produces the family ring as proof of her identity. Thrust into the role of guardian, the dark, compelling Knight has his doubts about the lovely Scottish lass, who's clearly keeping secrets-but her wit, beauty, and artless grace are hard to resist. When his sister starts husband-hunting for Catriona, the idea of any other man possessing her is suddenly unthinkable. For Knight realizes that there's only one possible groom for her: himself.This description of the plot doesn't do justice to the story. What a terrific bunch of characters-from the nobles to the servants, famliy members and friends, you'll like them all. Catriona has the 'sight', but so does the housekeeper. This is a friendly, happy book. I found myself smiling as I read various parts, mostly between Catriona and Knight. What a nice hero, and when he realizes he loves her, he becomes playful. Even the villians are nice. I hope the author does two more books, one about the brother, James and another about Lamont."},{"Title":"The Husband Hunt (Sonnet Books)","review":"Catriona Grant has fled her home in Scotland and the man old enough to be her father that her brother was forcing her to wed. She arrives at Rutleigh Hall in the middle of the night searching for the cousin who had been so kind to her only to find that he has been killed in the war and Knight Dennison, the Viscount Rutleigh, may be a fate worse than the one she had fled as Knight appears to have taken an instant dislike of her and her unannounced, unconventional and suspiciously late arrival. He doesn't believe her claims of kinship either until she produces a ring given to her by his deceased brother-in-law. Olivia, Knight's kindly sister, recognizes the resemblance of eyes and is only too happy to take her in resolving to help her in any way she can which is to find her a suitable husband. By the light of the day, Knight is surprised to find Catriona quite striking, once the raggedy clothing has been removed and he gets his first good look at her. As his sister and aunt proceed to launch her into society on the husband hunt - Knight fights the knowledge that the only man to possess her must be him!Although, this is a historical romance in nature, I was delighted to find some very magical and whimsical elements with tones of the paranormal genre. The heroine's saucy and irreverent comments to the baiting sarcasm of Knight are extremely funny as they both do the \`mating dance'. The final capitulation of the pompous Knight and very earthy, and straightforward Catriona was wonderful. The household staff, relatives, and friends were all delightfully eccentric and/or irreverent, with some I hope to see with their own stories some day. This book will make you smile a lot while reading if not laughing right out loud.

In abject poverty, she seeks shelter at a third cousin's estate only to learn he died in battle three years ago. His widow, Olivia resides in the home of her brother, Viscount Rutleigh. Seeing her choices being between her brother and the rakish sibling of her cousin's widow, Catriona takes a chance on the unknown because the known is too devilish for her.The Viscount Knight Dennison is suspicious of Catriona's claims of blood to his deceased brother-in-law even though she shows a family resemblance and display a family heirloom as proof. Knight investigates his guest while his sister befriends and offers to sponsor her with local society. Knight holds off tossing out Cat because her presence has revitalized his mourning sibling. Soon he finds himself charmed by this Celtic with the gift of sight falling in love with Cat.Readers need to understand that THE HUSBAND HUNT is an atypical Regency romance though on the surface it contains all the necessary elements of the sub-genre. Instead, the interesting story line includes magical and otherworldly elements that embellish an engaging plot. The characters are a delight as the lead couple is fun to watch as they squabble while falling in love. The support cast comprises of several amusing eccentrics as well as a secondary romance.

The love scenes, for the most part are steamy and engrossing, but at certain times the language used is a bit crude and unromantic. The magic part confused me more than the romance since everyone seemed to readily accept that she was gifted with \\"The Sight\\" and didn't offer the skepticism that would normally be found during that time, or in any time for that matter.

Also, there were several sub-plots that were thrown in that made it confusing.What was the deal with Catriona's uncle and his mysterious assistant? This was some other story entirely. Does the author intend a sequel? Also, Catriona's brother had some serious problems including a missing child who was later found. Again, this was another story.

Good lord, she was like an annoying mother hen to him. The guy couldn't turn around in his own house without his sister and his servants waiting in the wings to berate him. I didn't really care for Catriona's uncle, Murdo. Truth be told, he gave me the creeps. I did like Lamont Montgomery, although I could never figure out if he was supposed to be a good guy or a bad guy. I found that annoying in the extreme, I guess because I liked him and I wasn't sure if I was supposed to like him. The author never made it clear."},{"Title":"A Grue of Ice: 2","review":"I thought this book was OK, but it might really depend on the reader. Personally, I was anxious to read another book by Jenkins after reading A Twist Of Sand. Part of the attraction is the fact that these are action/thriller/mystery stories from decades ago, and it's interesting to check out what people were interested in reading, and what the perspective on heroic characters, politics, history, technology, etc. were. So, for me, this book served up a decent amount of entertainment, with all of that in mind. There's some nice action, and a decent story.But I wouldn't describe it as a tour-de-force, or anything. It's hard to say why (without maybe spoiling some elements)--my criticisms would probably be scattershot and not too deep in any particular instance. I'm just pointing to characters, plot, some descriptions of action and places... Mostly, the book ranges from a little mediocre (on rare occasion) to often pretty good, with most of it falling in-between. But I found it pretty readable, and I'd carefully recommend it to anyone that liked Twist Of Sand (who knows, maybe they'd like this one just as much...).Also, there is one regard in which I can safely point to, and be explicit about, in my \\"criticism\\". Like in a lot of Jenkins's books (I'm discovering), the book uses quite a bit of sailing terminology. If you are familiar with sailing and sailing terms, you might appreciate the book more than I did (there is a lot sailing action, some of which I probably barely grasped). I'm not just talking about port vs. starboard, here--there were quite a few terms I'd never seen before, and Jenkins just assumes that the reader understands them. I chose not to read this book with a dictionary near at hand, and so, for example, \\"bollards\\" would be mentioned, and I'd just keep reading past not knowing what they were."},{"Title":"The Damnedest, Finest Ruins: The Great San Francisco Earthquake and Fire","review":"This is a free ebook that I downloaded.

I am looking forward to the following instalations in this series"},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"A very original and intriguing story of an alien invasion during the height of World War II. These aliens arrive with an overwhelming invasion force and undeniable technological advantages; however, the resourcefulness, deviousness, and unpredictability of humans actually evens out the situation. I can't wait to read the rest of the series!"},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"When Turtledove wrote this book he was writing about a topic that authors have written about many times before. He, however takes it one step further. Instead of having the world at peace with each other he places us in the most devastating war in history. When the powers of the world are forced to co-exist he has written a book that you cannot put down until you finish it. There is a down side to this book however, in the beginning the characters are very slow in developing. As the book progresses they devolop more rapidly with several twists and turns. Bravo, an excellent book that you must read if you are into alternitive history or science-fiction."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"History buffs will find this book more enjoyable than science fiction fans will. Turtledove does not lack much in how he intertwines the historical characters. He does an excellent job with technical knowledge of WWII equipment and machinery. However, the book does have some shortfalls. First of all, it is hard to imagine that a species exists that is able to perfect &quot;cold sleep,&quot; intergallactic travel, and numerous other advancements but is not able to advance further along with its weaponry. There are times, as well, when wording and sentence structure becomes confusing. Nevertheless, after reading the first 50 pages of this book, I immediately ordered the final three installments of the Woldwar series, and I am anxiously awaiting the Colonization series."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Damn good series. Especially enjoyed the alternate-history angle--what-if? Mr. Turtledove is a master at that.I just wish he'd written some aliens with even a little bit of ability/intelligence/luck/you name it. The series starts out with them on top, and they go downhill from there. I've finished the series, and I don't recall a single time that things went their way. Sure they're the bad guys. Sure we want the humans to win. But, PLEASE, give us a bad guy that's a little tougher. Put me in just a _little_ suspense as to the outcome.That said, I still bought and read the whole series. :-}"},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Well, Harry Turtledove certainly squeezes as much mileage as he can from his basic premise, with Nazis, Jews, Soviets, etc. forging uneasy alliances as the Lizards rudely interrupt WWII. Personally, I found that the sub-plots added value, even when they didn't contribute directly to the main thrust of the story; I thought they provided a wide-ranging, epic quality to the proceedings. As the title suggests, the whole idea is a bit of a balancing act. On the one hand, obviously, the Race must be technically advanced enough to have space travel; on the other, they must not be too advanced (if they were, they might simply seed our atmosphere with nanobots or retroviruses, and we would have a whole different story.) The difficulty, I think, lies not with the level of technology but the familiar form it takes, ie. helicopter gunships, submachine guns. For a more imaginative angle, check out Harry Harrison's West of Eden trilogy, where dinosaur-descended humanoids have evolved a biotech-centred approach, modifying living creatures to produce analogues of troop carriers, guns, cameras, etc. Something along these lines would have been more plausible, perhaps."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Everybody seems to either love or hate this book--personally, I love it. Though we all know how the series will end, it's the journey that matters. And what a journey Turtledove takes us on--full of twists and turns, and clever observations, which make this quite a page-turner. I almost never read sci-fi and I think this book is awesome--that should tell you something about it; it's not just for sci-fi freaks. This is not Turtledove's best, though--Guns of the South is a better outing, but not by much."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"This book is about the struggle between an alien race, known as the &quot;Race&quot;, and the Earth in 1942. The &quot;Race&quot; makes an attack against the World which is right in the middle of World War 2. The different countries of the world have to join together to fight this evil. The book is set around a large group of characters, who are all around the world. They include a girl in China, U.S. minor league baseball player, Russian women who flies planes, etc. There are also 3 alien characters. The action is intense at times. I plan to read the rest of the series, and also recommend the book Guns of the South, which I am currently reading."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Harry Turtledove, master of alternate history, shows his flair for writing with this tome. This book shows what would have occurred had aliens attacked the Earth during World War II. Turtledove's grasp of history shines through with his treatment of major figures (FDR, Churchill, etc.) and weapons. Among the strange things that occur (and they are legion) is a British bombing raid protected by GERMAN fighters. In this first of the Worldwar series, the aliens attack and the Earth desperately tries to unite to repel the otherworldly invaders. Read this book."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"This is clearly one of the best books I've ever read, and one definitely notices that Turtledove has done quite a lot of research before writing this book, and it may be difficult to read for those who haven't got a clue as to what WWII was. I loved this book! When &quot;the Race&quot;'s nuclear ship was bombed I found myself shreiking with fierce joy! In the middle of WW II, an alien invasion fleet attacks Earth. However, the aliens expect armored knights to come against them, not armored panzers. The aliens technology are still superior, however, and humanity are in for quite a rough time. This is a must for every SF fan!"},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"The concept of this book (and the series to which it belongs) is, as far as I know, unique. Though Turtledove had already been known for alternate histories, throwing in an alien invasion makes automatically doubles as a sci-fi. This concept was what drew me into reading it, though I have not picked up either genre in several years.One problem that any alien invasion plot must defeat is how any civilization that is capable of travelling the stars could possibly find conquering the human race a challenge. Turtledove attempts to solve this problem by explaining how slow non-humans are to advance their own technologies. As plausible as this may seem, one still wonders how such aliens must advance at all beyond their 100,000 year head start. To further soften the alien advantages, however, Turtledove has his aliens still reliant on bullets, helicopters, and tanks. We are expected to believe, then, that an interstellar empire still hasn't discovered means of defense more elaborate than, say, 21st century technology.Such problems aside, however, one can see that Turtledove's contrivance is, nevertheless, superior to any other that has been used. Clearly, laser shooting, anti-grav using, teleporting aliens wouldn't have taken more than a week to annihilate the planet, and there would be no book to write. Keeping this in mind, one becomes more forgiving of the idea.The historical details, Turtledove holds a PhD in history, are the real gems to be found in the book (and series). The reader will become more familiar with German Panzers and T-34's and other such tanks, as well as other kinds of weapons, in a way that might not have have interested him/her before. The characters are many and varied, and each has his/her own tone that seems suited to ethnicity and gender.I hope the rest of the books are as good as this one and do not get bogged down in the mundane aspects of war. War, as many commentators have noted, contains long stretches of boredom between brief horrific acts. Novels about war should not imitate that reality too well. So far, I have not been bored."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Worldwar: In the BalanceThe book was great but the kindle edition contains ALOT of editing errors that really should not exist considering the pricing. Moat of the Turtledove books I have read on the kindle suffer from the same problem."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"When I read Guns of the South by Turtledove, I was disappointed that the &quot;alteration&quot; was caused by time travellers smuggling AK-47s to the Confederacy. I'm enjoying The Great War tetrology much more because the &quot;alteration&quot; is a natural re-writing of a historical event. So I didn't have high hopes when I saw WWII was to be altered by an alien invasion. BUT THIS BOOK IS GREAT! Turtledove takes the oldest cliche in pulp sf-the invading lizard race- gives it twists and turns and drops it into WWII. My sense of wonder was 1st stirred when it was revealed in the prologue that the lizards , although more highly advanced than humans, progressed at a much slower rate. The aliens , who think they are invading a nomadic bow and arrow culture, find us with radio, flight , and explosives. Now they realize they have to kick tail fast or the earth will be counterattacking their home world much sooner than they can devise appropriate defenses. There are the requisite reality figures-mostly world leaders and a slew of characters so large there is a dramatis personae given. The action hops from China to the US to Poland to space as we catch every facet of the struggle from different viewpoints. Every character has a unique insight into the War, Mr. Turtledove has provided an excellent way to escape from the real world for a day or 2. Now, excuse me, I have to sign off and begin part 2, Worldwar:Tilting the Balance."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"This is the first Harry Turtledove offering I've read, and I must say that I am impressed. I usually read Science Fiction, and mostly Military SciFi at that; so mixing Alternate Military History with Aliens from other worlds isn't that different from what I normally choose to read.To be honest with you, the quality of this story is actually above what I normally read - the characters are better developed and more varied than in most Military Scifi books. The aliens, their culture, and and their level of technology are believable.This is neither a \\"quick read\\", nor a \\"slow read\\"... I found it to be evenly paced, with each chapter containing enough intersting material to keep things interesting. Indeed, the ability of Mr. Turtledove to crank things out at such an even pace is almost eerie - with each Chapter coming in consitantly at almost exactly 28 pages.A few \\"warnings\\" about content: 1) There is a decent amount of sexual situations and scenes, but they are well done, and fit within the storyline. 2) This being a military-oriented book, there is of course a fair amount of violence and bloodshed. 3) This book does not contain an \\"ending\\", as it is part of an ongoing series."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"I have to admit, I approached this series with some trepidation. However, once I started reading these excellent books, I was hooked.Harry Turtledove does a great job of taking historical based fiction (World War II) and weaving in an entertaining science fiction story. Without giving too much away, the general plot is that in the midst of WW2, an alien race determined to conquer the earth for future colonization arrives, forcing enemies to unite against a newer, far deadlier foe. This book is the first in a series that chronicles that struggle.Turtledove has a huge cast of characters from just about every corner, and army, of the world. We see the war unfold through the eyes of these characters, both human and alien. Despite the large numbers, Turtledove manages to weave subplots and characters together to create an engrossing, entertaining story.This is one of the better alternate history stories I've read. If you're a fan of sci-fi and history you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"... This series, which runs well over 2000 pages, could havebeen edited into 600 pages and been an OK read.These books are among the most painfully repetitive you'll ever read - for several reasons. First you can actually start the series anywhere, at any chapter, and within two chapters have the entire backstory - he repeats what's happened so frequently. Then within one 100 page spread late in the series, I counted 12 different times characters, when having an alcoholic beverage, commented a) on its poor quality (i.e. &quot;this is what passes for beer these days&quot;) and b) it's better to have this than nothing. ...Finally, the author has this annoying habit of unnecessarly explaining what a character really means when they've said something - and often in excrutiating detail. ...The biggest disappointment: ... The bookcovers of the series feature military and political leaders. I imagined gripping scenes at the executive leadership level - grand strategic and tactical discussions, and the fireworks between these leaders when ideologies clash as they attempt to solve the alien threat. Awesome.Alas, we are only given fleating glimpses of these figures, usually from a distance, and instead we trudge through with uninteresting sidebar characters who are remarkably alike.This was a brilliant concept. I hope someone else does it right."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"I have purchased this book in paperback and loved it, liked it so much I wanted it on my kindle as well, so much that I was willing to pay the price set by the publisher. The publishers claim that just as much expense goes into converting these books into eformat as it does to print them. Well.....I find this hard to believe since I am finding so many spelling errors in the ebook format. Looking at the errors I am finding they are simple OCR errors, so they have paid some intern, or got the intern for free, and had him scan the books in. Did anyone check for errors, no way could they have, im only 120 pages in and already I have found 38 errors. So the next time you hear the publisher cry that they want more money for ebooks, cite this one as an example.

An interesting read, but nothing that would change the genre. The plot details an alien invasion that takes place in WWII. It's not the curb stomp you'd expect though, as the aliens have been living in a peaceful society and have no notion on how to fight a proper war.While most of the characters are interesting to read, I do wish there were a bit less POV characters. You never really spend enough time in this book with any one character to really connect with most of them. Although, since the author is trying to tell a story on a global scale, it's a bit understandable.What really let's this book down though is the EBook version. It's evident that after they scanned the book, they only did very cursory editing, if they did any editing at all. The book is filled with random punctuation. An extra comma or period there... A missing comma or period there... There were also at least a couple of times where the scanner evidently had problems with the small case \\"r,\\" leading to cases of someone saying \\"sit\\" instead of \\"sir.\\" There was also at least one case of \\"Whatevet.\\" These distractions constantly forced me out of the book to try to make sense of certain sentences. It was like I was reading a pirated copy, only instead I actually paid money for it and bought it off Amazon.That said, I did enjoy the book enough to purchase the sequel, and it doesn't seem to have nearly as many errors."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Love the book, is well worth the time and money spent, however, the kindle version is extremely poor as it is filled with typos and missing/incorrect punctuation that makes reading a chore. Thankfully, Turtledove's content and writing style make for a gripping experience that invites the reader to continue turning pages. When I finish this book, I doubt I'll buy the kindle versions of the others, but instead will go back to dead tree versions for greater readibility (even though I'll have to sacrifice the convenience of my ebook device).Harry Turtledove = 5 starsAmazon Kindle version = 1 star"},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"I'd never read any of Turtledove's work until this book but now he's got me hooked.

Even given that they were the type that might like our planet, the similarities in technology, physical sturcture, and psychology to that of humans is hardly greater than that of the Klingons (sp?) in Star Trek. But assuming that they evolved the way we are told they did, the book is quite good.The action is quite believable, with a few lucky breaks for each side, but nothing that defies reason. The author describes WWII techniqes and technologies, and historical events very precisely, and if he's faking any of it, it's good enough for me. The character interaction, while not remarkable, was interesting at times. The aliens were always confused about how humans worked, and their discussions were very repetitive, but this can be forgiven because the aliens are supposed to think and act slowly. The writing had a few gramatical and structural flaws, but was acceptable in general. Had a few unnecessary scenes. Don't expect anything of a conclusion.Series looks to be over 2,000 pages in length. Recommended for anyone with a taste for battlefield tactics, a somewhat open mind, and a lot of time on their hands."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"The first Turtledove book I read was 'Guns of the South' which is a single volume story. It was entertaining with a decent finale.IMHO, Turtledove wrote each of the four 'World At War' volumes for the sole intent of sucking the reader into buying the next volume.Then, at the end of volume IV, there's no conclusive ending with the sole purpose of sucking the reader into buying the next SERIES.What a waste of my time and money."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"The first 50 pages of the book pulled me into the story, but after that the book became a little hard to follow.

They spendt 90% of their time having sex, with the aliens forcing their captives to have sex, because they didn't reproduce sexually and were doing 'research'.

Also, the technology, the personalities of the main (fictional) characters, etc. felt right.On the flip side, as science fiction, this series fails. The alien race is cliched.

Lots of characters, locations, and situations to play out. The story proceeds as a collection of point-of-view episodes between numerous characters; the style used by Stephen King and Larry Niven, which I like. The technology and history are clearly thoroughly researched - great attention to detail. The multiple characters add interest too (though several chars seem alike with their partisan-for-a-day attitudes). Good storytelling and classic post apocalyptic material keep the pages turning. A couple points to ponder, however. A little info on the alien aims would be nice, Yes, they're taking over the planet for their colonists but surely there's more strategy than that. Battles occur in random areas (any strategic goals or do the lizards simply fight wherever they land?), no word given about the resources the invaders have, etc. Also, there's a curious lack of tension throughout the book. The author clearly picked human/alien technologies for their balance so that the outcome could go any way (I suppose). So how come there's no real suspense or foreboding when reading this? Part of it is the author tells instead of shows. He tells of atomic bombs being used on cities but, as the events are simply referred to, there's none of the horror one would associate with using such weapons. Tied to this is the inept, comical actions of the lizards that other reviewers have already mentioned. One gets the feeling that the lizards don't have the stomach for this fight and the rest of the story may bog down. So why 5 stars after that bellyaching? Again - interesting storyline, good writing style, and a well researched read.

Each subplot was mentioned in each chapter and many had nothing to do with the main plot. Made you wonder why they were written other that to just fill paper.Turtledove missed a good opportunity here to write a classic science fiction novel. He would have been better off to mention his idea to someone else and let them write a 600 page novel than meander through 2400 pages himself.Yup, still read three of the four books and he is spending the royalies he made off me!"},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"We are called on to hope for success by the Wehrmacht without changing our mind about whether they were good or bad. That's a good bit like the real life dilemma we faced when Stalin and the Soviet Red Army went up against the Nazis and our future depended on their success. The space stuff is a stretch but if you enjoy science fiction, not far fetched for that genre: reptile life forms that evolved slower than us have a more advanced technological base and they come to Earth from a distant place in order to conquer. They had scouted us and knew that we were still had low tech cavalry and foot soldiers with pointy weapons but arrive during WWII and are surprised to find tanks and planes, automatic weapons and evolved tactic.Turtledove's superior knowledge of historic events and his interest in the small events on which the large ones hinge is a spectacular plus. Other reviewers have agreed that his characters are rich and full and believable so ... maybe it's just me ... I was often bored by the dialogue and much of the other writing that was clearly intended to created and evolve those characters. I thought the same in this and other books he's written but his ideas are so good (Guns of the South is perhaps even better) that that can be overlooked for a good while ... but sometimes you just plead with him to get on with the story. Still ... having an historian in charge of the storytelling of an alternate history has benefits even less-than-believable characters can't undo ... well, at least in the science fiction realm, at least for me."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"The story was very good - a great idea that fused historical events and people with a wonderful &quot;what if&quot;. It's definitely worth reading, but only if you are willing to wade through it. In order to follow events as they progressed on every corner of the Earth, Turtledove keeps subplots running all over. A few in the US, one in China, two in Russia, one in Germany, One in Poland, one in Japan, one in Britain, and two or three with various of the alien invaders. (I may have missed one or two.) The subplots sometimes interact, giving some solidity to the work as a whole, and the effect is that world events are traced throughout the war in a remarkably wholistic way, considering the magnitude of the &quot;whole&quot;. The effect is that while being wonderful, the story is very, very drawn out. Turtledove also has a habit of hitting the reader over the head repeatedly with the same ideas. Everytime we have a scene with Atvar, the big alien fleet commander, he manages to state, yet again, the conflicts and position of the alien invaders, and exactly why the aliens were so surprised to find humanity so technilogically advanced when they attacked. There were times that I wanted to shout at him, &quot;Yeah, I get it already!&quot; Still, for all that it takes a long time to wade through the story, it is a very good one, so if you have (or are willing to take) the time to read it, I would recommend it."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Great altrernate history. A thorughly enjoyable read. Some reviewers have complained about the multiple threads in this series, but they are skilfully and enjoyably done. Great characters and the technological contrast between the humans and the Lizards are very well done"},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"I couldn't put this down. I hadn't realized it was a series till near the end when things obviously weren't going to wrap up in a few pages. I was both frustrated and overjoyed when I reached the end of this book. Overjoyed because there were sequels to read, frustrated because I didn't have them! Amazon will take care of that. :-)"},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Once I picked up this book I couldn't put it down, an exciting vision of what WWII might have become if it were disrupted by an alien invasion. Anyone who likes history or science fiction should definetly read this book."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Turtledove's talents are quickly realized when reading the World War series. His ability to combine history and science fiction have never been more apparent. The series shows the worldwide reaction to invasion while retaining the personal aspect of war. Readers understand not only what a character does but the motivations behind his/or her actions. The action does slow at times, and I couldn't help but notice a similarity betweens the aliens and our own technology. However, anyone who enjoys alternative history and/or science fiction and who has a little time to spend should find the World War series very entertaining"},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"In this saga of alternate history, Turtledove somehowmanages to create a fine blend of fact and fiction,pinpointing a &quot;what-if?&quot; in time. The characters arerealistic, the plot is unpredictable, and the conceptsare mind-boggling. It's as if Turtledove has taintedthe pages with some narcotic, urging us to read on.I would give this book to anyone interested in militaryhistory, alternate timelines, or World War II in general."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"The book is not bad, but the Kindle version is full of typos, about one per screenful. I'm guessing the book was OCRd badly. The result is hard to read."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"My thoughts about both this book and the whole series is of two minds. First, it's a great piece of mindless summer blockbuster type destruction, (...) this series was in desperate need of a chainsaw-swinging editor, because there's massive amounts of bloat in it. I've read the books several times, but after the first time I definitely do a 'reader edit' and skip whole sections of the books as not worth the time to read, as well as the ridiculously frequent flashbacks.There are some deficiencies, I think, in how people respond to the alien invasion - much like the Germans and the British, the US hadn't seriously pursued jets for reasons similar to the ones Turtledove ascribes to the RAF and Luftwaffe, but an alien invasion would have lit a fire under Lockheed's butt the same as it did to Turtledove's Germans and British; there are also the underfunded US and (even more so) German programs developing crude SAMs which would have also been kicked into high gear by sheer necessity. (...) But that's minor stuff...I do agree with the aliens not being able to invade their grandmother's kitchen, too; some kid plucked at random from his computer would probably do a far better job than Atvar or any of the other Lizards in strategizing."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Harry Turtledove's \\"World War - In the Balance\\" series weaves a vast tapestry of unforgettable historic and fictional characters set in the backdrop of WWII. In an alternate version of history starting in 1942, an armada of alien beings invades the Earth, equipped with what we moderns will readily recognize as Space-Age weapons and technology, such as integrated circuits, smart bombs, supersonic jets, night vision, etc. Mankind, ill-equipped in comparison, fights back valiantly with tools that \\"The Race\\", as the aliens call themselves, are unfamiliar with - spontaneity, initiative, craftiness, and all-too-human lowdown treachery.This huge four-volume epic spans the entire globe as human cultures struggle to find common ground on which to oppose the ultimate foe. The pre-existing conflicts on Earth at the time, such as China's civil war, involving Chiang's Nationalist Chinese Kuomintang versus Communists versus the invading Japanese, provide for endless conflict and lively stories and substories throughout the series.Despite the sheer magnitude of the effort, Turtledove, like a master juggler, makes it look easy, and keeps all the balls in the air as the plots and subplots progress, and they never get boring. The series is such a pageturner that at the end, my only disappointment was that there was nothing left to read. It's really that good.You'll be rooting for characters both factual and fictional, human and alien, as master storyteller Turtledove gets inside the heads of all his characters, and shares their outlook with you.\\"World War - In the Balance\\" is an immensely entertaining and satisfying read, and will delight both history and science fiction readers. Very highly recommended! Be sure to read \\"The Guns of the South\\", another masterwork by this ace storyteller."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"A lesson you should learn from this book: If you're married and there ever is an invasion of your country (or the planet for that matter), and a mission of national security, which will take you away from your spouse, happens to fall on your lap... don't be a fool and refuse to take it! The only thing that will happen is that your wife/husband will think you are dead and her/his love for you and sorrow will be so great that to honor your fading memory (even though you're still alive but delayed because of the invaders) she/he will end up having VERY lustful sex and marring the first person that happens by. The worst part is that this is not the plot of the story and it's just to fill paper. I do agree with other reviews that state that an interplanetary race would necessarily have far grater technology than what we have at the end of the 20th century. At the very least shoot at us some lasers instead of old fashioned bullets, please! The two stars I gave it are for the idea. An alien race invading during the middle of W.W.II. The other three are lost for failing to live up to the potential of it."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Turtledove's usually good for thought-provoking alternate history. In this book, we get to see the human race through the eyes of aliens.While he's no C.J. Cherryh (in my view, the ranking master of alien creation in SF), the author comes up with a pretty interesting race. He gets around the globe a bit, providing us a less Americocentric look at how the various WWII combatants might have dealt with an alien invasion right around the time of Stalingrad. Logistical issues are covered sensibly for both sides. I tend to think he gets too many subplots going, but this isn't as much of a difficulty here as I found it to be in his WWI books. He maintains a good level of suspense and is rarely predictable.Not a must-read, but worth the time and money."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"A lot of militaristic action, even a history trip, this alternative history book will give You hell of a ride. One time you will feel like in a WW2 reality, and another time, like in a sci-fi one. The battles and the militaristic stuff is written well also."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"I've read a couple of Harry Turtledove's excellent short stories, so I knew I was in for a treat when I started reading. Other than a couple of minor slowdowns in the plot, it does make me want to get the next book in the series."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"I happened to read WorldWar:In The Balance right after reading the new WWII novel The Triumph and the Glory, and it was very interesting to compare Turtledove's speculative fiction about the war with Rustad's superb historical fiction novel. Anyway, In The Balance was fascinating, although perhaps a little long."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Well, I got mixed feeling about it. The story has got a lot of potential but I think it got ruined by too much filler text. Mostly the non-plot-advancing sex the author keeps throwing in there. I really did not need to know that the old Jewish guy likes to spoon his wife while locked up in the cellar. There is only one case where having sex is relevant to this story. The Chinese woman and the baseball player are the only couple whose sex is part of the development of the story. If the author spent more time advancing the plot instead of the filler, the ending would of better.In the end I felt like saying 'Thats it?'. Instead of carrying all the story threads over to the new book, the author should of finished half of them off and started fresh ones in the second book. I have a feeling that the author will probably start new threads and add to the already bloated pile of threads.But I did like all the interesting conflicts of ideas and points of views between the humans and the lizards. Humans are sneaky and like to fight dirty. I give this book a 3 out of 5 because the intrigue of what will the filthy humans do next will keep me buying books from this series."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Herman Wouk's &quot;Winds Of War&quot; and A.C. Crispin's &quot;V&quot; are a couple of my favorite books, but it never occurred to me anyone might fuse the two concepts. Imagine World War II interrupted by an invasion from outer space! The trick is not to expect the level of writing of Wouk or Crispin. The arrogance of the invaders makes you want to say &quot;aw come on&quot; at times, plus there's a bit of a John Wayne aspect to many of the heroes (&quot;aw come on&quot; yet again). Plus, you have to have a tolerance for long-format fiction. All in all, not too shabby. I ordered both of Turtledove's Civil War titles before I'd gotten through the second of the four volumes. Gather what you will from that."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"I enjoyed the book, although a lot of parts were very thinly plotted. The historical background is really lacking in detail. If you are looking for a more in depth WWII alternate history, try Robert Harris &quot;Fatherland&quot;. The book is written in a Tom Clancy style (10 groups of characters with the action rotating through each group until they start to come togehter) and is entertaining but doesn't cover a lot of new ground."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"It seems possible that Harry Turtledove has tried to invent a war of modern day armys technologicly supperior.
