The story is at times intense, but the ending provides no punch. You finsh the book with a feeling of &quot;Why did I even read this thing?&quot; I would suggest Turow's other books..."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The characters were fairly dull and the author used a narrative that lay-people may not easily follow. I think the story was compelling but not enough to keep me intrigued. I certainly will try another of Scott Turow's novels."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"Scott Turow knows how to bend the language to suit his purpose. He shapes it to create his characters. He peers into their minds, their foibles and weaknesses.His narrative edges into the dark recesses of human sexuality, the arrogance and self-doubts of the lawyerly class and how it impinges on each of us. (Which of us hasn't lapsed into forbidden places and trembled before the might of The Law that kept us from it?)Turow packages it within the limits of The Law, even as he recognizes what a corrupt cesspool it is. His characters are flawed, just like the person on the street, people lurking and peering at each other.Yet there is a sameness to his characters: women lawyers flooded with venality, be they lesbian or libidinous heterosexuals. Furious women populate his narrative.His panting male suitors obligingly deliver the goods, even as they wallow in their pitiful shame, chippying on their sad, outraged wives, who find them pathetic.There are no men to be admired, especially the protagonists, no matter how lofty their claim to high-mindedeness. They squiggle around in the gutter. It's a lousy depiction of men."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"This fiction lacks page to page suspense. The reader is taken into a Jewish family, where the main character, Stern, does not know anybody except his colorful, scheming, affluent brother in law. His son, daughters, son in law and especially his wife of decades are strangers to him. So are his close neighbors. Yet Stern is a successful lawyer, must have a reasonable amount of intelligence, one should hope. An unlikely situation, but entertaining enough. It seems like he really doesn't want to know what makes his family tick but stumbles into their secrets. Rude awakenings! That would be a better title, because the legal aspects of the book read like murky morass. I think the author failed his burden of proof to convince me, that this is a good novel. His style is tiresome to read, however the proof is there, that fiction has no limits, because it demands no burden of proof. Rude awakenings for fans of this author, I assume! Gerborg"},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"This wasn't worth reading. Scott Turow has plunged a long way from the excellence of _Presumed Innocent_. I'm bummed I spent money on this book. I gave it away to the library swap rack."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"I had previously read Scott Turow's PRESUMED INNOCENT and was a bit underwhelmed. I titled my review of that book 'A Time Waster - Nothing More.\\" Then why read THE BURDEN OF PROOF? I guess I just wanted a time waster.I succeeded. This book certainly is a waste of time.Sandy Stern, defense attorney in PRESEMED INNOCENT, takes center stage here. But Turow over-reaches. Apparently forgetting that he is a writer of legal thrillers rather than Tolstoy or even Hemingway, Turow tries to do more than present the fun and lightweight murder story with a twist. Instead, he tries to draw us in (and if we are suckers, we follow) to a world of intricate legal complexities surrounding the suicide of Stern's wife. Ya know, maybe it's me, but some of those intricacies, such as the the defense of securities fraud claims, just did not grab me with the same force as, say, a man accused of murdering his lover only to find out that his wife did it instead.Ok, maybe I should look at this book not as a legal thriller, but as a dramatic novel that happens to involve lawyers? But again, it just does not live up to it. The complexities, plot twists and interweaving storylines are more likely to make one either confused or, worse, bored, than they are to provide a coherent plotline that a reader cares about. The characters come off as a bit hollow despite Turow's attempt to explore their inner lives, and the result is just a tired mess.This is the problem for Turow. Although an adequate mystery novelist, he seems, at least here, to want to be so much more. I have not read any works of his published after THE BURDEN OF PROOF, and probably never will, but based on this clumsy attempt, like the guy at the end of the bar pontificating about what's really wrong with this country, he not only isn't up to the standard he thinks he is, he isn't even close."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"The plot is interesting and one that could have made for excellent reading. However, the writer made one fundamental mistake which every lawyer tends to make from time to time. He had to show off his knowledge of &quot;big words&quot;.Unless the writer intended for this book to be read by scholars only, my advice to the average Joe is to ensure that he has a dictionary opened when he begins to read because the plot is buried in grandiloquence.I am myself an attorney and an English major and I found this book tough reading because I was basically stumbling over unnecessarily big words which made it difficult to appreciate the plot fully.A great writer is able to get his ideas across in uncomplicated language. It is after all a work of fiction, not a dissertation."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but people looking for a typical terse, thrilling courtroom or legal thriller may find that this one is deeper than what is typical for this genre.This book is more like a novel with very developed, deep characters, who have very complicated issues, all of which are essential to the story. It's a novel about the lead character, Sandy Stern, who happens to be a lawyer, and who does get entangled in a legal mess as the result of his wife's suicide, but the legal tangle and it's solution is not really the point. The major theme of the novel seems to be that appearances are deceiving, that people within the same family often work at cross purposes, and that even what seems to be direct communication can be totally misinterpreted. Sandy Stern is deceptive and deceiving, and so are all his family, friends and aquaintances. As he uncovers secret after secret he realizes how his life and everyone in it is largely a reflection of his own behavior.Turow is a much better and deeper writer than others in the &quot;legal thriller&quot; genre he's lumped in with."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"Scott Turow writes literature. Like John La Carre, the joy of reading his works lies in the journey through the book. Characters come alive; scenes are rich with description. Though not stream of consciousness novels, we are able to witness the thoughts of the actors, and discern their emotions as well as their understanding of life. In reading the \\"Burden of Proof \\" I often forgot that I was reading a mystery. To many readers that may be seen as a novelistic flaw, but to me it was a source of pleasure.Sandy Stern has to cope with losing his wife who has committed suicide. How does a middle aged man make his way through this tragedy? How does a reserved, formal lawyer re-enter the world as a single man? How does he manage to legally represent his adventuresome, risk taking brother-in-law? These are a few of the challenges he faces.Yes it is a mystery; a double one in fact. One sub-plot involves the federal investigation of his brother-in-law for some questionable futures trading. Some readers may find this less interesting than the typical legal thriller where the protagonist is faced with defending a suspected murderer (as in Turow's \\"Presumed Innocent\\"). The other sub-plot concerns a medical mystery surrounding the death of Stern's wife.This is not a book for lovers of heart pounding, action thrillers. It is a story where you savor the quality of the writing; where you enjoy the development of the characters, and where you take pleasure in the scenes and setting of the story.One complaint I've come across in reviews of various books is the comment that the author could have told the same story in less than half the actual pages. Turow could have written this novel in half the actual 570 pages, but then we would have missed the beauty of the story as he wanted to tell it. One reviewer of this book indicated that Turow was trying to show his knowledge of the dictionary. That puzzles me; I didn't have to look up a single word, and I'm sure you won't have to either.If you like both fine writing, and a good story Turow can't be beat."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"Scott Turrow took me on a trip that was amazing. One hundred pages before the end of the book I put it down and figured out the ending. It turned out that I &quot;figured out&quot; exactly what Sandy Stern did, but both of us were wrong. This book is the model for legal thrillers. I've read the book three times. I'm upset with myself for lending it out and not getting it back. I need to order another copy from amazon.com because I discover an entirely new dimension every time I read it. Enjoy..."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"Written as a loose sequel to \\"Presumed Innocent,\\" this novels takes us into the world of legal drama in the very capable hands of a true master of this genre. Though not as gritty or compelling as it forebarer, this work does bring vivid, realistic and personable characters to life in a way only Turow can.The tables have now turned and Alejandro Stern, ace defense counsel now must face trial for an unspeakable crime. The evidence and tension mounts as his former client, and former prosecutor battles to clear his friend's name in the pool of fascinating characters and locales of Kindle County.This book is not \\"Presumed Innocent\\" for those who enjoyed that book. It is a great effort and very entertaining. A bit longer and more ponderous, it is still a tremendous story and flawlessly written. I say it is a must read. It is far better courtroom fiction than most Grisham novels. Deserving of Five Stars, a good read and a great novel."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"This was my first Turow book to read. It took me awhile to get used to his writing style, but once I did, I was hooked. I was enthralled by the characters and the story line and couldn't wait to find out what happened next. Throughout the first 4/5 of the book, Turow adds many unexpected plot twists that add to the mystery. However, what could have been a great book just turns into an average book because of the end. I guess I expected too much. I wanted to see a totally unexpected surprise that went against everything I thought would happen, but it just never came. Instead, Turow lays out slowly piece by piece the solution to the puzzle. Sure, the ending was not what I expected, but it wasn't a surprise. Turow never gives you time to be shocked or surprised at the ending.I liked this book because Turow does shock and surprise throughout the first part of the book. His characters are well written. I will probably read another of his books, I just won't expect the big surprise ending."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"In \\"Burden of Proof\\", lawyer and novelist Scott Turow returns the character of Alejandro \\"Sandy\\" Stern, the smooth-spoken, Argentine-Jewish defense attorney introduced in the earlier novel, \\"Presumed Innocent\\". In that earlier novel, Stern defended a prosecutor in a high-profile murder case. In \\"Burden\\", Stern now has all the questions. Just when his existence seemed routine enough, Stern returns home from a business trip to find his wife dead - an apparent suicide. Reeling from the loss, Stern must also confront a grand jury proceeding against his client and brother in law, Dixon Hartnell. A web of complex (and suspicious) financial transactions involving futures-trading on Kindle County market run by Hartnell has whet the interest of the US Attorney's office, itself run by a foe of Stern. Though Hartnell is the sort of guy who routinely seems to hover at the edge of indictment for something, the charges now offer the chance of landing the embattled broker in a federal lockup and, because Stern's son-in law works for Hartnell, threaten to tear at the fragile Stern family. Into this mix of family and legal problems, Turow throws in Stern's romancing of his enemy at the US Attorney's office and of a nearby neighbor, his suspicions harbored against a neighbor who may have had an affair with Stern's now dead wife, and the story of his own romance, years ago, with Clara Mittler-Stern.\\"Burden\\" has Scott Turow's great prose and obsessive character dissection, but it's not as enveloping a book as \\"Presumed Innocent\\". The sense of an underlying secret isn't as enticing as the murder investigation in the earlier book, and the characters don't grab you as well either. Most annoying is Stern whose silver-tongued erudition was cute when he was a supporting character in the older book. Dixon Hartnell would have been a more interesting choice of main character, but the plot makes that impossible. Turow dangles the names of characters from the first book just to get our attentions (ex-PA Ray Horgan almost becomes the defense lawyer for Stern's embattled son in-law; Rusty Sabich is referred in passing as \\"Judge Sabich\\"; the specter of the corrupt Mayor Augie Bolcarro seems to hang like a smog over Kindle County) but remains it's own book. Even the fictional choice of legal venue seems troublesome - exchanging the Kindle county court in \\"Presumed\\" with the anonymous Federal Court here. Kindle County, which seemed so real and unique in the older book seems just another mid-west city. The nivel concentrates instead on the byzantine relationships of its main characters, but after you've finished, you wonder why you should care. This is a pretty good novel, but it loses something and suffers in comparison to its prequel."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"I put off reading this book for some time because it looked like too much work. I've enjoyed many Grisham novels and wanted to try out some other legal thrillers and see what they were like. Turow is a good writer, without question, but he lacks, at least in this book, some of the flash or pizzaz I was hoping for after reading others. This novel is definitely not a page turning thriller, but it is a solid story.Some of the legal complications get hard to follow unless you have at least a minimal grasp of how financial markets work, but basic evil is usually pretty easy to spot so don't let the setting throw you off. Turow obviously works at his craft with some measure of pride, so I don't count the few words and/or concepts that are over my head get the better of me, the context makes the actions plain enough.So the real question is do I give this book a recommendation? Well, yes. It's an entertaining mystery/legal setting type book and while it doesn't read with the same speed and ease of some others, it's still worth checking out."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"If you enjoy reading a \\"novel\\", read Turow; if you prefer comic books, read Grisham or Patterson, or the rest of said ilk. This is a complex story of a middle-aged man, who loses his much-loved wife to a mysterious suicide. Turow develops the personalities of his characters, and weaves a multi-faceted plot line, just as occurs in real-life circumstances. \\"Burden of Proof\\" is one of the best novels I have ever read, and quite different from \\"Presumed Innocent\\", which most folks know from the Harrison Ford movie."},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"Since I am relatively new to Scott Turow, I continue to be amazed by his writing. The story has been well described by others. While it is a very interesting story, what make this book (and his other books as well) exceptional is the depth of emotions and the insights of individual characters about themselves and others. This puts Turow well above other authors on this genre. The Burden of Proof explores the vast range of feeling connected with Sandy Stern's dealing with the suicide of his wife, his family members and friends as well as the very complex and fascinating legal situation of his brother-in-law and how the rest of his family was involved. I found the book to hold my interest from beginning to end. Who knew when reading \\"Presumed Innocent\\" that Sandy Stern would be such an interesting character!"},{"Title":"The Burden of Proof","review":"This is the second Turow novel I've read and I'm hooked. He's an excellent story teller and really knows how to take a plot through unexpected twists and turns. This book is solid evidence of his skills and I recommend it heartily.I know how popular Grisham is and I've enjoyed some of his writing, but I'd rate Turow as easily the better writer. This book has plenty to help me reach that conclusion: family and business deceit, awkward romantic liasons, legal and personal grudges and jealousies, securities fraud, etc. Try it, I'll bet you'll like it."},{"Title":"Methodical Realism","review":"Gilson is the consummate Thomist and this brief but powerful work is possibly his best in print. Gilson sets forth to establish a case that knowledge is not merely conceptual. Intellect, Gilson argues, is based upon an external reality. In other words, the possibility of the intellectual act is due to an external reality. This is crucial for the Thomistic philosopher especially when dealing with Kantian Idealism. Gilson compares Thomistic metaphysics and epistemology with other popular &quot;brands&quot; such as Cartesian and Kantian. Then Gilson delineates the proper starting point philosophically and where certain philosophers have missed the mark. This small book presupposes that the reader has a background in the issues at hand. Thus, if the reader is not prepared to understand the arguments he may get lost in the jargon. However, with the proper understanding of the terms and arguments at hand, this book is a powerful loaded gun. I cannot recommend this particular work enough!"},{"Title":"Methodical Realism","review":"This little book is the best introduction to real philosophy there is. Gilson's \\"realsim\\" grounds the reader firmly in reality. He disdains the philosophies that take us from reality, such as those of Descartes, Spinoza, and Kant.Read the short section at the end, \\"The Realist Beginner's Handbook,\\" once a month for a year and you'll see the world as it is. It's 30 paragraphs of common-sense realism applied to philosophy.For years, used copies sold for $60 or more. Now it's in print again, and on Kindle."},{"Title":"Methodical Realism","review":"Since the late Middle Ages, philosophy has spent more and more time convincing us of how little we actually comprehend the world around us; of how deceptive our perceptions and assumptions are. Ultimately, a great deal (though, of course, not all) of modern philosophy can be described as contemplation of the human subject that serves only to isolate that subject from the world with which it ostensibly interacts.For those frustrated by this situation, or for those, like myself, who find the modern philosophical tradition interesting but exhausting, Gilson is a welcome jolt. His realism is truly a philosophy that can be lived. His treatment of alternatives and criticisms is fair and convincing. To paraphrase C.S. Lewis, just because an idea has gone out of style doesn't mean it's wrong. Gilson's transformation and presentation of the West's medieval philosophical heritage as still relevant is a refreshing alternative to much of what occupies students in today's philosophy departments. Students of philosophy should give Gilson a chance.Physically, the book is tight and well-constructed, but it's what's between the covers that make this a good buy."},{"Title":"Circus Is in Town, The","review":"I remember reading this book to my children 20+ years ago; they enjoyed the words and pictures and I enjoyed reading as they learned to count from one to ten.They are all grown and moved out now, but when I saw this for sale I couldn't resist buying another copy... here's hoping I can read it to my grandkids one day."},{"Title":"Positioning in radiography","review":"The Irish painter Francis Bacon (b 1909 - d.1992)used this book as a source of ideas for some of his paintings."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Desire in the Buddhist Pali Canon (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism)","review":"An excellent read for anyone interested in Bhuddism or even philosophy in general.

Originally published to accompany a traveling exhibit that boasted the largest collection of Maya ritual life ever assembled., the book reflects the mysteries of the Maya.The artifacts collected and displayed from over 3,000 collected are those that were found deep within the waters of the sacred well or cenote located near the city of Chichen Itza(\\"mouth of the well of the Itza\\"). This cenote, deep in the jungle of the Yucatan, is like a mini lake, with sheer vertical walls where the Mayans once stood to offer goods or human life to their gods. Having visited the cenote on a trip to the Yucatan once, it made for one of those memorable occasions that last a life time, a step back in time to a world steeped deep in ancient religion prior to the arrival of the Europeans. The cenote was a sacrificial center where the Mayans paid their spiritual debts and honored their gods with gifts made of gold, jade, copper, pottery, wood, textiles, copal and other materials including the ultimate human offering. The objects collected in this book number over 300 and are detailed in full color and black and white. The magnificent pieces are primarily from the Late Classic\\u0003period(A. D. 690-725) through and including the Postclassic period(A.D. 900-1539). The text that accompanies this beautiful book is highly informative but not in an overly scholarly way. The descriptions of the figures sheds light on the subject for the arm chair archeologist in easly understood language without esoteric jargon. Included is a history on the collector, Edward H. Thompson, beginning with his lowering of a bucket in 1904, the burning of his \\"museum\\" after the Mexican Revolution and the settlement of the Mexican Supreme Court in favor of Thompson's heirs after his death which allowed the Harvard Peabody Museum to publish this book. Besides the absolute stunning beauty of the creations offered and sheer abundance of objects, the salvaged intact pieces are amazing to have survived so many hundreds of years in the depths of the cenote. At it's height the site rivaled a pilgrimage destination similar to Jerusalem or Rome. This is one of those books that can be viewed over and over again for inspiration or reflection on the arts and rituals of the Maya. Highly recomended for archeology , art or history buffs that want a glimse into a seldom seen collection of pieces that were unexhibited in the Peabodty Museum for over seventy years after being brought up from the silt in the cenote in the early 1900's. These are truly treasures that should not be missed if one is interested in the Maya and the Sacred Well."},{"Title":"Cenote of Sacrifice: Maya Treasures from the Sacred Well at Chichen Itza","review":"Breezy but informative text, but the reason for buying this is obviously the photos, which make this worthwhile for those with an interest in Mayan culture, particularly ritual."},{"Title":"Tomatoes: A Country Garden Cookbook","review":"I own this and all the Country Garden series of cookbooks.

It was over the top in that the 'science' behind the spaceship was not at all believable but, on the other hand, it was perfect for the sort of kid whose favorite toy was and old refrigerator box. I suspect kids today may be too 'sophisticated' to really enjoy the book but I consider that to be their loss.If you enjoyed Eleanor Cameron's \\"Mushroom Planet\\" series, I think you might enjoy \\"Rusty's Spaceship\\"."},{"Title":"Burmese for Beginners","review":"Let's face it - Burmese isn't the easiest language to learn. But if, like me, you are serious about learning the language, this book, along with the accompanying language CD, will get you there.

Also important for a book you'll be paging through for months at a time, the book is very sturdily constructed, and my copy is still in rather good shape.This isn't a perfect book by any means (I'd love to have seen far, far more pages on the alphabet, since though everything is covered, it's covered a little quickly), but this book is *so* far ahead of every other commonly available resource on the Burmese language, it easily earns the 5 stars I'm giving it.If you don't have ready access to a native Burmese speaker, I strongly recommend theBurmese for Beginners CDsas well."},{"Title":"Burmese for Beginners","review":"This book is pretty good, although I do have some issues with it. It could cover grammatical points more thoroughly, and it would benefit from expanding its drills to include substitution drills.

I didn't care for all of the stories - which is fine with me; I don't expect to identify with every female on the planet. The writing quality varies. While I presume the editor(s) did a bunch of cleaning up, they did not take away the different voices, which is a good thing. If you are curious about what a modern, Muslim-dominated society looks like, especially from a female (and usually feminist), non-Turkish point of view , this is a great place to start. I suspect readers will be pleasantly surprised. I certainly was."},{"Title":"Tales from the Expat Harem: Foreign Women in Modern Turkey (Seal Women's Travel)","review":"We don't seem to be too knowledgeable about countries in the Middle East area and this book will explode any and all stereotypes holding you back from learning from the Turkish experience of several diverse western women who either live there or have spent much time there. Each story is written by a different woman, usually about a different angle or aspect of the culture, and it is rich with warmth and human kindness and real people. It has certainly inspired me not to be afraid to travel to the region and I will the first chance I get! Captivating writing, delightful, mind-opening stories. Don't miss this book. I passed it along to my daughter. Halfway through, she called and said she was heading to the local Istanbul Cafe (here in the southwest) for lunch and was dying to travel to Turkey!

The stories are all skillfully written, lively and entertaining.However, it is very clear that some of the writers still see Turkey as a foreign land and have failed to observe it from 'inside'. Their stories are full of tourist like observations and foreigners' enthusiasm. These stories are not as interesting as the stories of the women who have written on their experiences in Turkey from 'inside' -- as members of Turkish families who have made an effort to adapt to the ways of the country and learn the language. These stories are fascinating and emotional. Excellent reading.Overall the book gives an excellent insight to the lives of foreign women in Turkey and the complex nature of the Turkish society. I recommend this book to anyone who has a strong opinion, either positive or negative, about Turkey."},{"Title":"Tales from the Expat Harem: Foreign Women in Modern Turkey (Seal Women's Travel)","review":"Not one of the women essayists published in this anthology is a tourist or a casual observer of Turkish culture. Among them are professional businesswomen, teachers, artists, writers, a nurse, a reporter and a Christian missionary. All have lived in Turkey long enough, and behind the patina of tourist romanticism, to have entered into the culture as an active participant. Some have learned Turkish, some have married Turkish men, some have worked independently, and all are excellent writers. They come from an assortment of countries, yet share a basic attitude of receptivness and willingness to explore life beyond the cultural milieux in which they've been raised.This is a book for seekers and students and those who would like to revisit their own experiences with all things Turkish.

Last night I finished it. How completely enchanting and engaging! The voices of all those fabulous women, each and every one of them, reached out to me and touched me. I felt their excitement at exploring Turkey, their anxieties as well, and I also laughed till tears streamed down my face! What a gift this book is!

In some ways Turkish culture is much more conservative than Western culture, yet in other ways, more open, uninhibited! From caring neighbors to overbearing in-laws, relentless male pursuers to protective bus drivers, each story is like an intimate little window into Turkish life and is much more personal than what you'd find in a typical travel book.Aggravating, touching, dramatic, never boring; Turkey beckons me even stronger now than before! ;)"},{"Title":"Tales from the Expat Harem: Foreign Women in Modern Turkey (Seal Women's Travel)","review":"Having just been to Turkey for a couple of weeks, this explained a lot of what we experienced.

Having been in Turkey these past 3.5 years, I thought I had seen and experienced quite a bit of Turkish life and culture, but reading this book opened my eyes to all kinds of new possibilities that are still waiting for me. It's an inspiring collection of the adventures and observations that a medley of women from different nationalities and backgrounds experienced in the past three decades, from touring around Turkey in the 70's to personal accounts of family traditions and even superstitions. I especially enjoyed one woman's account of her neighbours' generosity when she was sick for days and couldn't leave her apartment. They came over in a large group, to stoke up the fire in her woodstove, to clean up her house, to change the sheets on her bed and to make her a healthy breakfast, all in the name of fellow-compassion. When she asked them how they knew she was sick, they told her that they had noticed her absence for a few days and were worried about her. This is just one sample of Turkish caring and hospitality found in this book. I thoroughly loved reading this book for reminding me of all the positive aspects of living in this wonderful country."},{"Title":"Tales from the Expat Harem: Foreign Women in Modern Turkey (Seal Women's Travel)","review":"Tales from the Expat Harem is a lovingly produced book that probably gives a more rounded, fully fleshed-out view of Turkey than any book has managed before. It achieves this through narratives from 29 women who have made Turkey their home, either for a time or permanently, in locations scattered throughout the country. (A helpful map in the front shows each city or village where stories take place.) About half married a Turk. The others were in a relationship that didn't fly, were trying to figure out how to date there, or were trying to navigate life as a single in a country where being alone is seen as a bit odd and sad. This variety of place and experience allows a deeper look into the culture than usual.The quality of the writing is uniformly high, despite the fact that many of the contributors were amateur writers coaxed--and carefully edited--by Ashman and G&ouml;kmen. The two editors each contribute a tale as well: Ashman with a description of her opulent, high-society Istanbul wedding, and G&ouml;kmen with a story about giving her Turkish language skills a workout as she takes a road trip with her American mother. For anyone who wants to get a real feel for what it's like to marry into a foreign culture, or to see how daily life works out while settling into another land, this is an engaging and masterful collection."},{"Title":"Tales from the Expat Harem: Foreign Women in Modern Turkey (Seal Women's Travel)","review":"This book gives magical insight from the perspective of foreign women living and working in Turkey.I would especially recommend this anthology to those who may hold erroneous stereotypes about the Turkey and its treatment of women.So, if you are still saying: \\"Turkey!?

I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Tales from the Expat Harem: Foreign Women in Modern Turkey (Seal Women's Travel)","review":"The one theme I took away from all these articles is the 'hospitality' that this country offers all who visit. Even in the deepest part of the southeast - the hospitality was rich and genuine. There's something here that I can not get my arms around BUT it's positive and it's warm; you can not help but fall in love with the people who live in and represent Turkey.Thank you so much for reinforcing what I already feel and know! NO ONE should miss this fine work."},{"Title":"Tales from the Expat Harem: Foreign Women in Modern Turkey (Seal Women's Travel)","review":"I ordered five book about Turkey to read in preparation for my trip there this coming May, and this was by far my favorite. In fact, I think it's my favorite travel book ever. The book is composed of short essays by various women, mostly American, who have lived in Turkey and you can get a real inside personalized look into the country from their writing. These women don't just give you the history and geography, although there is some of that. They get you into the kitchen, into the bedroom, into the workplace, and into the baths in various locations throughout the country. Their stories are about people and relationships and from reading this book, I feel like I have a much better understanding of the Turkish culture. The tone of the book is conversational, and after reading a couple of books on Turkish history, Tales From the Expat Harem, seemed like talking with friends who happened to all be accomplished storytellers. I would have enjoyed this book even if i didn't have a trip to Turkey on my calendar."},{"Title":"Tales from the Expat Harem: Foreign Women in Modern Turkey (Seal Women's Travel)","review":"Having just returned from vacation in Turkey with the future desire of moving there as an expat, I bought this book to learn what other women have experienced in their adaption to this culture. Each short story is engaging, well-written, and seemingly honest about various cultural experiences from an archeological dig with local villagers to a first-time experience at a Turkish hamam. I appreciate the open-mindedness and courage of these women who give us a personal insight into their lives as foreign women in modern Turkey."},{"Title":"Tales from the Expat Harem: Foreign Women in Modern Turkey (Seal Women's Travel)","review":"I lived in Istanbul for a year, teaching in a Turkish school, a couple of decades ago. This naturally prompted an interest in Turkish life, and so I picked up this volume with interest.While there are tidbits about Turkish life [endless drinking of tea; gracious hospitality; etc.], this volume is less about Turkey than it is about self-discovery on the part of the foreign women who contributed their experiences to this volume. And that is valid -- while many people [non-travelers] believe that expats do it for the excitement, for the opportunity to see sights, living in a foreign environment is more about self-discovery: what about what I believe/do is part of me and unchangeable, what is due to societial restrictions; what am I willing to change, and what am I adamant about holding onto. This is what these contributors write about.The volume is well-written and edited. It is an easy read. Each chapter, by a different contributor, stands independent from the others, so it is easy to pick up and put down."},{"Title":"Tales from the Expat Harem: Foreign Women in Modern Turkey (Seal Women's Travel)","review":"\\"Tales from the Expat Harem\\" was going around our book club. At first I avoided borrowing it, suspecting that the book would turn out to be a disappointment. I needn't have worried: though several of the selections in this collection clearly indulge in romantic embellishments, the book was anything but disappointing. I first came to Turkey in 1989 to meet my mother-in-law, but have raised my family and worked as a musician here for the past 13 years. My friends (some of the other &eacute;migr&eacute;s have been here for almost 40 years!) and I quite enjoyed it, sympathizing and laughing with many of the contributors and their experiences.\\"Tales from the Expat Harem\\" is a \\"well-written and well-edited,\\" fun and almost overwhelmingly positive collection of personal experiences contributed to by many fascinating women from diverse backgrounds. But reader beware: this collection is not for those hoping to read sociology or travel literature; and though the stories, or anecdotes, all take place in Turkey, they aren't really about this country. As the review posted on this site entitled \\"Adventures in Self-discovery\\" points out, Turkey provides a common backdrop for the contributing authors' discoveries about themselves and their own cultures.The unanimously positive reactions to this book [...] indicate that the authors have kindled a sisterhood between themselves and their readers, illuminating a sub-culture of feminist \\"expatriatism\\" (a term evidently used mainly by Americans but which the British find unnecessarily connotative). With a marginal shift of perspective and perhaps a slightly more scientific approach, it seems that further work in this field could acquire even greater meaning and substance."},{"Title":"Three Year Picnic: An American Woman's Life Inside Japanese Prison Camps in the Philippines During WWII","review":"I stopped by the booth at the book fair in November that the publisher of this book put on. Evelyn Whitfield was manning the booth that day. She had sold all the copies of her book, but she was such a warm personality and sold other people's books so well, that I had to order a copy of her book.She wrote the manuscript shortly after her release and return from three years spent in Japanese prisoner of war camps in the Philippines. This was not originally meant to be published as a book, but for some reason she has dusted it off and published it. I suspect the Premiere Editions is a vanity publisher, though I do not know for certain.First off, I must get out of the way that the writing is somewhat amateurish. I might characterize it as something I would write.She tends to write as I would expect someone of her generation who is not a writer would, with much respect for the sensibilities of the people like her. Everyone in her prisoner of war camp holds up rather well under the circumstances. She does not write much about disagreements, and the ones she does write about she laughs off as minor. While not having experienced the horror of a prisoner of war camp, my experience with living in close quarters with people is that arguments are much more serious that one would gather from the plucky crowd who inhabits her camps.But several things do come through the story. The lack of contact with the outside world comes through so much in the story that I found myself wondering if they ever made it out alive. Having met the author, I know that she did. She does not fall into the trap of describing the events taking place outside the camps. As a reader, you have no context to compare against. As I suspect that they had little context in which to place themselves during their incarceration.The absolute precariousness of their position shines through loud and clear as well. One never finds her in the exaggerated position where she is near death due to the capriciousness of a Japanese guard. No guns being pointed at her head. However, subtly she paints a canvas with arbitrary decisions regarding food, shelter, and bowing which show how much at the mercy of others they were.The hope that the prisoners exhibit also is apparent. The internees attach themselves to any rumor that whips through the camp. Sightings of planes. Contact with former employees and acquaintances through camp fences. The disappointment shows when their camp translator is no longer allowed to translate in meetings with the Japanese authority, because she can understand the words they say in addition to the official translation.I highly recommend this book. While not the greatest writing, her story is compelling."},{"Title":"Three Year Picnic: An American Woman's Life Inside Japanese Prison Camps in the Philippines During WWII","review":"This can happen to any of us, let's not forget it.Many don't know what happened to American civilians in the Phillipines during WWII.How inspiring that people like ourselves can survive such unbelievable treatment and then not only live to tell about it but take on the task of humbly sharing the experience in the hope that others, by knowing what can happen, may work towards preventing this from ever happening together.This is a book that I and others I've shared it with, couldn't put down.Recently, at a family reunion, I met a lifetime friend of my wife's family. He was part of the team, crptographer, that rescued Evelyn and the others from the camp. It was fascinating to hear from him more about the conditions found there in the Phillipines.This is well told history, truly interesting history."},{"Title":"Three Year Picnic: An American Woman's Life Inside Japanese Prison Camps in the Philippines During WWII","review":"Mrs. Whitfield writes clearly and interestingly about her three-year internment in a Japanese prison camp during World War II. A far cry from Hitler's barbarism, the camps in the Phillipines carried their share of inhumanity, starvation, and sadness. But Mrs. Whitfield's book gives us a window without bitterness. Her three years were dangerous, exciting, sad, and funny--simplistic adjectives which do not do justice to her special style of writing. For the young and old--and all of us in between."},{"Title":"Three Year Picnic: An American Woman's Life Inside Japanese Prison Camps in the Philippines During WWII","review":"As secretary to the inmates' governing committees, the author had an unusual inside view of their struggles to maintain the health, safety and morale of American and other allied men, women and children held captive over three years in the Philippines, climaxed by the horrible three week battle that destroyed Manila. Accompanied by contemporary photos, sketches and maps."},{"Title":"Three Year Picnic: An American Woman's Life Inside Japanese Prison Camps in the Philippines During WWII","review":"The underlying stress on the daily life of the author and her fellow prisoners is very apparent despite the author's genteel and somewhat oblique manner of description. I imagine that one must avoid full descriptpions of the pain the psyche undergoes in order to maintain a sane perspective. Many people did not survive their prison camp experiences for many reasons. Just think of eight people sharing a 4oz tin of food and thinking how lucky there were to have it! The Japanese were brutal, horrible people in WWII. I lived in the Philippines during some of the VietNam war years and felt as if I lived on another planet despite having all of the conveniences of American life. This book was a treasure read. I contemplated the courage of ordinary people in extreme circumstances as I read it."},{"Title":"Three Year Picnic: An American Woman's Life Inside Japanese Prison Camps in the Philippines During WWII","review":"When I first read the title of this book &quot;Three Year Picnic,&quot; I didn't pay too much attention. And I thought it is a book about someone's vacation story. However, I noticed that there is a subtitle under the title, &quot;An American Woman's Life inside Japanese Prison Camps in the Philippines during WWII&quot; then I realized that it is NOT what I thought. This is a truth story about a young woman, Evelyn Whitfield who spent three years in a prison camp during the Japanese occupation. In the book she portrayed the life in a civilian prison camp (of course it was different from military prison camp). In the camp, prisoners suffered from starvation, lack of medical treatment, mulnutrition, etc. However, I didn't find any in depth torture or physical abused by the Japanese soldiers. That was the good thing in that camp. But I was surprised. This book is not as &quot;horrible&quot; as other wartime stories/memoirs. Then I understood why Evelyn put the book title in that way."},{"Title":"'Gator","review":"I love nature-runs-amok books. However, while this book has plenty of the nature, it doesn't have much amok. Most of the time all the gator does is wander around, try to make up its mind, and wait. It goes to its larder, leaves to contemplate attacking, comes back to the larder to find something stolen, then goes back out again over and over. Whenever the reader thinks the gator will attack someone because he's right next to them, he doesn't. He just waits until they're out of harm's way or swims off concluding that the prey is too difficult. The author may have thought he was making the book suspenseful, but it comes off as tedious and frustrating instead. In the beginning the gator claims a dog. Somewhere around the middle he snatches up a leg. It isn't until the end that he causes the death of any of the characters, all of whom are completely idiotic and annoying. Add to the proceedings a character who just suddenly goes crazy and starts having flashbacks of Nam, becoming more of a threat than the gator, and it's a recipe that will leave a foul taste in the mouth of horror fans.That being said, the writing style itself isn't bad. It's descriptive and does a good job of placing the reader within the environment. I also had no problems with the actual plot, which is about a group of people trying to retrieve cocaine from a downed plane. People who simply must have every rampaging reptile book out there may still have an interest in 'Gator. Sadly, unless they know what they're in for, they'll be extremely disappointed."},{"Title":"Pershing: a History of the Medium Tank, T-Twenty Series","review":"This is the best book on the tank, bar none. As is usual with Mr. Hunnicut, the book offers an exhaustive description of the development of the tank and the projects that went with it. Full of hundreds of crisp and clear photos of the every detail of the tank these books are invaluable to modellers and those who want to know about the tank. The only slight mark against the book is that it is indeed a development history of the tank and as such has very little on the operational use of the tank.His books are the gold standards for American AFV's and probably will be for a very long time to come."},{"Title":"Crash Course for the SAT, Second Edition (College Test Prep)","review":"This book basically teaches you how to guess and what to do when you don't know the concept.

Confusingly, Fox uses &quot;illuminations&quot; to mean what Hildegard and everyone else calls &quot;visions&quot; rather than the pictures in manuscripts which are properly called &quot;illuminations.&quot; This book contains, however, twenty-five reproductions of these pictures. To judge from other reproductions of the same pictures, the quality of the reproduction seems mediocre. Here you can learn only what Matherw Fox, a Domican, thinks about these visions. To find out what Hildegard said about them visions -- which is far fresher and more stunning that what Fox has to say -- one will have to look elsewhere. As an introduction to Hildegard, I would suggest &quot;Hildegard of Bingen, A Visionary Life&quot; and &quot;Secrets of God: Writings of Hildegard of Bingen,&quot; both by Sabina Flanagan."},{"Title":"Illuminations of Hildegard of Bingen","review":"It is terrible shame that the best affordable set of reproductions of Hildegard's images is by Fox on Fox. His text is a series of misquotes which misrepresents his source throughout all his commentary, juxtaposing quotes to put words in Hildegard's mouth, often ones which would have enraged her. There is a costly but much better reproduction of the visions by A. Fuhrkotter published by Turnhout, Belgium in good library collections or for those who can afford it. I encourage anyone interested in Hildegard to go for the reputable scholars like Newman, Flanagan, Davies, and Hart just to name a few."},{"Title":"Illuminations of Hildegard of Bingen","review":"This book is not worth buying: what a shame they killed good trees to produce it!

Virtually unknown for eight centuries of Western history, Hildegard was featured as one of the women in Judy Chicago's Dinner Party in the early 1980s and published for the first time in English by Bear & Company in 1982. In addition to her mystical teachings, Hildegard's music has been performed and recorded for a new and growing audience. Author Matthew Fox has stated, \\"If Hildegard had been a man, she would be well known as one of the greatest artists and intellectuals the world has ever seen.\\"Apocalyptic Visions:Religious or spiritual revelation that heralds the end of the world is a powerful image. Usually, the dreamer will see some significant icons of their faith initiating or withstanding the destruction. Another scenario is that adherents to the mysticism are identified in a particular way and survive the destruction because of their association. In these dreams, the world is often reordered. Many times, these dreams will accompany a time in the dreamer's life when he or she feels that the entire world is against them and only their association with something larger than themselves can provide a resolution. Mythical prophecies for world-ending dreams come out of a collective anxiety about the future of our planet or frailty of the human race. These dreams may be triggered in times of global upheavals and unpredictability.Feminist 'End Time Kingdom':With Hildegard the contribution to apocalyptic expectations ceased to be an exclusive male visionary activity on the fringe of Christian belief. Bernard McGinn summarizes her unique view of the end times as, \\"the picture that she has of the Antichrist, for example, as part of this play or scenario, is one of the most inventive of the entire medieval period. Well, Hildegard of course gives us several pictures of the end times. But the one that was most .. powerful, I think, is the picture in her book Scivias, the visionary book that she wrote in the 1140's. ... a series of visions, many of the connected with the heavenly world, ... the picture of the kingdoms of the end time and the birth of Antichrist from the Church. This is a powerful image of a vast female figure representing the Church, with this horrible monstrous head being born from the woman.\\"Holistic View of God and humanity:\\"It is both fitting and just that such an impressive array of feminine medieval scholars should present this \\"faithful and unabridged translation\\" of the Scivias of Hildegard of Bingen. 'Fitting', not because Hildegard was a rabid feminist in the modern sense, but because as a woman in a patriarchal age she dared to obey God 'instead of men,' preaching and writing to arouse to Christian responsibility a 'lukewarm and sluggish' clergy and an ill-informed people in what she called an 'effeminate age.' And 'just' because scholars of her own gender may best resonate with some of the struggles Hildegard faced in follower her prophetic calls, a mission that eventually won the support of her contemporary, St. Bernard of Cleurvaux, and the official endorsement of Pope Eugenius II himself.\\" Sr. Helen Barrow, OSBMedieval Apocalyptic Pantheism?Hildegard of Bingen is one of the focal figures in the history of apocalypticism to promote its Judeo Christian symbolic prophecies. The brilliant German abbess, obscure but very mystical, a multi-talented woman, and a devoted believer in Biblical prophecy. Her innovation to the tradition was through illumination, presenting her vision, and commentaries on the prophecies, unfolded through paintings in which she employed to capture the core of her visions. The Last Judgment after the reign of the Antichrist penetrated into European culture, in her own day and afterwards. She felt called upon to reprove rulers; her correspondents included Henry II of England, the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, Pope Eugenius III, and various other prelates, like other visionaries.Fox\\"s Hildegard of Bingen\\"After his challenging presentation, we were walking to dinner through the wet slush of a Chicago January and I told Tom that I was working on a book on Hildegard of Bingen's paintings and illuminations. \\"Ah, Hildegard!\\" he said. \\"A great genius.\\" And he was off expounding on Hildegard. He was the first person I had encountered who knew who she was. And of course his knowledge was of the deepest kind. Thomas Berry helps me to resacralize the gift of curiosity. So many people in our culture and so many clergy appear to be anything but curious. They are complacent. Intellectually complacent. But not Tom.\\" Matthew Fox__________________________________________________________________________________M. Fox Criticism:It is wrong to give uninformed and Curia biased judgement on Matthew Fox theology, which is based on Eastern Churches Cosmology and Soteriology, rather than 'Illuminations book' review, a milestone in Catholic apocalyptic fascination. Fox gave a novel look at the Medieval seer, and made popular her illuminations, and consequently the Scivias. this book was a confirmation of 'Original Blessings' line of Nouvelle Theologie. His reference to Chenu, Master Eckhart, Mircea Eliade, Julian of Norwich, Carl Jung, and the like made his work inaccessible to dogma oriented hard liners. For those pre Vatican II enthusiasts, let them be shocked out of their misinformation, when they learn that readings from the Apocalypse of John cannot be found in any Eastern Orthodox Lectionary.Visions and apocalypses are not so regarded in the Eastern Church. Even the book of Revelations of (John the Elder, a local bishop and disciple of John the beloved) was authorized by St. Athanasius in 367, to avoid alienating the Roman Church whose faithful admired it, while affirming the epistle to the Hebrews, the Alexandrine favorite, in exchange. Earlier Dionysius the Great, Papa of Alexandria(247 to 264) blamed Napos, Bishop of Arsenoi, ruling that the book of the Apocalypse was a distraction from the good News, which says that eternal life start here (John 17:3).

For beginners, it is an easy-to-understand way to introduce the classic work. But this is also true for older readers. The unabridged version is an excellent book, but it might be hard to follow or just plain intimidating for many readers. Reading the Stepping Stone version first will give a clear understanding of the book. For instance, time jumps around in the regular version - and the history of the Phantom isn't even given until the very end. The Stepping Stone version proceeds from start to finish with the normal time frame. Readers who enjoy the book, will find the transition to reading the \\"real\\" book much easier.

Sites are grouped together by location and international borders are ignored - great for both US and Canadian divers!

The breadth of coverage in this book is truly astounding. It contains info on literally every divable wrecksite on the five Great Lakes, with historical and dive info on each. In order to fit all the info into the book, Kohl had to resort to some pretty small fonts, but the result is still extremely impressive and really invaluable to divers, local historians and anyone who lives near the lakes. The book contains detailed history and site info on more than 1000 wrecks! Kohl has been collecting info on Great Lakes shipwrecks for over 30 years and has become a nexus for researchers, historians and divers. This has enabled him to collect accurate information from a large geographical area and from thousands of divers and historians. My only criticism of the book would be the small print, location numbers that are sometimes inaccurate and an occasional failure to accurately credit sources for information and photos. However, this might be forgiven due to the sheer volume of information presented and the impossibility of personally checking over 1000 wreck locations. If you are a midwest scuba diver, this is the one book you absolutely must own."},{"Title":"Good Hearts","review":"This being my third Reynolds Price book to read, it was with interest that I realized this was a sequel of sorts to his very first and wildly successful A Long and Happy Life. The book starts out strong but begins to fizzle in the last third, concluding weakly with great disappointment and rather ambiguously. Strong writing, personal depth, and life philosophy come through in typical Price fashion, but without plot goals the story loses its purpose.Wesley hits his fifties and after years of a great marriage, leaves the house, and finds himself in Nashville living in a trailer with a woman age 25. While the sex is good, eventually Wilson (her name) wants something more permanent. This and a letter from his wife Rosa causes Wesley to return home. Meanwhile, during Wesley's absence, a man we later learn named Wave, breaks into Rosa's home and rapes her. For protection, Rosa's brother Rato moves in with her, leaving his mother by herself. By the end of the book, Wesley and Rosa are back together, Rato is back home, the mother is fine, and Wave goes on his way an improved person we think.Wesley's confusion throughout the book is never completely resolved (he even has moments of homosexual activity) and he does not seem to know how to love his wife. His weak character does not grow in any sense and we are not sure what his problem really is. Rato, probably the most interesting character in the book, does not reach his potential and remains an enigma throughout the story. Wave...well, he is just a disgusting individual with an obsession and sexual weakness. We don't know why he rapes women nor why he decides to leave Rosa alone at the end of the book. Perhaps we were hoping he would be caught and justly punished.Maybe the most confusing detail of the book is that Rosa is suspicious of Wave, but does not act on her suspicions. Who are these people and why do they react so poorly to life's problems? It all makes for a random, ambiguous study of people without goals and without any kind of reason for the story. Nice people and some positive moments, but nothing really anguishing or even joyful. Everyone is sort of ho-hum and aside from the rape, the events are generally average. Just one big average reading experience of average people who do not accomplish much. Nothing robust or purposeful here.On the other hand, the writing style is poetic, beautiful at times, and Rosa is a strong woman with excellent character. A rewriting of the philosophies presented might make for several excellent essays apart from the people. Not one of Price's best, but certainly a well-written book by an outstanding writer."},{"Title":"Good Hearts","review":"Middle-aged Wesley Beavers abandons his middle-aged wife Rosa and heads for points west. He takes up with a younger woman in Nashville. But back home Rosa is raped, and Wesley moves back to be with her. The rapist, Wave Willbanks, is depicted as \\"the victim of a misguided pathology,\\" and is treated with kindness by the protagonists. (Perhaps too kindly to be totally believable.) This act (could Wave be an angel?) brings Wesley and Rosa back together again as a couple. Price was suffering from cancer when he wrote this novel and was taking powerful drugs - he calls it his druggy novel - and even claims not to remember writing some of it. But Price's wonderful and unique style is in full force, which makes it an interesting and compelling book."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Harry vs the LAPD (again); M.

In City of Bones, Connelly and his noirish LA detective Harry Bosch is at the top of his game. From the opening of the novel with the discovery of a child's long-buried body near the infamous Wonderland Drive, Connelly tells a great story with his beloved city of Los Angeles holding center stage. If you enjoy LA noirish mysteries give other authors such as Robert Crais, Jan Burke, Kent Braithwaite, Steve Cannell, Sue Grafton, Robert S. Levinson, and Rochelle Krich a try. Don't ignore the classics like Chandler and MacDonald, either."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"If you love authentic police procedurals, you just can't go wrong with Michael Connelly.

I love this character, and found the most interesting aspect of this particular book how the case affected him. However I didn't find it to be the taut, tension driven narrative that I think is so prevalent in his first five books. To me nothing since has topped them for their sheer heart pounding plots. Still it's definitely worth reading especially if you're a fan of Harry."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"There aren't enough stars for this book !If you love Harry Bosch (which I do) then this book is a MUST READ !

This one, however, is forced and very unbelievable. What is it about a middle-aged detective that makes a beautful young police woman throw herself at him?

Pedestrian, lazy writing, dictated on the run to the next story conference."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Harry knows that he isn't the most popular detective in LA. The PTB at the Crystal Palace (Police HQ) consider him to be a loner and maverick. Ten years ago he was demoted from the RHD (Robbery Homicide Division) at headquarters to Homicide in North Hollywood. While working on this case he is told by the Deputy Commissioner that her should start thinking about retirement. With more than twenty-five years on the job, he has maxed out his pension.Harry takes what seems to be another, \\"my dog found a bone\\" call which turns out to be 99 out of 100 times that of some animal. Harry of course gets the one that's from a human. The discoverer of the bone is the dog of a retired MD, and he knows his bones. The body is of a child of a preteen (a tween) who has been dead for over twenty years. But after 60% of the skeleton is uncovered, the Coroner tells Harry that this child had over twenty healed fractured and broken bones during his short life. Harry wants to find his killer, badly.Needless to say, Connelly does his magic that he always does. The story evolves in ways that seem so logical but we know that they can't be. There is a disturbing interlude between Harry and a 'boot', that seems to be there to cement in our minds why Harry should remain a loner. Near the end, having aggravated practically everyone he knows, he comes up with the answer.At the end, he gets a call from 'downtown' that he's being transferred. Everyone figures Harry's going to Traffic Detail or The Records Archive. But, Harry's going back to RHD after ten years. But Harry knows it's only so that 'Downtown' can keep an eye on him while they figure out how to shove him out the door. Harry decides to beat them to the punch and leaves his badge and gun and walks out the door.Zeb Kantrowitz"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I'll be succinct: damn the conclusion stunk."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Michael Connelly always keeps my attention with a good story and his mainstay, Detective McCaleb."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Michael Connelly is an amazing author.

He discovers abandonment ,alcoholism and abuse, but can he discover what actually occurred?In the process of his search for answers he meets a fellow officer, new to the department, who seems to bring light to his life. Julia Brasher is interesting, attractive and has an interesting past full of great experiences, but what drives her to be a detective?While Bosch tries to keep the case low profile, the case takes on a life of it's own and the media gets involved.

The last three books have left me sorely disappointed and this one put the finishing touch on my feelings for this author. This entire book felt like a very long and trite &quot;Law and Order&quot; episode. It was superficial and empty as compared to his earlier works. I kept waiting for something to happen but, when it finally did, it was utterly predictable. Please do yourself a favor and read his earlier works (The Poet, etc.). If your done with those, I recommend Robert Crais' early stuff (before Hostage and Demolition Angel)."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I am an avid mystery reader and love Mr. Connelly.I felt this was one of his best efforts to date.I love the Harry Bosch character and felt thisbook showed a lighter side of the character.Lots of plot turns and twists.A very good read."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Michael Connelly has been doing these Harry Bosch novels for some years now. Bosch is the stereotypical detective, and if anything that's always been my one main objection to him: he's a bit too much of a stereotype, right down to the jazz on the stereo, the chain-smoking (though he did finally quit), the casual attitude towards superiors, and the dogged determination to clear every one of his cases.The current book follows Bosch and his partner, Jerry Edgar, as they look into what they at first imagine is a false alarm. A man walking his dog in the Hollywood Hills has let the dog run wild, and the pooch returned with a bone in his mouth, which the man thinks is human. This happens regularly, and the bone is usually from an animal, but this time the dog's owner happens to be a retired doctor, and he knows what he's talking about: it's human. Soon Harry and Jerry are working a twenty-year-old homicide, apparently a runaway who was killed, for what reason they don't know. They can't even make an identification. Then it turns out there's a convicted child molester on the street, and things begin to go sideways and get ugly at the same time.Connelly has this sort of thing downpat now. The mystery's not the most surprising one he's done, and the plot is somewhat meandering, but the characterization of Bosch is well-done, and the other characters are interesting too. There are several strange twists in the plot, things that you weren't expecting, all of which aren't directly connected to the mystery of who killed the kid. The ending, which I won't reveal (though I guessed what was coming), is something of a mystery too, though the preview of his next book in the back told me where he was going to take things.Anyway, I enjoyed this book, and would recommend it, though of course anyone reading something like this should first read some of the earlier books, so that they get some background on the characters in the story."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Great story, especially if you like Michael Connelly and Harry Bosch in particular. You won't be disappointed if you like this genre."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"When some bones are discovered - by a man walking his dog on an L.A. hillside - in a shallow grave, Harry Bosch really doesn't know what to expect from the case. Shortly after, the bones are proved to be human, and sent of for forensic examination. This examination reveals that these bones belonged to a young boy, and have lain buried on that hillside for over 20 years. And, they are also found to detail a horrific tale of abuse and violence visited on the young boy. Repulsed once again by witnessing yet another of society's lows, Bosch vows that this victim, unlike many others, will find justice and not be forgotten.This is a very welcome return for Harry Bosch, one of the best series characters being written about today (along with Rankin's Rebus and Deaver's Rhyme.) City of Bones is a great success. It boasts a strong, if unremarkable, cast and an interesting and incredibly well paced plot. The writing is polished and taut, and the result is probably the most tightly plotted Bosch novel of the entire series.And the ending, which may seem out of character to some readers, certainly promises an exciting new direction for the series, and demonstrates once again Connelly's great skill at keeping his work constantly fresh."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"After reading all of Michael Connelly's books I have to say that City of Bones is one of, if not the best novel he has written. Over the years Connelly's writing has improved with each book, and his plots have always been excellent. If you have not read any of the other Harry Bosch novels don't feel you are cheating yourself by reading City of Bones first. This could be a stand alone novel, it is that good. Also I just heard COB has been nominated for the Edgar Award for best novel of the year, I think it will win!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I can't say much as I still awed by how this book turned out. I finished this a day before New Year's Eve 2002, and the timing of the books was similar to when I read it.The story was amazing ... it got me hooked since the first few pages. One great thing about Conelly is how he managed to write such a beautiful but kind of quiet ending. How Harry stood in the rain waiting for the cab. It was lovely ... it was sad ... and again I must say it is surely one of the BEST Bosch books so far! It surely better than the last one (A Darkness More Than Night) which did not have enough Bosch. I can't wait to read &quot;Lost Light&quot;"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Micheal Connelly is the best crime fiction writer now working. In his new Harry Bosch novel, a long buried body is discovered off Wonderland Drive in Los Angeles. Connelly uses this Wonderland murder as a launching pad to explore modern Los Angeles. City of Bones is one of, if not, Connelly's best. He continues his noir attitude and makes astute observations about contemporary society. It is a must read. So read it!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"HERE IS ANOTHER GOOD READ BY MICHAEL CONNELLY.HIS STORY NEVER LETS YOU DOWN AND YOU HOPE HARRY BOSCH WILL BE AROUND FOR ANOTHER DAY..THE BOOK IS WELL-REVIEWED HERE SO I AM ONLY WRITING TO TELL AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE BETWEEN FACT AND FICTION.TODAY IS 23 MAY 2002.YESTERDAY CHANDRA LEVY'S BODY WAS FOUND IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES TO MR.CONNELLY'S FICTIONAL BODY.BUT HE WROTE THIS AT LEAST A YEAR OR MORE BEFORE 22 MAY.SOMETIMES TRUTH AND FICTION ARE NOT SO STRANGE."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I am astonished at early enthusiasm for this book. Granted it's well plotted and very well written. Michael Connelly is an established author, and for good reason. But THIS book is a dreadful downer. Terrible things have happened in the case Harry Bosch is investigating. Terrible things happen in the course of the investigation. The future looks bleak indeed.I'm not one to avoid all unpleasantness in my reading, but this unmitigated pessimism does not constitute recreational reading in my view. Consider yourself warned!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Michael Connelly's City of Bones is my first, but not my last, Harry Bosch novel. It makes for excellent crime fiction reading--an excellent, tight, well-paced plot, with a twists and turns along the way. The dialogue is stellar, and the novel makes for fast reading. The novel is smartly written and does not disappoint. Enjoy."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Admittedly I am biased. Connelly is my favorite and I'd probably rate him 5 stars if he wrote a phone book. That said, this is a different Harry Bosch novel. The pace is slower than previous works, the empasis is more on procedure and mystery than complex story line and unexpected plot twists, and Harry is even more introspective than usual - from his intense involvement in the case to his affair with an almost normal lover. This book reminded me more of &quot;The Last Coyote&quot; than other Bosch novels. I believe it is a book to be read slowly, enjoying the nuances, discovering Harry's gradual evolution, and simply delighting in an excellently written novel."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"City of Bones by Michael Connelly is the third book I've read by this author, and the second in his Harry Bosch series. Connelly never fails to deliver with his mysteries and City of Bones was a real page-turner.Harry Bosch is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department Homicide Division. When human remains are found in Laurel Canyon, Bosch and his partner, Jerry Edgar, are called in to investigate. A forensic anthropologist determines that the victim was between the ages of 10 and 12, and was severely physically abused throughout his short life. Since the bones have been buried for over 20 years and there is very little evidence, Bosch and Edgar have an uphill climb in trying to identify both the victim and the murderer. As always, there are a number of factors that complicate their case. The police chief wants the case wrapped up quickly without regard to whether they've identified the real murderer. The press is relentless, and someone on the inside is leaking them information. And Bosch finds himself romantically involved with a rookie police officer-something against department rules. Bosch is a meticulous and tortured officer, and he leaves no stone unturned in trying to find the real killer. Even when he has a confession in hand, he doesn't believe the case is closed.Michael Connelly writes gritty, hard-nosed mysteries which are more realistic than most writers today. Things don't always work out for the best, and police don't always follow the rules. City of Bones is not a fluffy work of fiction and Connelly will have you guessing until the very end. It's also interesting in that Bosch ties in some local history of the La Brea Tar Pits and two murder victims discovered in the pits that dated back 9000 years.After finishing City of Bones, I next plan to read Connelly's Concrete Blonde."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"A dog digs up a bone on his daily romp in the woods. His owner is a retired physician who immediately knows it's a human arm bone...from a kid. Hollywood Homicide Detective Harry Bosch and his partner, Jerry Edgar, are called to the scene. The next day the scene is completely searched and most of the body's bones are found along with a backpack. The only problem is the bones are about 20 years old.At first, a neighbor is suspected, but he is later disqualified. After several days working the cold case, they get a lead on the victim's identity. They talk with the victim's sister and get each divorced parent's current address along with the name of a boyhood friend of the victim's. As the investigation proceeds, another person dies, a confession is blurted out, obstacles never cease to pop up, and confusion reigns supreme. In the end, Bosch figures out whodunit and comes to startling revelation about his own life.I've read a few other Bosch adventures by Mr. C. They're all pretty good and most keep you guessing about who the bad guy is."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"The City of Bones is hardly action-packed. A doctor out with his dog finds a long-buried bone of a young boy, who, upon thorough examination of the entire body, was obviously severely abused over a long period of time. Gritty detective Harry Bosch knows evil only too well, but given his own disturbing childhood, child abuse cases are especially distressing to him.Connelly's books are so interesting, despite the lack of great action, because he is an expert in capturing the subtleties and feel of police procedures and investigations. Beyond technicalities, the reader gets to see turf battles, spin control, rivalries, unspoken protocols and deference, petty rules, publicity seeking, the incessant media, etc. The psychological toll of police work is always right there.Harry has had a difficult time through the years maintaining relationships, but he immediately makes a connection with a rookie female cop at the scene of the buried bones. But the apprehension of a childhood acquaintance of the abused boy takes an inexplicable turn that hits Harry hard.The resolution of the case is entirely unsatisfying to Bosch. There are degrees of guilt among several parties with suitable punishment or accounting proving elusive. He feels compelled to respond in a manner that seems like the only course that he can take. Another good Connelly effort."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"After the relative disappointment of \\"A Darkness More than Night\\", I was anxious to see if the Harry Bosch mythology could be salvaged eight novels and a dozen years after its beginning. I felt that Harry had been left at a crossroads at the end of that novel - would he slip down the self-destructive path of a cynical, hard-boiled anti-hero or magically find a new lease on life?It's a very difficult task for any storyteller to keep a central character involved in fresh but believable dramatic situations time and time again (imagine what a regrettable eye-roller an eighth season of \\"24\\" would probably be!). However, I had to believe that if any writer could guide his protagonist back into the upper tier of mystery fiction, it's Michael Connelly. \\"City of Bones\\" justifies that belief by tying up the loose ends of Bosch's recent past and then opening up his future to a limitless number of possibilities. The central investigation of the novel is also very good, pitting Harry's drive for justice against big odds on a cold case over two decades old.The subtle strength of the book, however, is in the development of Bosch's complete life, not just as an LAPD detective but as an individual. By the time you turn the last page on the (semi-) surprise ending, you completely empathize with the difficulties that he faces and you feel for the tough choices that he has to make - in short, you care. Too many authors fall into the \\"mad lib\\" method of churning out rapid-file novels like a get-rich-quick scheme once they've established a popular lead character. The books all begin to read the same, the characters never really develop, and everyone stops caring. Connelly avoids this trap via his attention to the details in Bosch's life - he answers the questions that have been at the back of the established readers' minds before they've even materialized. I can't give specifics without leaking spoilers, but the big issues are all covered here; if you've been following Bosch from the beginning, then you'll really appreciate this book as so much more than an everyday whodunit.As always, the writing is effortless to digest because Connelly's narrative and (especially) dialogue flows so naturally. Pacing is right on time as well - the twists of the case and of Harry's life happen at all the right intervals. One of the subplots has an ending that's left a bit wide open and as a result is somewhat perplexing, but I'm nitpicking at this point. Finally, the action in the book is the most emotionally gripping we've been given since \\"The Last Coyote\\" (when Harry tracked down the culprits in his mother's homicide) but never goes over the top. Whoever edits Connelly's works has one of the easiest jobs on the planet.Long-time Bosch fans will find \\"City of Bones\\" to be rewarding on a number of levels. Readers new to Connelly who just picked up the hardcover remainder from the sale table will want (need, actually) to begin with the earlier works in the series. The first six Bosch novels have been republished in a pair of hardcover omnibuses that are a great value at about $20 each. If you're a fan of mystery or crime procedural novels, you'll be doing yourself a favor by getting to know Harry Bosch."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This is another excellent entry in the Hieronymous Bosch series, in which we continue to learn about him, his past, and what makes him tick. In CITY OF BONES Bosch investigates the death of a boy killed 20 years ago, whose bones are found in the Hollywood Hills. As he uncovers evidence about the crime, Bosch meets a female cop who awakens feelings and memories for him.As Bosch continues to work the case and piece the crime together, he confronts challenges and hurdles that complicate his life and add complexity to the story. Connelly takes the reader along with Bosch through his struggles and for me it became apparant he was looking for redemption by solving the case. Does he find it? That's open for discussion. In typical Connelly fashion, there are a few surprises and a stunner at the end, after you think the story is over. It's well worth the trip but looking beyond CITY OF BONES, I ask myself, \\"What's next?\\". I can't wait to find out."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Each time Michael Connelly turns out another Harry Bosch novel, I vow to take my time...pace myself...savor his latest literary accomplishment. It's never going to happen!I finished City of Bones last evening. I bought it 4 days ago. For those die-hard Connelly fans that loved favorites like The Concrete Blond\\" and \\"Trunk Music\\" you are in for a treat. It is pure Harry Bosch, in all his inner-pain and glory! I was a little distracted by the off-shoot story-line involving a rookie female cop; in the end though, I simply appreciated what it adds to our vision of the character, Harry Bosch.Michael Connelley...I almost wish you'd release these novels a chapter at a time!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Michael Connelly's Detective Hieronymous \\"Harry\\" Bosch is one of the few archetypical hard-boiled noir detectives in the Raymond Chandler mold to be found in today's mystery fiction. The intensity with which Connelly has painted this character is truly a marvel of the genre. That he does so with such a clean and bright literary palette-there are no gimmicks, tricks or bizarre eccentricities used as literary devices here-is truly refreshing.Bosch (for those new to him) is a L.A. homicide detective--a chain-smoking (OK, he quit, but you get the idea) loner, a tightlipped outsider who refuses to play by his superiors' rules and a man who takes each crime he's exposed to as a personal affront as he tries to cleanse his beloved city of the darkness he sees engulfing it.If there is room for criticism of this series it's that, all too often, the plots Connelly constructs are inferior to the character-that's certainly been the case the last two outings. That is not the case here.In City of Bones the old bones of an abused, murdered child are uncovered in the hills of Laurel Canyon, Harry and partner Jerry Edgar are assigned the nearly impossible task of identifying the child and solving a murder committed 20 years ago. An orphan himself, Harry considers child abuse cases particularly difficult, but he finds some solace in the arms of Julia Brasher, an attractive recruit whom regulations say he shouldn't be seeing. As the investigation progresses, so does Harry's relationship with Julia until everything goes spectacularly wrong.Of course, things going wrong are a hallmark of the Bosch series. However, this riveting thriller is a departure from the norm. This installment in the series finds Harry even more introspective than usual, and while the tight prose of the plot swirls around the mystery of the bones, Harry's turbulent life and career are changed forever in a stunning conclusion.One is left to wonder where Harry-and Connelly-go from here. That you, as the reader, are left really, really nervous about Harry's fate and prospects at the end of this book says a lot about what a wonderful creation Connelly has wrought with this series in general, and this installment in particular.This is as good as it gets for the thriller/mystery fan!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"&quot;City of Bones&quot; was the first book I've read by this author. Connelly did create a great page burner. The chapters are short, the vocabulary is easy as we zip through the tale.For me, the best character was Dr. William Golliher who examines the bones and projects that the victim suffered many fractures and repeated abuse over a long period of time. He offers the only real character depth as his faith in a Higher Power is challenged by the brutality shown by the evidence. Unfortunately, his time in the novel is quite brief and not very affecting to detective Harry Bosch. I found it interesting that Bosch is named after the painter Heironymous Bosch whose fantastic religious imagery offers some of the greatest artistic puzzles. However, Detective Bosch does not believe in a Higher Power; his motivations are humanitarian.The second most interesting aspect was Bosch's romance with Julia Brasher. Unfortunately, we never really come to get a grip on what makes her tick. Did she have an accident or was she a pretty girl with a death wish? For some fleeting chapters, we think Bosch may find personal happiness, but it's not to be. His exit at the end after pages of recitation about dedication to the job left me puzzled. How the novel built to that final act remains undetected.The most interesting incident in the book is when the press-hungry Teresa Corazon gets locked in a port-a-potty. Now that could have been some great comic relief! Instead, Bosch seems to start and end in a state of depression. Many of the supporting characters were quite captivating from Dr. Guyot to all of the dysfunctional Delacroix family. In the end, &quot;City of Bones&quot; is like a fast meal that tastes good going down, but leaves one hungry for some substance. Caleb Carr's &quot;The Alienist&quot; was far more gripping for me. &quot;CoB&quot; is a definite maybe!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"A dog's discovery of a human child's bone in the Hollywood Hills leads Detective Harry Bosch to the shallow grave of a boy dead 20 years whose life, as read in the bones, was a long history of terrible abuse. A tip from the missing boy's sister leads to the unraveling of a bleak, sordid family history.Bosch's burgeoning romance with a rookie cop, the suicide of an early suspect and a dogged search through the wreck of the boy's family and the dead suspect's life move the story through numerous twists, dead ends and false leads, all of them bleak. Edgar award-winner Connelly leads the reader through little-known by-ways in Hollywood fringe work as well as the enclaves of the rich and the tucked away shanties of the down-and-out.A devastating cop shooting with some decidedly weird aspects throws the reader - and Bosch - for a loop. But the mystery's unexpected solution is vintage Bosch - a sad, too human story, exposed by dogged perseverance and luck. As always, the writing is excellent; gritty and LA atmospheric with pitch perfect dialogue. Not Connelly's best, but still top-notch."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I just finished City of Bones and as always with Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch novels, I wanted it to go on and on.

I've read 'em all and his latest is up to his usual lofty standards.The things I like about this book are pretty much the same as what I like about all his books: tight writing - no wasted passages, unbeatable procedural authenticity, steadily escalating tension and excitement, and REAL characters.I gave this 4 stars simply because I would have to leave the 5 star ratings for Concrete Blond and Blood Work - his two finest books in my opinion.Anyone who is checking out these reviews and wondering if they should try a Michael Connelly novel for the first time, listen up: I've read all of the current crop of crime writers work and Mr Connelly is the subtle master at the head of the class. Do yourself a favour and read his novels in sequence starting with the Black Echo. You will not regret it !"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"i am a great fan of michael connelly and have read all his books. this one was very disappointing. he must be getting bored with the harry bosch character, or more to the point: connelly and other writers have so mined this vein of the rogue homicide cop that nothing is left--without making some imaginative leaps that connelly is not willing or able to make, in this book at least.and why should he since the majority of readers are so uncritical, and just want more of the same?i guess this is what happens when authors become so rich and so successful, and still have contracts for four or five more novels with the same characters.by all means read any, and all, of connelly's earlier works. but not this one, or any newer ones that may come out, until we see if he really intends to return to his earlier form and make a bit of an effort."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"\\"City of Bones\\", Michael Connelly's eighth entry in the spectacularly successful Harry Bosch series, works on two distinctly different but equally compelling levels.First of all, \\"City of Bones\\" is a pure police procedural. A dog, out for a walk with its owner, finds a bone in a wooded area off of Hollywood's Wonderland Drive. When the owner who happens to be a doctor recognizes that the bone is unquestionably a human humerus, the hunt is on for the identity of the 20 year old skeleton and the killer who buried it so many years ago.Connelly covers it all - internal police politics; forensic science; dogged routine investigation; suspect interviews; budgetary constraints; publicity and media; legal subtleties from search warrant execution to the requirement to Mirandize suspects to potential issues relating to libel; the necessity for the police force to maintain an awareness of its own public image; and much, much more.On a second level, long time fans will savour the continuation of the dark, complex, deeply psychological story of the life of Harry Bosch, the noir bad-boy who refuses to toe the LAPD policy line. Right alongside Harry, readers will allow themselves to ignore departmental fraternization policies and to fall in love with Julia Brasher, the mature rookie cop who, like Harry, totes a jam-packed set of personal psychological baggage. She sees herself as a potential hero who wants to achieve something of lasting importance in the world, no matter the cost.There is nothing of the high speed suspense thriller in \\"City of Bones\\". But it is a deeply satisfying novel that ends with a breathtaking twist that, while not particularly surprising given Bosch's personality, will definitely have fans looking for the next novel to see where things are headed.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This reflects the highest rating for Connelly's brilliant plotting, deft characterizations, and fine writing, and unfortunately, the lowest rating for the reader, Len Cariou. I have read and listened to many Connelly books featuring Harry Bosch. Up til now, I have heard Dick Hill as the narrator, and he is matchless in his interpretation of Harry Bosch and all other characters on Connelly's books. I'm sure Cariou is a fine actor, but with the voice of Harry Bosch so firmly entrenched with Dick Hill, I was distracted while listening to this audio. Cariou doesn't even seem to realize that both of Harry's partners (Kiz and Edgar) are African American and instead made Edgar sound like a nasal voiced whiner. I see that most of the rest of the series (I'm following them in order) feature Cariou's voice - so I will have to think hard about continuing to listen. Very, very disappointing!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This is the first book I have read from this author. I am truly amazed at how well I enjoyed his style. It kind of reminded me of some of the good Stuart Woods books I have read. I plan on reading many more from Michael Connelly. Great read, you won't be disappointed, trust me."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"It was a fast read. It however seemed quite predictable. It really did not do much for me... It did not draw me in as I had hoped it would. This is my first M.C. book. I will give him another chance and try 'The Closers.\\""},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Michael Connelly may be the Jerry Seinfeld of crime fiction. He builds his stories with pieces of the nothings of everyday life. When Harry Bosch bungles the switch from call waiting, Lt. Grace Billets, who's been his boss since \\"Angel's Flight\\", finally finds out that he and Jerry Edger call her Bullets. Watch sergeant Mankiewicz tells Bosch to use his wiles as in Wile E. Coyote to move the bones case along and knows that the best donuts in his squad room come from Bob's in the Farmer's Market.Bosch fans will also appreciate how smoothly Connelly intorduces another love interest to the series while an old one remains on the scene. Teresa Corazon, a soul mate and casual sex partner of Harry way back in \\"The Black Ice\\" is now the publicity hungry Medical Examiner who takes a camera crew to document everything she investigates. She's become almost as much of a bumbling nemesis as Harvey \\"98\\" Pounds used to be. Julia Brasher, a rookie cop in her mid-thirties, former lawyer from a family of successful lawyers, is Harry's current squeeze.When the old bones of an abused young boy are found in a shallow grave, the reader should recognize from the outset that technology and good policework will enable the cops to I.D. the victim pretty quickly. The early part of the story isn't about what the investigation uncovers but rather the unintended consequences of events it sets in motion. Deputy Chief Irving is still around, always ready to deep six the truth and Harry's investigation if it will make his department look better. He's more than outlived his usefulness as the poster boy for evil bureaucrats, but where would Harry be without him to rebel against?Once the bones are identified and Harry starts to resurrect the dirty secrets of the family de la Croix, the story goes back to a Connellly whodunit - one where Harry may be the only one who really cares about the truth. The pace and path to the solution are typical Connelly, exceptionally well done.As to the ending, if you've read the jacket or another review you already know that it's different. The question is, when the old tunnel rat finally does see the light at the end, is it a door to a new beginning or the dreaded oncoming train? I'm hoping for the door out and a whole new series of Harry Bosch stories."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Sorry for my english, i don't think i will be able to write a great review, but was my intention to say everybody that this is a very good book, strong, with a plot well conceived and finally well written (no surprise!).bye"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"A young child's humerus is found by a dog on a hillside in Hollywood.

His investigation resurrects painful memories of a dysfunctional family while driving another to consider suicide. In the midst of the case, Bosch manages to possibly find love. Can any form of happiness last for this tortured soul?Harry Bosch is the prototypical modern fictional crime fighter. He is a direct descendant of Chandler's Philip Marlowe and Hammett's Sam Spade. Bosch is today's dark knight, lone wolf or, to use Mike Connelly's simile, The Last Coyote. He is also the one of greatest creations in the history of crime fiction. Many of us have repeatedly extolled the virtues of the writing of Mike Connelly. He is simply the very best of today's fictional crime writers. Readers should take note of the incredibly smooth lyrical writing. There is much personal angst Bosch suffers and this is so well conveyed through dialogue and other characters. Los Angeles has never looked more bleak than in the pages of this brilliant book. With each successive work, Mike Connelly continuously raises the ante in reaching new levels of excellence. This work is no exception.

The writing is strong and consistent, and as with all Bosch novels well researched, and cleverly plotted. The only error I spotted was the mention of a 1975 quarter as evidence, when that is the one year that the US Mint did not mint since 1932, instead all quarters were the bicentenial type with the drummer boy reverse and dual dated 1776-1976, but that wouldn't alter the plot in any significant way.Michael Connelly is at the top of my permenant list of must read authors, along with George Pelecanos, Elmore Leonard and James Lee Burke, among others.

It happen over twenty years ago and the leads are slim. Harry, of course, is not going to give up. His care of one of the boy's bones, laying in a shoebox (he keeps his hand over it as he drives) broke my heart. There is a lot of police procedural and politics in this outing, but I thought it made the story more believable. It also made me appreciate the hard work that the real police do. It is not all glamorous action. The twists and turns in the mystery kept me interested. Just about everything that can go wrong in an investigation, goes wrong in this one.

During his journey he meets Julia Brasher....a real cop's cop....a strong and persistent woman. And that is why Bosch is attracted to her. But it is a star-crossed love affair.The name \\"City of Bones\\" was very interesting to me. When graves like this one are found, a grid is made so that different bones are designated to a certain area. The grids become streets in this city of mystery and the bones under careful scrutiny slowly, but surely give up some of their secrets.Many roads are traveled, many leads followed, as Bosch watches a brutal story unfold before his eyes.It is a well written and well plotted book; and through it all we see how all the evil in this world is becoming more of a mystery to Bosch, than the individual mysteries he is given to solve.The ending is a twist-and-a-half and leaves the reader wondering what the future holds for Harry.Michael Connelly has once again given us a fantastic read and fascinated us with his knowledge of just how the police et al work to pull it all together...marvelous!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Michael Connelly is easily one of the best and most consistent crime fiction authors working today. I've read almost all of Connelly's novels, but for whatever reason there are still a couple of middle Bosch novels that I have yet to read. City of Bones was (until recently) one of those novels.I'm please to report that it's another solid effort from Connelly. It isn't a high water mark for the author (like Angels Flight, Concrete Blonde, Lincoln Lawyer, or The Poet) but it's still one of his better novels. It has many of the characteristics that I appreciate in a Bosch novel. Connelly has good insight into the politics of the LAPD and his novels always feel procedurally accurate and the language of the cops always rings true.A lot of reviewers seem disappointed with the resolution of this case but I actually liked it. As someone who reads a fair amount of crime fiction, I was expecting a bigger twist at the end and the person who I thought would turn out to be the killer would have made for a typical, but implausible ending, so in a strange way I was pleased that I was wrong, and that the identity of the killer actually resulted in a much more realistic explanation. Some reviewers seem to regard this solution as a little anti-climactic but I liked that I was genuinely surprised by the outcome, and its unusual mundaneness.Given the short time frame of the novel I did think that Harry seemed relatively unaffected by the sudden death of a character he was close to and he seemed to recover from his fractured ribs awfully quickly, but these are minor complaints.I finished this novel very quickly, found it highly entertaining to read, and think that it measures up to some of the better novels in the series."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"After reading a few of Connelly's more recent books, I decided to go back and read them in order. I'm really glad I chose to do this, especially with the Harry Bosch novels. There is a great flow to the Bosch novels that I have not encountered in too many other detective series. And I keep thinking I've read the best Connelly novel until I read the next one of course.Which is what brings me to \\"City of Bones.\\" I can't figure out why none of the Bosch novels have made it to film. Maybe it's all for the better considering the one Connelly novel that was translated to the big screen was the dreadful \\"Blood Work.\\" But \\"City of Bones\\" just screams to be a movie. And I think if you are going to pick a random Bosch novel to see if Connelly works for you, then \\"City of Bones\\" would be a great pick.It's got a wonderful stand a lone story, and as if Connelly hasn't raised the stakes high enough for Bosch in the past, he raises them even higher in this novel. This story has everything a mystery lover should need including the lone rebellious hero and a couple of great twists at the end to make you want to delve right in to the next novel in the series. It's too bad I had already read \\"The Narrows,\\" so the final revelation in this book didn't suprise me too much, but that's my own fault. Great stuff. Can't wait to read \\"Lost Light.\\""},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This is my fourth Michael Connelly book and so far my favorite. I love the Harry Bosch character and I love the way Connelly has developed his personality. This is a fast paced, always interesting book with a twist at the end. These are charcters and circumstances that seem real. A lot of times, after finishing a book, my comment is, \\"Give me a break.\\" Not so with this story. Loved it."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"The Harry Bosch series has a dual purpose: entertain us with crime and detection stories while portraying the depravity of our culture. In City of Bones, Michael Connelly expresses the kind of world-weary despair that causes many to lose faith in God . . . and humanity.As the story opens, it's the end of the year . . . a sad time for depressed people and two taxpayers take the quick way out. A call to Laurel Canyon reveals a bone that proves to be human, which also leads to a horrifying case of abuse. In searching for the rest of the skeleton, Harry is repulsed by the coroner's fixation on fame and glitter. He is refreshed to meet a mid-thirties rookie cop, Julia Brasher, who likes his style.The investigation is quickly compromised by someone wanting to curry favor with a television journalist, with dreadful consequences. Harry is, as usual, annoying the downtown people who care more about their image than justice. More mistakes occur, and more harm is done. Clearly, the lesson is that it's dangerous to turn the police loose on crime.If I could re-title the book, I would call it \\"People are never what they seem.\\" You'll get more than your share of surprises in the book which is best appreciated as a deep character study.For those who like action, linear progress, and a taut plot, City of Bones will be frustrating: This book is more like the sort of \\"why do I bother?\\" soliloquy that most of us conduct in our heads from time to time.The investigating mistakes that Harry makes can be seen clearly if you read carefully: He's clearly not in a lucid state of mind. Exploring the sources and consequences of that displaced perception is the core of this novel.The noir parts of the story are well wrought. I especially liked the theme of peoples' bones being picked clean by the denizens of Hollywood. The reference to piranhas was quite effective."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"All ten previous novels from Connelly have been very good. In City of Bones I think I sense an easing of the pedal for the author, maybe the novel was rushed. There isn't as much grittiness, characterizations, or suspense as in his previous work. No matter, still a very good book in an excellent series."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I like Michael Connelly for beach trash that's not too trashy - this was a good one-day read on the beach. This moved nicely and kept me guessing. With similar books I get frustrated that the inner dialogue is overused and cheesy, but Connelly is good about keeping that to a minimum. Also he doesn't feel the need to titillate and focuses on what is important to the plot.Connelly definitely overdoes the whole \\"I'm a cop and I'm so dedicated to it\\" thing, and I haven't read any Bosch books before so that was pretty much Bosch's whole personality to me. (KIND-OF SPOILER Yes, he slips up, but come on - it was in such an obvious way)I have read better books by Connelly, but this served its purpose.3.5 stars"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This was an exceptional novel written by one of my favorite authors. Detective Harry Bosch has once again entered my life and taken over all of my spare time. This was a particularly good one to me, however, I find of Connelly's novels to be spellbinding. Once you start reading them, you can't quit."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"How do you capitalize on your previous job experience? You write about it!Michael Connelly books have mesmerized readers with his working knowledgeof the California Law Enforcement community. Not even some of his main characters are saved from the evil that lurks there. My thoguht is: If once you delve into his world of characters, and you don't find yourself fully engaged, you might want to check your sanity."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This is a good addition to the Bosch series. Although it is not the best one of Connelly's novels, it is entertaining and captures the city of Los Angeles quite well."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I love the characters, but this was just not quite as good as the previous ones. I still love the series and will continue to read them all."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"A little slow to pick up, then in true Connelly fashion, it picks up and is hard to put down. I was way off on the 'who done it.' Nice twist, but a little fast."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"City of Bones is another spectacularly written and engagingly plotted book by Connelly. This is the 6th book of his I have read in a row and I have thoroughly enjoyed each one fullingly. You might have noticed I am making up some words as I go along here. Anyway, I am about to go to bed now and grab another Connelly as I head downstairs. I see no reason to read another author at this point until I am all out of Connelly's. I don't think I've ever been able to do that with an author before. The closest I have come to that was F. Paul Wilson. So, someone please email me and tell me who to read after Connelly."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"A body of a young boy found in the hills leads Bosch into pursuing a cold case that leads in a variety of different directions. The boy has been abused and this brings out the avenger in Bosch and he pursues the right solution despite the rush to close. This rush creates errors ending in suicide and false leads. There's is also a new love interest for Bosch which becomes an integral part of the shocking turn of events. By the time you get to the end of the case, it's not as much of a surprise as a rueful understanding of just how these things often turn out. Connelly keeps some of Bosch's more out-there personality traits under wraps; his \\"man against the system\\" attitude more believably portrayed and it works to the book's benefit. This is definitely one of the better Bosch cases and will keep you interested until the end."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"CITY OF BONES by Michael Connelly is the eighth book in the Harry Bosch series. Harry works for LAPD and is one hell of a detective. Read the books in order for a far better set of stories. Harry Bosch is a detectives detective with enough years in to walk away if he chooses. This story is about a child's murder, twenty years ago, a cols case. It is a well done story and Harry has a rookie cop as a love interest. I really enjoyed this one, hope you do. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I ordered the 5-cd (abridged) audio version of City of Bones after reading the laudatory reviews of the book. I was not disappointed: great plot, fabulous characters, magnificent reading by Len Cariou. This audio book was my introduction to Michael Connelly and Det. Harry Bosch, and I have since ordered a stack more. I'm hooked!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I was disappointed with Michael Connelly's previous contribution to his Harry Bosch series, &quot;A Darkness More Than Night&quot; and, on finishing that, feared that the character had become stale and would go the way of other characters such as Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta. So it was with some anticipation that I delved into Connelly's latest, &quot;City of Bones&quot;.&quot;City of Bones&quot; is the old Michael Connelly and the old Harry Bosch - a hard-boiled LA homicide detective who plays by his own rules but gets the job done. In this book, Bosch is called out to investigate the discovery of skeletal remains buried in a wooded area some twenty years previously. As usual, he runs into the usual bureaucratic frustrations as the top brass fear that another &quot;cold case&quot; will do further damage to the reputation of the LAPD. Connelly guides the story through a number of complex plot twists, creating suspects and then despatching them and leaving the reader wondering where things will end up. The writing is well crafted, the character development very good and the plot leaves you guessing right up until the very end. He also injects the right amount of &quot;police procedural&quot; - the paperwork, the internal investigations, the politics - into the plot to give the book the realism for which he is known.The book is every bit a &quot;page-turner&quot; and I ploughed through it in a single day, staying up into the wee hours to finish it off. The lack of sleep was worth it - Connelly has crafted an excellent book. In many ways he has returned to the old Harry Bosch - no gimmicks, no &quot;tie-ins&quot;, just plain old good quality, hard-boiled detective fiction. Let's just hope that Connelly sticks to the format because, if so, we've got a lot to look forward to.Michael Connelly is back on form and has produced a 5 star crime novel as a result."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I love Michael Connelly's work. I've read them all, including Void Moon, The Poet, and Blood Work (oh my goodness, I clapped in the movie theater when I found out Clint Eastwood would be Terry). But of course, most of all, I love Harry Bosch.Harry Bosch is the central character in a series of novels about an orphaned boy of a prostitute who grew up to be the avenging angel of murder victims in LA. He is a police detective and possesses a lot of what comes with that as far as cool characters of detective novels go: handsome, clever, tough, gets the girl, saves the day, doesn't get along well with the brass.... Harry Bosch lives for putting away the bad guys and solving cases for the victims. I believe him, I believe in him.City of Bones is a pretty good mystery, but it lacks much of the action from other Bosch books and much of the drive usually seen from Harry. Expertly written by Connelly and quite the pleasure as always, but the grit was gone and the pace was off.In writing my review (originally set at 4 stars) I analyzed why I was slightly disappointed with City of Bones. It comes from that lack of grit. Where was the grit? What happened? And it occurred to me, ah... Harry has lost his grit. Harry's pace is off. So, with this in mind, I'm changing the 4 stars to 5, because, this lack of grit and odd pace I felt in reading it translates into the life Harry leads, and the life I love to read about. Connelly, without telling us anything about Harry losing his grit or pace, showed us that Harry was losing it.I'm just going to be hopeful that he gets it back. The world is a sad place without the gritty, fast paced, quick whitted, Harry Bosch...."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Harry Bosch has been through a lot in the previous seven Michael Connelly novels that he has appeared in and this one is no exception. The discovery of the skeleton of a child by a neighborhood dog sets Harry off on an adventure to solve the mystery of who the child is, how he died and who killed him which will bring him both heartbreak and personal growth. Harry runs into the usual problems with superior officers and not so usual problems with the tracking down of the killer. At the conclusion of the book we are left to wonder what next for Harry and knowing that whatever it is, it will certainly be different. There are no slow reading chapters in this book. First rate."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I have read all of Mr. Connellys books, and although Trunk Music is probably my favorite, these last two books have been so wonderfully dark; Harry is one of the most complex characters we have.

Harry has just finished up with his second suicide call-out when he receives a \\"bone\\" call. A man on Wonderland had his dog out for a walk and she brought back a bone. At first skeptical, Bosch is told that the man is a retired doctor and knows a human bone when he sees one - the final nail in the coffin of Bosch's ennui is that the bone appears to be that of a child. Bosch heads for Laurel Canyon.What is discovered is heartbreaking. A mostly complete skeleton - about 60% complete - that is about the size of a 10-year-old boy. However, the bones indicate frequent physical abuse, starting when the boy was as young as 2 or 3, including broken bones and a neurosurgical procedure for a hard blow to the head, which means the boy was probably closer to 12. To make matters a bit more ... difficult - it appears that the skeleton has been in the ground about 20 years.Tracking down suspects and evidence - even learning who the boy was - on the cold case to end all cold cases is not easy; Harry nonetheless perseveres. What he discovers and uncovers is shocking.A very difficult but worthwhile read. Mention is made of Harry getting together with a rookie cop - I don't want to spoil anything, but I also don't want anyone getting their hopes up. All I'll say is that this is a very short romance. I feel for Harry - he's so alone and I think it would be good for him to have someone around, but at this time it's just not meant to be. He makes a life-changing decision at the very end of the book, so we'll see where this leads.

Bosch is determined to bring the killer to justice as he sees this type of child abuse as the consumate evil. With the Chief of Police already not his biggest fan, Harry gets into a relationship with a rookie female cop, knowing this is very much against regulations. Of course the romance turns out to be disasterous and tragic.

But Harry cares."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"City of Bones delivers a streamlined mystery that follows one trail after another until finally turning the corner that leads to the answer. The story is interesting and entertaining, providing several emotional twists. The climax is somewhat weak and not as satisfying as others from Connelly.

This story revolves around a set of newly discovered bones on a hill side in Laurel Canyon. The bones are 20 years old and Harry sets about unravelling the mystery. What sets Bosch apart is his depth and flaws. Mr. Connelly's scores big in several ways. First, is the depth he adds for all his characters. Secondly, his crisp writing moves the plot along at a good pace. Lastly, the touches of the police procedural are like no other writer that I have encountered in crime fiction. His writing is addictively good. This ranks with \\"The Poet\\" as my 2 favorites - so far."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Like much of what Connelly writes, this novel is a realistic look at how detective work actually takes place. The plot is almost too authentic in that pointless tragedies occur, and the whole storyline is very downbeat and depressing--just like real police work. In Connolly's LAPD there are departmental politics, professional rivalries, and infighting--just like any real city police force. This is not an uplifting novel or story. Quite the contrary. The ending is realistic and plausible--not the clever \\"tie all the pieces together\\" ending that many detective stories culminate with. In this one, there are loose ends and dead ends. The ending is less than satisfying albeit believable.The strengths of this novel are its realism and, of course, Connelly's writing, which is always pretty good."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"City Of Bones is a good book so far, and I really like the mystery and suspense. I really didn't like how the main character fell in love with a minor character. I really thought he would fall in love with another main character.

I have liked them because they have been a little bit more than just detective books to me, what I've liked is that you get a little bit more about the history of Harry Bosch every time and it keeps me going back for more.This book lacked that, it was pretty much straight detective novel for me and did little to piece together the main character.Had this been the first Michael Connelly book I've read, I would have liked it, but I don't know if I would have liked it enough to read more.

It did keep me interested through the whole thing but it was a not so thrilling ride. I guess I was just too shocked that the end wasn't what I wanted it to be. I was let down with the ending. I'm glad I read it, but doubt I would recommend it as a *thriller* but more of a police mystery. Kind of a monotone storyline that is somewhat predictable. I felt that Bosch ran up a few too many trees for the result he got, which made it all not seem worth it. But still well written and researched."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This was my first Harry Bosch book. I do not think I needed to read its predecessors (although there were a few vague references to Bosch's prior problems with the police brass).I found this to be a pretty run-of-the mill detective story. The characters were good, the writing fine and the police procedures interesting when analyzing 25 year old human bones. I thought the plot was going very well - including a few erroneous leads being followed. However, the ending left me disappointed. In the last 75 pages, one suspect is arrested, then the charges dropped and then the real killer identified and the crime solved. After such a long set-up it concluded too fast and in an unsatisfying manner.I enjoyed the book, but I did not find anything in it to recommend it over other detective stories. It was solid but no more. If you are a fan of this genre, I think you will be amused but not ready to rush out a buy some more Bosch books."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Against the grain and toughened by time describes Michael Connelly's detective character, Harry Bosch.

A gripping depth of despair is revealed through Connelly's detailed narrative, which serves as a sober reminder to be grateful for a decent and happy life.Excellent writing for a haunting novel."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I am busily reading through all the Bosch series.

The story starts neatly with a dog retrieving a human bone and from there the police become involved. Specifically Detective Harry Bosch and his partner. After making a cursory investigation and finding a possible burial site the other teams are called in to confirm the death of a small child. Harry does a good job of following the leads and the trail, but gets too personally involved in the situation such that he gets attention from the higher ups in the department. Harry also gets involved with a rookie female patrol officer and it looks like he and the officer are going to make something of thier relationship.The investigation seems straight forward, but takes a real turn for the worse and then another turn for the worse. Bosch's life and theory of the crime are both upset. He refuses to give up the chase and starts anew. This time he finds the true trail and does a lot of unorthodox moves. Some of which cause him to face a forced transfer in a few days with the case still open. Well harry hates to leave anything still open and the reader will be suprised as to how fast he works the case to a conclusion.The characters are well positioned and the suspense keeps the reader turning the pages.

As usual, Connelly writes this novel with dark overtones, clear wit, complex build-ups, rough character development, and (as I've always said) hard-hitting realism.

A bone expert says the boy had been consistently abused throughout his life. He lived most of his life in pain due to either healing or new injuries. Bosch and his partner talk to neighbors and take steps to get an identity.REVIEWER'S OPINION:I hated the unknown abuser and wanted to see pain to the abuser with justice. But the plot didn't go in that direction which was a letdown. My feelings at the end of the book were somewhat sad and empty, part due to the subject matter of child abuse, part due to the lack of a feeling of justice for the perpetrators, and part was a resignation that things can't always be resolved in black and white. I wanted to see the perpetrator stopped, put in jail, and suffer, but I didn't get that so I was disappointed. It was \\"I understand, but I don't like it.\\" I had tears in my eyes at the end. I was sad for a few characters. And I was mad at a couple of cops. Although we learn \\"who\\" killed the boy, I wanted more details of exactly what happened and why.Regarding the overall experience, it was excellent storytelling. I was engaged throughout. I enjoyed the detective work, good instincts, and satisfaction from solving the mystery. There were interesting characters with different motivations. This was still a good book just not my favorite in the series. I'm glad I read it, and I'm going on to the next one.A secondary story has Bosch dating a rookie cop, Julia Brasher - which could be a problem within the department.NARRATOR:The narrator Peter Fernandez (PF) was ok, but not nearly as good as Dick Hill. I miss Dick. Dick had a good Bosch voice and a very fitting voice for Bosch's partner Jerry Edgar (a deep black man's voice). PFs voice for Edgar wasn't anything like that, and I missed it.

Of course Connelly, now a mega-seller in light of the filmThe Lincoln Lawyer, based on the author's book of the same name, has had many best sellers. Connelly is a former journalist, a crime beat writer for the Los Angeles Times, who certainly earned his spurs in murder while earning his daily bread.The Bosch series, Los Angeles-set police procedurals, looks at life on the \\"noir\\" side in that city. Bosch, who was supposedly named after the famous 15th century Dutch painter by his mother, finds himself drawn into a case that brings up dark memories when the bones of a schoolboy are found on New Years Day. A retired doctor walking his dog in the Hollywood Hills has let her off the leash; Calamity brings back a bone that the doctor is sure is human, and shows signs of terrible, lifelong abuse. Bosch had been orphaned when he was eleven: the murdered boy appears to be 10-13 years old. As the cops start looking, more bones quickly come to light: the boy apparently was buried only shallowly. Bosch will also embark upon an against-the -rules affair with a much-younger woman cop: one way and another, he's in for a bad time. Yet Bosch stubbornly discovers the child's identity and reconstructs his fractured life, determined that the boy won't be forgotten. In what I consider to be one of Connelly's most masterful \`tours de force,' he comes up with several characters, one after another, and all believable, as the boy's possible murderer. The author further deepens his plot by telling us of the bones that come out of the La Brea tar pits, an ancient hazard to life now situated in the middle of busy Los Angeles; recently, the bones of a woman murdered 9,000 years ago had come to life.The book at hand gives us several of the supporting players we have become familiar with in Connelly's works: Bosch's police supervisor/enemy Irvin Irving, and the detective's partners/former partners Kiz Rider and Jerry Edgar. The author also pulls one of his favorite little maneuvers here, finding a way to mention another of his works, THE CLOSERS, which, while not yet written, was probably already outlined: he cleverly does that by bringing in the popular television showThe Closer: Complete First Season, which has actually nothing to do with his book of the same name. CITY also shows the excellent narrative, descriptive, and dialogue writing that are characteristic of Connelly, and is informed by his deep, accurate knowledge of police work, it too is written with great knowledge of, and love for, Los Angeles, the author's adopted home town. (You could pretty much use his works instead of a road map). In this book, the writer describes Venice, California, (the funky beach city adjacent to Santa Monica) with such poetry and power, that I've remembered his descriptions since my first reading of it-- I had to go and get a good look at the place on one of my trips to the far coast. And, surely, the book follows in the footsteps of earlier outstanding hardboiled Los Angeles authors Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald, but adds the further ingredients of a police procedural. Finally, Connelly explicates his love of jazz as he goes.And the writing he gives us, as for example, he explains the book's title:\\"Kohl ... was making notations on a piece of paper with a grid already printed on it.... At the top of the page she had written \`City of Bones.' .... \`Why do you call it that?'....'Because we're setting out the streets and the blocks of what will become a city to us,'....'At least while we're working here it will feel like it. Our little city.' Bosch nodded. \`In every murder is the tale of a city,' he said. ... \`Who said that?' \`I don't know. Somebody did.'\\" I've looked that reference up; it's to a poet I'm not familiar with.Shortly afterward, he discusses his time as a \\"tunnel rat,\\" working the dangerous tunnels of the Vietnam War, and explains the title of a book yet to be written, LOST LIGHT: that he also probably already had in outline:\\"Lost light. We called it lost light. We never knew where it came from. But it was down there. Like smoke hanging in the dark. Some people said it wasn't light, that it was the ghosts of everybody who died in those things. From both sides.\\"Many of Connelly's Bosch, and Lincoln Lawyer series have been New York Times best sellers, as have some of his recent standalones such as THE SCARECROW. Crime Beat: A Decade of Covering Cops and Killers, a non-fiction collection of his journalism, was also a New York Times bestseller. Personally, I consider this to be one of the finest of the Bosch series; Connelly is writing at his most powerful, and Bosch's tenderness of feeling and empathy towards the young boy and his sad, short life, are palpable."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I have heard lots of good comments about the Harry Bosch novels and I was not disappointed with this seventh book of the series. Bosch is a hard boiled homocide detective in the Hollywood division of the LAPD who gets a call that a dog has discovered a human bone. The investigation uncovers a 20 year old murder of a 12 year-old boy who was the victim of child abuse. As the case proceeds, Bosch meets and becomes involved with a rookie cop named Julia Brasher, who has an idealistic view of police work.Some information leaks and false clues initially sidetrack the investigation but slowly the victim is identified and his short and tortured life revealed. Connelly draws his characters with fine strokes and his development of the details of the police procedures which are key to solving cases was really fascinating to me. Understanding the murder book, how warrants were drawn up and served, and details behind the forensic investigation added to my enjoyment of the story.False directions provide intrigue but I was a little disappointed with the unsatisfying way the murderer was revealed and dealt with.All in all though, a fast paced (I read it in one 24 hour period), and very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I bought 'City of Bones' when it first came out, but put off reading it for a bit. The last couple of Connelly's novels about Detective Harry Bosch seemed a bit off pace, so I was waiting for a tolerant moment. Once I started reading I discovered that my premonitions were wrong, and that this was going to be a high water mark in the eight volume series.Michael Connelly has a trick of creating an introspective mood without actually making his characters become solipsistic, and 'City of Bones' at its deepest level is about Harry Bosch coming to grips with his own beliefs and needs. This subtext threads its way through a case involving the 20-year-old corpse of a young boy found buried in a small plot of woods. Cases this old are rarely soluble, but somehow just enough information keeps coming to the surface to keep Bosch and his partner, Jerry Edgar, working away at the case. Gradually Bosch becomes fixated on the case as its ramifications begin to have echoes in his own life.One of the key factors in Bosch's character development is a new relationship with rookie police officer Julia Brasher. She is the officer on duty at the murder site, and is drawn into the investigation. This relationship becomes the model for all the other relationships in the book; especially those Bosch has with his partner and his work. In the end it triggers something unexpected in the older detective, and will eventually cause him to make some surprising decisions.Beyond the character level, the plot is tightly drawn and well paced. Generally, a story that turns on forensic police procedure is interesting rather than exciting, but Connelly has goes to great lengths to prove that this does not have to be the case. There is a surfeit of plot twists and the high emotional pitch will keep the reader on tenterhooks - a delightful form of torture, too rarely experienced in the present.Obviously, I enjoyed the book. I found myself intentionally slowing down my reading speed in order to extend my pleasure with a writer whose minimalist style always seems to have more to say than the efforts of wordier contemporaries. This is a milestone in the Harry Bosch series, but hopefully not its last, shining moment."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"&quot;City of Bones&quot; was a happy reunion for me. I met again the Michael Connelly to whom I was introduced in &quot;Black Echo&quot; and &quot;Concrete Blonde&quot; and &quot;Black Ice&quot; that electrified me with his broody LA, sharp characterizations and twisting suspense. No one in &quot;City of Bones&quot; is 100 percent nice or straight arrow, though all are very recognizable. I had my usual problems with Harry, always wanting to tell him to lighten up a bit. By this time, I should be resigned. Harry Bosch is to gloom like Goldie Hawn is to giggles.Harry walks into a cold case when a dog digs up an old bone in Laurel Canyon that turns out to be human. Harry's superiors are unenthusiastic because the chances of closing a 20-year old case are slim to none. Harry is grimly determined because when more of skeleton is found, it is ascertained the victim was an abused child. Harry first runs afoul of a former girl friend Medical Examiner (suspiciously close to Cornwell's Kay Scapetta) who has risen so far in the world; she cares more about photo ops than the integrity of the case. Along with hard working cops, there are plethoras of politician/cops who are willing to set up and convict the first likely guy that comes up on the radar. As if Harry doesn't have enough troubles, an ill-fated romance with a police rookie streaks across his horizon. He antagonizes his own partner with his lone wolf tactics, and seemingly neglects an obvious suspect for far too long.The denouement has twist after twist, surprise after surprise leaving us breathless and far behind Harry all the way. Then Harry gets another idea, leaving us hollering, &quot;wait a minute!&quot; but Harry just keeps walking right off the last page."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Lets start off with telling you how much i love Michael Connelly's books, but then this one just left me not satisfied at all.first off, the book got me really hooked, i really liked it alot!when a simple walk out with the dog turns up a bone from the woods, and investigation goes out to search for where the bone comes from. very good with some details and such, but then the only negative of this book is that it left too many questions unanswerd. I didn't like it the way it ended, when they find or think this person is the kids killer, then bam...what the?? i really wanted to know what went on! if i give any more information about it, then i would basically be giving away the book.its a good read, but if your the type that doesn't like to dwell on why this wasn't answered or what happened to cause this killing...then this book isn't for you."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"With &quot;Blood Work&quot; (1998 ) set to become a major motion picture and &quot;A Darkness More Than Night&quot; (2001) receiving plaudits one might think ace crime writer Michael Connelly would be resting on his laurels, film rights, and royalties. Not so. The energetic author now presents &quot;City Of Bones,&quot; another in his bestselling Harry Bosch series.This time detective Harry Bosch faces off with a child murderer, a killer who has remained on the loose for nearly two decades. Once a dog uncovers what appears to be a human bone in the woods of Hollywood Hills, Bosch is called. It takes the savvy sleuth only a glance to realize this is a child's arm bone.Once the media spreads the word Laurel Canyon is crawling with police, amateur crime solvers, the curious, reporters, and (true to Connelly form) a gorgeous young police officer whom Harry takes under his wing in more ways than one.As additional remains are unearthed Bosch determines the bones are those of a long dead abused boy. Obviously, there's a killer out there who believes he's home free, and Bosch is haunted by black images of his own childhood. The pressure is mounting and it's all on Bosch.Few can bring to life the components of a police investigation as capably and thoroughly as former crime reporter Connelly. Authenticity and rapid fire action make &quot;City Of Bones&quot; another can't-put-it-down read.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This is a must buy and read Harry Bosch book!Harry is at his peak in this one, and I took only one break while reading it. It is non-stop reading and riveting! The plot is an excellent one and as Connelly usual, a very twisty ending (unexpected).This is for any mystery fan really - honestly. The title signifies a horror found in the hills, and Harry must work to solve this one. Despite the usual struggles, Harry works out the obstacles his own way, in his own fashion, and some of it hurts. But true to the Bosch vernacular, Harry tracks down the bones and his own ghosts. Buy it! Read it! Then buy the whole series and read them from the beginning to the newest!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"\\"City of Bones\\" is Michael Connelly's thirteenth book, his eighth to feature Harry Bosch and was first published in 2002. Orphaned at the age of twelve when his mother was murdered, Bosch spent his teenage years in and out of orphanages. He enlisted in the army and served in Viet-Nam, before returning home to Los Angeles and joining the police force. Once a member of the LAPD's elite RHD (Robbery-Homicide Division), he was demoted in the Hollywood Division following an Internal Affairs investigation. Bosch has occasionally been seen by some as a maverick, but increasingly by others as a 'man with a mission' and an excellent homicide investigator. Harry is one of the senior detectives at Hollywood's homicide table, and is Squad One's team leader. Although he continues to work with Jerry Edgar, the team's third member - Kiz Rider - has yet to be replaced following her promotion to RHD.\\"City of Bones\\" provides both a difficult case and a rough ride for Harry. A retired doctor makes a call to the department, saying that his dog had returned from a run in the Hollywood Hills carrying a human bone. A number of calls like this are made every year, which normally turn out to be bogus: however, this time, there is no mistake. Dr. Guyot, the caller, has correctly identified it as a child's humerus and has also identified a healed fracture on the bone. Using the dog to discover where the humerus had been buried, a subsequent, more detailed search recovers about sixty per-cent of the skeleton. This includes the skull, where the fatal blow was apparently struck. The remains are of a boy, possibly as young as ten, and show evidence of several years worth of chronic abuse. The best initial guess for the time of death, meanwhile, is between the mid-seventies and the mid-eighties - making the investigation a 'cold case', the hardest cases to close. The first step, obviously, is to identify the victim - a process that included looking at the list of missing persons who match the criteria for age and the time of disappearance. As harsh as it sounds, the injuries that made the boy's life so difficult may provide the key identifying him - and, possibly, the killer.When Bosch first arrives at Dr. Guyot's house, a couple of uniformed cops are already there. The junior partner, Julia Brasher, is a rookie (or 'boot') who Bosch is immediately attracted to. Given that Bosch is at supervisor level, it's against regulations to allow anything other than a professional relationship between the pair. However, given a pretty face, who also seems rather taken with him, and a chance to bend the rules, there's generally only one thing Harry Bosch is capable of doing...and when Bosch bends the rules, it generally means trouble.After \\"A Darkness More Than Night\\", when the action was divided between Harry and Terry McCaleb, this is a return to a 'straightforward' Bosch book - and is much better for having only one 'main' character. You won't feel too left out if you've never read any of the other Bosch books before. However, it's probably better if you've read at least a couple of them : there's a few passing references to some of the events of his previous adventures - the story behind his scar on his shoulder and his relationship with Teresa Coraz&oacute;n, for example. Recommended."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Connelly's detective (Harry Bosch) is as insightful, anti-authoritarian, and occasionally glum as always. The plot is twisting. And the action unfolds at a good but unexaggerated pace. It's great mystery/police-procedural reading. And yet it doesn't have the same spark and wit and personal quirks that the earlier ones (which are 5 stars plus) do. But start with earlier Bosch and come to this willing to cut some slack and it's well worth it. (The reader on the audio version (unabridged) has good voice characterizations that keep all conversations clear and add some emotion.)"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"If there is a better police procedural crime novel, I've missed it. I approached this book with some misgivings, having been disappointed by \\"Chasing the Dime.\\" But Henry (Hieronymous--I liked that little touch) Bosch is a first-class, believable detective, all the way. He's jaded to some degree but tries to maintain some touch with the populace. The us-them relationship police have with the press and the \\"looky loos,\\" as civilians are called, is there, certainly, but outwardly subdued.The plot feels right, enhanced by the fact that the writer didn't try to tie up all the loose ends, such as, the surprising matter of Julia Brasher and, not to give too much away, the fact that the killer is not at all a sure thing when we reach the final page. Not all killers confess into a tape recorder and psychoanalyze their own motives.Bosch makes mistakes. He goes down dead-end trails after false clues. He is imperfect. In short, he is realistic. So are the other characters, including his partner, the technicians, Bosch's superiors in the department, the suspects, the incidental personae--the entire cast. They don't always do what we expect, but people in real life don't either. Too many books have characters who appear to be \\"on rails.\\" We know exactly where they are going and how the plot is going to follow them.I realize I haven't outlined the plot, but others have, and sometimes they give away too much. Suffice it to say that I'll read more of the Harry Bosch series and hope for books that are in this same class."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I picked up this book after reading an article about the author in the New York Times. I couldn't put the book down and finished it in two days. Unlike some authors who write about LA and put Downey next to LAX, Mr. Connelly's Southern California is accurate. The little bits of ambience he throws in ---Philippe's sandwiches, farmer's market donuts --are pleasant, but you don't have to be an Angeleno to enjoy his work. With the exception of the Julia Brasher character (I couldn't figure out what was going on there), I enjoyed each of the people I met in the book, from the stars to the bit-players. Little vignettes, like the auditioning LA police officers, the SID scientist who was an avid skateboarder, the anthropologist at the Page Museum who could read a person's history in their bones, the retired doctor, made the book come alive. I'm looking forward to reading more of this author's works.I also want to thank the people who write reviews. I read them in order to decide whether I will enjoy a book or not. I'm not a professional book person by any means, but by adding my voice, I hope that I can help someone decide whether this is a book for their tastes."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This is my 6th or 7th Michael Connelly book since becoming \\"addicted\\" to his easy reads & twisted plot endings. The only one worse than City of Bones was Chasing The Dime which I left on P. 192 a couple months ago. City of Bones is, generally, the same good read but the person finally pegged as the killer in the end wss never proven to me---the most incomplete villain ever!! At the risk of invading a writer's mind, I think Detective Edgewood should have been the killer of the boy as well as the eventual \\"killer\\". It would have made for a more intriguing subplot with the two of them connected in a sinister, perverse way!!! lol. Chasing The Dime, a non-Bosch story, was bogged down in way too many pages of boring technological details of nanochips and patents. It did not seem to be Connelly's forte. That said, every other Connelly book has been a fun, entertaining page-turner."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This was only my second Connelly book, with Echo Park being the first, so I was not disappointed as other Connelly fans have been with this book. I thought it to be better than Echo Park, I was more engaged with this one. After a dog digs up a bone of a child's dead body, Harry investigates. He also develops a love interest in a rookie. It retains suspense until the end of the story. I didn't particularly care for the romance part of the storyline, but it was a small enough part to not take away from the main storyline of the murder mystery. I would recommend this to people who enjoys murder mysteries."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I won't rehash the plot summary since most reviews do that...I'll just jump right into what I thought of the book. To start, I have to mention that this is the first Harry Bosch novel I have read. I was given the book as a gift, and decided to read it before going out and buying the first in the series. I love that the story involves an investigation that feels \\"real.\\" There are no over the top clues, and the detectives don't just go out, find things, and wrap up the case in 48 hours which seems to happen in so many stories to keep the action flowing. Harry Bosch is a real detective and his investigation takes some time. Also, Connelly does a superb job in demonstrating to the reader the inner workings of a real cop. He seems to know how they tick. I enjoyed the behind the scenes stuff and inner workings of Bosch more than the plot of the murder.That being said, the novel left me feeling a little empty inside. For a fascinating setup to a story with a dog digging up a human bone in the woods, I felt let down by the rest of the plot. The ending was totally anti-climactic as other detectives brought down the \\"bad guy\\" while we were stuck in Bosch's point of view a distance away from the action, wondering what was going on. Too many strings were left untied, as we never find out what really happened in one of the biggest plot twists and certainly the best action sequence. In addition, there seemed to be some continuity issues in play. Harry cracks a few ribs at the beginning of the book, and it is mentioned a few times as being very painful for him over the next few days. Then, all of a sudden, it is never mentioned again, and he is able to do some incredibly strenuous activities that nobody would be able to do a few days after breaking their ribs. I know it sounds like I'm nit-picking a bit, but a great book should not have those issues.I finished reading the book about a week ago and I still can't decide if I liked it or not. It kept me engaged throughout, but still left me wanting more from the experience when I was done. Overall, I would probably give the book more like a 3.5 rating. I recommend it for an entertaining read, but don't expect to be blown away. I am going to try to read some of the earlier Bosch novels now, and I suggest other readers do the same first. From what I hear, those are much more engaging."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Another Connelly book written to justify a publishers advance (my guess). It fares better than A Darkness More Than Light and The Overlook both of which are extremely weak.But not much better. I figured out the killer right after Bosch interviews the dead boys father and he says he did it.Bosch resigns at the end of the book and it is totally unconvincing.Nothing spectacular here. It's readable, sometimes predictable, but also forgettable.And, my pet peeve about Connelly's writing is back in full swing. His use of the word \\"nodded\\". I counted it six times in two pages at one point. His editor really needs to get with it."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"It's always nice (and it is rare) to see an author get better and better. Many writers write just about the same book every time. This novel is a real gem in the detective/thriller genre. I don't think I've ever read one as good. The characters, the dialogue, the plot, and EVERYTHING come together in a superbly well crafted tale. I defy anyone to figure out whodunnit before the final pages. Yet it makes perfect sense. Connelly was always good but with this book he puts himself up there with the greats. Hope we see more of hero Harry Bosche."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"After taking a couple books off from his principal series character Harry Bosch (with the exception of a guest appearance in A Darkness More Than Night), Michael Connelly has returned to his hard-boiled detective in a novel that is as high caliber as any of the previous Bosch efforts.In this story, Harry is assigned to an old [end of life]; the bones of a child have been found by a dog, but they are at least decades old. It is quite a challenge; even determining the child's identity isn't easy. In the course of the investigation, Bosch also meets a rookie cop who he becomes romantically entangled with; as with everything in Bosch's life, there will be big complications here too.Connelly once again shows that he is one of the best mystery writers around today, probably in the top five on the active list. And Connelly is never stronger than when he writes about Bosch. It is not essential that you read the previous Bosch books to enjoy this one,..."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Bosch has been with us for quite awhile and he is still a great character. This book is fantastic and reads quickly. Enjoy."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"A dog finds a young child's bone...Bosch is called to thescene...20 year old murder. Bosch engages with new femaleofficer. Suicide, sort-of-suicide, what is that all about?Plot stays true to the end. Entertaining read. Not hisbest."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Michael Connelly is one of the best mystery writers now writing, and City of Bones is one of his best mysteries. It opens with the discovery of bones from a long-forgetten death and speeds us through a contemporary view of modern SOuthern California. This work is remarkable. Read it today."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"When they're just starting out, writers are on fire--driven by the compulsion to write, fueled by the determination to do it better than anyone else ever could. That was very definitely the case with the first of Connelly's books. The Black Echo, The Black Ice were exceptional efforts, the kind of inspired writing that brings readers back for more. Sometimes, when writers achieve success, they lose the fire and their work reflects it. That's very definitely the case with Connelly. His last book, A Darkness More Than Night, was all over the map and not credible. City of Bones is somewhat better because the author is back to focusing on one hero, rather than two. But this book is lethargic. It starts with an interesting premise but fails to deliver, with an ending that is lacklustre.Bosch connects with an over-thirty female rookie and they embark upon an affair. It's abrupt and not entirely convincing. It is also amazingly similar to one of the threads of Lee Child's new Reacher novel. That happens. There are no new ideas under the sun. But the difference between the two books is noteworthy. In Connelly's book the emotions seem synthetic. In the Child's book, it's knockout stuff. It is, ultimately, the difference between a writer who is still on fire and one who is down to the embers.Perhaps Connelly will go in a new direction, given the ending of City of Bones. That might be a very good idea because the Harry Bosch series seems to have come to the end--both in terms of the stories themselves and in terms of the amount of energy the author appears prepared to give.Disappointing."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"\\"City of Bones\\" is intensely well written. For me it was a nonstop read that I could savor at the same time. I completed it in just two sittings.In this one Michael Connelly takes a couple of side roads that give the reader time to contemplate all that is surrounding Harry Bosch as he lives his \\"everyone counts or nobody counts\\" credo.As Harry seeks to uncover the murderer of a young boy that took place over twenty years earlier, a chain reaction of unintended consequences is set off---taking its toll in death and human destruction. The pages fly by as the reader joins Harry in his quest.Harry Bosch attacks this case with a vengeance that makes him an archangel for both the victim and Los Angeles.The writing is crisp, literate, hardboiled and dark---yet sensitive. It is complex story with a riveting plot. We continue to learn more about Harry Bosch as Mr. Connelly shows the reader some of Harry's more subtle characteristics.The ending is quite a surprise that had me talking to myself. Not to be missed is the interview that Michael Connelly does with Harry Bosch that is available on his web site. The interview gives away some plot points, so read \\"City of Bones\\" before the interview.This is mystery writing at its finest."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Anyone who has read the previous works by Michael Connelly featuring Harry Bosch absolutely MUST read this one, as opening *City of Bones* and once again encountering Bosch is its own way like being reintroduced to an old friend.As is so often the case with Connelly's novels, the story is grisly and depressing, and the mood overall very *noir*. In terms of the quality of the writing, the development of some (not all) characters, and the plot line *most* of the way through, Connelly once again delivers a tight, gripping, fascinating book that is hard to put down.However, I confess that I was keenly disappointed in the book's ending. I expected some final twists and turns in the plot that would tie together some definite loose ends, but these never materialized. No spoilers here, so I will simply have to declare that I felt in more ways than one, the way the story concluded was disjointed and unsatisfying. This has rarely been the case previously with Michael Connelly's novels, and this renders my disappointment doubly keen.Another problem is that *City of Bones* reveals very little about Harry Bosch's personality and personal history, and so readers who have not read the previous Bosch novels will surely not find the protagonist nearly as interesting as those who have several books' worth of previous character development to fall back upon. There are cryptic references to Bosch's past here and there, but Connelly seems to assume that he is writing for an audience that already knows his character, and this seems to me to be a mistake."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I am a huge Michael Connelly fan and a fan of Harry Bosch in particular. This book is another in the long line of Bosch adventures - and is true to the character of Bosch. I came to this series through the backdoor - through reading \\"Bloodwork\\" and \\"A Darkness More than Night\\" and have found them to be highly enjoyable. I have read the series pretty much straight through, minus \\"The Concrete Blonde\\" and Bosch feels like an old friend at this point. There are plenty of places to pick up the plot details so I will skip them. I've never been to Hollywood, or LA for that matter, but Connelly instantly transports the reader into the city and his considerable experiences as a journalist add to the ability to narrate the story and transport the reader into the story. Since I've read a later book in the series, \\"The Narrows\\" I know what direction Bosch is headed in. I look forward to reading \\"Lost Light\\" since it is written in the first person and it will be interesting to see what's inside Bosch's head."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I really enjoyed this tale that is not like the average police tale. Rather than a lot of action the author relies on the psychology of the main characters as they attack a case of a crime committed more than 20 years prior, that was never reported and with virtually no evidence to go on. The author methodically takes us through how the police sift through the evidence and leads that they can find, while trying to eliminate all that is irrelevent, with minimal resources and minimal time to solve the crime.Harry Bosch is the main character, who has been the subject of many prior novels by the same author. He is a detective, who is torn with a lot of inner struggles but with a desire to try to right some of the bad things in life. He is someone determined to get to answers even when it seems that even if he finds those answers, it will be for naught.Harry seems to be nearing the end of his career and in a lot of hot water with the top police brass. His problems seem to escalate when he begins a relationship with a female officer, which is considered a big no-no to those in authority.If you are looking for a lot of action try another book. If you want a look at the inner thought of some interesting characters with detail of police procedure thrown in then this book is for you. I choose the later option."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This being my first Michael Connelly novel I only knew him by reputation and didn't know what to expect of his writing. I bought it take on a short vacation and ended up reading the entire novel on the car ride en route. Needless to say, I was thoroughly enthralled by this book.Detective Harry Bosch's endeavor to solve a 20-year-old murder of a 12-year-old boy made for an interesting plot. But it was Connelly's ability to seamlessly move his characters in and out of a shifting storyline that kept the pages turning at a brisk pace. I found his writing to be very fluid and very readable. And I really didn't come across any dead spots in the book. I suppose that at some point the final outcome became predictable but, for me, that didn't dampen one iota my enjoyment of \\"City of Bones.\\" Other reviewers have stated that Connelly has done better in some of his other books in the Harry Bosch series. That being the case, I certainly will be reading many more of Connelly's works."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Against the grain and toughened by time describe L.A. homicide detective Harry Bosch, Michael Connelly's main character.Hard hit by the discovery of a young boy's skeleton in the Hollywood Hills, \\"Dirty Harry\\" Bosch silently sets his sights on uncovering the child's identity and tracking the cold lead of the killer. City of Bones is a chilling story, which outlines an eerie parallel between the brutal abuse that the boy suffered during his brief, troubled life and the engulfing evil that Bosch doggedly tries to purge from his beloved city.Connelly has a knack for capturing the steady pressure of a determined detective and for conveying the misery of a tragic life, cut short, never given the chance for happiness. A gripping depth of despair is revealed through Connelly's detailed narrative, which serves as a sober reminder to be grateful for a decent and happy life.Excellent writing for a haunting novel."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"1) Starts out great: intriguing murder case2) Book has a terrific character arc for the protaganist (continuing character Harry Bosch)3) Excellent view of the inner workings of LAPD, real grit, great atmosphereBUT:4) I found the solution to the murder to be very routine and lacked any really twists that would have made it really exciting.I know that's not real life, and Bosch is supposed to be based on real-life, but for such an intriguing beginning, the ending was a let-down.For the record, I prefer the non-Bosch novels \\"Blood Work\\" and \\"Chasing The Dime.\\" So factor that into your opinions.Howver, I anxiously await reading the new Bosch book \\"Lost Light\\" to see what happens to him."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"It must be difficult to write of one character repeatedly. Yet Connelly's extraordinary skill at bringing us to see the dark side and then bringing us back, wiser but always a little shaken, remains unparalleled. Harry Bosch. Can there be any doubt that this is Humphrey Bogart 60 years ago? Harry Bosch belongs in the lexicon of the American novel alongside of Dave Robicheaux, Patrick Kenzie, Elvis Cole, Joe Pike, Hawk and the rest.Harry reluctantly gives his partner, Jerry Edgar, New Years Day off and spends the day \\"catching suicides,\\" one a \\"no change of mind\\" and the other an \\"accidental.\\" We are drawn into the dark side of a once heroic profession, cleaning up the detritus of lost and sometimes stolen lives. His new friend \\"Boot\\" Julia Brasher tells him that she hates to clean the vomit out of the back of the squad car. And right away, we know where we are. Like Tchaikovsky's \\"Pathetique,\\" we have a sense that the tale will be beautiful and yet very, very sad.Connelly is a master and possibly after several less than satisfying ventures, this is again classic Bosch. On that same empty New Years Day, a call comes in that an aging Doctor's dog has discovered a child's bone while rooting around Laurel Canyon.What Connelly does perhaps better than anyone else lies in the subtle dialogue of his characters. The petition of the forensic anthropologist, telling Harry that without faith, we are all lost. The conversation with the old Doctor, wealthy, happily binding Harry's broken ribs, who had given 1/2 a century to curing ills but who has no place to go on New Years Day. These are all part of the deep background Connelly paints.The child was a victim of serial abuse and naturally, this triggers recollections of his own lost foster home youth. The conversation with Julia Brasher on how he removed the tatoos from his fists before he went to Vietnam and the brief, understated recitation of his time in the tunnels is orchestrated in such a manner as to make the telling of the story, while not predictable, secondary to the characters.Mike Connelly can still make his point about those who believe that last blue shield can still make a difference with a conversation over a box of donuts.Good stuff. Excellent writing. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This is an enthralling Harry Bosch mystery with Harry investigating a 20 year old homocide when some bones are unearthed. This is a classic Connelly page turner. If you like the past Bosch books you'll like this one. This is not the best of the series but it is better than &quot;A Darkness More Than Night&quot;. Not as many twist, turns, and surprises as the other books but still at least one good one included. The reader can sit back and relax while reading &quot;City of Bones&quot; knowing Harry's on the case."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Connelly is among the best of the contemporary, gritty hard-boiled school. Maybe even the best. For me, this was a very taut, well-paced thriller. The procedural element was excellent. I would give the book a 5 except for two things. First was the Brasher sub-plot, which I thought was going to be great, but ending up feeling psychologically invalid. What happens might have been made believable, but perhaps Connelly was afraid it wouldn't be surprising enough. Instead, I was angry. Secondly - the end failed. It might have pure emotional dynamite. Perhaps if the Brasher situation had been more believable, I'd have believed Bosch's final choice. But again, I just felt set up, that it was done for effect rather than emotionally inevitable for the character. Nonetheless, mystery writers of this caliber are difficult to come by, so the book still ranks high for what it does do well."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"MIchael Connely never disappoints. I've read most of his books and Iliked all of them. Can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Kept me guessing! Michael Connelly has created yet another great Harry Bosch story. This time he really told a story well about a sensitive issue. Child abuse."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"the product came promptly in less time than stipulated and was accurately summarized, I would recommend purchases from this vender.

But then I found myself deliberately slowing my reading speed down in order to extend my delight with a writer whose discreet style always seems to grip me. This is a milestone in the Harry Bosch series, but hopefully not its last, shining moment. Few can bring to life the mechanism of a police investigation as capably and thoroughly as former crime reporter Connelly. Authenticity and rapid fire action make \\"City Of Bones\\" another can't-put-it-down read. I'm not a professional book person by any means, but by adding my voice, I hope that I can help someone decide whether this is a book for their tastes."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I had read a couple of these over the years, but was able to get the whole collection and am going all the wry through. It is great!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Michael Connelly is one of my favorite mystery/suspense authors.

I've read most of the Bosch series and this one doesn't fail. I am not yet finished with the book but can't wait for the ending. Harry is tenaciously trying to solve the mystery of the 20 year-old bones found in the hills by a dog. The bones belong to a murdered child and Harry will not play any games that his department bosses want to play - it's the truth and only the truth from Harry, even if it hurts the department's reputation. A few twists and turns along the way keep the action going. Harry is as intense and focused as ever, keeping the reader tense and engaged as well! Another winner for Connelly."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Always love a Michael Connolly. Adore Bosch and Heller. Never read a dud from Connolly.

Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch is, in my opinion, the most interesting of all the modern detective characters. The 1st novel, &#34;The Black Echo&#34; grabbed me and didn't loosen it's grip until well AFTER the last page. Even though I've read or listened to all of the books in the series, I've made sure to add each one to my Kindle collection when it goes on sale, because I want to read them at my leisure and as often as I please. This one, &#34;The City of Bones&#34; is as at least good as the 1st.

I have read previous books by this author and I love the character Harry Bosch. Really enjoyed."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Not the strongest of the Harry Bosch series, but a good read nonetheless. One can't help liking the Harry Bosch character, taciturn but driven, and very fallible in his personal life. Once again the personal and the professional clash in Bosch's life. Strange that he can remain so detached and perceptive in his detective work, but such a disaster in his personal dealings. An interesting murder over 20 years old is the center of this story and Bosch has his eyes only on solving it, no matter the cost."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"The dog dug up the remains in a shallow grave in Hollywood Hills. The Los Angeles Police Department forensic team performs magic on the decaying bones by determining the victim was approximately twelve years old, was battered, and finally killed by a blow to the head around 1980. Not much more for the head Detective Harry Bosch to work on except the nearby-buried surfboard is quite distinguishing looking.Since the homicide much of the neighborhood has turned over as people moved away. Harry follows the thin leads accompanied by rookie Julia Brasher. Not long after sharing the case, the two cops share a bed. After identifying the victim through his surfboard, Harry and Julia begin inquires with friends and family of the lad that take them to a series of individuals who make the \\"City of Angels\\" seem more like the \\"City of Lost Souls\\". Violent incidents occur leaving Harry to wonder if the efforts to solve a two decade old crime could prove dangerous for those involved today including two police officers.Harry remains Harry as he retains that same edge that readers enjoyed in his previous book, A DARKNESS MORE THAN NIGHT even with brash Julia to take some of the edge off the hero. The investigation is engaging and the secondary cast of losers adds depth to the plot while keeping Harry in the darkest environs of society. However, Michael Connelly's effort to bring peril into the present deletes from the overall plot of a powerhouse investigative tale of a twenty year old murder. Still, CITY OF BONES is a taut Harry Bosch police procedural.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"In deference to Michael Connelly's brilliant -- and prior -- Harry Bosch novels, Connelly's &quot;City of Bones&quot; receives a courtesy three stars. Alas, that is the only courtesy we can give this very disappointing novel. There is much of a relatively minor nature that is wrong with this book. Brasher's shooting, for example: never explained, and mourned by Harry for...gee, a few hours. The suggestion that there is more to the &quot;leak&quot; than we know...it comes to nothing. The fact that Dr. Guyot keeps written records of every patient he has ever treated (even in retirement): zip/zero/nada. Then there are the extraneous scenes: Bosch with his former lover, the ME; Bosch with Brasher's father; Bosch with the departmental &quot;shrink.&quot; Long ago, Chekov suggested that the writer not describe a gun unless that gun would eventually go off. Connelly ignores that advice, to his, and the novel's, disadvantage. Not to mention that the &quot;confession&quot; is clearly bogus (do we expect a bona fide confession with over one hundred pages left in the novel?).But, as egregious as these faults are, they pale in comparison to the fundamental problem with this novel: this is not Harry Bosch. Harry, we hardly knew 'ye: what has become of the morally ambiguous, shades of gray, tormented Bosch? The character in &quot;City of Bones&quot; has Harry's name and nothing else. Would our beloved Bosch so readily enter into a relationship with Brasher? Would Harry glide through an entire novel with virtually no second thoughts (until a very unconvincing ending?)? Who is this guy?Connelly is perhaps writing too quickly (it's not often that an author has two hardcovers on the market at the same time, and not often that most authors (Dean Koontz excepted) have already published the next sequel. But perhaps it's just that Connelly, like Bosch, has become a shadow of his former self. Success -- well deserved in Connelly's case -- drains not only the author's energy but the author's work.Reading the excerpts from &quot;Lost Light,&quot; I am somewhat encouraged. If Harry is now to become a de facto Private Investigator, narrated in the first person, then Connelly is moving toward what he has always admired and always striven for: a modern day Philip Marlowe. There may be hope yet. But Michael, write slower, and work harder."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I've read, and mostly enjoyed, all the Harry Bosch novels. But with this one, Connelly has worn out his welcome.HB is the classic \\"hard boiled dick\\", the detective that deals with the seamier side of life, that deals with people at their worst. You can tell a lot of interesting stories with this kind of protagonist, which is why there are so many hard boiled dick stories.But all the \\"mean streets\\" stuff is just a premise. It's not an end in itself. Alas, that's the part Connelley is more and more fascinated with. The titles just keep getting more and more portentious, the story gets more and more nasty and meaningless. In the end, what's the point? You just have a depressive guy running through the streets yelling \\"Redemption! Redemption!\\"What finally did it for me was the excerpt from the next Harry Bosch at the end of the paperback edition. This one will be narrated by Harry himself, in full self-absorbtion mode. No thank you!I picture Harry running into my current genre favorite, John Sandford's Lucas Davenport. Like Harry, Lucas is a mean streets guy. (Of course, the streets of Minneapolis aren't nearly as mean as those of L.A.) Lucas would certainly say to Harry, \\"Get a life, dude!\\""},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"With the discovery of human bones found buried in the Hollywood Hills, Harry Bosch will take the plunge into a case that opens up dark memories from his own past.Bosch begins his investigation and uncovers the identity of the bones to be that of a twelve-year-old boy buried for years in the hills.

During his long career, Harry has seen it all. He has been battered both physically and emotionally throughout the years, and at this stage in his life, he is not easily rattled.One day, however, a dog unearths a child's bone that has been buried in the Hollywood hills for more than twenty years. The forensic anthropologist determines that not only was the child murdered, but he had also been severely beaten over a long period of time prior to his death. Who was this child and is there a chance that the murderer can be brought to justice after so many years? For reasons of his own, Harry cannot be objective about this case. He vows to find the murderer, no matter how much time and effort it takes.Against the background of this intense investigation, Harry begins a risky affair with a rookie cop, Julia Brasher. He also clashes with his superiors in the LAPD and with the media, who are determined to sensationalize the case. Harry does not suffer fools gladly, and he is impatient with people who are incompetent and/or self-serving. \\"City of Bones\\" is particularly noteworthy for Connelly's excellent depiction of the LAPD's complex procedures and internal politics. The author has done his homework and his book has an air of authenticity that many similar novels lack.\\"City of Bones\\" is not a pretty, \\"feel-good\\" novel. It is a deeply pessimistic book about the dark side of human nature. Connelly touches on such unpleasant topics as child abuse, police brutality, and suicide . The Los Angeles of this novel is a \\"city of bones\\" both literally and figuratively. Several characters in the novel have ugly secrets that they hope will remain hidden, but, like buried bones, secrets have a nasty habit of ultimately being revealed.\\"City of Bones\\" is a gritty, dramatic and unsettling novel.

Remembered for his appearances on TV's &quot;Law and Order,&quot; &quot;Cosby,&quot; and others, Fernandez is a gifted actor with much experience on and off Broadway. His background is obvious in this exemplary reading.Veteran actor/singer Len Cariou offers a distinctively different interpretation in the abridged version, but one that is equally compelling. Who can forget Cariou's star turns in Broadway productions featuring the music of Sondheim?&quot;City Of Bones,&quot; is another in Connelly's bestselling Harry Bosch series. This time out detective Harry Bosch faces off with a child murderer, a killer who has remained on the loose for nearly two decades. Once a dog uncovers what appears to be a human bone in the woods of Hollywood Hills, Bosch is called. It takes the savvy sleuth only a glance to realize this is a child's arm bone.Once the media spreads the word Laurel Canyon is crawling with police, amateur crime solvers, the curious, reporters, and (true to Connelly form) a gorgeous young police officer whom Harry takes under his wing in more ways than one.As additional remains are unearthed Bosch determines the bones are those of a long dead abused boy. Obviously, there's a killer out there who believes he's home free, and Bosch is haunted by black images of his own childhood. The pressure is mounting and it's all on Bosch.Few can bring to life the components of a police investigation as capably and thoroughly as former crime reporter Connelly.

The story moves at snail's pace for about half the book and then different events happen unexpectedly and rather suddenly.

Also, the pace of this book moved quickly and kept me guessing - a total success.However, as a Harry Bosch novel, I think that book failed. While Bosch was himself, the characters that usually surround him were missing. As a stand alone novel, I would have loved it, but since it was a Bosch novel, I wanted more of the characters from the past six books.Edger was there, and so was Kiz, but where were everyone else. I almost wonder if this was written as a stand alone book, but then became a Harry Bosch post production...I know that in serial novels, some characters have to move on, but there was room for more of my old favorites from Connelly and I was disappointed that I didn't see any of them.One quick side note - I think it was a nice touch to mention Sept. 11 - it brought the book some sense of reality and since 9/11 is still so much a part of my everyday life, I thought it was nice that Connelly referenced it."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This is about a 20+ yr. old killing of a much abused twelve yr. old boy.

Bosch has seen everything during his long career with the LAPD but he is still capable of feeling a sense of outrage about the murders he investigates for the city. And what he learns about the short life of this young murder victim will hit him particularly hard.It soon becomes obvious that the boy lived not just a short life, but a very painful one. There is evidence of numerous breaks in the bones recovered by the police and some of the fractures appear to have been suffered when the boy was only two years old. Bosch knows there is a killer out there who believes that he will never be caught - and that the killer is likely to be one of the boy's parents. What he does not know is the boy's name or who his parents are.There can be no doubt that Michael Connelly is a master of the police procedural and much of \\"City of Bones\\" is textbook police procedural. The reader is intimately exposed to the time-consuming and tedious process that is a police investigation, including the dozens of false leads that have to be worked before the real ones can be followed. Detective Bosh and his partner, Jerry Edgar, are determined that, against all odds, they will bring this boy's killer to justice and, as one piece of the puzzle after another slowly begins to fall into place, they seem to be getting there. But at what cost to the boy's family and to the detectives, themselves?\\"City of Bones\\" is a superb procedural but what saves it from the possibility of becoming tedious are side-plots involving two women well known Harry Bosch. One is the egotistical coroner he is forced to work with, a woman so determined to become a national celebrity that she has her own documentary cameraman follow her around from case to case. The other is an overage police rookie who manages to attach herself to both Bosch and the case he is working. Between these complications, the internal politics of the LAPD and the 20-year-old murder case, Bosch has plenty on his plate.What longtime Harry Bosch fans will remember most about \\"City of Bones,\\" however, is likely to be the revelation Harry makes at the very end of the story.Reader, beware: Don't go there first.Rated at: 3.5"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"In \\"City of Bones\\" (2002) Michael Connelly is at it again, giving his readers clever plotting, believable characters, fascinating details, a breakneck pace, and haunted homicide detective Harry Bosch, on his usual mission of speaking for the dead and bringing evildoers to justice. Some of the characters would be well advised to get out of his way because in his wake come trouble and sometimes even death.You wouldn't want to be Harry's detective partner, because self-absorbed, vain Harry often keeps his partners in the dark and goes barging off on his own.In this one a dog finds a human bone in the woods. It turns out to be from the body of a decades-old murdered twelve-year-old boy whose skeletal remains indicate years of severe physical abuse. Bosch has to I.D. the child, the abuser, and a killer who has fractured the boy's skull. He hooks up with a rookie cop (a boot) Julia Brasher (Isn't that a trait name in this story?), and they have a brief affair. Harry has never been lucky in love.Harry investigates a man with a past who lives near the body find, the boy's father, mother, sister, and a childhood buddy. A skateboard becomes a crucial piece of evidence. As usual along the way Harry ruffles the feathers of superiors especially arch-enemy Deputy Chief Irving.Just as you wouldn't want to be Harry's partner, you wouldn't want to be his gal either for reasons you'll discover as you read the book.Readers learn a lot of cop vocabulary: \\"crossing the tube\\" means walking in front of a gun barrel, \\"pull the pin\\" means retiring, \\"going Code 7\\" means leaving the force, and cops are \\"the blue religion.\\"L.A. is Harry's turf, a city of bones and ghosts too.

Harry Bosch gets the call and finds himself on a search for justice for an abused little boy who disappeared some twenty years before.

I have read several books by Michael Connelly, and while this is not his best work, it was worth the read. I read the book quickly over a two day period and was able to get immersed in the characters. The book moved quickly from the discovery of the bones of an abused eleven year old to the conclusion with enough other activities to hold interest.The author understands the politics of police work and how desire for feeding the 24 hour media machine can affect the progress on an old case file. This leads to interesting events and losses that should have been able to be prevented if the media had not demanded as much from the department. It all works in a wrap it all up by the end kind of way that we are programmed to expect from our television shows."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"One quick look through some of these reviews and I was very surprised with how many people seemed to give away major plot twists and plot points without realizing that this type of thing will ruin the book for anyone who'se considering reading it. I won't do that, except to say that this story is a very well-thought out mystery in the long-running Harry Bosch series, one that involves the constant struggle with the media that police in this country obviously face and how this can lead to corruption. The setup and mystery is definitely not one of the better or more complex ones in the series but it's easily one of the fastest-paced. Centered in here is a love story, which has been a rarity in this series.It's a breath of fresh air overall, and the plot takes its shocking turns. What stops this from reaching the 5-stars of Harry Bosch novels such as Lost Light are a number of factors...first of all, a very traumatic event happens in around the middle of the book and it's a stunning development...yet Harry Bosch seems to forget this over time. There was a very sad moment involving a note at the end of the story but aside from that, it sort of went the rest of the story without playing a central role, which was a little disappointing. The mystery itself, also, ended with surprising loose ends for a Connelly novel. I'm used to detailed explanations at the end of my Harry Bosch novels but this time it never occurs, leaving the villain's motives totally unexplained (aside from an assumption) and same went for a much-needed explanation of why a cop acted the way they did in the middle of the story....never happens.Still, though, this is a recommended Harry Bosch novel. Good stuff."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I enjoyed reading this book very much, from the very start to the very end. Once I began reading I could not put it down. This happens to me with all of Michael Connelly's books. I highly recommend them ALL."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This was a solid police/mystery novel. The death of the \\"main\\" female was depressing but a good twist nonetheless. This book made me want to rush out and buy more of his work."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"lf you could get him to talk, Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch would probably make a fine seatmate on a very long flight. But the odds are very much against getting Harry to talk.Harry is wound tight. A Los Angeles homicide detective, a tunnel rat in the Vietnam war, an orphan before that, Harry is very much self-contained. He has trouble getting close to people because he knows all the horrible things that can happen to people --- and that people do to other people.A dog brings back a bone from a romp in the woods. The dog's owner, a retired doctor, recognizes the bone as human. So begins the search for the murderer of a young boy a quarter-century earlier.Bosch is a hardworking cop. He is diligent, pushes hard and makes most of his own breaks. He is also one of those guys who just can't live by the police department's rules. Without this trait, of course, Connelly wouldn't have much to write about since the LAPD wants this investigation to go away.Connelly is a master at bringing the clues in one by one, some of them insignificant at first, but looming large later.Here, one of those little things comes to mean everything and Connelly handles it beautifully, if not indeed brilliantly. Connelly's Harry Bosch is one heck of a detective.It's difficult to tell, at least for me, whether Connelly's characters have any depth. He moves them along at a rapid pace, though Bosch is mildly introspective. But it really doesn't matter: Connelly is a marvelous storyteller and that's what is important.Jerry"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"A thriller, one more some would say. For sure, but what is the interest of this one ? It reveals LA and Hollywood under an X-raying light. All those small details we see everyday and that have no meaningful depth on the instant, become significant in this particular homicide case. The bones of the victim and their suffering. A backpack with nearly nothing in it. A skateboard that is yet another skateboard and yet it is encrypted with meaningful details that start shining like morning stars with the investigation. A father who is thought to be abusing his son and it is all wrong, a preconceived idea. A sister who is supposed to be crystal clean since she tipped the police about the case and turns out to be another victim. A reformed childmolester who is forced into suicide by the media unprofessionally tipped by a police leak. And a gruesome end that smells like frontier justice and vengeance against a criminal who really had no chance and luck in life, even if the book does not ponder enough on the fatality that befalls some individuals in our society. There cannot be any such thing as a born criminal. But there sure are some circumstances that can become particularly oppressive and lead to the worst situations imaginable.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This book was one of the best i have ever read. After reading this story I have decided that Michael Conelly is my favorite author. His style of writing in this book kept me on my toes throughout the whole thing. With every twist and turn that took place in the story i thought i had the answer to the mystery. I couldn't have been more wrong. Conelly makes all the characters look like they maybe could have had something to do with the crime, but then right at the end of the story he tells you who the true perpatrator is. I would definately recomend this book to some one who is in search of an awesome murder mystery."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This is the eigth in the Harry Bosch series, and it was great. Once again assigned to a case that touches Harry's damaged soul, he works his way through this mystery all the while dealing with soul-searching questions about himself. I will not give too much a way about the plot, but this has quite a few twists and turns. Just when you feel that Harry will finally be happy, that idea is abruptly snatched away from you. And the final twist at the end left me gasping (partially from dismay).An excellent read, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I've been reading the Bosch series from book #1 &amp; on. Not one has disappointed me, including City of Bones.In City of Bones Bosch is working on a case where human remains have been found after buried for nearly 20 years. This book is very fast paced and step by step through his detective processes, you find yourself not being able to put the book down. Trying to figure out, who did it and why. Another great aspect of this book is that some of the background players in the series, like his partner Edgar, are given time, the relationships developed more. Which is very satisfying for those who have been reading the series for years.Overall, I loved the story and the twists and turns in the plot kept me guessing until the end. As always, I wasn't able to guess the ending. My only complaint is that I think the resolution of who murdered this person wasn't as good as it could have been. I don't want to give anything away, so you'll just have to read it! Do check out this book- but if you've never read the series before, I would recommend starting with the first book (The Black Echo) and working you way through, it's not necessary, but I think it's very worth it- as I said, they're all excellent reads!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"In this book both stories are unsolved, Why did Julia kill herself? Harry is really sure who was the killer of the kid?As many books of MC you will see that not all the police are good men, many of them just want to do things to get higher in the department no matter if in the way some one gets killed. Some times some police men wanted to work with out his partners, I think that that is not a working team no matter the reason, if you have a partner you must work with him.This book is definitely a page turner, even if the case is really unsolved it has his high thrilling points and his down crying points, with this book you will laugh a little and cry a little too. The investigations has so many turns, ups and downs that you would never put the book down, but as all the MC books, you can skip the last two chapters."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This is the first book I've read in this series and will be my last. It was very interesting until the end. There were a lot of storyline off-shoots that just weren't followed through on. I read the end feeling I must have missed something. A lot of questions were left unanswered, at least in my mind. There were interesting twists in the story but they fizzled out in the end."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I've read every book Connelly has written and I hate to say it, but I think he is getting VERY lazy. This book is a quick easy read, but completely unengaging. I can't believe it is getting such good reviews here. The plot \\"twists\\" are easy to see and not surpising. The list of suspects are completely non-threatening and don't get me started on the [less than satisfying] ending. If you want a lot better novel in the same vein, pick up Dennis Lehane (except for mystic river) or even Robert Crais (LA Requim is a masterpiece)."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Connelly is one of my favourite story-tellers and I always look forward to reading his latest. This was no exception. City of Bones is a superb book, one of the few that I get so absorbed in that I lose track of everything else that's going on.In Harry Bosch, Connelly has created a detective who will become a modern classic, a tortured, all-too-human man who is also a gun gumshoe. Connelly's two biggest strengths are his dialogue--he is the Joss Wheedon of novelists--and his prose: concise, hard-boiled, gritty, observant, detail-oriented and Raymond Chandleresque. When you add in that he is a pretty mean plotter, too, it's easy to see why his books are so great.City of Bones opens in a fairly unremarkable way, and everything seems to unfold in a logical and believeable manner. It's only when you look back at the end of the book that you realise just how ingenious and incredibly well-told the tale is, how the events just fit together and take on a life of their own. It is proof that you don't have to invent the fantastic to tell a good story--properly approached, even the most banal &quot;real life&quot; can contain some amazing ideas.This book was a sheer joy to read and, as always, I look forward to the next. I won't spoil it, just grab it and read. If you haven't read any of his others, I highly recommend reading them in order and saving this for last, like a great dessert at the end of a sumptuous meal."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"As one who'd been waiting for the next Connelly novel with great enthusiasm, I *have* to share my disappointment. I wish I'd never read this book... it soured the taste of the whole Bosch series for me.In short, this reads like the procedural history of an authentic police case, but it's just not a case that's \\"bookworthy.\\" No cliffhanger moments, no truly suspensful life & death struggles... there is just nothing compelling about this dusty old case, no credible justification given for the investigation's urgency or for the media frenzy, and no real sympathy created for the victim.BTW, \\"The Last Coyote\\" did a *much* better job of bringing an old case to life and making the pursuit of its solution truly exciting than did \\"City of Bones.\\"Connelly's a great author, so the book is not rife with cliches... that and the fact that at least *one* character (Bosch) was well developed made it worth two stars instead of one."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"In this book, an older, more grounded Bosch investigates a 25 year old murder of a 12 year old boy. The boy's bones, found buried in the hillside of a Los Angeles canyon, tell a heartbreaking story. Through the investigation, Bosch not only uncovers a complex chain of cause and effect that had devastating consequences for the boy -- but also becomes a catalyst for an uncomprehensible chain of events in the present day.This is Connelly's best, most serious work. He again explores the themes at the center of his earlier works -- the ambiguous nature of good and evil; the shifting sands of cause and effect; and the fervent but often futile search for redemption. But where his earlier books sometimes relied on lurid details and unconvincing plot lines to telegraph these ideas, here these themes are fully realized in a layered and nuanced book that moves every bit as quickly as his earlier works.Any review of a Connelly book would be incomplete without reference to the starring role given to the setting -- The City of Angels, as it is always referred to by Connelly. Here, Connelly's treatment of the L.A. landscape and culture rings especially true -- from the influence of the entertainment industry, to the supposed escape that the desert and mountains provide, to the skateboard culture of the early 1980s. Connelly's debt to Ross McDonald is especially clear in this book -- and, for the first time, he lives up to McDonald's genius."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Detective Harry Bosch is no stranger to Michael Connelly fans. In this seventh book of the series, Connelly doesn't disappoint.A new case uncovers buried bones from 20 years ago. And Bosch can't shake the story the bones of the 12-year-old boy are trying to tell.The bones reveal heavy abuse. A brutal death. An abbreviated life that may have been better off dead after all.While the mystery behind the bones starts to unravel, new obstacles begin to block the case's progression. In the middle of it all, Bosch finds himself falling for a rookie cop.As Bosch and his partner try to solve the case, what seems to be a routine procedure goes terribly wrong. Bosch's career is in trouble, his personal life is in turmoil and he's rocketing toward a decision that will affect the rest of his life.Whether you're a hard-core Harry Bosch fan or just starting to read about this detective's all-too-human daily life, \\"City of Bones\\" is an excellent chronicle with a compelling plot and well-developed characters."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"A very good crime fiction book. Connelly fans should buy this book without any hesitation if you don't have it already. Why it's good?1) Connelly is very good at creating 3 dimensional, believable, realistic characters and this book is no different.2) A very realistic behind the scene look in the inner workings of a police department, he's supposed to have been a crime beat writer.3) Logical plot. His books are not as fast flowing or edge of the seat exciting or scary as some thrillers, but they can't be if they are crime fiction. Rather, he takes you through the investigation step by step, going through the process that his detectives go through so you can see how they solve the crime.Cons: The only con I have is that the books are somewhat noir (I'm plagarizing this word from some other review). The thing is, Bosch is not your spiffy \\"yes sir\\", toe the blue line cop. And so, even though you want Bosch not to stir the pot and just get on with his detecting he does his best to sabotage his position in the force and your wishes, well, c'est la vie, apparently Connelly likes to put angst in his readers' lives.I'm not going to spoil the book, if you must know what the book is about you can read the intro. All I'm trying to get across is why this book is good. A must buy."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"In this eighth entry in the detective Harry Bosch series, author Michael Connelly, whose bibliography now stands at some dozen novels, brings back a fan favorite character in a story so focused on solving the crime that the book is pretty close to a classic police procedural. Shades of the fairly new forensic pathologist stories by Dr. Kathy Reichs, a dog discovers a bone and trots it home to his master, who happens to be an MD. The doc pretty quickly recognizes a human arm bone when he sees it, though this one looks like it's old and was probably a child's. Enter the police who find the scene and discover enough additional bones that a long buried corpse seems to be the discovery of the day. In due course, Harry and his partner Jerry Edgar, proceed to identify the victim, dead some 20 years or so; locate family members and friends; and eventually solve the crime with solid and intuitive police work.Connelly has an evocative writing style that helps us almost \\"see\\" the scenes we're reading about. His prose is economic, and therefore a lot happens in this 400-page tome that might have taken many more pages to convey. But maybe best of all, some other matters vie with the basic storyline for our attention. First, the author takes some well-deserved shots at the media and at police higher management for their handling of certain events, some with dire outcomes. Second, the motivation of the cops is on view in two cases while apprehending suspects, and we come away sometimes questioning whether everything is on the up and up. These themes, and a brief affair between veteran Bosch and a young rookie, added a great deal of thoughtfulness to a story that while entertaining, is pretty somber throughout. Even Bosch is questioning his career future at the end, making us wonder where the author takes him from here.We wish we had met Connelly in an earlier Bosch work, as this one had a climactic feel to it for which we wish we had better background. Bosch is a likable but complex worker, who sets out on his own when necessary to explore every angle; indeed he is difficult to satisfy. We think that fans and new readers alike will enjoy this tale and this series, and we for sure mean to uncover some of the earlier entries. So might you!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Once again Michael Connelly has penned a narrative that draws you into its midst and holds you captive to its conclusion. Connelly takes you through the discovery of old bones and uses action and dialogue to carry you step by step through the case to the discovery of the murderer. Another blockbuster from this talented writer.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"While there was a lot to like about this book, the real disappointment was what might have been. It would have been so much more interesting for Harry to have to deal with the lunatic Julia was turning out to be. And the ending(s) seemed slapped on rather than thought out. If you haven't read a Harry Bosch book before, read the early ones. If you've read them all - wait for the next one."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"It didn't take all that long for Michael Connelly to become one of today's top mystery authors. And it's not hard to see why. His books are always suspenseful, filled with great dialogue and believable characters. His stories are intriguing and always intricate. And, most of the time, his plots are unpredictable.Although City Of Bones isn't Connelly's best, it still shows how amazing the author truly is. Here, we find Bosch, one of the characters Connelly established in his earlier works. He is now working as a detective in Hollywood. On New Year's eve, he is told to investigate bones that have been uncovered by a dog. On closer examination, the bones are shown to be human and belonging to a twelve year old boy who would have died over twenty years ago.The quest to find the boy's identity and his killer follows. And what a chase it is! The story is full of subplots that will keep you guessing until the very last page.I love Connelly's style. His books are gritty and straight to the point. He is the noir author par excellence. As Bosch investigates the crime and uncovers many of the answers that have been laying dormant for over twenty years, he will meet many great characters, such as a young female officer in whom he will find romance, or the victim's sister and father, who's past is filled with dark secrets that are just waiting to resurface. All of Connelly's characters have ghosts in their closets, which only adds to the dark tones of his stories.All in all, City Of Bones is yet another great work of fiction by today's best mysetery author. When you start one of Connelly's books, you won't want to let go of it until the it's done. City of Bones is no exception."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Detective Harry Bosch's New Year starts off with a whisper from the past when a hapless dog uncovers the long-buried skeletal remains of an abused young boy. Harry's tortured childhood memories compel him to use all his skills to find the child's killer, but he can only do so by following a trail as cold as this murderer's heart. Amid a myriad of distractions including Harry's steamy romance with a rookie cop, a dangerously nosy press and the ever-problematic internal politics of the LAPD, the veteran detective plugs holes, probes, pushes and postulates his way toward the truth -- a truth that proves no less shocking than the crime itself.Michael Connelly dishes up this complex tale in his usual expert fashion, this time treating his readers to super-sized, gut-wrenching helpings of heart. The question remains, can Harry keep up this pace?One whiz bang of a mystery."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"The blurb on the jacket was what caused me to purchase this book. I was ready for a gritty and dark ride into the case of a murdered young boy from over 20 years ago, his bones found on a deserted hillside by a neighbor's dog.'City of Bones' is Los Angeles. Nicknamed 'Bones' due to the tarpits that regularly churn up bones from thousands years past. This time though, the bones they find are merely 20 years past and found on a lonely hillside. Detective Bosch has been in the force for over 25 years and this is a first.Who is the boy in the old grave? His bones indicate massive trauma and old wounds healed. But who were they looking for? A serial killer that's still prowling the streets after all this time? Or something much more dark and sinister...What Bosch and his partner Edgar find brings them on a wild ride into the depths of human suffering and shame. Who would kill the ten year old? And why? Why does his bones speak a very terrible and dark past that both Bosch and Edgar feel ill just thinking about? The more they find the more they dread the final leg of the gruesome journey.We follow the main detective Bosch throughout the book and watch as he struggles with his personal feelings in this painful case and how he develops a relationship with a rookie patrol cop named Julia Brasher half his age.The writing is very good and Bosch's personal life will distract you enough to forget facts so you will be surprised when things pop up throughout the book, but the ending was a big disappointment for me.The tension builds and builds effectively and then I felt let-down at the end. I was left asking out loud, \\"So...why did he pick this as the climax?\\" I guess I was expecting something more spectacular and frightening to make me widen my eyes and say, \\"Whoa!\\", but alas, I simply frowned and said, \\"Why did he do that?\\"If you're looking for something realistic with a real-life ending to a murder, look no farther, but if you're like me and when you open a book you want to be swept away and brought on a rollarcoaster ride and to have the murderer or murderers be something really frightening and 'out there', then skip this one. It's probably something you'd see on the 11 o'clock news....Tracy Talley~@"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"It's just been a few hours since I closed this book and I find myself missing Harry already! This installment in the life of Harry Bosch took me completely by surprise--I picked it up a few days ago, sure I was going to be able to stretch the reading out. And that thought lasted until this morning when I picked this book up and became totally immersed in Connelly's City of Bones. I felt like I was THERE. Real life attempted to intrude a few times, but the look on my face and the sharpness in my voice convinced those who would dare interrupt, that I belonged in Hollywood with Harry....for the time being anyway! The story itself held me spellbound--a battered child's bones found after 20 years--but it's Harry that keeps me there! This is a hero I can relate to--one with flaws and passion and integrity. One who makes mistakes and regrets it. A hero that sticks up for the victim and for himself when it's necessary.Not many authors can pull me INTO their stories but Connelly does possess this gift and I am ever so thankful for it!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Michael Connelly sure knows how to keep the reader \\"reading\\" and guessing and thinking and actually investigating with Harry. City of Bones is a story unfolding in a limited time frame so the sense of urgency is there at the outset. The characters are a varied bunch from the 12 year old victim's odd family to the cops on the beat to the residents of Woodland Drive where the City of Bones is located to the cop partners and their superiors. It is an interesting plot and how a 20 year old murder can be traced through DNA and research techniques. But it still comes down to those who do the grunt work and sometimes pay with their lives. There is a lot of interviewing; a lot of not \\"playing by the rules\\" (when did Harry ever do that); a lot of chasing every tiny lead. And in the end it all came around full circle. Harry's emotions and relationships are out in the open in this story which I suppose led to the very emotional ending for me. This was a typical Connelly book - he never misses! I just hope Mr. Connelly that \\"It Ain't So\\" what you leave the readers with to mull over."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Hieronymous (Harry) Borsch is back with a case that looks impossible.

However, I really did enjoy the reading of this book in its entirety. The one thing that I would like to point out here is that M. Connelly appears to be extremely talented in grafting out all of the facets in a story. The dialogue was intense enough so that you desired to be a part of the conversation, yet never was it too much. The same with detail. When the author described a particular setting, he was quick to give you what you needed to know. In other words, he did not ramble on for two pages about the appearance of one's house or computer (i.e. D. Koontz). And lastly, what goes on within the police force was brought together precisley so that even the simple reader can easily follow. This book is a definate reccomendation to all those that are tired of the same ol' myster writers that care more about culteralistic dialogue and more murders scenes than logical reasoning and reality."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"A woman's bones were found in the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles in 1914. It was determined that they were nine thousand years old, and anthropologists concluded that she was murdered.I heard that it was this event, and an anthropological book about child abuse, that inspired Michael Connelly's latest murder mystery, City of Bones.LAPD detective Harry Bosch is left with only the bones found in the Hollywood Hills to solve the \\"cold,\\" 20-year-old case that will soon be closed regardless of if the killer is put to justice. It isn't until the bones are studied that he finds a personal connection that, according to Connelly, \\"...taps into Harry's sense of rage.\\" Until then though, the murder seems like any other case, and the story seems like any other mystery.Bosch struggles throughout the novel with his need and capability to find justice and make a difference in an evil world. Julia Brasher, a thirtyish rookie, helps Bosch with logical and true encouragements such as \\"...there will always be the need for heroes,\\" but these views prove detrimental to Brasher and in turn to Bosch.With many suspects and no hard evidence, Bosch is forced to go with his gut feeling numerous times, leading the case into many exciting and suspenseful twists and turns. But, nothing can compare to the shocking ending, leaving long time Bosch followers to wonder if this is the end, or a new beginning.*I also realize that the next book is out, but i'm a little behind!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This latest Bosch book is good, but not quite there, when compared to earlier ones. Some of the conversations/dialogs seems to be unnatural. That is, unnatural for Bosch to utter. There is a slight hint that this book was written to be turned into a screenplay. All the essentials are there, action, ...love (with the rookie) etc. Earlier Bosch seem to be more convincing."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This book is one of Connelly's best and is more along the lines of Concrete Blonde, The Last Coyote, etc. The characters are well developed and the storyline is intelligent and fast-paced. I liked this book better than Void Moon, Black Ice or any of his science fiction genre efforts for those reasons. If you already like Connelly's stuff, you will really enjoy this one. If you're looking at him for the first time, it's similar to the &quot;Prey&quot; series by John Sandford. Connelly keeps you in suspense as to the identity of the villain until the end, whereas Sandford shares the chase from the villain's perspective and you know who did it all along."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Never read Connelly before so I wasn't sure what to expect, although I am a big fan of his buddy George Pelecanos. This eighth book in the LA-set Harry Bosch series centers on the discovery of an old child's skeleton. It reads kind of like a good TV movie (although much darker than anything on TV), taking the reader through the forensics that eventually lead to the child's identification, and the long plodding investigation to uncover the truth. As a procedural it's quite well done, with plenty of detail and nuance throughout. Particularly well-handled are the numerous interviews Bosch conducts with witnesses and suspects throughout the book. Quite a bit of internal police politics come into play as well, giving the book a certain \\"insider\\" element. Certain elements are a bit clich&eacute;, from Harry's drive/obsession with the case, to the pressure from his superiors, and even a love interest. However, the book manages to stay away from being run-of-the-mill by showing the police making plenty of mistakes, and portraying all kinds of shades of gray in behavior. On the whole, it's a solid read, but not one that'll have me scurrying to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"A dog, rummaging in the woods, returns with the arm bone of a child. So begins the case for Harry Bosch which will lead him to the identity of the child and the story of a brutal and too short life told by his bones. The cast of characters includes his sister, father, mother and good friend who reveal different parts of his troubled life. Along the way Harry encounters a rookie cop who ignites a long dead passion. The story plunges along at breakneck speed and turns from a routine investigation to one filled with tragedy as a loose lipped cop and the press misidentify the killer.A very good read typical of all Connelly books. Harry Bosch again comes through as a tough, sympathetic but somewhat flawed protagonist. Harry's transfer at the end of the story to his old stomping grounds in Hollywood and the threat by the Chief to stay on his tail presages the packing up of his office and returning his badge and gun. What now for Harry Bosch?"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Connelly offers Bosch this time in a rather unusual dark, brooding story that indicates Harry might be on the way out? It's hard to tell, although as Harry thinks about things, maybe it is time? I certainly hope not, as Harry continues to develop into a quite complex character: a man who has many, many good points, but continues to develop his darker side, and pulls a couple of things in this one, too.A dog digs up a bone, that turns out to be the humerus of a young boy, who has been missing and dead for twenty years. In spite of myself, I did enjoy the pun when Harry's talking to the command desk sergeant: \\"Harry, come on..humor us on this humerus.\\" Connelly's wit is sharp, if derivative!Harry and Edgar (who continue to exhibit a rather unusual friendship; Edgar seems jealous of Harry and hurt when excluded)become involved in the case. Harry falls head over heels for a new rookie, Julia Brasher, who shares some of Harry's darker side. Of course, Harry is not supposed to be shacking up with a rookie, but you knnow, Harry----nothing stops Harry from what he's doing, whether it be right or wrong.As the case builds, a former pedophile is involved; a seedy friend from the little boy's past, and of course, the father and the sister. It's a web of intrigue, deceit and false leads, and Connelly masterfully weaves them to the predictable, if strange, denouement. \\"City of Bones\\" is not the best, but it is a marvelous addition to the series. Michael, please don't leave us hanging in the air!!RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"City Of Bones represents another riveting, hard-edged, unforgettable thriller in the continuing series featuring Harry Bosch. In typical Connelly fashion, he's created an intelligent, attention-grabbing plot -- this one involving the finding of evidence of a murder committed over twenty years earlier. Also, as fans of Connelly have come to expect, City Of Bones is filled with well-developed characters, \\"real world\\" dialogue, and lots of surprises. While it can be argued if this is the best in the series or not, it is unquestionably well-worth reading and very enjoyable. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series to see what the future holds for Harry Bosch. Get a copy of City Of Bones and prepare yourself for a highly entertaining mystery."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I love Harry and although this case wasn't as supercharged as some of his others, I thought the book was good. I felt like the Brasher part was left somewhat up in the air and I couldn't really grasp what the significance of her character was supposed to be. But overall, I enjoyed the book and can't wait until the next one...because Harry never quits!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"With all of the years of knowing Harry Bosch and being a native of Hollywood (so very rare these days), I found this book to be very sentimental. Traveling with Harry from Mulholland, through Nichols' Canyon and over to Tuxedo Terrace, Connelly brings all of the flora (good and bad) of the area to his stories. The &quot;Last Coyote&quot; and the &quot;Poet&quot; were good, but this episode with Harry Bosch truly put things in perspective. Thank you, Mr. Connelly, for a wonderful read. And, goodnight, Harry."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"The story was tragic and all over the place. I had some problems following it. But then I hate it when a good looking chick dies, especially so early in the book. Over all it's a good read though."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I'm in the process of filling all the holes now. I've read over half of the Harry Bosch series and am now catching those I've missed in-between. Since I haven't read them in order, there is a lot of history I either know about already or am learning after-the-fact. Knowing that ahead of time, I didn't let it bother me. I still found this story a fascinating read.The plot details have already been hashed out over the 200+ reviews already done, so no need to do it again. The author's ability to nail the police procedural and all the while weave in Harry's personal foibles is part of the fun. He kept it in solid third-person with no head-hopping which made for a very easy read. The exposition never felt forced or in a lecturing way. What was said needed to be there.I'll admit to not being entirely happy with the ending. I didn't get a great warm fuzzy off the final confrontation with the guilty party. After that, there was a decision Harry made that left me scratching my head. I sort-of understood it, but still wasn't quite sure what was going on. I supposed it will be explained in Lost Light, the next novel except I'll never read it because to my great disappointment, Mr. Connelly wrote it in first-person. I hate that point-of-view!Despite the minor quibbles, it kept me glued to my seat for two days and kept me from doing anything else useful which says something about the story and the writing. There were plenty of twists and turns along the way to keep things interested and the love interest for this installment certainly didn't turn out like I expected. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Even though one of his older books, still very good.

These books are always a page-turner to the end."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Michael Connelly's books are always amazing. As I recall Connelly at one time in his life was a detective, so that is probably why he is so knowlegable about solving crimes. Also, he is so human about believing in some people that are not honest with him."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Michael Connelly comes through yet again. Never a boring read. He needs to crank them out faster, because I always have to wait on the next one...sniffle, sniffle."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Kept me turning the page and wanting to see if I outguessed the author.

You won't be disappointed.5 stars!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I have actually read this book before, and was reading it again so that I could compare the differences between the Harry Bosch of this book and the Harry Bosch of the Black Box. This is a much more complex plot, with the murder case being the vehicle that brings all of the intrigue and politics of the LAPD together."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Typical Harry Bosch novel. Fast pace and easy to read. good old fashion murder mystery. I will probably read all Michael Connelly books."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I am pleased to report that Connelly has done it again, he has hit the mark with another \\"Harry\\" murder mystery...I'm also pleased to report the discovery of Connelly's twin ( perhaps better twin ), one L.

The story was good, and Harry is at his usual best, but I think I was a bit disappointed with how it ended and the resolution of the crime. Still, I think if you're a fan of this author and Harry, you will enjoy."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I have loved Connelly since reading the Poet.This book was lacking the pace and the depth of other mc books.To show you that I am a true mc groupy, I check his web site on and off to see what is going on with future books and to read the conversation board with mc and his fans.Frankly I think all that praise has gone to his head, affecting his aproach to Bosch.The Poet and Void Moon had a freedom lacking in half of the Bosch books. Clearly there is an alter ego aspect to mc and his most written about character. In CoB's some of the Harry versus Self and versus Past and versus Establishment is under-described and the plot is under-worked. At this point most of the readers of mc's books know all about Bosch amd maybe mc did not want to weave details into this book. I miss the cop from Angel's Flight and the Concrete Blond and the Last Coyote.Void Moom made me so tense that I nearly jumped out the window while I was reading it (as fast as I could). Reading CoB's I kept falling asleep. I wanted to care about who killed that little boy but in order to do that I need some dramatic tension and could not find it. I guess maybe the style of the book reflected the feelings of a tired cop.I want the next book to have a complicated plot with a challenged protagonist, whom ever the book is about."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"the solution to the murder was weakly done.It neede n more punch like COYOTE.Harry Bosch will go home get blitzed on amber steam and realize he really cant leave the LAPD.

A dog out for a walk with its master unearths the bones which are immediately recognised as human. Bosch is soon at the scene to begin what would seem to be an impossible investigation. Providing the feminine interest is good looking Julia Brasher, a rookie policewoman in her late thirties, who has left a career in law and a globe trotting life of travelling in order to really \\"make a difference\\" as a law enforcer.The theme of investigating a 30-year homicide is in a way relaxing for the reader as there is no apparent threat of nasty scares from scum with blood on their hands lurking behind every corner. However, the literal and figurative unearthing of old bones does directly result in the three further tragic deaths as the investigation takes its course.City of Bones is a very entertaining thriller that regular Connelly readers and new ones alike should all enjoy."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I've been following Michael Connelly since Black Echo and I'm pretty impressed with his detailed plots, fleshed-out characters and crisp writing. However, he seems to be losing his touch with City of Bones. The story started out well but faltered 2/3 of the way. You'll know who is the killer when he is introduced, so there's no surprise at the end. Harry Bosch, despite all the back cover blurbs saying it would change him forever, is still the same, the ending notwithstanding. Maybe we're getting numbed by the current CSI, The Shield, Boomtown, Law &amp; Order assault, but then again, that's just me."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I really tried to like this. I wanted to. I gave the book several hundred pages to hook me but it left me feeling flat. As others have said the book has plenty of flaws, leaves lots of loose ends and doesn't accomplish what you think it will. The end falls flat. I'm not giving up on Connelly. Connelly is surely a good writer, this just isn't his best stuff."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"In my opinion, this is the very best Bosch novel to date. The plot is as tight as the sheet on a new recruit's bed and full of twists and turns that kept me guessing until the end. Bosch is maturing as a cop and as a human being (and I'm glad his superiors agree with me) in this haunting tale of his search for the killer of a young, abused boy. I highly recommend this awesome author. Keep up the good work....I can't wait for the next one!!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I have enjoyed all of Michael Connelly's books but his two most recent have been let downs. They lack the gritty excitment and kinky twists that made the Concrete Blonde or Blood Work so exciting. Is he running out of original ideas for his work? It certainly seems so as these don't compare to his first works."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"City of Bones has been put together like a skeleton - only there seems to be a few bones missing. Michael Connelly's eighth Harry Bosch title is disjointed and disappointing - a letdown from his usual brilliance evidenced in A Darkness More Than Night, Void Moon, Angels Flight, Blood Work, and The Poet. The plot sees LAPD veteran Bosch investigating the discovery of a child's skeleton, buried for 20 years. However a storyline that starts with so much promise also become buried. The characters are flimsy and the investigation, a facile victory.It seems even the usual brilliant Connelly became bored and rather than deliver his usual twists and turns, sent this story down a deadend street."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"A sad, bittersweet book. Harry finds a woman who lifts him...yet things don't work out quite as we'd hope. A young boy is abused throughout his childhood only to end up buried....bones on a hill. How Harry deals with the ending of the case will surprise you, I think. A great investigation, as always."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Harry Bosch is the greatest character an author has ever invented. The way these stories are written either Michael Connelly was a LA detective or he has the best collabrators. Bosch is the best."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Michael Connelly's Detective Hieronymous \\"Harry\\" Bosch is back in the police procedural, City of Bones. Harry and partner Jerry Edgar are assigned the case of a missing child whose bones are found in the hills of Laurel Canyon. With the cases of child abuse and abduction today, this grisly and depressing storyline really punched me in the gut right from the start. I wanted this killer caught or worse more than Harry and Jerry did.As the case progresses, so does Harry's romantic involvement with Officer Julia Brasher. Because she's a fellow officer, she's supposed to be off-limits per LAPD regulations. Harry feels the heat on and off the case from his superiors to overly ambitious media personnel to his own desire wanting to solve this horrific crime.Connelly's always does a great job of depicting the inner workings of the LAPD chock-full of political correctness, rivals and friends, procedure and how the case works the psyche of Harry. In spite of all of this, as is the tone of a police procedure, the action is minimal and the solution to the crime didn't turn or twist as much as I thought it might. A key piece of interpreted evidence triggers the solution but it lacked that white-hot, \`I gotcha!' feeling.Police procedural mysteries are not thrillers or suspense stories and tend to reflect real life in a more subdued manner but after raising the hair on the back of my neck in the beginning just imagining what happened to this child, the ending to me didn't match that horrendous discovery to launch the case file.Then Harry at the conclusion left me scratching my head as much as the solution of closing the investigated and determined homicide. I wasn't quite fully satisfied with the resolution of neither the story nor a certain love interest in this one. But Michael's still the man and continues to be in demand."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I just started reading Michael Connely books and have enjoyed them all so far Can't seem to put them down.This book CITY OF BONES was the same ,I think I read it in one week.It held you'r attention till the end."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Some of these Bosch books are dark, but this one is the darkest one yet.

Great book!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"It was a dog that found the first bone in the Hollywood Hills, and brought it home. His owner, a retired doctor, identified it immediately as a human arm bone, probably from a ten or twelve year old child, and called the police. After finding about sixty percent of the remaining skeleton in a shallow grave, forensic experts figured the boy had died about twenty years ago from a blow to the back of the head. But it was his short life that tormented Los Angeles Homicide Detective, Harry Bosch. The bones showed that this kid had been horribly abused almost since he was born and had lived his life in constant agony and suffering. It was January 1, the first day of the new year, and Harry had caught a cold case, the kind of crime that gave him nightmares, and stayed with him forever. And as Harry digs deeper and deeper into the tragic events that led to this boy's death, and the bones on the hill, he sets off another unexpected chain reaction of misery and death that pushes him to his limits and a shocking conclusion..... Michael Connelly has written a dark, compelling, and unforgettable thriller, full of intriguing twists and turns, and intense riveting scenes. His writing is vivid, crisp, and intelligent, with a real ear for dialogue, and his intricate story line is tight and suspenseful. But it's Mr Connelly's brilliant characterizations that make City Of Bones and all his novels stand out. These are real people, full of complexities and nuances, sometimes heroic and well-meaning, often flawed and chasing their own internal demons, and Michael Connelly breathes life into even the most minor character. City Of Bones is the eighth book in a marvelous series that just gets better with each new installment. To understand the troubled and introspective Harry Bosch, start at the beginning with The Black Echo, and read them all. For those of you who are already fans, Michael Connelly's latest is a &quot;must read&quot; and shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"First I have to say I'm a fan of Michael Connelly's work. His writing to me is beyond words. It opens up so much inside. His stories reach far beyond most others in the genre. Because of his characters and the situation he creates with his extremely well written and masterly plotted storylines I am often forced to rethink my own opinion on things.City of Bones ranks as one of my favorites because the end is so beautiful and real. Sometimes life just takes it own turns and there's nothing you could have done about it."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"The right of the murdered to justice takes Harry Bosch up a mystical river of darkness. A tearful anthropologist describes a child's life of torture from the partially recovered skeleton of a young boy. Bosch never wavers in a determined quest for the killer.Sometimes justice is as costly as injustice, and the chance discovery of the boy's remains set of a chain reaction of the death and human destruction. Bosch survives on will and discipline, never accepting the easy wrong when there remains a hard right yet to be revealed.Michael Connelly is the living master of this genre. Bosch, moody and cynical, never falters. Connelly, literate and dark, exposes a kind of humanity that makes you want to join the anthropologist in tears.This is as good as it gets."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Detective Hieronymous \\"Harry\\" Bosch and his partner, Jerry Edgar, are given the almost impossible task of solving the murder of a young boy who suffered horrendous abuse before his death. The problem? The boy has been dead for twenty years.When a man out walking his dog comes across bones that look human, the police are called, and Harry is thrown into a strange and emotionally wrenching case that brings back his own troubled childhood. When the identity of the boy is discovered, the trail leads back to a suspect who subsequently kills himself. But was this really the murderer? Harry isn't so sure.Harry's relationship with an attractive rookie cop, Julia Brasher, adds conflict to his already troubled psyche. However, when the love affair turns disastrous, and the reasons for the an unexpected tragedy become clear, Harry Bosch finds the line between good and evil irreparably broken. His reaction will leave readers wondering about the future of the Harry Bosch series.Michael Connelly presents CITY OF BONES with simplicity - and unforgettable emotional power. In this eighth book in the series, the reader will identify with Harry - even if this is the first time you've met this agonized detective. Connelly is a masterful storyteller - throwing us headlong into his disturbing story and characters without making us feel manipulated in any way. It is a detective story with a heart - one that may have finally been broken.I highly recommend CITY OF BONES."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Michael Connelly is without doubt one of the best fiction writers today. His books invariably rank at the top for plot, characterization, prose, theme, and setting. But it is his ability to reach inside the reader and use his story to stretch your values, your assumptions, and your \\"comfort zone\\" that truly sets him apart. A great writer gives his readers a world so real that the reader becomes a part of that world while he is in the midst of the novel. An even greater writer works on the reader while he is in the novel's world. That's what happened to me in City of Bones. If you've never read Connelly before, you will still appreciate his main character, homicide detective Harry Bosch. If you know Harry, you will believe in him even more in this book. However, be prepared. You will be angered, disappointed, shocked,and frightened as Harry works over less than two weeks to solve a 30 year old murder of a horribly abused small boy, whose skeleton has just been unearthed. And throughout the masterfully told tale, you will discover how important absence can be -- whether it's of a young boy, a caring mother, a fulfilling romance, a reluctant police partner, a delcaration of innocence, or a hero without fault. In the end, absence is the character in City of Bones by which redemption comes -- to Harry and to the reader. Thank you, Michael Connelly."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"After ditching a Scott Turow book, reading only 100 boring pages...I fell into this book that I had purchased at a discount and turned page after page in lightening speed. Connelly simply has a good writing style that rarely bogs down. Like \\"The Narrrows\\" (the other Connelly book that I read) the ending didn't garner a 5 star rating from me, but a solid 4 stars for the reading entertainment."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Not the best Bosch, but certainly another solid noir entry. Kudos to my main man Connelly on that. Obviously the series did not after this and since I read the Narrows first, I know what happens to Bosch. Still, it was in line with his character to make such a rash decision. The mystery was geniunely surprising. The BRasher part seemed underdeveloped could have been much stronger. Still, Bosch is alone and ready to do more damage, which in this case is quite good."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Michael Connelly's \\"City of Bones\\" - his latest procedural about L.A. police detective Harry Bosch - is a book I would love torecommend. Connelly's descriptions of L.A. and police work are convincing, and like other books in this genre (police procedural, existential hero division), there's the serious voice that tries to imply that there's something going on underneath the story. There's even something of a love story and a climax that suggests major changes in Bosch's life.The story starts out with a bang, too, with the discovery of the bones of a long-dead child in a residential wooded lot. This attracts the cast of characters usually seen in the City of Angels: the publicity hungry coroner who brings along her camera crew, the police and press helicopters hanging overhead like sinister fireflies, the reporters using means fair and foul to gain access, the police department higher-ups putting pressure on Bosch to solve the case fast.Bosch, too, is a fine study of the angst-ridden detective with a past. He's not too overbearingly morose to inspire suggestions of Prozac and a long rest. He's good at what he does and dedicated to his work for a reason. As Bosch puts it, \\"It's the feeling that this won't just go by. That those bones came out of the ground for a reason. That they came out of the ground for me to find, and for me to do something about. And that's what holds me together and keeps me going.\\"The case proceeds with the usual twists and turns, as Bosch digs back into the boy's past and uncovers the people who would like to see the case and the body remain buried. Connelly's a former police reporter, and he uses his eye for detail to build a convincing portrait of big-city police work's alternative culture, and how the relatively simple task of detecting can be bent and sometimes sabotaged by the media, budgetary constraints and simple incompetence.Yet, \\"City of Bones\\" left me cold. While Connelly is good at recording the visible details, the invisible ones trip him up. This is especially troublesome when they involve major plot points - and readers who wish to read the book anyway should skip this and the next paragraph. One officer tries to make herself a hero by attempting to kill a chase suspect and wound herself, only it goes wrong and she dies. Her death is heartfelt and sad, but the reason Bosch ferrets out - \\"she said she hoped to get a chance to be a hero one day. But I think there was something else in all this. It was like she wanted the scar, the experience of it\\" - doesn't ring true. Ending his explanation with, \\"I don't know. I guess everybody's got secrets,\\" comes off as lame.Another spoiler: The book ends with a major change in Bosch's life for which the motivation is equally as confusing. The resolution of the murder results in Bosch resigning the department. Again, the reader asks, why? Was he affected by the officer's death? It didn't seem that way. Is he tired of the office politics? Given the evils that he's seen on the job, I can't imagine that would be the case. Yet, nothing makes sense.\\"City of Bones\\" is all effect and no cause. It's well-written, tightly paced and a quick read, but it's best not to think about it too long after you close the covers."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This book widely missed the mark for me. It just seemed like a book that was due and Connelly tried to phone this one in. The initial set up was fine with the human bones being discovered buried in a shallow grave. But Connelly obvious didn't know where to go or what to do. Some of Bosch's reasoning just didn't make sense to me. When he was laying out the reasoning about why he thought the confession was false made no sense and I HIGHLY doubt that the charge would have been dropped with that weak reasoning Bosch came up. And make no mistake it was weak. It was a good thing Irving wasn't in tha scene because no way would he let a confession slip through his hands. And that's another thing. Irving slow about face change from the early books to now is weird. Bosch has tried his patience and gave him better excuses to get rid of him than what was going on in this particular case. Don't believe me? Go re-read Concrete Blond, The Last Coyote, and Trunk Music. After what happened to Pounds--Irving could punch his ticket at anytime--so this whole thing is weird to me. Why is Eggar suddenly insulted about Bosch pushing him to the side. He has never been more than a gofer in all the other books anyway. And another Lady bites the dust. In what supposedly has taken place in two weeks, I stunned how fast Bosch pushes Brasher to the back of his mind. She is literally gotten for huge chucks from a man who was developing fast feelings. Injuries that come and go with no more thought. The broken ribs would be problematic for a while but doesn't bother Bosch any more than two days--after that, he's hiking up steep hills with a SID dummy with no trouble to his broken ribs. My point is nothing has any continuity"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Quick. Think back to an author that was excellent at scene and character development, but drove you crazy because he took so many words to get it done and get on to the action. Then there are those equally frustrating authors who give you tons of action but little or no scene and character development.Michael Connelly is neither of these. Connelly develops scenes and characters with a complete minimum of words, yet every word delivers the message.When you read City of Bones and visit the trailer of the father of the victim, you are there. When you visit the mother in her opulent home, you are there. When Harry Bosch (the main character) and his partner interview these people, you are there!The net result of all this is another fine Connelly book where the plot is engaging, and the ratio of action, words and scene and character development are superb.All that said, if this will be your first Connelly book I suggest you start with one of his earlier Bosch stories. City of Bones will be even better when you have had some earlier Bosch under your belt.I am in the process of reading all Connelly's books and City of Bones entices me to just keep on going...."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I've loved every Harry Bosch book. The character development has always been the strength of the Bosch books. This book is written as a police procedural rather than the taut thrillerss we are used to in this series. Unfortunately, it does not live up to the previous excellence of the Harry Bosch mysteries. A decent read, nonetheless."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Harry Bosch seems to have evolved from the depressed loner of the earlier books into a more driven and balanced cop. His driven nature is tipped off after the bones of an abused boy are found after being buried twenty years ago. Although it's an old case, he still lets nothing get in his way to try to solve the case, and even while working with such determination still reprimands himself for letting the case progress too slowly. He's balanced enough now to keep his anger in check and, while still not particularly respectful towards his superior officers, he's not so outwardly hostile.For a series that began as hardboiled as they come, it has mellowed dramatically over time. In fact, I would probably lean more towards classifying City of Bones as a police procedural. As usual, Harry is as persistent as a dog with a bone and is determined to find the boy's killer, no matter how long ago the crime was committed. At times though, in typical Harry Bosch style, he's so determined that he forgets he has a partner and reverts to his old lone-wolf ways.The ever-changing fortunes of Harry Bosch are given another twist here, which continues to make the series fresh and interesting.City of Bones documents a satisfying investigation that is always moving forward, which makes it a quick and compelling book to read. Like all of Connelly's previous books, I enjoyed it from cover to cover."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I'm such a big fan of Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series. I The thing that has always impressed me about this series versus other mystery series is Connelly's deftness with character development.

Such depth is rarely found in mystery fiction. &quot;City of Bones&quot; is different from the other Bosch books in that it was written like a police procedural rather than an endeavour into Harry's being &amp; psyche in solving unsolvable crimes.I must add that this book was the usual page-turner, but just not up to the usual standard."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Just when you think you have this novel figured out, Michael Connelly throws another curve ball so efficiently that you'll feel as if the wind has been knocked out of you! Add to that the wonderful central character who is delightfully unsure of his decisions, supporting characters who act and react so unlike one would expect, and you have the perfect mix for a suspenseful &quot;who-dunnit and why?&quot; Mr. Connelly has a way of pulling the reader into the story and making them want to know what happened to the little boy who ended up in a shallow grave so many years ago. What a great read, and the ending will surprise you... Kudos to Michael Connelly!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"A very good crime fiction book. Connelly fans should buy this book without any hesitation if you don't have it already. Why is it so good?1) Connelly is very good at creating 3 dimensional, believable, realistic characters and this book is no different.2) A very realistic behind the scene look in the inner workings of a police department, he's supposed to have been a crime beat writer.3) Logical plot. His books are not as fast flowing or edge of the seat exciting or scary as some thrillers, but they can't be if they are crime fiction. Rather, he takes you through the investigation step by step, going through the process that his detectives go through so you can see how they solve the crime.Cons: The thing is, Bosch is not your spiffy \\"yes sir\\", toe the blue line cop. And so, even though you want Bosch not to stir the pot and just get on with his detecting he does his best to sabotage his position in the force and your wishes, well, c'est la vie, apparently Connelly likes to put angst in his readers' lives.I'm not going to spoil the book, if you must know what the book is about you can read the intro. All I'm trying to get across is why this book is good. A must buy."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This is another excellent Michael Connelly/Harry Bosch detective tale. Having been intrigued by the title for some time, I finally picked it up last Friday. I finished it on Saturday.Starting with a report of a dog finding a human bone on New Year's Day, the story covers a period of about two weeks as it tries to solve a twenty year old crime. It has most of the elements that make Connelly a great writer and Bosch a great character--fast paced and well written action, multiple plot twists, appearances of old characters and former love interests, a new love interest and several viable perpetrators who come into and out of focus. It also revisits some of Harry's personal demons while probably creating a couple of more.I have now read five Connelly books, and I have enjoyed all of them. \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\" remains my favorite, but this one just moved into a close second place. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Well written police procedurals are fascinating. Those dealing with cold cases require an approach different from those involving currently active criminals, and perhaps that's one reason why some readers feel that City of Bones is off the mark. Michael Connelly is an accomplished writer who invents compelling characters. Harry Bosch is an accomplished detective who finds meaning in his life only through his work. He can relate to victims whether they died this year or 20 years past. His new love interest and concept that resonates with Harry. City of Bones is full of carefully timed surprises, but they emanate from its various subplots rather than the central mystery. The pace of the book seems weighed down by the heaviness of Bosch's depression, which in him appears low grade and chronic. Grief is not something he can express. He's so tightly wound that when his feelings do get loose there's a pretty sizable explosion. Like the one in the final chapter. All or nothing at all. That's our Harry."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"The title CITY OF BONES comes from an archaeological discovery of the bones of a person apparently murdered perhaps a thousand years ago in the area around Hollywood. This, of course, is a metaphor for the recently discovered bones of a child murdered ten years ago that sets detective Bosch on another case. I find this to be a rather tepid Bosch novel. The case itself was not particularly interesting nor where there any significant villians to the piece. It was kind of a \\"ho hum\\" and routine case to Bosch and the book seemed ho hum and undistinguished to me. Still a Connelly fan, I will approach the next Bosch book with hope for a better read as I like the tough-minded, independent spirit of the character Bosch. But it takes more than character to sustain the reader through 393 (hardback) pages."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I am a fan of Michael Connelly's mysteries and think his books are among the smartest popular fiction mysteries being written today, but I found \\"City Of Bones\\" to be one his slighter, more pro forma efforts. At its best, Connelly's prose can rise to the Chandleresque. His descriptions of post-modern Los Angeles are dead-on and can be tinged with a poetic melancholy. In \\"City of Bones\\" Connelly's writing is, as always, effortless and highly readable, but more servicable than literary.Unlike some other Bosch mysteries this story lacks any personal high stakes and there was no sense of surprise in the ultimate reveal. Bosch seems oddly unmoved by the death of a character with whom he was close. And there were other rarities for a Connelly mystery novel -- such questionable procedural details. The skeletal bones central to the story are identified without the use -- or even mention -- of DNA testing. And the exact cause and motivation of a central character's death remains surprisingly muddled and unresolved, a loose end I expected to be central to the stories conclusion.For those who enjoy Connelly's mysteries, there's no reason to skip this readable effort. For those seeking an introduction to this excellent mystery writer, I recommend one of Connelly's earlier books."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I have read nearly all of Michael Connelly's Bosch novels, and I would say that CITY OF BONES is one of the better ones in the series. I don't think this novel rivals the best Bosch books like THE CONCRETE BLONDE and THE LAST COYOTE. But this novel is better than novels like ANGEL FLIGHT and the subpar DARKNESS MORE THAN NIGHT.This novel is essentially a \\"cold case\\" mystery involving the recently discovered bones of a young child who was murdered over twenty years ago. Bosch tries to get to the bottom of the child's murder, and uncovers a lot of family secrets along the way. I found the plot realistic and highly interesting and I thought Connelly did a good job with the story. This is a real page-turner.The most annoying aspect of this book is the romantic subplot, which seems forced and underdeveloped. I also find it unconvincing that Bosch, a man in his fifties, would have a beautiful woman in her mid-thirties throwing herself at him. I was also highly disappointed with how this relationship was resolved. In my opinion, Connelly has never done a convincing job of creating a believable romantic relationship for Bosch.Overall, though, CITY OF BONES is a great read and much better than other crime novels out there. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I have enjoyed this novel. This is one of better Bosch novels since Trunk Music (5th in series). It's much different than the previous novels as it's written nicely. It's like Harry Bosch needed a break in one of his cases from being a scapegoat, his superiors breathing on his neck, making enemies among other unknown blues, or being out of control emotionally as shown from previous novels. Not much shown in this novel which makes it more enjoyable to read like I needed a break, but continuing in this series once in a while. That's the way I have noticed and felt from this novel comparing to previous novels in this series."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I picked this book up at the library while waiting for my wife. She was more than an hour late, so I managed to get well into this book. It's a good story, and this author, whom I had never read before, seems to handle police procedure well. At least it seems realistic to me. This story has enough twists to keep the reader interested, so I managed to finish it. It's well written. Not quite a four star job, but very good."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Harry Bosch and company. They will never let you down. Michael Connelly has done it again. A \\"cant put down exciting read\\". Plot twists, familiar characters, tough yet compassionate feelings of sincere prose that hits home. I, for one, will read Mr. Connelly's consistent creations as fast as he writes them. I have asked Amazon to flag me when ever the next offering is available."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"This is the best yet in the Hieronymous Bosch series. If you like police procedurals, you'll love this one. One of the things I liked most about the book is that while there is a pretty sordid crime underlying the book, the author doesn't dwell on the details, so I didn't feel a need to shower after finishing the book. There's a good plot, it's well developed, and it keeps you turning the pages. Well done!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I've read three Michael Connelly mysteries now, and I'm trying - really hard - to enjoy them, and to understand all the buzz and the great reviews. I just can't seem to get there. This was my first Harry Bosch and I found it, well, kind of boring. The book was at lot about Harry and his various relationships - with Edgar, his cardboard partner, with his boss, with the bueatiful rookie cop, with the assistant chief of police... And, oh yeah, and there was actually a mystery to solve going on in the background, though it seemed almost a distraction to both Connelly and Bosch.This wasn't a bad book - but essentially &quot;CoB&quot; is just another average crime novel. I've found Connelly's work rather sterile: today's really accomplished writers of this genre (Lehane, Crais, Burke, Teran,...) will build a scene which lets you feel the grit in the streets and smell the decay from the projects. Connelly, on the other hand, just kind of &quot;tells&quot; the story. The cities and the characters have a &quot;plastic&quot; feel to them; the situations overly simplied and contrived. Not much passion, little regional flavor, nothing to really grab the reader and reel them in. Perhaps the hardened Bosch fan will find this hard to put down, but in the final analysis, &quot;City of Bones&quot; is just another tale of LA. Others have done it much more effectively."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I got 'hooked' on Harry Bosch & Michael Connelly merely two years ago and have found it nearlyimpossible to 'put down' his offerings; however, CITY OF BONES was the first (and I've read nearlyall of them) I was tempted to 'stop turning the pages!' Unfortunately, after a tedious workup to avery sick abusive child molester as the murderer, he devises the ultimate anti-climax in 'outing'the killer. This book is surely not up to his usual standards. It's simply 'ho-hum'!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"CITY OF BONES by Michael Connelly only gets three stars from me. But, don't give up on the book. I've read all of Connelly's books except one now (kind of sad about it). This book is a page turner and hard to put down. As usual, Connelly is a master at hooking the reader in the lives of Harry Bosch, his partners, the victims and the villains. Ultimately, this book didn't win me completely over because it was more of an introspection into the character of Bosch instead of an actual police story.The book opens when bones are found on a hillside in a neighborhood in LA. Bosch and partner Edgar get the case. Much of the novel follows Bosch's quest to ID the victim. The bones are really old and Bosch has to track down people who may have known the murdered young boy. A romance with a rookie cop named Julia Brasher adds to the fun of the novel. But the case is a problem in the novel. Everything is too easy and there aren't any twists and turns until the last 1/4 of the novel. Finally, things start to happen and conclude in a satisfying, but somewhat depressing fashion.Connelly's Bosch books are some of the best I've ever read. CITY OF BONES just isn't one of the best. I think what separates this book from Connelly's greats is the lack of a great villain whether it is a serial killer or someone who may kill again. This eliminates any tension that there is danger to anyone. As said above, this novel is more about Bosch than the case he's trying to solve."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"An interesting Harry story but it only appears to be available in an abridge edition. I prefer unabridged editions."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"A few months ago I started reading Connelly's work in chronological order and I'm very glad I did it that way. City of Bones has Harry Bosch, an LAPD homicide detective, working a very cold case. A dog discovered some human bones in the woods. They are determined to be the bones of a 10-12 year old boy who had been severely abused throughout his life. Bosch sets out to determine the identity of the boy with the help of a new romantic interest. There are several deaths as a result of the investigation...two of which I'm not sure I fully understood...Connelly hints at what happened but never confirms the motives and series of events for sure. The ending is a total shockers...you will never see it coming!"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"The more I read, the more intrigued I became by the process, assumptions, mistakes, in trying to solve a crime. That I became involved in the whole thinking process as events unfolded was a journey to the truth well traveled along with Bosch."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Michael Connelly has been doing these Harry Bosch novels for some years now. Bosch is the stereotypical detective, and if anything that's always been my one main objection to him: he's a bit too much of a stereotype, right down to the jazz on the stereo, the chain-smoking (though he did finally quit), the casual attitude towards superiors, and the dogged determination to clear every one of his cases.The current book follows Bosch and his partner, Jerry Edgar, as they look into what they at first imagine is a false alarm. A man walking his dog in the Hollywood Hills has let the dog run wild, and the pooch returned with a bone in his mouth, which the man thinks is human. This happens regularly, and the bone is usually from an animal, but this time the dog's owner happens to be a retired doctor, and he knows what he's talking about: it's human. Soon Harry and Jerry are working a twenty-year-old homicide, apparently a runaway who was killed, for what reason they don't know. They can't even make an identification. Then it turns out there's a convicted child molester on the street, and things begin to go sideways and get ugly at the same time.Connelly has this sort of thing downpat now. The mystery's not the most surprising one he's done, and the plot is somewhat meandering, but the characterization of Bosch is well-done, and the other characters are interesting too. There are several strange twists in the plot, things that you weren't expecting, all of which aren't directly connected to the mystery of who killed the kid. The ending, which I won't reveal (though I guessed what was coming), is something of a mystery too, though the preview of his next book in the back told me where he was going to take things.Anyway, I enjoyed this book, and would recommend it, though of course anyone reading something like this should first read some of the earlier books, so that they get some background on the characters in the story."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"In City of Bones Michael Connelly continues to develop his ability to write realistic, thoughtful crime novels. Detective Harry Bosch of the Los Angeles Police Department appears to be at the end of his long career and he is at the top of his form as he struggles to discover who has killed a 12 year old boy buried in a shallow grave in the Hollywood hills.Harry learns that the bones are twenty years old and belong to an abused child. This cold case would have been relegated to the unsolved murder files, but Bosch identifies with the long dead child and he is determined to track down the killer. First he discovers the identity of the boy and then slowly and methodically collects and interprets the clues he needs to identify the murderer.I have read four other Bosch detective stories and this is the first time I have been satisfied with the overall development and conclusion of the story. Typically, Michael Connelly starts out strong, as with the Edgar Award winning novel The Poet, but then strains our credulity as the novel comes to an end. Not so in City of Bones. We pay close attention as Bosch sifts through the evidence and moves relentlessly to a satisfying conclusion.City of Bones has more careful detective work than non-stop action. One shoot-out in the middle of the novel is all the gunplay the read will find. Instead of murder and mayhem, Connelly takes us into the squad room and out in the field with Bosch as he does the painstaking work that helps him solve a crime which would frustrate and defeat most other detectives.City of Bones is an intelligent crime story that should please most fans of this genre."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Again, I have to thank MC for writing such wonderful crime novels, and spending time with Harry Bosch is always a joy and of course, very entertaining. As all his other books, \\"City of Bones\\" is a fascinating story, ...What impresses me the most is the fact that while many authors (after wrtiting great first novels) show an immense lack of quality in their writing ...; in contrast, MC keeps his high standards and therefore deserves my deepest respect. Justly, he is an acclaimed writer of realistic, suspenseful crime novels with strong characters.His books, esp. the Harry Bosch novels, are highly appreciated!-buying order-"},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"The one thing that grabbed me the most about Michael's work in this book is that he kept tossing out to you possible leads in this case but everytime you thought you had it figured out...he lets you praise yourself for about five minutes with, \\"I knew it was him!\\" only to find out you are not as detective smart as you thought you were. Great job Michael!James Karlson, Author of Black Petals- A Murder Mystery Coming out Soon."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"Connelly seems to be tying up loose ends in this novel ( the paperback teaser for his next shows why)with its sense of career completion. Harry makes a point of saying he is past the pension gateway, and the time span of the case - twenty year old bones- gives us a sense of time having passed. It's been a long time since Harry returned from Vietnam, which also comes up in the novel. Then too there is the finality of statements made by a number of the characters - the words one cannot take back- and a new road may be beckoning.The plot turns on the tale the bones tell and the urban sprawl of Southern California which transforms snake infested canyons into subdevelopments and former wilderness into neighborhood back lots. As the city comes to find the bones, so this novel rambles out of the city in a number of directions, playing upon the theme of scattering of the past and the detectives' task of reassembling it. The double turn of the ending is nicely done. (I'm not really giving it away, when the case seems resolved and you are only half way through the novels sizeable heft you know complications are coming). This is a good read for any detective novel fan and well worth the money."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"MICHAEL'S DONE IT AGAIN, LOVE YET ANOTHER BOSCHE MYSTERY. CERTAINLY A PAGE TURNER CAN'T HARDLY WAIT UNTIL A NEW RELEASE."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I have heard lots of good comments about the Harry Bosch novels and I was not disappointed with this seventh book of the series. Bosch is a hard boiled homocide detective in the Hollywood division of the LAPD who gets a call that a dog has discovered a human bone. The investigation uncovers a 20 year old murder of a 12 year-old boy who was the victim of child abuse. As the case proceeds, Bosch meets and becomes involved with a rookie cop named Julia Brasher, who has an idealistic view of police work.Some information leaks and false clues initially sidetrack the investigation but slowly the victim is identified and his short and tortured life revealed. Connelly draws his characters with fine strokes and his development of the details of the police procedures which are key to solving cases was really fascinating to me. Understanding the murder book, how warrants were drawn up and served, and details behind the forensic investigation added to my enjoyment of the story.False directions provide intrigue but I was a little disappointed with the unsatisfying way the murderer was revealed and dealt with.All in all though, a fast paced (I read it in one 24 hour period), and very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"I was not happy with the ending of this book but otherwise it was a good, not great read. The character development was a bit light, but Harry was certainly good old Harry in this one."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"After more than 20 years in the ground, the bones of a boy are recovered from a shallow grave. Good forensics and a tip from the general public help LAPD detective Harry Bosch and his colleagues to identify the boy, but at that time the media attention has already claimed its first innocent present day victim of the case. As the investigation goes on Harry Bosch also has to find some time for his new lover until she becomes the second victim of the case. And there are more victims: people who get falsely accused, people who lose their jobs, families that reveal their secrets. When the case is finally solved Bosch is left behind with the question whether it was all worth it.This is another typical Harry Bosch thriller: fine detective work, good psychological insights into the detectives and the suspects and the usual fight of the loner (Bosch) against the system (the press, his superiors). It is one of those books that will cost you a night sleep once you start reading, but it is definitely worthwhile."},{"Title":"City of Bones","review":"L.A.P.D. homicide detective Harry Bosch has unenviably pulled the New Year's detail. After concluding his investigations of two \\"routine\\" suicides, he receives a call that a dog has unearthed what appears to be a human bone in the Hollywood hills. Perusing the crime scene leads him to call in the medical examiners office to comb the area for possible clues. They exhume a large percentage of a human skeleton apparently of a 10-12 year old child.Analysis of the remains reveals an extensive amount of healed and healing bone fractures indicative of a heart wrenching case of severe child abuse. It appears that a particular type of medical procedure had been performed to repair a fractured skull. Other bits of evidence allow the incensed Bosch and his partner Jerry Edgar to conclude that the murder of a young boy was committed approximately 20-30 years ago.The press, having a field day with this unsolved mystery, impede the investigation by implicating an innocent man living in the neighborhood of the crime scene. He unfortunately had been convicted many years ago on a questionable child molestation charge. Bosch, after questioning the suspect, dismisses him as the culprit. His outing by the press however leads him to take his own life.Bosch and Edgar's investigation had stalled until one of the many calls to the police suggesting identities of the child's bones bears fruit. Sheila Delacroix speculates that the bones may be those of her 12 year old brother Arthur who ran away in 1980. Hospital records and comparative xrays confirm the identity by virtue of the operation done on the skull. Now the killer must be found.Bosch unearths a tragic family history involving the Delacroixs. Arthur's mom abandoned the family when the boy was two to be raised by an abusive, alcoholic, failed actor father, Samuel. Samuel who is now a down and out shell of a human being confesses to the murder. Bosch has his doubts. Despite enormous pressure from his superiors, he continues his probe and ultimately unmasks the true murderer.Connelly does a very routine job and dragging us through the many avenues explored in this murder investigation.

Plekhanov's other famous work, \\"The Development of the Monist Theory of History\\", this book addresses criticisms of historical materialism as well as misrepresentations by so-called Marxists themselves. All of the relevant issues and critiques are discussed, from the contrast between the materialism of Marx and Feuerbach to the role of race and geography in historical development. Plekhanov defends historical materialism from detractors and misguided supporters consistently and intelligently, and this book is a must read for everyone interested in Marxism and/or historiography.This edition also contains Plekhanov's essays \\"The Role of the Individual in History\\" and \\"The Materialist Conception of History\\", where the latter is a summary of the principles of historical materialism in the form of a review of the works of Antonio Labriola. The introduction, by a certain James Allen, is particularly excellent and goes into all the relevant points and issues with Plekhanovs work. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Fundamental problems of Marxism,","review":"G.V. Plekhanov was one of the founders of Russian Marxism, and a leading figure in the international socialist movement which began to emerge in a solid, organised form in the late 19th century. While he is little known today, and his name is mostly found in history books rather than libraries, his contributions to Marxist thought, and in particular, to Marxist philosophy, sociology and the philosophy of history from the standpoint of historical materialism, are still surprisingly fresh and informative for the reader of the 21st century.Plekhanov begins by describing the evolution and the philosophical foundations of the thought of Marx and Engels, demonstrating that they had established and developed a mature philosophical position from which they began to comprehend and understand the workings of society around them. He then continues by discussing the Marxist position on society, touching a vast variety of subjects, from the social relations of production, to geography, culture, idealism, and even to the importance (or not) of race in the historical development of a society. The book is followed by an appendix which includes two of his better known essays, the first discussing historical materialism and its significance and appropriateness in understanding history and the historical process, while the later analyses the relative significance of individuals in history. His explanation of the position of historical materialism in understanding history is one of the gems of this book. Plekhanov has produced an explanation and analysis so clear and persuading that I prefer it to any modern discussion on the subject I have come by so far.In conclusion, reading Plekhanov today is still interesting and rewarding. He is a thinker unjustly forgotten, and I would advice this book to anyone interested in approaching Marxist social thought. This book is also useful as a historical and ideological source.This edition comes complete with an introduction, explanatory notes and an index."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"I read this book a while back when my husband, a horse lover, introduced me to it.

He is a beautiful black animal with a white star on his forehead and one white foot and in the novel of Black Beauty, Black Beauty's white foot was usually always on the back in the left and another second best of Black Beauty's white foot was on the front in the right and that's where I like to see Black Beauty's white foot and it's perfect for the best on the front in the right and the left, and the one hind leg on the left and that's how you like Black Beauty and the best choices.The characters in this book of Black Beauty where Black Beauty's white foot is perfect in the back left for the best novel is just perfect for the one of this one of the my favourite four characters out of this book just to tell you of what clothes they would wear and they are John Manly the coachman in a black derby hat, red scarf, white shirt, plaid vest of green and black, green riding jacket with a yellow lining, black leather gloves, brown riding pants and tall black leather riding boots, except in A Stormy Day when John would be in a black derby hat, red scarf, white shirt, brown vest, long plaid jacket of grey and black, black leather gloves, beige riding pants and tall black leather riding boots, then James Howard the stableboy in a light blue shirt, brown vest, green riding pants and tall black leather riding boots, then James is in a black derby hat, blue shirt, red tie, brown vest, black jacket, brown leather gloves, green riding pants and tall black leather riding boots and for The Fire when James leads Beauty and Ginger from the burning stable, James would be in a light blue shirt, black jacket, beige riding pants and tall black leather riding boots using his red scarf for Black Beauty and Ginger and when James would get out of bed, he would have time to grab his vest but, would only just grab his jacket and his boots and scarf, then Joe Green the stable boy in a brown cap, white shirt, light green scarf, plaid vest of green and black, red riding jacket, black leather gloves, black riding pants and tall black leather riding boots, and then when Joe Green becomes a man and finds Beauty again, he would be in a black derby hat, white shirt, red scarf, brown vest, blue riding jacket, brown riding pants and tall black leather riding boots, then the master Mr. Barry in a black top hat, white ascot and shirt, black vest, blue riding jacket, black leather gloves, grey pants and tall black leather riding boots, then Jerry Barker in a red scarf, white collar on a blue and white striped shirt, brown vest, long brown jacket, brown leather gloves, grey pants and tall brown leather riding boots all for that whole year and the winter and then Farmer Thoroughgood's grandson Willie in a blue cap, pink shirt, plaid vest of green and black, brown pants and short black leather boots and that's very perfect for some of the few favourite characters out of this book of Black Beauty so you'd know what their clothing would have been like.At the end of this best book to live and enjoy with, Joe Green is home with Black Beauty at a pretty house in a small village and it had a nice pasture and a comfortable stable, and that is a good book I love a lot and it is a GEM, I loved it and it's the greatest novel of all times of the greatest horse story ever told.Black Beauty (1994) starring Sean Bean DVD is like the novel with the four of the real books on two different Black Beauty books of Illustrated by Robert Doremus and Adapted by June Brigman and Roy Richardson and because those two different books of Black Beauty just for sure go great with the movie as the only two matched up and goes well. The one illustrated by Robert Doremus and adapted by June Brigman and Roy Richardson for sure goes great with the movie because of his white foot on the back in the left.Black Beauty with actor David Gregory in this animated DVD is like the novel with the book of Black Beauty Illustrated by Scott McKowen would go great with the animated DVD version as it matched up with some of the Black Beauty books of illustrated in black and white by Edwin John Prittie and colour illustrations by Edward F. Cortese and the only one out of another one is Going for the Doctor colour illustration by Percy F. Spence and that for sure goes great with the animated movie because of his white foot on the front in the right and that's how it would be for the animated version.From now on, my new favorite seven Black Beauty books to live easier with the one of Illustrated by Neil Reid: published and copyright in 2001 by Prospero books is the other best only just the seven from now on will only be and are Illustrated in colour by G. P. Micklewright, Illustrated by Scott McKowen, Adapted by June Brigman and Roy Richardson, Illustrated by John Beer and colour illustrations by Cecil Aldin, Lucy Kemp-Welch and G. P. Micklewright, Illustrated by Robert Doremus: copyright and published by Whitman in 1951 and Illustrated by Ian Andrew and only from now on, that's my best new only seven favourite from now collection on only just the seven books of Black Beauty to live and read with but, they are now the best real ones I would be in for the ones I like are the best and that's how I'll make my living that way forever and now only just to live with and no more, just my only best now-on favourites to live in somehow and carefully to live in and the only ones I'd take part in are Illustrated in colour by G. P. Micklewright, Illustrated by John Beer with colour illustrations by Cecil Aldin (part of in with John Beer), Lucy Kemp-Welch and G. P. Micklewright and Illustrated by Ian Andrew and those are the only best three books of Black Beauty I want to follow in, live with and be part of and the only ones that follow the movies are Illustrated by Robert Doremus: copyright and published by Whitman in 1951 and Adapted by June Brigman and Roy Richardson (the only best two that follow the 1994 movie of Black Beauty starring Sean Bean) and Illustrated by Scott McKowen (the onbly best one that follows the 1978 cartoon animated version of Black Beauty with David Gregory), and those are the only seven except I only live in four of the books and the other three books just only follow the movies, and the one by Neil Reid can be by itself for sure sometimes.Another real four favourites of Black Beauty I like are his white foot on the back in the left, another of his white foot on the front in the right and another one with three white feet of two on the front in the right and the left and the one in the hind left and also his white foot on the front in the left and that's my real four different favourites I like of Black Beauty and where his white foot will be.Examples of my favourite horse of Black Beauty in different books of his white foot are:Black Beauty's white foot on the back in the left in the different books of Adapted by June Brigman and Roy Richardson, Illustrated by Neil Reed - Published by Prospero books in 2001 and Illustrated by Robert Doremus - copyright and published by Whitman in 1951. So that's where I would like to see Black Beauty's white foot on the back in the left for sure and for real.Black Beauty's white foot on the front in the right in the different book of Illustrated by Scott McKowen. So that's where I would like to see Black Beauty's white foot on the front in the right.Black Beauty with three white feet of two on the front in the right and left and the one in the hind left in the ones Illustrated by Ian Andrew and Illustrated in colour by G. P. Micklewright. So that's where I would see Black Beauty with three white feet so his you would want it on the front in the right and the left, back in the left and if you see one white foot because of the three, you would say the one on the front in the left and that's the all time best horse ever to have.Black Beauty's white foot on the back in the right perfect for the two of the best ones of Illustrated by John Beer and colour illustrations by Cecil Aldin which is perfect on the back in the right and part of in with John Beer. That's the best one to keep sometimes, but, never can tell, sometimes.This book of Black Beauty: Illustrated by Neil Reid - published and copyright in 2001 by Prospero books reminds me of some of the DVD videos on the The Cowboy Way starring Woody Harrelson and Kiefer Sutherland, Bonanza, Vol. 1: Feet of Clay/The Last Viking/Bitter Water/The Savage, Bonanza, Vol. 3: The Courtship/The Savage/Breed of Violence/The Last Viking, Disney's The Princess Diaries starring Anne Hathaway, 2003 & 2005 Wrangler NFR and that's what this means to me, a lot in this world. Also this Black Beauty book is reminding me of some Charles Schridde paintings of a few.I loved, liked and enjoyed this book and that is a gem and it is the great and best book of love, I loved it and it's the greatest novel of all times of the greatest horse story ever told. I loved it:) BEST ONE EVER!My only favorite book of Huckleberry Finn is the Illustrated Junior Library illustrated by Donald MacKay, the only best one book that follows the Walt Disney movie \\"The Adventures of Huck Finn\\" starring Elijah Wood and Courtney B. Vance and that is the only best Huckleberry Finn book I could ever enjoy the best Illustrated by Donald MacKay to show how it follows the Elijah Wood movie and that's the best!:)Well, that's all I gotta say about Black Beauty for now!

I still love it, it is as well written and endearing as I remember it. Interestingly though, I found it more interesting to read now as a horse owner. So many of the things that I read as a youngster who only dreamed of horses, now had a whole new context as a rider and horse owner."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"I read this book when I was very small, and found the description and the livelyness of the charecters amazing. Its hard to believe its nearly a hundred years old! Anna Sewell was an excellent writer, who is my inspiration. She uses imagery and personification so well to get her (very valid) point across, in a wonderfully encapsualting way.Black Beauty is a kind, gentle and well-mannered horse who struggles in the harsh victorian world. This book has made me cry many a time, out of despair and sorrow for the charecters, and at the loveleyness of all the horses and some of the human charecters. It shows the way Victorians lived, and treated their animals and teaches us a lot of very important lessons. A must read for anyone, of any age."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Okay, I remeber back in like 5th grade when IU bought this book at my local book fair. Then I could not read very well, and I was still having troble. When I got into six grade and got a whole lot better at reading, I read this. I shall the movie ten thousand times, and the book was even better! I loved it! It's a heart warming story about a black quarter horse, with a white star on his forehead. There Ginger, the abused bad temperd mare, now owned by John. And learns, with king treatment and love, becomes better and becomes a good companyion for black beauty. And the small white pony named Merrylegs. Black Beauty is warned when young by his mother that a horses life can be hard. He doesn't relize this till he comes to Earlshall where they have the bearing rein, a device to making the horses hold there heads high, and are very hard on there backs. After about five times of being strained back more, Ginger bolts, and break the cart, and in the process runs the men over. And starts choking on the reins. It sad, for then they are no longer in shape, and finaly Black Beauty is sold for his knees are open and would not heal because of the stupid thing! Life becomes even harder for him, till he comes to Jerry a cart driver in the busy streets of London. But once again is sold and comes to caring a cart up a hill loaded with sacks of grain.

But the job destroys him till he goes to a sale and brought by a old man and his son, and comes back to health. Then sold again and comes to Joe Green. And fianlly has a home to live in for the rest of his life. This book is one of the best horse books I ever read, and my most favorite. Set in England from a horses point of view of old life back there. If you want a book about a horse, well this book is for you! I adore it, and I hope you do to!"},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"I really loved this book because it teaches many good lessons, like patience and willingness to work hard. This horse's life is filled with good times and bad, kind masters and cruel masters. The way Black Beauty loves and tries to do his best for all his masters shows his humble spirit and his need to be loved. He goes through whatever hardship comes his way and his trust in his grooms and his masters is lovely. To hear him speak of how he must do his best in everything and always be good and patient is really heart-warming, and though he is a horse, a very timid and human spirit lives within him. He often speaks of how silly and stupid things like check-reigns and blinkers are and how ignorant certain foolish people can be. He knows that not all people are like that and tries to not show his despair when an amateur is in control. He is truly pious soul and in him I saw the qualities that make a creature beautiful, not only on the outside but on the inside too."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"This truly is a timeless classic, a bestseller and groundbreaking book in it's time.It was written by Anna Sewell who was an invalid at the time. It was her first and only book. She had been particularly close to horses due to a childhood injury to both her ankles that limited her walking mobility but not riding.It was one of the first animal biographies written in the first person and highlighted abuses and difficulties that horses faced in their everyday lives in the Victorian era. This book was instrumental in changing the way society looked at animals and horses in particular and changed the way that horses were treated. It is also a treatise of sorts on compassion and how to treat your fellow man and animals. It's quite possibly the first guidebook on the humane treatment of horses.As for the book itself, even more than a hundred years later the writing is still easy to read and follow. It is like an old friend that I can pick up any day and still read with pleasure. The story is poignant and sad but also happy. I highly recommend this book to children and adults who have not read this already, anyone who is interested in animals and especially horses and life in the Victorian era. 5 stars definitely."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"This was a gift for my daughter. She asked that family members give her books that had significance in their lives and to inscribe them with a message about the significance of the book. Black Beauty was the first book my mother read as a girl. She is 89 years old, and during the Great Depression the government created a book binding program in her home town. If people brought a book in and donated it to be rebound, they would receive a free library card. My mother's copy of Black Beauty was sorely worn, and she carried to book to the bindery and received her free library card. When I asked her what book she took out first from the library, she responded, \\"Black Beauty!\\""},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Anna Sewell (English Quaker 1820-1878) was one of the first equine advocates, if not the first to write a children's novel about a wonderful horse and the cruelty of man. Black Beauty is the autobiography of a horse.Told from the horse's point-of-view, Black Beauty describes his birth, early training and his fondness for his first master, Squire Gordon, stablemates Ginger and Merrylegs and grooms John and James.For fashion's sake, some owners insisted the grooms harness the carriage horses with their head's held high with the check rein. This made it difficult for the team to pull as well as caused other long term problems. Squire Gordon was against such devices.When James plans on moving on, little Joe Green is trained for his position. The young boy makes a grave error in Beauty's care after the horse is ridden hard to fetch the doctor for the mistress, and the doc rides him hard back. Beauty survives the incident, but when the mistress needs to move due to her illness, all the horses must be sold.After that, Beauty describes his life with various owners. Some are ignorant, some cruel but a handful give him the best care they can including a cab driver. Life is hard, and the author gives details of the cruelty of some grooms, drivers and owners.At least Sewell gives the story a happy ending.I first read this as a teen, before I took riding lessons. Looking back, I think Sewell's insight helped me decide my path on my journey to becoming a professional horsewoman.I would recommend this book for all horse lovers except the very young."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Black Beauty: The Autobiography of a Horse, by Anna Sewell is a spellbinding story of a horse's life in nineteenth century England. This novel is especially interesting because Sewell anthropromorphizes Black Beauty and makes him the first person narrator. The plot of Black Beauty revolves around Beauty's life and interaction with other human and nonhuman animals as well as his sale from one owner to the next. Most importantly, Sewell wrote this novel to call attention to the treatment of animals in nineteenth century England.Sewell organizes this book into four sections. In the first section, Beauty tells the story of his youth with his first two masters: Farmer Grey and Squire Gordon. The author describes Farmer Grey as a man who gave his horses \\"good food, good lodging, and kind words.\\" After Beauty turned four, Farmer Grey sold him to Squire Gordon. Beauty led a relatively comfortable life with Squire Gordon. The only exception was when a new stable boy forgot to cover Beauty with a blanket on a cold night and he became very ill. The first section of the book ends when Gordon is forced to sell Beauty because of his sick wife.In the second section of this book, Beauty's health begins to rapidly deteriorate due to inept owners as well as indolent, corrupt, and abusive grooms. Beauty's first owner after Squire Gordon is a nobleman referred to as the Earl of W-----, who is indifferent to his horses. Beauty's bad situation is made worse after his regular groom leaves and a man by the name of Rueben Smith is left in charge. The climax of this section occurs when Smith drunkenly rides Beauty over a freshly paved road of \\"large sharp stones, over which no horse could be driven quickly without risk of danger.\\" As a result, Beauty's front knees and one hoof were injured and Smith was thrown from the saddle and killed. Due to Beauty's injuries, the Earl of W----- sold him and for the rest of this section, he is passed from one incompetent owner to another.Beauty's luck improves in the third section, after he is purchased by a London cab driver by the name of Jeremiah Barker. Barker is portrayed as a religious, kind, and attentive owner who cares greatly for his horses as well as other people. At one point, Barker even refuses two paying customers to give a free ride to a woman with a sick child. By portraying Barker as both a religious man and a kind owner, Sewell makes the implicit argument that the cruel treatment of animals conflicts with Christianity. However, when Barker becomes ill after waiting on a fare in extremely cold weather, he is forced to sell his cab and all of his horses.In the final section, Beauty's fortunes are mixed. Beauty's first owner in this section was a baker who knew very little about horses or how to care for them. Worse still, this owner's foreman had no empathy for Beauty and persistently overloaded his cart. This was especially difficult because the foreman also put the check-rein up, which prevented Beauty from putting his full power into pulling the cart. Sadly, when Beauty was unable to pull these heavy loads, he was insulted and abused. It is also during this section that Beauty experienced the worst treatment yet at the hands of man named Nicholas Skinner. This Simon Legree-esque character used horses like machines, and when they could no longer work, he sold or killed them. Luckily, Beauty was eventually sold to three older women. In the last paragraph of this book, Beauty stated, \\"My troubles are all over, and I am at home.\\"Sewell's choice to anthropomorphize Black Beauty allows her to present his story in a very personal manner. As Beauty is sold from one owner to the next, the reader feels Beauty's fear and apprehension. When Beauty is mistreated, neglected, and abused, the reader is forced to feel his pain. Had Sewell chosen to write this from a human's perspective, this would not have been possible. Therefore, Black Beauty: The Autobiography of a Horse presents a persuasive argument that humans should reconsider the way they interact with animals."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"This is a great book and I like the book Black Beauty the book, because my favorite color is black and I like horses.The illustrations by William M. Hutchinson are very beautiful and my favorite ones in there are A Stormy Day, The Fire, Farmer Thoroughgood and His Grandson Willie and My Last Home and they are just my favorite four drawings in the book and one part of a guy driving a horse.For The Fire, here's something to say about it for an adapted example and it goes:Danger at the InnMy master and his wife planned to visit friends some two days' drive away. We were to drive partway and stay overnight at an inn. Ginger and I pulled the carriage and James Howard, the stableboy, drove us. James needed practice at driving in order to take up the offer of a job as a groom at another stable.At the inn, an old hostler took charge of Ginger and me. James couldn't believe how quickly and thoroughly he cleaned me - my coast was as smiit as silk.\\"I've had forty years practice looking after horses,\\" the old hostler told James. After he had gone, a second hostler came in with his friend. The friend puffed on his pipe as he climbed up to the loft for some hay.That night, I had slept for some hours but woke up suddenly feeling very uncomfortable. The air had seemed all thick and chocking. I heard Ginger coughing and one of the other horses moving about restlessly. They were neiging and stamping very loudly in fear. When I listened more closely, I could hear a low crackling noise. I didn't know what the noise was but it made me tremble all over.Then one of the hostlers burst into the stable with a lantern, began to untie the horses, and tried to lead them out. He was so frigtened himself that he scared the horses even more. The first horse wouldn't go with him, nor the second and third. He tried to drag me out by force, but that was just no use! As I waited my turn, I saw flames spreading from the loft. Then I looked upward and saw a red light flickering on the wall. Someone outside cried, \\"Fire! Fire!\\"Then the next thing I knew James was at my side when I heard his voice saying, \\"Wake up and come on Black Beauty, we'll soon be out of this mess.\\"He slipped my bridle on, took his scard off his neck and tied it lightly over my eyes, and talked to me carefully leading me into safety in the yard, when he slipped the scarf off my eyes and left me with another man, then raced back into the burning stable with his scarf.There was a whole lot of confusion in the yeard with horses being yanked and led out of other stable and people were yelling and shouting all sorts of things. Presently I heard above all the noise a loud clear voice, which I knew was Squire Gordon's. \\"James, James Howard! Where are you?\\"Then I heard a crash of something falling in the stable and the next moment I gave a loud joyfull neigh for at last, I saw James leading Ginger away from the burning building. I neiged woith joy and relief.\\"You're a brave lad, James, are you hurt?\\" the master told him.\\"I am well, Squire,\\" James said happily. \\"Aye,\\" said the big man who held me, \\"He is a brave lad, and no mistake!\\"Just then two strong horses dashed into the yard pulling a fire engine begind them.We heard that the fire had been started by someone laying down a lighted pipe and exiting without it; I remember our John Manly's rule, never to allow a pipe in the stable.For My Last Home, if you were Joe Green and you found Black Beauty again, the outfit you would wear is a green cap, blue shirt, red scarf, brown vest, black blazer, beige riding pants and high black leather riding boots and that is probably nearly an OK outfit to wear and another one is a white shirt, blue riding jacket, white gloves, white riding breeches, and high black leather riding boots with brown tops and here's something to say about My Last Home as an example as it for an adapted example and it goes:My golden yearsAt the next horse sale, a boy took a liking to me. \\"Was that one a carriage horse, Grandpa?\\" he asked.\\"He might have been, Willie,\\"he replied, to his grandson's delight.\\"Couldn't we buy this horse and make him young again!\\" Willieasked.\\"I suppose we can try, Willie,\\" he replied happily.They brought me to their farm, where I could rest or run in themeadow as I pleased.\\"He's growing young, Willie,\\" the boy's grandfather remarked.He found me a home with three kind young ladies who doted on me.My new groom looked at me over. \\"You have a scar on your backlike Black Beauy.\\"He looked me in the eye.Then he smiled. \\"Beauty, is that really you?Don't you know me? I'm little Joe Green from Squire Gordon's stables.I did not recognize Joe at first. He had grown from a boy into a fine young man with dark whiskers.\\"I can see you've had some hard times, Beauty,\\" said Joe. \\"ButI'll make sure that you only have good times now. I'm here, Black Beauty, I'm here. I swear I won't ever let you out of my sight again. Oh, Beauty ... You're safe now. Your troubles are over.\\"Joe was right -- finally my troubles are over. He is the bestand kindest of grooms and my mistresses have said that they willnever sell me. Willie's grandfather said to Joe the other day: \\"In your place he will last till he is twenty years old -- perhaps more.\\"At last, I am truly at home.This book illustrated by William M. Hutchinson is simular to the Black Beauty starring Sean Bean and directed by Caroline Thompson, the Warner Brothers home video one and the other Black Beauty books illustrated by Victor Ambrus and adapted by Caryn Jenner, Great Illustrated Classics adapted by Deidre S. Laiken and Illustrated by Walter Seaton are definitely simular to the Warner Brothers Home Video of Black Beauty starring Sean Bean and Directed by Caroline Thompson. They just are for sure.I really liked and loved this book and this Whitman classics book of Black Beauty Illustrated by William M. Hutchinson is reminding me of the 1958 rodeo of Dean Oliver, the 1958 world champion calf roper when I think just a book published in 1955 should just be perfect for the year of 1958 for sure.Well, that is a great book and a great movie the only movies of Black Beauty I like are Sean Bean, the goodtimes cartoon animated version and the Hanna Barbera animated version and just three would do of my favorites.I loved, liked, and enjoyed this book and what a great book to read over and over again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I am a fan of that book and I liked and enjoyed that book like a happy one at the end of Black Beauty finding a happy home! Another book to collect only with Black Beauty is \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" by Mark Twain and like two Black Beauty books and one Tom Sawyer book.This is a great book and I really liked and enjoyed it and just for the heck of it, you would like to hear some Historical Results from 1958 in the past and it goes:1958All-Around Cowboy1.

Although it is thought of as a childrens book, it has a lot of things to offer. One of the quotes that grabbed my attention was the one where Sewell wrote, \\"Not knowing the right thing to do often does more harm in this world than wickedness itself.\\" It is little gems like this that make this a worthwhile read for both a parent and child. Sewell no doubt understood a lot about life that she, thankfully, left behind for others to discover in her one and only book. My wife and I are finding there is a lot to learn from all of the books that were not part of either of our childhoods. I am grateful to be able to able to be learning about them now, and to be able to share them with our children.This book is easy to read, not too long, and easy for little ones to follow along with. It also has a lot of little gems in it that are there if you pay attention to them.

It left me speechless. Truly a timeless classic, for animal lovers and beyond."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"I've read this book several times since I was a little girl, and it never gets old. It contains so many wise words about dealing with adversity and treating animals well--everyone should read it at least once. Black Beauty learned from his wise old mother that others' poor behavior is no excuse to behave poorly himself. He gets plenty of opportunities to test this advice, and comes across others who weren't so fortunate to learn it at a young age."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"There are several problems with this book in regards to young people, but the most obvious is the antiquated vocabulary, which is almost impossible to understand through context.My daughter is 9, and though she has an average plus reading level, this book gave her no end of problems. As a consequence, I was forced to listen to her read and then translate the vocabulary, diction, tone, etc. She was, in most cases, completely in the dark. And no wonder! \\"Roan cob, bearing rein, phaeton,carter, drayer,\\" etc.--all words used with no reference points for my bewildered little lady, and several of them gave me pause as well. I am a high school English teacher, and I guarantee that my students would not understand half the book as well.The book was completely impossible for her to fathom by herself. When I asked her to read by herself and then tell me what she read, she couldn't explain what she had read because she didn't understand half of the terminology used.Although I am sure the book was a fine example of a classic children's book when it was published, it is a drudgery to read now. I liked the idea of the horse speaking directly to its audience, but the constant prosying on about the condition of horses and their owners became so tedious. I do understand that the book teaches about kindness to all people, human or otherwise, but any message repeated continually throughout 197 pages becomes a cliche and loses its impact after the tenth repetition.I am so happy to have this book read and the book report done. I believe that children under 12 will not understand it, and I think that only good readers who are in love with horses should attempt this book by themselves!"},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Much as I appreciate the idea of a facsimile--there's the charm of the handwritten inscription, the feeling of an old book--trying to read this edition of Black Beauty is like reading a damaged copy reassembled by an illiterate.

Did they notice the last pages were missing?"},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Every third page is a sermon on how to treat animals with respect. I got the point by the fifth time time around. The 10th through the 20th sermons were tad bit tiresome. Not sure how this book ever became known as a classic.

This story is in a horse's point of view, but it seems so human-like. It shows how life has ups and downs, for every living thing.This story teaches us kindness, and to help others in need.

John Manly is saying goodbye to Black Beauty & Ginger. John Manly goes around to Black Beauty & Ginger in a soft loving voice.

For all those teachers out there, DONT BUY BLACK BEAUTY!!!"},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"One of the great unanswered questions of life is the mysterious attraction that horses hold for young girls. Sure, we all know that there's some kind of psychosexual component, but why horses in particular? At any rate, Black Beauty &amp; the rest of those equine tales (Black Stallion, National Velvet, etc.) were never central to my childhood reading, but my wife fondly recalls her father reading it to her--a topic I feel it is best to avoid commenting on.Anna Sewell was left crippled by a childhood accident and depended on horses to get around. A Quaker, she was apparently extremely sensitive about any violence towards animals. As the quote above indicates, she even used prompting rather than prodding to guide her own rides . In the closing years of her life, suffering intense pain herself, she wrote this book to call attention to the mistreatment of horses and it became a genuine publishing phenomenon. She uses a first person (first horse?) narrative to completely anthropomorphize Black Beauty, a well bred and even tempered stallion who passes from owner to owner. Over the course of the book, Beauty's owners display varying standards of treatment from kindness to neglect to open brutality. But Beauty perseveres and happily ends up back with his original owners. Along the way, Sewell also gets the opportunity to take some potshots at hunting, drinking, poverty and the like.It's easy to see how the story became a classic, thanks to its sympathetic portrayal of Beauty and his fellow horses. But it is fundamentally based on a lie. Animals aren't human and horses aren't even particularly intelligent by animal standards. We shouldn't mistreat them because to do so is unnecessary and counterproductive. But to pretend that they have complex personalities and emotions does them no service and sort of cheapens the dialogue about what &quot;rights&quot; animals should have. The book makes for a pleasant read, provided you don't let kids take it to seriously.GRADE: B-"},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"This book is just plain boring.

The character has no flare of personality and is your basic stupid goody-two-shoes.Any real book the characters have flaws. Of course, this book is lousy and the characters are just boring. I have consulted several others and we all agree on one point: its a total waste of money, time, and effort. This book somehow managed to become a classic, proboble just because it has to do with horses. It has no plot! There really must be better ways to spend your time than read this book!

Black Beauty is a moving story of a horse's life, told in the horse's own words. As the reader accompanies Black Beauty through life's adventures, a powerful message is presented: Treat both humans and animals alike with kindness and respect. Black Beauty's mother taught him early in life that there are many different kinds of men.\\"There are a great many kinds of men; there are good, thoughtful men like our master, that any horse may be proud to serve; but there are bad, cruel men, who never ought to have a horse or dog to call their own. Beside, there are a great many foolish men, vain, ignorant, and careless, who never trouble themselves to think; these spoil more horses than all, just for the want of sense; they don't mean it, but they do it for all that. I hope you fall into good hands; but a horse never knows who may buy him, or who may drive him; it is all a chance for us, but still I say, do your best wherever it is, and keep up your good name.\\"This classic tale inspired me, and I think it will inspire you aswell, to always be kind and compassionate to my animals, and care for them the best I can."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"This book is brill it made me cry laugh and somtimes even jump up and down!

I really loved reading Black Beauty, by Anna Sewell. I loved reading it because I learned that a horse's life can be filled with love, and it can also be filled with meanness. It's a great book to read if you love horses like I do. Black Beauty is told from the horse's point of view. The story is so interesting when it begins as you visualize Black Beauty running with his mother Duchess in a field in the happiest times of his life.My favorite parts of the book were the beginning when Black Beauty was with his mother and six other colts in the meadow running together and having great fun! In the middle of the book, Black Beauty comes to meet Ginger and Merrylegs, who end up becoming very good friends and somehow always seem to meet up throughout the story. At the end, my favorite part was when you come to realize that all of Black Beauty's troubles are over and he finally will live in a happy place.Some of the characters I liked were Black Beauty, Ginger, Merrylegs, Duchess, Squire Gordon, Black Beauty's first Master, John and James, and finally Joe Green. I admire all of there characters for their spirit and their courage. I would recommend this book to anyone that loves horses or to read a story that is truly heartwarming."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Black Beauty is about a great stallion that gets separated from his mom and he is sold to other people and meets great friends. He meets a little pony named Marrylegs. Marrylegs was a horse who has short legs and he loved his owners. When kids came over to get a ride on Marrylegs then they started whipping him with a stick like a real horse. A couple of days later Marrylegs gets sold.Then Black Beauty meets a lady horse named Ginger. He talks to her about how his life has been after he got separated from his mom. They fall in love as they stay together for a long time. A few months went by and Ginger got sent away followed by Black Beauty. They no longer live happily ever after because before they left Ginger told about the troubles that have been going on between the man that had bought her and the way he is going to treat Ginger. Ginger and Black Beauty meet up after carrying a bunch of people he sees ginger and she looks terrible. After finding out what happened to ginger she dies a couple days later. Black Beauty becomes really sad and then he figures out that it could be a good thing that she has gone to a better place because she has no more troubles for her to fight over. Black beauty was sad because he lost the only one he could be in love with but not long after he was being worked really hard and he was not feeling good and he died after Ginger from being worked too hard. He had no more troubles for him to take care of either. When he died he was able to be with the one he loved. Then they really did live happily ever after.I recommend this book to anyone who likes horses because this book is about a horse who is brought to many places and trying to survive being with different owners and they are not being very nice to a horse who has been to a lot of places.

She does what few authors of her time did, and many do now, but with much greater charm and imagination. She makes 'Black Beauty', a young stallion growing up to be a 'working horse' in 19th century England both her hero and her narrator. We see the story of horses, places and people Beauty knows through his own eyes, and we feel the grounding truth of the story even more that way, And that's why this book is still a classic read, for ages 8 to 98+. I can't recommend it too highly. You will be transported to a very different, and yet a very familiar time and place, in which wise horses and foolish ones, foolish people and compassionate ones live and work and learn how much they depend on one another.Rielle"},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"When Black Beauty is just a young colt, his mother warns him that a horse's life is often difficult.

The book is a cross between fantasy and realistic. This is because even thought the story is being told by a horse (Black Beauty), it contains real and true information also.Black Beauty is the story of a horse's life. The horse in the story, Black Beauty, had a very interesting life. He starts out with his mother, on a nice farm. After he is one or two years old he is broken in by his master. After that, he is passed on form master to master, farm to farm, some are good, and some bad. In his life he experiences friendship, love, pain, terro, and death. His best master he ever had was at Birtwick Park, with Squire Gordon and John Manly. They were good riders and love horses deeply. However, he was also ridden by a drunk man once in his life and ended up breaking his knees!In my opinion, this book was very good. I also think that it teach an important lesson to humans, to love and care for all of the Earth's creatures.

Those hot summers when the ice cream truck drove by and you sat there licking you frozen ice pop? And then, your mind began to imgaine things. You saw a dreamy black horse, cantering across the meadow with a small white welsh pony and a mare a tad smaller than the black horse. And they galloped as one, through lush green meadows, occasionally lapping at a nearby crystal clear spring fed pond. You will once again be invited back to these scenes as you read Ann Sewell's Classic, Black Beauty.This masterpiece paints a picture of a horse's seemingly nine lives. Always changing from one place to another. Some are gentle and know just how to treat the horse; others just try to get the money's worth out of him. Black Beauty's best friends, a mean-tempered chestnut mare named Ginger and a spunky littl;e welsh named Merrylegs team up to take on their dreams together. Through becoming a carriage horse to take a lady to tea, to being rented out, to recovering in a young farmer's son's hands, Black Beauty is something that we won't see in a long, long time. Forget Heartland and Chestnut Hill-one book can say a lot of powerful things.I have rated this story 5 stars because it is one of the best things I have ever read.

At that point in time, it was much easier for horses to find work. Nowadays it is virtually impossible for a horse to find work. This is because automobiles have made horses obsolete.Nevertheless, Black Beauty is a charming novel about a hard working and well mannered horse (Black Beauty) who understands and speaks English. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to get inside the mind of a well mannered horse who lived in a time before automobiles were invented by Henry Ford.Merrylegs is one of Black Beauty's friends. He is a pony who, like Black Beauty, speaks English. Upon meeting Black Beauty, Merrylegs says, \\"My name is Merrylegs. I am very handsome.\\"If you enjoy reading books about animals who speak English, I also recommend George Orwell's Animal Farm."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"black beauty is a thrilling adventure for children. it is a great story of love"},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Animal books that are told from the creature's point of view (whether cat, dog, horse, or some other species entirely) are a dime a dozen these days, but \\"Black Beauty,\\" was the first book of its kind to use this technique and is thus the forerunner to all animal stories that came after it. Most people are unaware that Anna Sewell broke new literary ground when she wrote \\"Black Beauty\\" in the style of an autobiography, though ironically she never meant it to be a children's story at all. Instead she intended that it would be read by those that work with horses: \\"to induce kindness, sympathy, and an understanding treatment of horses.\\"Beauty is one of several names given to the horse that grows throughout the story from a young colt in a farmyard to an elderly stallion enjoying his retirement, chronicling all his experiences in between, both good and bad. These include being the horse of a squire, a cabby, a gentleman and a cart driver among others, as well as events that are probably known even to those who haven't read the book, such as the fire in the barn and the washed-out bridge.Throughout his life he meets several other horses such as cheerful Merrylegs and feisty Ginger who recount their stories to him; and it's difficult not to get a little choked up when it comes to Ginger and her tragic tale, especially when she tells Beauty at their final meeting: \\"you are the only friend I ever had.\\" For many children, Ginger's story may well have been their first experience with the portrayal of death in a story - I know it was mine, and I never forgot it.Since being published in 1877, the story has lost none of its power, and the image of a black horse with a white star on his forehead is universally recognized as the iconic Black Beauty. Not only this, but the novel is credited with driving the bearing rein out of fashion, a device that was popular in the Victorian age but which damaged horses' necks by forcing them upright at an unnatural angle, and is also believed to have made a difference in reducing the taxicab licence fee of the time, (something that was often exploited by those that hired out cabbies to drivers), not to mention heightening the awareness of animal cruelty at a time when animal welfare simply didn't exist.As such \\"Black Beauty\\" can be described as the first animal rights book, told in first-person narrative from the (literal) horse's mouth, criticizing things such as docking (that is, cutting off horse's tails), the aforementioned bearing reins, and the long, hard hours of work that horses had to endure. The trick of it though, is that the issues never seem particularly moralizing or heavy-handed because it's all told by the horses themselves. It doesn't take much of a stretch of the imagination to assume that if horses were capable of talking to each other, they would discuss the cruelties and kindnesses that human beings mete out upon them.This is effectively portrayed by the sheer confusion of the animals as to why humans act in certain ways; such as Beauty pondering why human beings endanger both themselves and their horses in fox hunting, or why so much pain is inflicted on animals for the sake of fashion, asking: \\"What right have they to torment and disfigure God's creatures?\\" Likewise, the first-person narrative gives a perspective on the life of a horse that had probably never occurred to Sewell's original audience (or indeed, her first-time contemporary readers), has when Beauty discusses how it feels to wear a bit:\\"Those who have never had a bit in their mouths cannot think how bad it feels. A great piece of cold hard steel as thick as a man's finger is pushed into one's mouth, between one's teeth and over one's tongue. It ends come out at the corner of your mouth and are held fast there by straps over your head, under your throat, round your nose, and under your chin, so that in no way in the world can you get rid of the nasty hard thing.\\"Towards the end of the book, it does start to get slightly more preachy, mainly due to the fact that Sewell begins to dwell on issues such as alcohol, elections and religion that have no bearing on the horses at all, but are merely being discussed by the humans around them. However, this aspect is thankfully minor and doesn't detract too much from Beauty's own story.I have a particular soft-spot for \\"Black Beauty\\" considering Anna Sewell is lurking up in my family tree somewhere (on my grandmother's side), and the fact that the memories of reading this book as a child have always stayed with me. This is an essential book for any children's library in order to cultivate empathy for the animal kingdom, but is also valuable reading for an adult as well, not just for the ur-example of an animal tale, but as a thoughtful, bittersweet and well-researched look into the life of man's second-best friend."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"A worthwhile read for kids, tho my grandchildren didn't seem interested in this and other books I got them."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Black Beauty is a novel about the tough lives of horses. The main character, who is also a horse, is Black Beauty. He grew up on a large meadow with his mother always by his side to teach him wrong from right. His mother was the one who brought him up well, and taught him to treat his masters with manners. The first place he was raised, his master knew each horse's feelings, and was affectionate towards them so that they would treat him well also. This great man, though, had to leave due to family matters. Black Beauty was sold to a new man. This master kept his horses in stalls, but yet also knew exactly what his horses wanted, but Black Beauty soon came to realize that not every master is perfect.Black Beauty was lent by to a drunkard. This man did not realize that the horse's shoe was coming off, causing him to go slower, and more cautiously. The drunkard whipped Black Beauty continuously, until they came to a stone side road. The horse's shoe became wedged between two stones, and was pulled off. Next, a sharp stone became shoved into Black Beauty's hoof. His reaction was an intense buck to leave the rider in front of him on the stone road. The man was dead! People came near, but did not blame Black Beauty, because they already knew of the poor judgment of the rider. Black Beauty was pleased with the others' reactions, but felt a tiny bit of remorse. He was able to tell his neighboring horses of his great stories, but was surprised when the others had even more dramatic events occur in their lifetimes. This book is about the events that happen in horses lives, and actually bored me quite a bit. I would not recommend this book as a gift for kids, because they would have a lack of interest for the not-needed details."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"I didn't read the audio book but I read the novel. This book was excellent, it definatly belongs up there with all the classic novels. It makes you think about all the horrible things some horses go through in their lifetimes(like my own horse). No animal deserves abuse or mistreatment no matter how intelligent(horses) or not.FYI, Orrin C. Judd, horses are NOT STUPID!!!! Scientific research has recently discovered that horses' intelligence is the same as dolphins' and chimps' and we all know that dolphins' and chimps' intelligence is extremely close to our own. Research also suggests that horses may actually be smarter and more intelligent and have a more complex reasoning system than could have ever been thought. Of course, horses don't think exactly like humans: they don't judge, they don't hate, they don't lie, they don't cheat; they are honest, loyal, loving and brave-provided they have a person who cares about them, they are all these things and more. It doesn't take a genius to see that horses have very complex personalities and emotions. Sometimes I think my own horse's personality and emotions mirror my own.And all you kids out there who have read or want to read this book, don't listen to this guy. Take it seriously, because mistreatment of any animal is no joke, its a very sesious problem, because people who hurt other people usually start by hurting an animal.P.S. Obviously, Orrin C. Judd never even read the summary for The Black Stallion, because it's about a BOY and a horse, written by Walter Farley, a man who LOVED horses.I recommend ANY horse or animal lover who cares at all about the abuse animals suffer to READ THIS BOOK!!! The abuse animals and people suffer everyday is a very, VERY serious problem, and one we need to think more about. Animals are such innocent creatures, why should they have to suffer for our own ignorance and superior feelings of ourselves?"},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Black Beauty is a great book about a horse and his life. from good masters to bad, happy moments to sad, this book tells it all.

Although it was written many years ago, it stands the test of time, and will be a book that you will think about again and again.Black Beauty tells the story of a horse, and his descent into hard times and mistreatment at the hands of man. Throughout this truly touching book we see things from the point of view of the horse. We meet men, both good and bad. We see selfishness, abuse and neglect. We see that the horse wants little more than to be treated decently. Luckily for Beauty he is reunited with a kind man from his early days.This story is recommended for all ages. While there are some harsh lessons, I feel that this book teaches us to see things from all points of view, including animals."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Anna Sewell originally wrote this book for grooms and horse handlers - NOT CHILDREN!!! It is a heartbreaking tale about animal cruelty narrated from a horse's point of view.The first time I read this book I did so quickly and was eager to know what happens next. However, the second time I picked it up I studied it more carefully and was so moved that I couldn't read through to the end.This book made me so sad and so angry and yet I am glad that I read it because I now have more respect for animals - horses in particular...."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"This book should be a prerequisite for anyone owning a horse as it acts in some ways as kind of owners manual. Since horses are no longer used for everyday transportation and labor however, the book loses some impact, but it is still a very well written and insightful book which captures a period in history where steam engines are just starting to replace horses. The country is on the verge of an industrial revolution and you can feel man's pressure from society to go faster, longer, and harder. Anna Sewell seems troubled that this increased pace may ruin and wear out men as easily as it starts to wear out the horses. The effects on the horses are only a warning to what is to come for man unless something is done. She shows the effects of working 7 day weeks without a rest, as well as 14 hour days. Sewell also mentions many other topics which animal rights supporters have picked up in later years. An example of this would be a few shots she takes at people who do harm to animals out of the sake of fashion without any regard for the animals. She also mentions several scenarios of animal abuse and makes comparisons to child abuse. She believes people who do not stand up when they see injustices are just as guilty as the perpetrators. The horse 'Black Beauty' is given many human qualities which is very effective. I do not know if a modern day book about love of cars would be as effective as the love that is shown in this book for a living animal. On a side note, I'd be curious what Anna Sewell's opinion would have been on euthanasia. Whenever she mentions horses getting old and unable to do their work, several times she says it would be better for them to be put out of their misery with a bullet to the head. This is a little disturbing to me since these horses all have such human characteristics. Overall though the thing that comes through the most is Anna Sewell's sincere love of these animals."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Black Beauty is a black horse that is sold to many horse owners. He lives a horrible and also an exciting life. He was born in a wealthy enviroment. However, his mistress becomes seriously ill, and Black Beauty is sold. He goes along well until he is resold again. Unfortunately, this owner is cruel. Eventhough Black Beauty was born from a kind master, he soon realizes that not all people are like that. He finds out that some are careless and cruel masters. He finally lands into cart-pulling in the streets of London. FOr the final time, he is sold to a young man named Joe Green. This was his recent master that Black Beauty met when Joe was just 13 years old. Black Beauty stays there for the rest of his life.I actually really liked and enjoyed this book. I liked it because I think that it teaches us about life somtimes. Like Black Beauty, sometimes when we have a roof over our heads with plenty of food, we do not realize how hard and difficult it is when we are poor. Black Beauty learned this when he was sold to a cruel master other then a kind master. Some of the masters are so cruel, but no matter what, Black Beauty always tries his hardest to accomplish it. This is somewhat related to our life. Eventhough it writes about a life of a horse, I really think that this book teaches many morals that can really relate to our everyday life.My favorite part is when he is at the auction. It gave me a cliff hanger that wanted me to read on. At the auction, he is at the broken down and trodden part of the fair. Black Beauty looks around and sees all these old horses, he pities him and he thinks that he does not belong here. This part made me realize that sometimes people do that at school. At the auction Black Beauty is bought by a farmer that sees that Black Beauty was born from a good breeding ground.

At the time that \\"Black Beauty\\" was written the owners were abusing the animals in any way you can think of. Anna Sewell sure did not think that way, she felt that animals should be taken care of like a family members. Anna Sewell heard the cries of the animals and decided to get the word out to the people. Anna Sewell decided to write a book about an animal, she decided to write a book about a strong young horse named Black Beauty. Anna Sewell titled the book \\"Black Beauty\\". Black Beauty is a novel about a gorgeous black horse. Black Beauty is described as being a young, solid, black houses that is kind and loving on the inside. From the beginning Black Beauty is abused by it's owners. Every time Black Beauty tries to show its owner respect and that the fact that it loves its owner Black Beauty gets punished for something that no one understands. Black beauty is treated like nothing more than a peace of dirt. Its owner does not care what so ever happens to the horse, they hardly give the horse food and somewhat a little bit of water. Every now and than Black Beauty gets sold to a different owner no better then the last one before. Second owner seemed to be a little more open minded and actually bothered to give the horse food and water every day, but as old times the horse began to be abused by the new owner and the family member s as well. Only people who could afford a horse at the time were the very rich people who are known to care less then others most of the time. So after a while the owners seemed to get tired of the and just care less for it. As time passed Black Beauty became tired and began the habit of throwing off amateur riders. Because of that habit Black Beauty was sold again. This time to a lovely lady who really wonted to help the horse. She took care of Black Beauty like it was one of her own family members. She brushed Black Beauty every day and never kept it cold, she also never kept Black Beauty in hunger and loneliness. Black Beauty was promised never to be sold again, and has nothing to fear of. All the troubles were over for him now. Now he could stand under the apple trees with his old friends and not have to think about what is going to happen next tomorrow in its life. Recommendation: I recommend this book to teenagers because it is a very interesting book to read, it can also teach a few lessons about life."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Black Beauty was an exelent book by Anna Sewell!

I still love it, and I still cry when I read it. No, it is not the best crafted book I have ever read. But it still teaches us great things about love, and caring, and fate and suffering. I can't wait my daughter to grow up for us to read &quot;Black Beauty&quot; together."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"We often talk about teaching children values, but in most cases children's literature is insipid and of no lasting value. BLACK BEAUTY, however, is both valuable as art and valuable for the virtues it teaches: kindness, common sense, and helping those who cannot help themselves. The book is well written in clean prose. It does not over reach the &quot;reading child,&quot; nor does it talk down to him. And although it is touching and occasionally sad, it is not in the least sentimental.The story, of course, is about Black Beauty, a handsome horse who is born and raised in happy circumstances. But in Victorian England horses were used much as we use cars today: they were things to be bought and sold and then gotten rid of when they were no longer useful. Black Beauty is first sold to a good home, but as time passes he is sold again and again--and not always to people who treat him kindly or even to those who give him common care.There are adventures aplenty, like a stable fire and a dangerous bridge; there are many memorable characters, like the horse Ginger and the kind cabbie Jerry. All of them are seen from Black Beauty's point of view, and beautifully, perfectly described. My mother read this book to me, and as soon as I could I was anxious to read it myself; now, some thirty years later I have stumbled once more upon it. And I can honestly say that it lives up to my memory: it is a fine book, and one that every parent should place in the hands of their children. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"This is a beautiful chapter book for a child who is reading at around a 5th grade level to read alone. Black Beauty is a classic. We all know that it tells the life story of an English riding horse from his own point of view. What can be harder to remember is how deftly it teaches children about the importance of kindness to their fellow creatures.During the course of his lifetime, Beauty experiences the best and the worst humanity has to offer its companion animals. Children old enough to read this book will just be developing the kind of empathy skills necessary to understand how important kindness is, even, and perhaps especially, to those who cannot verbalize their gratitude.The book teaches kids to notice how they and their peers treat others, and I have been buying it for all of the kids in my life for as long as I can remember.I particularly like this edition because it is unabridged (the story is perfect), and because the illustrations are enchanting. I'd give it a hundred stars if I could."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Since pictures &amp; illustrations are as much a part of a child's imagination as the written word, then this book beautifully combines both, with the abundant B&amp;W line illustrations by illustrator Lucy Kemp-Welch, in addition to the 12 colour plates included - all in keeping with the time period this novel is set in. A wonderful edition to any child's library.I've been reading horse-topic related books for as long as I can remember; but the very 1st horse story that left an indelible impression on me was ANNA SEWELL's &quot; BLACK BEAUTY &quot;.It really openend my eyes as to the abuse and cruelty - and majestic fraility - that these wonderful creatures suffer at the hands of their human counterparts.Ms Sewell opted to write this book from &quot; the horse's point of view &quot; and she was one of the very few authors that was able to pull this off with such great success.This book also, laid the cornerstone for the ASPCA aims and goals, and brought to light the conditions and treatment of working horses in 20th century London, England ( and elsewhere ).The story is such a wonderful tale of a horse's life from start to finish; told with a quiet dignity and warmth - and serves as a successful analogy also, as to how humans should interact with one another.This book also laid the cornerstone for my interest and love of horses, and further spurred my interest in reading about all things Equine.From there, and I went on to read all of Walter Farley's &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; series ( I used to collect the hardcover editions), and Marguerite Henry's books, and National Velvet(which really wasn't about a horse per se, but more about a little girl who's dreams come true), and anything else I could get my horsey-hungry hands on!I now keep a copy of Anna Sewell's &quot;Black Beauty&quot; in my library at home, and have given a copy to my daughter to read.This is a tale that sensitizes the reader to the plight of horses at the hands of their human caregivers, trainers, etc - all told from the horse's mouth ( so to speak )..!And lest we think that the inhumane treatment of horses has abided since this book was written - one only has to follow the controversy surrounding the use of &quot;Premarin&quot;, or abusive training methods of gaited horses, or the Thoroughbred racing industry, or rodeo...etc.There is still much to be gleaned about the exploitation and abuse of animals from this book - which will always remain a timeless classic.Kim C. Montreal, 05/2000"},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Because it is a well-known classic and a children's perennial favorite, many people do not realize that \\"Black Beauty\\" is an impassioned plea for animal rights, written at a time when such a notion was dismissed as ridiculous. And because it is what it is, sensitive children may need a parent to explain that, thankfully, most of the abuses described in the book are long gone, thanks in part to crusaders like Anna Sewell.In a story that takes place in 19th century England, a gorgeous glossy black colt, who comes to be known as Black Beauty, is born into a life of comfort and kindness. His life is a kind of horsey paradise, until the fortunes of his owners turn...and Black Beauty is sold.Sold to a cruel owner as a cab horse, Beauty is now treated as so many hapless animals were in his day...he is virtually tortured. He is in constant pain. His knees are sore. He is made to wear a \\"check rein,\\" a device that no longer exists, but which scares me to this day because of the impression its description made upon me as a child. It was a type of rein that forced the horse to keep his head up extremely high at an unnatural angle, the more to look \\"elegant.\\" The pain that this rein inflicts upon Beauty is heartbreaking, and it did indeed break my heart to read it.Along the way, Beauty meets other horses, and keeps a lifelong friend, Ginger, who also suffers. Everything comes out alright in the end, in a story that is so tender and yet meaningful at the same time, that it is a shame it is relegated by reputation to the backwaters of so-called \\"children's literature.\\" It was pure muckracking, in the style of the great American muckrakers who came shortly thereafter. Will a child realize this? It's hard to know, but I know that as a child I was simply haunted by the described cruelty to this horse. And of course heartened by the ending. But I have to say that, many decades later, some of the cruelty in this book still upsets me.Therefore, I recommend the book with a caveat: If you have a particularly sensitive or thoughtful child, please warn him or her that Black Beauty is mistreated in the story, but that because of the book, and others like it, such mistreatment of animals no longer exists. And then let your child enjoy the sheer wealth of detail in what really is, in the end, a beautiful story."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Black Beauty is a classic read for any animal lover, however, this is a fact based novel, with vivid descriptions of the various abuses of man upon horse which are still carried on in some forms to this day. At the time this was written, horses were often overloaded and used up before going to the knackers.Really helps get you inside a horse's life and will change how you look at horses and how they are treated, but not for very young children as this is unabridged.I would highly recommend this on so many levels, from the lovely vintage language to the insight into a horse's life and training."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Animal books that are told from the creature's point of view (whether cat, dog, horse, or some other species entirely) are a dime a dozen these days, but \\"Black Beauty,\\" was the first book of its kind to use this technique and is thus the forerunner to all animal stories that came after it. Most people are unaware that Anna Sewell broke new literary ground when she wrote \\"Black Beauty\\" in the style of an autobiography, though ironically she never meant it to be a children's story at all. Instead she intended that it would be read by those that work with horses: \\"to induce kindness, sympathy, and an understanding treatment of horses.\\"Beauty is one of several names given to the horse that grows throughout the story from a young colt in a farmyard to an elderly stallion enjoying his retirement, chronicling all his experiences in between, both good and bad. These include being the horse of a squire, a cabby, a gentleman and a cart driver among others, as well as events that are probably known even to those who haven't read the book, such as the fire in the barn and the washed-out bridge.Throughout his life he meets several other horses such as cheerful Merrylegs and feisty Ginger who recount their stories to him; and it's difficult not to get a little choked up when it comes to Ginger and her tragic tale, especially when she tells Beauty at their final meeting: \\"you are the only friend I ever had.\\" For many children, Ginger's story may well have been their first experience with the portrayal of death in a story - I know it was mine, and I never forgot it.Since being published in 1877, the story has lost none of its power, and the image of a black horse with a white star on his forehead is universally recognized as the iconic Black Beauty. Not only this, but the novel is credited with driving the bearing rein out of fashion, a device that was popular in the Victorian age but which damaged horses' necks by forcing them upright at an unnatural angle, and is also believed to have made a difference in reducing the taxicab licence fee of the time, (something that was often exploited by those that hired out cabbies to drivers), not to mention heightening the awareness of animal cruelty at a time when animal welfare simply didn't exist.As such \\"Black Beauty\\" can be described as the first animal rights book, told in first-person narrative from the (literal) horse's mouth, criticizing things such as docking (that is, cutting off horse's tails), the aforementioned bearing reins, and the long, hard hours of work that horses had to endure. The trick of it though, is that the issues never seem particularly moralizing or heavy-handed because it's all told by the horses themselves. It doesn't take much of a stretch of the imagination to assume that if horses were capable of talking to each other, they would discuss the cruelties and kindnesses that human beings mete out upon them.This is effectively portrayed by the sheer confusion of the animals as to why humans act in certain ways; such as Beauty pondering why human beings endanger both themselves and their horses in fox hunting, or why so much pain is inflicted on animals for the sake of fashion, asking: \\"What right have they to torment and disfigure God's creatures?\\" Likewise, the first-person narrative gives a perspective on the life of a horse that had probably never occurred to Sewell's original audience (or indeed, her first-time contemporary readers), has when Beauty discusses how it feels to wear a bit:\\"Those who have never had a bit in their mouths cannot think how bad it feels. A great piece of cold hard steel as thick as a man's finger is pushed into one's mouth, between one's teeth and over one's tongue. It ends come out at the corner of your mouth and are held fast there by straps over your head, under your throat, round your nose, and under your chin, so that in no way in the world can you get rid of the nasty hard thing.\\"Towards the end of the book, it does start to get slightly more preachy, mainly due to the fact that Sewell begins to dwell on issues such as alcohol, elections and religion that have no bearing on the horses at all, but are merely being discussed by the humans around them. However, this aspect is thankfully minor and doesn't detract too much from Beauty's own story.I have a particular soft-spot for \\"Black Beauty\\" considering Anna Sewell is lurking up in my family tree somewhere (on my grandmother's side), and the fact that the memories of reading this book as a child have always stayed with me. This is an essential book for any children's library in order to cultivate empathy for the animal kingdom, but is also valuable reading for an adult as well, not just for the ur-example of an animal tale, but as a thoughtful, bittersweet and well-researched look into the life of man's second-best friend."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"What girlhood would be complete without reading this tearjerker classic? As a child, there wasn't much I loved more than books, horses and a good cry -- and this provided all three.For those of you who don't know the story, Black Beauty is horse in England during the 19th century. He begins life with a loving master, but due to circumstances is sold several times -- to owners both kind and cruel.Sewell, a Quaker woman, wrote this book (first published in 1877) to enlighten the public. Horses at the time were often beaten, starved and overloaded. Sewell's book, however, became a catalyst for change and ushered in a new way of thinking about the treatment of animals."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"\\"Black Beauty,\\" written by author Anna Sewell, is one of the most famous horse books during the nineteenth century. Part of its achievement consists that the novel is a classic for people with many different characteristics. First published in 1877, \\"Black Beauty\\" continues to enjoy people for new generations of American citizens around the world. Anna Sewell's brilliant account of animal treatment became a historic breakthrough because it was the first book that described a horse's experience in England. \\"An autobiography of a young stallion,\\" this book follows the life of Black Beauty. Throughout the novel, it is told in a creative first person form, as if Beauty was describing and narrating his life. Ms. Sewell chose to write this book from the \\"horses point of view,\\" and she remarkably was able to succeed with her novel. Since Sewell intended on writing this novel in Beauty's point of view, the reader begins to understand the impact of good and treatment towards the horse and his loyal friends. Starter of the Humane Society, the author truly captivates readers with this autobiography of a beautiful, friendly, loving black stallion. In a letter to her friend, Sewell expresses that she hopes \\"Black Beauty will induce kindness, sympathy, and understanding treatment towards horses.\\" From Beauty's happy, enjoyable youth to his pleasant retirement, Anna Sewell ingeniously wrote the book to remind the cruel treatment in the 1800's. Most importantly, Sewell wrote the book in a time where horses were not given the same respect today, and \\"Black Beauty\\" helped to open the eyes of many to the cruelty horses had to suffer. Although Anna Sewell's classic paints a clear picture of the society in London, England, its message is universal and timeless: animals will serve humans well if they are treated with consideration and kindness."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"This is a classic and I wouldn't dissuade anyone from reading it if they want.

My only criticism is that, from time to time, other horses get to tell their stories too, and it is difficult to tell which one is speaking. This makes the book hard to follow, particularly if the reader is a child. The book also makes overmuch use of the flashback. I am told that the book did as much as anything to discourage the use of the bearing rein (check rein) in England; if that is true, it accomplished a good deal indeed."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Anna Sewell said she wanted to write a (good) book about horses because she was upset that some people treated horses cruelly and hoped it would change the way people treated horses.

The detail of human relationships and modes of travel, etc. in the time period are an enjoyable bit of history.The hero is most admirable, undergoing difficulty and responding correctly. Whereas White Fang would tear to pieces anyone who mistreated him, Black Beauty suffers in silence as a true hero should--because it takes more courage to accept wrongful blows than it does to stand up for yourself whether you deserve the treatment or not. Black Beauty teaches other excellent principles about the treatment of animals in general and was probably very influential on people who stand up for the \\"rights\\" of animals these days; they have missed the point of Black Beauty. Beauty himself was taught by his mother that a horse should submit to even a bad master, and others in the book make the point that animals should be treated kindly not because they have rights, but because they belong to God.Black Beauty shows the importance of having sympathy for suffering friends, joy for fortunate ones, and of holding onto one's hopes. Though the gentle protagonist loses many friends, he is reunited with others, reinforcing the traditional ideas of good triumphs over evil.This book is appropriate for all those who are old enough to read literature more advanced than See Spot Run. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"I give Black Beauty a really good review because this book is a really good book of courage, will to live, and horses.

This classic could be placed in the category of one of the most thrilling and adventurous books of all time. The author Anne Sewell, who has so much compassion towards horses, shows in this novel how cruel men can be towards them or on the other hand how people can understand horses and treat them well.After his birth, Black Beauty learned how to be a fine horse and to do his work properly. At a certain age, like all horses, he was sold. With sadness he left his mother and his first master, but he knew it was time for him to go to work. With his mother's advice \\"Do your work with a good will and lift your feet up well when you trot\\" he walked off with his new master. This was his second of many.Over the years Black Beauty endured mean masters as well as good ones, but he never failed. He kept beautiful souvenirs in his mind while he grew up and grew stronger. Black Beauty became a handsome black horse.One day, during his stay with his second master, the grange where Black Beauty and the other horses lived caught fire. Huge flames roared through the grange threatening all of the horses. Will Back Beauty survive the flames, all of those harsh, cruel, severe owners and all the hard work? Will he, one day, go back to his first home and be reunited with all his friends?This book is suitable for children of ages 9 to 12 and even adults could read and enjoy it.

The main characters are black beauty, some dogs, and some other horses. The things that the animals did in the story were to hang out with their friends.

My favorite character is the little horse because no one would lease to him. I have done some of the things and felt the same things that the characters do like when on one would listen to me.I like this book because there are wild horses in the story. My favorite part of the story is when the little horse finally got to speak to everyone.

He has been sold three times! It is pretty hard to be broken in in what the people want you to do three different times. He has been whipped many times. I would think that would hurt getting whipped like that all the time. He has been in a dirty sable for a long time now. But finally at the end someone bought him and he had a great life after all.

IT follows the life and experience of a horse named Black Beauty. The horse is born on a farm and sold at the age of four. His first owner Squire Gordon is a great loving man.

A loving and gentle man finally purchases Black Beauty. He cares about the horses and treats them well. Black Beauty is finally happy as a carriage horse when tragedy strikes. His owner is struck with illness and is forced to sell the horse. Black Beauty is sold to a poor owner and is neglected. He longs to go back home to squire Gordon&#65533;s farm and live a happy life once again.The book is uniquely enough from the horse&#65533;s point of view. This helps children connect with the horse, and makes the book more interesting and easy to follow along with. The heart breaking tale of a horse&#65533;s life that will readers leave on the edge of their seat wanting to keep reading, dying to find out what happens next. The book goes into detail about how animal abuse used to be in the early 1900&#65533;s. Older children have and will continue to enjoy this book for generations to come."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"This book is a very good book! I enjoyed it very much. And horse lover or non-horse lover would love this book. I've read this book and seen the movie-they are both great. I would recommend this book to you. If you wanna know more-just read this book. And I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Black Beauty is an amazing story. It tells the hardships of horse and makes you feel for them. Horses are just like humans in this book. Sometimes they are treated good and sometimes they are treated bad. We all grow older and come across hardships. We all have to fight through them and get over the problems and this book shows that. Black Beauty has amazing courage and even though he is a horse we should all follow after him because of the courage and the vision of life he has. It is an amazing story and I reccomend this book to all ages."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"On the face of it , this book is just another childrens story. Yet now that we are in a more \\"enlightened\\" period of horsemanship (Parelli, Lyons, Roberts etc.) it is astonishing to find a book written decades before modern Natural Horsemanship was even created! Bringing up a horse with love, care and kindness were all virtues suggested, and examples were given on how to do this (don't tie the head up, rub down your horse after a hard days work). It also gives examples of what happens to a horse when it is mistreated. And all this was written in a time where horses were mere methods for transportation, rarely more. If you havn't read this book as an adult horse owner, perhaps you should, the lessons are just as valid today."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Black Beauty is a beautiful classic by Anna Sewell.

Black Beauty's mom is an old horse but see knows what she speaks is true.

Black Beauty faces a lot of struggles throughout this book. The setting takes place in a rural area. Early on his horseshoe falls off on the road,and he keeps falling down and people want him to pull a taxi. He is so beat up,and his knees are all riped up, it is just awful. He has been sold three times! It is pretty hard to be broken in in what the people want you to do three different times. He has been whipped many times. I would think that would hurt getting whipped like that all the time. He has been in a dirty sable for a long time now. But finally at the end someone bought him and he had a great life after all. I learned that the nicer you are to an animal or person, the nicer they are to you. I thought it was a well written book. I'm in fourth grade and the author used wonderful voice and desriptions so I could \\"see and feel\\" the action in the story.

When Beauty is misused as well as other horses, that is the part that makes me sad. Horses are so sensitive and should be treated with love and care."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Black Beauty is the best book ever. It is about a horse who has a hard life. His friends die, and he goes from owner to owner. This story would have gotten the Newbury Award if they had one in 1877. This book was good because it was never boring in the middle. Anna Sewell knew a lot about horses, since they were her only way of getting around. Some of it is kind of gross but it is an all around good book. In the end there is a suprise ending. It is a really good book."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"I thought Black Beauty was a great book because it teaches some good lessons, like patience and a willingness to work hard. This horse had a truly pious soul and through the kind and cruel masters, whether he was loved or unloved, he always did his best and struggled to do his duty faithfully and completely. He was humble and timid and it was heart warming to hear him speak of always having to try his best and serve his master well. It was so sad at times when he thought of his mother and when he pictured aloud what he had seen other poor horses go through. This book brings some tears but it is a truly wonderful book rooted deep in reality."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"A sad, entertaining story about love, friendship, pain, and finding a home.

Her name was Duchess, but he often called her pet.''So begins the story of Black Beauty. A young, handsome horse Black Beauty gets his name from his dark color and the one white star on his forehead. His journey starts on a plantation with his loving mother, Duchess and kind owner. At first Black Beauty is a colt spending his lazy days in the pasture sleeping by the shade of trees and munching on grass, but as Black Beauty gets older and he gets sold for the first time leaving his mother and old friends behind he begins on a journey filed with adventure, friendships, and hardships.Black Beauty is a wonderful classic fit for any age. this book is filled with great writing and loveable characters. You won't ever want to put it down. I know I didn't."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Of all the books I read when I was a child, Black Beauty stands out as one of the most inspiring and most remembered. Every child should have an opportunity to read it for within its pages so many things are taught and experienced. It is one book that allows a child to live and understand and consider the world through the eyes of an animal. To read it is to allow development of compassion for others and animals. Buy this one for your child.

It gave me an insight of how horses see us humans. It makes you think of how animals have feelings too like us, which we seldom think of them and take them for granted.

Some friends of mine also don't!Thanks to Amazon, now I can read it all, and also watch it all, since I ordered the DVDs from Amazon also. If you have the time, pay attention to what Caroline Thompson had done, writting this play for the screen.Anna Sewell's text is very strong, though enchanting. Her only play is, nonetheless, a Master Work [I keep on thinking how many times had she write and rewrite the play on pieces of paper, back in 1871, without a Text Editor on a LapTop! In a world full of Technology, it is very pleasant to pause and read a text like this one].The precise details of the story, the subtleties gathered from the environment, the way of living of people at that time, the role played by all the main characters of the play, children, men and women, and most of all, all the emotions related to humans and animals sharing the same place at the same time back then, tells us how attentive a person Anna Sewell was."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Black Beauty by Anna Sewell is a heartwarming tale about a gallant horse that goes through many changes in his life. His name, home, and treatment changes each time he is sold. Black Beauty has many owners, good and bad, some avaricious and rueful, some kind and compassionate. He meets many horses along the way, all in which he finds a friend, and hears their story. This horse goes from a clueless pony, to a strong, brave stallion. I recommend this book for people who have been wistful for a story from a quite different perspective. This novel by Anna Sewell is truly a classic."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Black Beauty is an excellent book. It stays true to what horses at that time would go through and is very realistic. I as a horse person find everything true. Though it is realistic Black Beauty is almost human in his observations and feelings. Anna Sewell really sculpts her character so that you forget he is a horse and think of him more as a living breathing intelligent being."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Based on our reading of the first two chapters, this is a book that is both good and sad. Black Beauty's mother gave very good advice. The death of one of his mother's friends was tragic, as was the death of the rider. We look forward to reading the rest of the book, and we hope Black Beauty has a happy life! I am writing on behalf of a group of special young men and women who are students at the French Creek Elementary School in French Creek, WV."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"I like horses and the color black and Black Beauty is my favorite book and one of the best novels by Anna Sewell. He is a beautiful black animal with a white star on his forehead and one white foot and in the novel of Black Beauty, Black Beauty's white foot was usually always on the back in the left and another second best of Black Beauty's white foot was on the front in the right and that's where I like to see Black Beauty's white foot and it's perfect for the best on the front in the right, and the two hind legs on the left and the right and that's how you like Black Beauty and the best choices.My favorite character in this book is Joe Green, because at the end of Black Beauty, Joe becomes a man and one lucky day, he finds that horse he used to care for and gets excited when he said he had almost killed him so many nearly ten years ago at Squire Gordon's farm after coming back from the Doctor's. This is the best one illustrated by Scott McKowen because there is five black and white illustrations in this book of Black Beauty as a colt with his mother Duchess, Rob Roy or a differnt horse either on a hunt or Lady Anne on Black Beauty, Black Beauty getting shoes for the first time, A kind man leads Black Beauty to his new home and Black Beauty as a cab horse and if there were some other 2 illustrations for this book that would be part of in with illustrated in black and white by Edwin John Prittie and 4 color illustrations by Edward F. Cortese and Going for the Doctor by Percy F. Spence of 7 black and white illustrations and 5 color illustrations in this book, that would make it the best but...there would be like some of the best seven Full Page Illustrations that would be best for the Scott McKowen part of in with some of Edward F. Cortese and some of Edwin John Prittie and Percy F. Spence are:One of the riders was getting out of the water, covered with mud the other lay quite still color illustration by Edward F. Cortese\\"The children did not know when they had enough, so I just pitched them off backwards\\" black and white illustration by Edwin John PrittieSafe in the yard, he slipped the scarf off my eyes and shouted, \\"Here, somebody! take this horse while I go back for the other\\" color illustration by Edward F. CorteseGoing for the doctor color illustration by Percy F. SpenceWith scarcely a pause Lizzie took the leap, stumbled among the rough clouds, and fell color illustration by Edward F. Cortese\\"My dear master was cheering on his comrades when one of the balls, whizzing close to my head, struck him\\" color illustration by Edward F. CorteseMy groom began patting me as if he were quite overjoyed at seeing me again black and white illustration by Edwin John PrittieThat was talking about two of the black and white illustrations by Edwin John Prittie, the four color illustrations by Edward F. Cortese and Going for the doctor by Percy F. Spence and that would make it just for the perfect book illustrated by Scott McKowen if you imagined it in your head to make it go with the book, plus this Black Beauty book is very much easier to be in of Scott McKowen of the five black and white illustrations of Duchess the white horse with Black Beauty the colt in a red background, hunter or Lady Anne in a black top hat, white shirt, brown riding jacket, black leather gloves, brown dress and tall black leather riding boots on a different horse or Black Beauty in a blue background, blacksmith in a light blue shirt, light brown apron, brown pants and short black leather boots shoeing Black Beauty in a pink background, A kind man in a brown cap, white shirt of his sleeves pushed up, plaid vest of green and black, black leather gloves, brown riding pants and tall black leather riding boots leads Black Beauty to his new home in a yellow background and a driver in a black derby hat, white shirt, black vest, black jacket and black pants and probably has a blanket over him driving Black Beauty with two passengers of one of a man in a white shirt, black bowtie, black suit jacket and black pants and a girl in a black hat, green shirt, and grey pants are in a purple background, as for out of this book just to tell you of what clothes they would wear and they are John Manly the coachman in a brown cap or a black top hat, white shirt, black vest, brown riding jacket, beige riding pants and tall black leather riding boots, then James Howard the stableboy in a green shirt, brown vest, brown jacket, light green scarf, grey pants, spats and short black leather boots, then Lady Anne in a black top hat, white shirt, brown riding jacket, black leather gloves, brown dress and tall black leather riding boots, and then for the final in My Last Home when Joe Green becomes a man, Joe would be in a brown cap, white shirt, black vest, beige riding pants and tall black leather riding boots with brown tops when he recognizes its Black Beauty and that that's very perfect for some of the best seven black and white and color illustrations that would've been great if it was in the Scott McKowen book and thank goodness it is part of it and I am using my imagination as I read the book for the few favorite characters of John Manly the coachman, James Howard the stableboy, Lady Anne and when Joe Green becomes a man at the end and that's what it always means a lot to me for this best book of Black Beauty illustrated by Scott McKowen.This book of Black Beauty - Illustrated by Scott McKowen reminds me of DVD movies on Bonanza, Vol. 7: Silent Thunder/The Last Trophy/The Hopefuls/The Spanish Grant, Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again, Disney's The Pacifier, Virginia's Run, City Slickers, Jeopardy!: An Inside Look At America's Favorite Quiz Show starring Alex Trebek because of episode 3. Ultimate I: Anyone's Game in Ultimate Finals, and the 2006 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo (Wrangler NFR), for this year in Las Vegas, Nevada and that's what this means to me, a lot. I loved and enjoyed this book of Black Beauty and it's the best book ever to look at over and over again and live with that easy one by Scott McKowen so you'll have great effort into this book and this Black Beauty book illustrated by Scott McKowen also goes with the DVD of an animated version of Black Beauty with actors David Gregory and Barbara Stevens.For this book of Black Beauty illustrated by Scott McKowen (where Beauty's white foot is on the front in the right) to make this go good and great with the animated DVD version of \\"Black Beauty\\" (Hanna-Barbera Productions) with David Gregory, in this Black Beauty book illustrated by Scott McKowen, Black Beauty is Anna Sewell's beloved story of a sweet tempered horse born and raised in the English countryside. Taught by his mother to always be a friend to man, Beauty lives happily with his master Squire Gordon and the stableman John Manly. Beauty soon learns that the world can be a harsh place when he becomes the property of several owners who use him as a job horse, pulling cabs and heavy loads through city streets. Beauty endures this through his unyielding courage and lives out the rest of his life in meadow where he was born. At the end of the book, Black Beauty comes into the care of Joe Green with three kind ladies and Joe Green is proud to be home with him again.My other favorite Black Beauty books with the one Illustrated by Scott McKowen is the other best eight are Illustrated by Neil Reed: Published by Prospero books in 2001, Illustrated by Ian Andrew, Adapted by June Brigman and Roy Richardson, Retold by Lisa Church and Illustrated by Lucy Corvino, Illustrated by William Geldart and Illustrated by G. P. Micklewright and that's my best new favorite eight books of Black Beauty to live and read with but, the real ones I would be in for the ones I like are Illustrated by Neil Reid published in 2001 by Prospero books, Illustrated by Scott McKowen (which is the easiest one to live with, because of the five black and white illustrations which are great and good and much easier), Illustrated by Ian Andrew, Adapted by June Brigman and Roy Richardson, Retold by Lisa Church and Illustrated by Lucy Corvino, Illustrated by William Geldart and G. P. Micklewright and that's the best seven books to be in of Black Beauty.Another two favorites of Black Beauty I like are his white foot on the back in the left and three white feet of one on the front in the right and the two in the hind right and left and that's three different favorites I like of Black Beauty and where his white foot will be.Examples of my favorite horse of Black Beauty in different ten books of his white foot are:Black Beauty's white foot on the back in the left in the five different books of Adapted by Laura F. Marsh, Illustrated by Neil Reed: Published by Prospero books in 2001, Illustrated by Ian Andrew, Adapted by June Brigman and Roy Richardson, Retold by Lisa Church and Illustrated by Lucy Corvino. So that's where I would like to see Black Beauty's white foot on the back in the left.Black Beauty's white foot on the front in the right in the different books of Illustrated by Scott McKowen and Illustrated by G. P. Micklewright. So that's where I would like to see Black Beauty's white foot on the front in the right.Black Beauty with three white feet of one on the front in the right and the two in the hind right and left in the specail book Illustrated by William Geldart. So that's where I would see Black Beauty with three white feet so his you would want it on the front in the right, back in the right and the back in the left and if you see one white foot because of the three, you would say the one on the back in the right.Black Beauty is my favorite horse and he would be a great horse for roping and bulldogging as if he could be a perfect rodeo horse.Here's how the Black Beauty books will work out for the two favorite DVD's I like of Black Beauty are the ones by Sean Bean (1994) and directed by Caroline Thompson and the animated one with David Gregory and that's the best two to watch over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.Black Beauty (1994) starring Sean Bean DVD is like the novel with the three of the books on three different Black Beauty books of Adapted by Laura F. Marsh, DK Readers: Black Beauty (Level 4: Proficient Readers) (Paperback) adapted by Caryn Jenner and illustrated by Victor Ambrus, and Illustrated by James Needham and because those three different books of Black Beauty would go great with the movie as the three matched up and go. The one illustrated by James Needham for sure goes great with the movie because of his white foot on the back in the left.Black Beauty with actor David Gregory in the animated DVD is like the novel with the two of the books on two different Black Beauty books of Illustrated by Scott McKowen and Illustrated in colour by G. P. Micklewright would go great with the animated DVD version as the two matched up and go. The one illustrated by Scott McKowen for sure goes great with the animated movie because of his white foot on the front in the right and that's how it would be for the animated version.Well, I gotta say, now that I love the best eight Black Beauty books, instead of ten which was way too much, I wanted to find a way just to live with eight and that was a better well mount and that's how I could make my living by some of the Cortese and Prittie and Spence for the Scott McKowen book by imagination and that was the best book I ever read which showed me how to treat horses with respect and kindness.This book should be perfect and great for the 2006 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo (NFR) in Las Vegas, Nevada to show how cowboys in the NFR should treat their horses with respect to train roping horses how to rope and wrestle calves or steers.I loved, liked and enjoyed this book.It is a GEM, I loved it and it's the greatest novel of all times of the greatest horse story ever told.What a great book I ever read if some of the cowboy art of paintings of \\"HH \\"Slim\\" Hill circa 1920 Calgary Stampede\\" by artist Gail Guenther as if on the front cover of a book, \\"Caught in the Open\\" by J. Swanson, \\"Bronc Rider\\" by Colette Pitcher, \\"Jerkin' The Slack\\" by Rick Timmons and \\"Steer Wrestler\\" by Colette Ptcher and one pencil drawing of \\"Calf Roping (6)\\" by Virgil C. Stephens and that's how those cowboy art go good with this Black Beauty book by Scott McKowen of rodeo events of saddle bronc riding, team roping, steer wrestling and calf roping. For the roping, the two cowboys of one is on a ranch as they are team roping to catch a steer for branding as the header ropes the horns by three swings and the heeler ropes the hind legs by four swings, then the two different calf ropers at rodeos, one cowboy ropes it by one swing and ties up the calf with two wraps and a half hitch and another second cowboy ropes it by two swings and ties up the calf with two wraps and a half hitch and that's how cowboys must learn to rope by treating horses right by reading the book of Black Beauty.Again cowboys and cowgirls, I loved, liked and enjoyed this book.It is a GEM, I loved it and it's the greatest novel of all times of the greatest horse story ever told.

This book was a milestone because few people had ever considered what their carelessness or thoughtlessness did to animals. This book is not only about animal cruely however.

Beautygoes through many masters before she finds her real home. What happens is that sometimes either her master or mistress get very ill or her master travels a lot and does not have enough time to care for her, so they are forced to sell Beauty. Sometimes she ends up with nice masters that treat her fairly and are kind to her, but sometimes she ends up with mean masters that do not care for her and make her work; even when she is not in the conditions to work.Then her second to last master has to sell her, because he bacame very ill (even though he was good to her and loved her very much), but he made sure that Beauty was sold to kind people. Beauty was sold to 3 old ladies. There she was reaquanted with one of her old caretakers, who loved her very much. Beauty was very happy and knew that she was here to stay and that that was her real home now.I thought this was a vey sad story. It explained how a horse's life kept going from better to worse and then back again to better.It tells how even when things are down they can get better.I would reccomend this book to anyone and everyone.It is a very moving story and will be enjoyed by children as wll as grownups.It sends out a very good message: treat others as you would want to be treated."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"It's no wonder this book is still a best seller. Sewell has written a timeless book. It is an unusual book in that the main character is a talking horse, yet it's not positioned in the somewhat cartoon-ish manner that so many children's books with talking animals are. Sewell attempts to place a subtle moral tale within each chapter. She uses man's cruelty or kindness to animals as a lesson for how we humans should treat each other. The overall message, essentially, is that if we are kind to animals, presumably, we will be kind to each other. While the plotline moves at a gentle pace, there is enough action embodied within the overall story that it kept the attention of my two sons throughout. A wonderful escapist read at any age."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"You can't go wrong with a classic.

I have been reading the story from my 1897 copy, described as a \\"new illustrated edition ... sure to command attention.\\" The life of a horse told in the first person is not on every child's reading list these days. It wasn't on mine years ago. This was my first reading. Perhaps I missed this classic because I didn't have the typical young girl's 'love affair with horses'.*BLACK BEAUTY* was written by Anna Sewell, an English invalid whose Quaker beliefs permeate every page. IF kids will read it, I guarantee the preachiness won't injure them! I was surprised to be so moved by the wrongs done to animals -- all the suggestions for treating horses more humanely translate into decent human relations now, as it did then.Amazon.com states the reading level for *Black Beauty* is ages 4-8; maybe only prodigies are to atempt it? Listening to an adult read this story may help children bridge the years since \\"progress\\" brought us the motor car. Black Beauty talks with other horses about good and bad handlers and owners, and discusses all aspects of life (except mating) with friends Ginger and Merrylegs. He mulls over their temperments and his own, and the good influences of reasoning and praise. Unfortunate events caused by cruel check reins, and bits, whips, or being knocked about are part of this story. There are also exciting times of racing for the doctor, being saved from a stable in flames, or a broken bridge, becoming lame from the loss of a horseshoe.I hope you won't avoid this 'classis' but will allow yourself to do some time-traveling by adventuring into the late 1800s. Listen to a horse's wise thoughts over the clatter of hooves in the streets. Later you can look up the LISTMANIA titled \\"You've never heard of a talking horse?\\" and ask with Reviewer mcHAIKU: Did the legendary \\"horse whisperer\\" grow up reading *Black Beauty*?"},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"I first read this book a long time ago - frankly, I don't remember when. It has been several years since then, but it touched me all the same. Currently, I am in the process of re-reading it. That's how good it is! You will want to read it over and over.It begins with Black Beauty as a young colt, born into a good bloodline with racing blood running through his veins. His master was a good one and made sure that the horse became an obedient, noble steed. Unlike many other horses, he was broken in gently to insure years of the loyal service of a beautiful animal.Unfortunately, Black Beauty's life is not all good; like any other horse, he came into the hands of both kind, cold, and simply ignorant masters. Though fiction, it really could've been any horse that went through the life of Black Beauty, and some probably did. At least, horses lived the lives of some in the book, such as those abused or beaten for doing things natural to a horse.This novel was most definately touching and inspiring. It presented several important moral issues. A few include always doing your best, how to NOT \\"look out for number one,\\". and thoughts on how kindness can change a horse... and a person too.Of course, I am somewhat biased, being a Horse in the Chinese Zodiac and a special fan of stories about horses, but all the same - I have taken many of the themes in this book to heart, and truly believe that the world might be a bit nicer if a few others picked up this classic tale of a horse's journey though the harsh reality of life.Read it once! If you don't like it, then that's understandable, I guess.But chances are, you'll love it.And then you'll want to read it again."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"One of the best known books, almost everyone has heard of Black Beauty. The story is told from Black Beauty's point of view giving a totally different view of the world. He has to endure some cruel owners but remains hopeful that someday things will turn out better. One of the sad parts is the death of his over-worked friend 'Ginger'.The hero horse is eventually saved by a kind boy and his grandfather who care for him and restore him to health. It is quite sad in part but does have a happy ending and in its day would have had an effect on the treatment suffered by working horses.Another brilliant book:GODSTONE - THE KAIROS BOXES"},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"\\"Black Beauty,\\" written by author Anna Sewell, is one of the most famous horse books during the nineteenth century. Part of its achievement consists that the novel is a classic for people with many different characteristics. First published in 1877, \\"Black Beauty\\" continues to enjoy people for new generations of American citizens around the world. Anna Sewell's brilliant account of animal treatment became a historic breakthrough because it was the first book that described a horse's experience in England. \\"An autobiography of a young stallion,\\" this book follows the life of Black Beauty. Throughout the novel, it is told in a creative first person form, as if Beauty was describing and narrating his life. Ms. Sewell chose to write this book from the \\"horses point of view,\\" and she remarkably was able to succeed with her novel. Since Sewell intended on writing this novel in Beauty's point of view, the reader begins to understand the impact of good and treatment towards the horse and his loyal friends. Starter of the Humane Society, the author truly captivates readers with this autobiography of a beautiful, friendly, loving black stallion. In a letter to her friend, Sewell expresses that she hopes \\"Black Beauty will induce kindness, sympathy, and understanding treatment towards horses.\\" From Beauty's happy, enjoyable youth to his pleasant retirement, Anna Sewell ingeniously wrote the book to remind the cruel treatment in the 1800's. Most importantly, Sewell wrote the book in a time where horses were not given the same respect today, and \\"Black Beauty\\" helped to open the eyes of many to the cruelty horses had to suffer. Although Anna Sewell's classic paints a clear picture of the society in London, England, its message is universal and timeless: animals were serve humans well if they are treated with consideration and kindness."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Black Beauty by Anna Sewell is a story written from a horse's point of view and it is an excellent story. The main character of the book is a beautiful black horse named Black Beauty who tells his life story. At different points in the book it was quite sad...but it was mostly happy.

From great owners to the worst, from the best moments to the worst moments in his life, this book tells it all, and horse lovers can never stop reading.Black Beauty goes though many adventures like a barn fire crossing a dangerous bridge. He meets a lot of people, and he meets and a lot of horses. Black Beauty will never forget his best friend Ginger. I think this is the best book ever because I saw what this horse went through, not what a person thinks a horse went through."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"This story is about a horse living in the 19th century. The horse, Black Beauty, lives in England. The story is told through the eyes of the horse. Black Beauty shares his life experiences and friendships. During his life, he is sold many times, and he encounters some cruel and good owners.I think this book accomplished the task the author set out to complete. She wanted to alert people to the cruel treatment of horses. The description of the bit in a horse's mouth was eye opening to me. It had to be strange to have an object inserted into one's mouth for the first time. I am not fond of horses. I was thrown off of one as a child. I had tears in my eyes in some parts of this story due to the cruel treatment of the horses."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Black Beauty is the best book ever. It is about a horse who has a hard life. His friends die, and he goes from owner to owner. This story would have gotten the Newbury Award if they had one in 1877. This book was good because it was never boring in the middle. Anna Sewell knew a lot about horses, since they were her only way of getting around. Some of it is kind of gross but it is an all around good book. In the end there is a suprise ending. It is a really good book."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"I got it for $14.93 with shipping and gift wrap. I'm pissed at Amazon for ripping me off. This book is only 3&#34; x 5&#34;. The price of $7.95 is printed on the inside cover. The wrapping was cheap paper with a machine ribbon, no bow. The gift card was glued flat to the ribbon. This is a sham. The owners and managers of Amazon should be punished. Me too for being so stupid. That's what Amazon takes me for, stupid. I deserve this crappy book. Oh yeah, I can return it. Yeah pay more money and waste more time. I'll take my loss. I was gonna save me a real life trip to the bricks and mortar Barnes & Noble store...Amazon not anymore. At least on Ebay you expect to be ripped off. On EBAY you take your chances and hope. You count on EBAY's ratings being a lie. Amazon you lost my business. Send me a $50 no strings gift card and I'll forgive you."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"In a nutshell, Black Beauty's overarching story is about a single horse's experiences though it's life and the accounts that it hears from other horses. But, the underlying (and very repetative) message is this. Alcohol is the ruin of all creatures (aka the \\"Devil's drink\\"), Bearing reins (or \\"the fashion\\") is terrible for horses, overworking yourself (and the horse) will do you more harm than good, and people should be more thoughtful of others (humans and horses).Going into this book, I thought this was going to be an adventure; something akin to Homeward Bound or Benji. But instead, I was subjected to each chapter being a moral lesson in itself. Here is a rundown of how almost every chapter (of which there are nearly 40 -broken into 4 parts-) plays out.1.) An injustice is done to a horse and is either witnessed or detected by another person.2.) Said witness/detector confronts the person committing the injustice and speaks to them about it.3.) Either the person hearing this advice takes heed and makes a commitment to change for the better, suffers some kind of misfortune for continuing their wretched ways, or is reported by the authorities and is fined or jailed.I'm only guessing here, but I think the author possibly designed this book to be read in chapter bites. I only suggest this because reading this book straight through is a grind (to say the least). I seemed to continuously run across the exact same moral lessons being played out in different settings (or by other horses).So would I recommend this book to someone else. No.There is almost nothing redeeming about it.It makes you feel like people -for the most part- are either ignorate, irresponsible, awful, and/or inconsiderate, the repetition of the messages that it's trying to get across is a chore (and in the case of the bearing rein, almost irrelevant), and there isn't really much of a story to even get out of it in the end.Sadly, this is just another \\"Classic\\" that has confused me as to why it's as highly regarded as it is."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Being a classic there is no need to review the story, I think.Like so many of the Amazon free classics, this book is not really optimised for an ereader. The table of contents does not link to the chapters, each new chapter begins in mid page and the chapter heading is in plain text so the whole thing feels like one massive block of text. Granted, it is free, so one should not complain, but it seems like Amazon is missing out on an opportunity here.However, in the end I opted for the Project Gutenberg version [gutenberg.org] which is also free and much more attractive in layout and formatting."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Ordered for my kindle and it is an awesome book to have.

For example, they made horses work nonstop, riding them and not making the horse rest, treating it not like a living thing but a machine.

One reason I loved it was because it was told from the point of view of the horse, Black Beauty. The things that the horse observed and narrated seemed very real to me: the kind of things a horse would observe and be concerned about. By the time I read this book I was already reading a junior edition of the Sherlock Holmes stories, set in the same Victorian time period (although Holmes was a bit later), so I enjoyed being in that world and learning more about the horses who pulled cabs, the drivers, people who owned horses, the abuse of horses, and their rescue. Many other reviewers of this book have observed that Sewell taught people to be kind to others, gentle, and patient, through this story. I agree.I read this book again as an adult and was struck not only by the beauty of Black Beauty's story, but also by the writing, which flows effortlessly.

I thought that Black Beauty was very inspiring, especially in animal cruelty. All the things that said how some people could really treat animals is unbelieveable. The part I like best of this is when he was born and how he always stayed by his mother when he was a colt until he was old enough to hang out with the other colts.Another part that I liked about this book is at the end where he finally found peace in the pasture from his bitter hard life that he had that wore him down. The worst part I disliked about this book was how Ginger(black beauty's obsession)died from being over worked and beaten so many times, that it killed her. Also when a drucken man rode him, and knew that his shoe was falling off, still did and made him go faster so the nail dug into his hoof and knew that it hurted him so badly, and it got so harsh that he fell to the ground on his knees, and cut them up badly.

This book allows you to see an animals perspective of life."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Animal books that are told from the creature's point of view (whether cat, dog, horse, or some other species entirely) are a dime a dozen these days, but \\"Black Beauty,\\" was the first book of its kind to use this technique and thus the forerunner to all animal stories that came after it. Most people are unaware that Anna Sewell broke new literary ground when she wrote \\"Black Beauty\\" in the style of an autobiography, though ironically she never meant it to be a children's story at all. Instead she intended that it would be read by those that work with horses: \\"to induce kindness, sympathy, and an understanding treatment of horses.\\"Beauty is one of several names given to the horse that grows throughout the story from a young colt in a farmyard to an elderly stallion enjoying his retirement, chronicling all his experiences, both good and bad, in between. These include being the horse of a squire, a cabby, a gentleman and a cart driver among others, as well as events that are probably known even to those who haven't read the book, such as the fire in the barn and the washed-out bridge.Throughout his life he meets several other horses such as cheerful Merrylegs and feisty Ginger who recount their stories to him; and it's difficult not to get a little choked up when it comes to Ginger and her tragic tale, especially when she tells Beauty at their final meeting: \\"you are the only friend I ever had.\\" For many children, Ginger's story may well have been their first experience with the portrayal of death in a story - I know it was mine, and I never forgot it.Since being published in 1877, the story has lost none of its power, and the image of a black horse with a white star on his forehead is universally recognized as the iconic Black Beauty. Not only this, but the novel is credited with driving the bearing rein out of fashion, a device that was popular in the Victorian age but which damaged horses' necks by forcing them upright at an unnatural angle, and is also believed to have made a difference in reducing the taxicab licence fee of the time, (something that was often exploited by those that hired out cabbies to drivers), not to mention heightening the awareness of animal cruelty at a time when animal welfare simply didn't exist.As such \\"Black Beauty\\" can be described as the first animal rights book, told in first-person narrative from the (literal) horse's mouth, criticizing things such as docking (that is, cutting off horse's tails), the aforementioned bearing reins, and the long, hard hours of work that horses had to endure. The trick of it though, is that the issues never seem particularly moralizing or heavy-handed because it's all told by the horses themselves. It doesn't take much of a stretch of the imagination to assume that if horses were capable of talking to each other, they would discuss the cruelties and kindnesses that human beings mete out upon them.This is effectively portrayed by the sheer confusion of the animals as to why humans act in certain ways; such as Beauty pondering why human beings endanger both themselves and their horses in fox hunting, or why so much pain is inflicted on animals for the sake of fashion, asking: \\"What right have they to torment and disfigure God's creatures?\\"Likewise, the first-person narrative gives a perspective on the life of a horse that had probably never occurred to Sewell's original audience (or indeed, her contemporary readers), has when Beauty discusses how it feels to wear a bit:\\"Those who have never had a bit in their mouths cannot think how bad it feels. A great piece of cold hard steel as thick as a man's finger is pushed into one's mouth, between one's teeth and over one's tongue. It ends come out at the corner of your mouth and are held fast there by straps over your head, under your throat, round your nose, and under your chin, so that in no way in the world can you get rid of the nasty hard thing.\\"Towards the end of the book, it does start to get slightly more preachy, mainly due to the fact that Sewell begins to dwell on issues such as alcohol, elections and religion that have no bearing on the horses at all, but are merely being discussed by the humans around them. However, this aspect is thankfully minor and doesn't detract too much from Beauty's own story.I have a particular soft-spot for \\"Black Beauty\\" considering Anna Sewell is lurking up in my family tree somewhere (on my grandmother's side), and the fact that the memories of reading this book as a child have always stayed with me. This is an essential book for any children's library in order to cultivate empathy for the animal kingdom, but is also valuable reading for an adult as well, not just for the ur-example of an animal tale, but as a thoughtful, bittersweet and well-researched look into the life of man's second-best friend."},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"Though you can't seem to skip back and forth from chapter to chapter the whole of the book is great"},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","review":"This book is a timeless classic that everyone enjoys.

His initial attraction was his love of Arabian horses, but he eventually acquiired the language and customs of the Ruala tribe. Incredibly violent scenes are described in great detail as he rides in raiding parties and fights gun battles with other tribes. One compelling scene describes the sound of bullets smacking into the chest of his best friend. The food scenes are also not for the faint of heart; you may not want to know what they do with the contents of a dead camel's stomach. There is also much in the book that makes one admire the laws of the desert and the nomadic customs that have evolved. This is not a scientific book or an anthropological text, but it should be of extreme interest to any one who seriously studies these people.

Blacks Tents is a chronicle of his periodic escapades, (which spanned a total of twenty-six years) migrating, hunting, raiding, feasting, and starving amidst the Ruala tribe. Certainly, no modern writer better captured the essence of the vanishing nomadic Arab culture in such nostalgic and wistful terms. Among the many interesting segments found in the book is an account of the only know meteorite shower to have caused human casualties.

Traveling in the Arabian Peninsula shortly before the founding of Saudi Arabia in 1932, Raswan was renowned among the tribes for his deep respect of Bedouin ways, especially horsemanship and horse breed-ing.

Their books are crafted around an outline, a chronology, or an intuition. A story must evolve, a character must draw the reader in. If in structure only, this narrative changes the way you will read fiction. The stories, the chronology, and the manner of which they are used, create an atmosphere that engulfs the reader, teaches the reading mind that life, when witnessed and retold well, is more beautiful than fiction; a new mythology of truth is born.

On page one, the parents announce that they're going to a masquerade party, and tell their Rottweiler, Carl, \\"take good care of the baby.\\" Therein lies the problem. In real life, parents who leave their baby unattended by humans and go off to a party, are guilty of child neglect. But this book presents this scenario as being cute and funny. Adults and older children reading this book can make the distinction that this is inappropriate behavior in real life, but the book's young target audience cannot.Once the parents leave for the party, Carl takes the baby to the same big party, where they get admitted because the greeter at the door thinks they're in costume. Once in the door, the story is told only with pictures. At the party, Carl and the baby (who appears to be about a year old) see many interesting costumes and have fun adventures. The pictures are quite amusing and clever, such as when Carl sees what he thinks is a cat, but is really a human in a cat costume. Visual humor is the book's major strength. Although the baby spots her parents, the parents are always looking the other way and don't see the baby. Carl manages to get the baby home and safe in her crib just before the parents come home.Although I wish I could recommend this beautifully illustrated, clever, humorous book, I simply can't, because of the parents' irresponsible behavior. I just don't count on preschoolers being able to make a distinction that this is a fantasy. Also, it might play on fears they have of being left alone. However, it's worth a quick \\"read\\" for adults and older children to enjoy the clever visual humor of Alexandra Day."},{"Title":"Vladimir Solov'ev: Reconciler and Polemicist (Eastern Christian Studies)","review":"Vladimir Solov'ev: Reconciler and Polemicist by International Vladimir Solov'ev Conference, William Peter Van Den Bercken, Manon De Courten, Evert Van Der Zweerde (Peeters) Vladimir Solov'v (1853-1900) is regarded as the most original and systematic of the Russian philosophers in the 19th century. &#919;e has once again become the subject of international scholarly attention both in Slavic countries and the West.

Assigned to be a reporter in Moscow during Stalin's rule he broke the mold: he, unlike Walter Duranty of the Times, would tell the truth. Initially attracted to the Great Experiment, Lyons soon learned the misery and death suffered by the eggs broken in Lenin's omelet: the NEP men slaughtered when the New Economic Policy fell from favor, the kulaks liquidated as a class, the Ukraine nearly exterminated. Though tragic, Lyons recounts the times with wit and pathos, and with a grasp of English not unlike a cross between Conrad and Nabakov."},{"Title":"Assignment in Utopia","review":"This 1937 publication is an invaluable eye-witness account of the realities of Communism in the Soviet Union during the early 1930s as Stalin was directing the Soviet Union into a dark period of collectivization, state-engineered famine, show trials, and terror (Lyons also just happened to be in Berlin on the way through just as Hitler was taking power in Germany in January 1933, no doubt a frightening experience for a young leftist Jewish intellectual). Lyons wrote this book to expose the realities of what was happening in the USSR to leftist and liberal readers in the United States who, while not Communists, were inclined to be sympathetic to a \\"progressive\\" workers' state at a time when the American economy remained mired in the depths of the Great Depression.Lyons himself had been born to a Jewish family in the old Russian Empire but grew up in the tenement slums of the Lower East Side of New York City. Like many young people of that background and generation, he gravitated to socialism and welcomed not only the collapse of the autocratic and anti-semitic tsarist regime in 1917 but also the emergence of a new radical alternative with the Bolshevik October Revolution. By the early 1920s young Lyons was a journalist and vigorous fellow-travelling propagandist for the Bolsheviks. In 1928, on assignment for United Press International, Lyons had the opportunity to come to the USSR for himself, and from 1928 to 1934 Lyons would not only cover Soviet affairs but would even have the opportunity to meet the great dictator Stalin himself.The account that Lyons gives of this experience is eye-opening. No one today who pays attention can be unaware of Stalin's crimes or the nature of the Communist regime as it evolved in the USSR, and yet even today, more than 70 years after the book's publication, this book still provides a gripping insight into the nature of the regime and the horrors of Stalinist Communism. Lyons is honest enough to acknowledge his own role early on in concealing the extent of these horrors to his readers, mentioning for example his role in dismissing journalist Gareth Jones' accounts of famine in the Ukraine. He tries to explain why journalists in the USSR closed their eyes to these facts and why he eventually felt he had to be open with his readers, and why he could not accept the rationalizations of people like radical Anna Louis Strong and New York Times correspondent Walter Duranty, who continued to lie to their readers.Lyons was too honest -- and too horrified by the terror -- to close his eyes for long, and eventually he is compelled to leave the country. His accounts of the horrors of what were happening in the USSR are still shocking, but perhaps even more disturbing are the accounts of western political \\"tourists\\" -- often literary and intellectual celebrities like Sidney and Beatrice Webb, George Bernard Shaw, and Romain Rolland -- who seemed to be stubbornly, almost willfully, blind to the realities of Soviet existence. Such apologists for Stalinism appalled him, and even more depressing was the unwillingness of liberal or fellow-travelling audiences to hear or understand what he had to say once he came home. While most Socialists and the anti-Stalinist left had come to understand the meaning of Stalinism (and it was the Socialist movement, not the political right, that was the principle target of Communist hostility during the Comintern Third Period, 1928-1934), too many others on the left, especially among well-meaning liberals, simply did not want to have their illusions about the workers' paradise shattered. Nor did Lyons have any patience with those on the American Right who tried to compare the mild liberal democratic reforms of the New Deal to the brutalities, paranoia and terror of Stalinism.Lyons's book is essential reading for anyone trying to understand what was happening in the Soviet Union in the 1930s -- especially for those on the left who still in some dark corner of their mind wish to hold on to the notion of the Soviet Union as a \\"progressive force.\\" During the 1930s the pressures of economic depression and the menace of rising fascism and rightist militarism made the need for unity on the left imperative and this created an entirely justified Popular Front impulse that sought to overlook differences on the Left in favor of common resistance to Nazism and Fascism. Lyons demonstrated that this unity might come at too high a price. In his controversial 1941 book, \\"The Red Decade\\", Lyons goes further in attacking a Popular Front ethos that ended up making excuses and apologies for Stalinist crimes in the name of anti-fascist unity, although the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop pact demonstrated the bankruptcy of this \\"unity.\\" But even if one feels the need to qualify some of the claims Lyons makes in his 1941 book (as author Frank Warren would do in his 1966 book \\"Liberals and Communism: The Red Decade Revisited\\"), Lyons in \\"Assignment to Utopia\\" makes a valuable contribution to understanding not only the meaning and nature of Stalinism, but also offers valuable insight into the struggle by those on the non-Communist Left to make sense of the Soviet experiment.Lyons himself would later turn politically to the right, rejecting not only Communism but those efforts to minimize or downplay the insidious influence of Communism in American life. By the 1960s he was an editor with Reader's Digest and contributed to other conservative journals. One does not have to accept his later political evolution to appreciate the value of his contribution to our understanding of Stalinism through \\"Assignment to Utopia.\\" Nor does one have to fully accept his growing anxiety about Communist influence in liberal and fellow-travelling circles during the 1930s and 1940s -- although I suspect he had more reason for this anxiety than is sometimes appreciated today -- to appreciate the importance of his descriptions of life in the USSR. \\"Assignment to Utopia\\" is a very good book, a very important book, and one that still deserves reading now that the Soviet Union has collapsed into the metaphorical historical trash bin."},{"Title":"Human Resource Policies and Procedures for Nonprofit Organizations","review":"I have used forms and checklists from this book most recently with a large arts organization.

Kristoffer Tabori -- who won an Audie Award last year for his version of J Eugenenides' &quot;Middlesex&quot; -- does a nuanced, exciting rendition of this vintage Western."},{"Title":"Beyond the Outposts (Five Star First Edition Western)","review":"The best book I read in 2007 was originally published in 1925. And, as a bonus, it was actually read for me. The plot of Beyond the Outposts is unlike any I have encountered before: young Lew Dorset runs away from his uncle (looking after him since Lew's father went to prison) in search of his father.Along the way, he makes a great friend in Chuck Morris (and that's Morris, not Norris, in case you weren't really paying attention yet), and fights Indians, later befriending them. There's a lot more that happens, but I don't want to ruin this epic experience for you. This is one of author Max Brand's most ambitious plots and he handles it deftly. Also, the complexity of the father-son relationship (even in the absence of the father) is dealt with especially well, giving Lew a depth that is not found in many characters.As for the audiobook of Beyond the Outposts, let me begin by saying that it is a special occasion when an actor you were previously unaware of makes an impression -- and to do so twice is extraordinary -- but that is just what happened to me with an actor with the distinctive name of Kristoffer Tabori.The first time I saw Tabori, he was truly inhabiting the usually thankless role of Henry Baskerville to Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes in The Hound of the Baskervilles. (In fact, I defy you to name anyone you who has ever played that role memorably.) His portrayal, I wrote at the time, \\"offers up a sympathetic rendition of the lord of the manor that actually makes the viewer care about his safety (and his heart).\\"Fast-forward a year. I came across this audio of Beyond the Outposts (Brand is one of my favorite authors, and one whose audiobooks, for some reason, I have a good deal of trouble tracking down through the library) -- read by Kristoffer Tabori. Well, I knew the name rang a bell and looked up the Holmes review to reread it. Interesting, I thought, a Briton reading a Western, but I decided to give it a go anyway. (It turns out Tabori is actually an American, and the son of director Don Siegel and actress Viveca Lindfors, but I was ignorant of this at the time. Thanks, Wikipedia!)The voice that came from my car's speakers was so different from that of Henry Baskerville that I had to do some Googling to confirm that it was in fact the same person. Tabori's reading reeks of the Old West. His personification of narrator Lew Dorset surpassed even my expectations for a Max Brand character. And his voice never falters as he gives each character a voice distinct enough to be different, yet similar enough to remind us they are all from the same area. Tabori makes these people live in a way they simply cannot on paper. And anyone who can actually improve on a Brand story gets high marks in my book."},{"Title":"Beyond the Outposts (Five Star First Edition Western)","review":"Wow!

It's a real rip-snorter. Fleeing from an abusive uncle, searching for his father, he meets up with a colorful cast of characters from the pre-Civil war West. Initially it has tones of Huck Finn (abusive parental figure, misguided racism from the South) but becomes a dramatic, rip-snorter of a tale, fighting and living with Native Americans, hunting an almost mythical white horse, and telling a tale of great friendship and disaster.The reader of the CD audio book is a perfect match - one of the best I have heard.

Dr. Raman combines modern medicine and yoga to treat or prevent a wide range of common ailments. He is a longtime student of yoga master B.K.S. Iyengar who taught him about the immense clinical benefits of utilizing yoga as a tool for health care. This book is the culmination of Dr. Raman's research in integrating the two sciences of medicine and yoga.As a yoga teacher specializing in yoga for people at midlife and older, I was especially interested in Dr. Raman's demonstrations of the use of yoga props for those who start yoga later in life. I highly recommend the sections on geriatric health and yoga and aging for teachers who offer classes for seniors. Clear, inspiring photographs demonstrate how even older beginners can reap the benefits of yoga using simple yoga props. The last section of the book presents a comprehensive discussion of common medical disorders that particularly respond to yoga therapy, including cardiovascular disorders. Dr. Raman describes the causes and symptoms and shows how excessive and prolonged medication and surgery can possibly be avoided in many cases through the practice of yoga. The book is illustrated with exceptionally educational photographs and diagrams of the human body.I highly recommend this book on its own merit and also as a companion to \\"Yoga: The Path to Holistic Health\\" by B.K.S.

Now don't get me wrong, this isn't the best ever written, but it is written very well indeed! Ryan is a young whipper snapper and full of himself, this writer is showing you his brash youth, a different ryan but Ryan all the same. This ghost writer in my estimation gave the Deathlands readers and full-blown action/adventure read. It is even better than some of the old master blaster writer himself - Mr. Laurence James, a.k.a. James Axler! Whoops, did I ruin anything for you readers? Don't worry, this series needs new blood writers anyway and it seems to me - there getting some d*** good action writers for the most part! I was getting kind of sick and tired of seeing Ryan and Co. getting food and shelter all of the time. The bare knuckles survival feel of the books was starting to slip away there for awhile. This book at least gives you Trader at his finest and gives you some long-awaited answers, mixed with sex and violence! Now thats Deathlands to me folks!"},{"Title":"Encounter (Deathlands)","review":"I thought this book was as good as any other Deathlands book. I enjoyed reading about Ryan and J.B. in the early years. I was really surprised about Doc being in the book. But it answered the question about why Doc always carries those two balls with him. It also explains how Trader received his rad poisoning. For anyone that read Pilgramage From Hell they would now know what happened with Trader. I have read every book by James Axler and there has not been one book I've been disappointed with. The only disappointment with this book was it being to short of a story. I hope to read more books on the Trader in the future."},{"Title":"Encounter (Deathlands)","review":"I'm a long time reader of the Deathlands series and, as stated by others, this book falls a little short.

Not a best effort but a good foundation for something bigger and better."},{"Title":"Encounter (Deathlands)","review":"After waiting for well over a year to read this novel, and being hyped about it, I found that it was a serious let down. The story was sub-standard and poorly written. The villians were stereotypical card board cut outs. The situation was just another standard back stabbing fight for survival. But the worst thing is that there were two major mistakes in the first 60 pages. I won't tell you what they are but suffice to say I almost put the book down and couldn't continue. However, the last part of the book, the section dealing with the birth of the series was just incredible. That section gets a five out of five from me. And after 12 years we finally get a chance to see what Trader looks like."},{"Title":"Encounter (Deathlands)","review":"filled in alot of blanks for the series... enjoyrd it very much... wish there were more back stories. would like to know on all the characters."},{"Title":"Encounter (Deathlands)","review":"What could have been a great chance to tell the story of Trader and the war-wag days has been squandered, resulting in a decidedly sub-par Deathlands novel. Serious inaccuracies, some poor writing and a pretty lame plot threaten to make this book almost not worth buying. The bit that really does make it worth buying has nothing to do with the story at all. Right at the end of the book there are essays on the birth and evolution of the Deathlands saga. They really should have made the entire book like this, it's totally fascinating stuff.Treat the story as nothing more than a folk tale and not part of the Deathlands canon and you might be able to put up with its failings. All I hope is that if someone tries something similar in the future, and I hope they do, that they put a bit more effort and thought into it."},{"Title":"Encounter (Deathlands)","review":"This is the first in what I hope is a series about Trader and Ryan before Ryan met Krysty et all.

Plus he gets poisoned, just like a &quot;rube.&quot; The story should have been 348 pages then do the history of Deathlands and Outlanders.I enjoyed the extras, but the story was bad. they fit everything into 348 pages.

And, yeah, there are two major mistakes in the first sixty pages. But my chief complaint was this: who cares about this psychotic character, Trader? What makes the Publisher think the average fan out there is eager to follow the antics of a character who frequently crosses the border into that of a murderous psycho? Not me, Baby! Hoo-Ha! The treatment renders the story into a disagreeable yarn, wherein nobody wants to follow the main character, known as Trader, around much at all, if not totally avoid the sucker completely. (Then again, some subsurface rock dwellers are fascinated with reading about Hitler.) As Confucius might once have penned the reader's experience, &quot;Living with Trader like athlete's foot -- soon becomes irritating.&quot;"},{"Title":"He-Motions: Even Strong Men Struggle","review":"I purchased this book for my husband. it is really uplifting.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a big TD Jakes fan, I think he's definitely an anointed prophet from God, and he's a fantastic minister. But being a great minister doesn't necessarily make a person a great writer. He's blessed w/ an uncanny ability to preach and teach on healing and deliverance from life's painful experiences, but when it comes to putting this thoughts on paper, he just doesn't seem to be able to get his points across clearly, directly and succinctly. For example, he doesn't stay focused on the subject at hand because of his excessive use of metaphors, hyperbole and superfluous information throughout this book. A good writer uses metaphors only to set an example or to illustrate a significant point in order to paint a clear picture in the reader's mind, not use them in every other sentence. For a while there, I wasn't sure if I was reading a book by TD Jakes or Dr. Seuss.Another problem I have w/ this book is that it seems like it is addressing little boys or, at best, men who have failed at every kind of human relationship possible - i.e., husband/wife, son/father, father/son, male/male friends, male/female friends, etc. He does however, provide a great outline on man's various relationships (with himself, with God, with his children, etc.), but his delivery is so out of focus. In fact, he even devotes an entire chapter smack in the middle of the book about money and finances. What does that have to do w/ how I deal w/ my \\"He-Motions\\"? Besides, he's already written a book a few years ago entitled \\"The Greatest Investment-Faith, Family & Finance\\", therefore it was unnecessary to bring up the subject of money/finance again in \\"He-Motions\\".The info contained in this book is just too elementary for me. He doesn't offer any real soultions on dealing w/ my \\"He-Motions\\", and the examples he provides just don't deal w/ anything that I have ever dealt with personnally. I was really expecting something much deeper and substantive. But all I got here was a bunch of fluff. C'mon Bishop, enough of the lame stories and metaphors, give us some substance. I don't mean to sound too critical, but I'm just not feelin' this book."},{"Title":"He-Motions: Even Strong Men Struggle","review":"Halfway thru E-motions, Bishop Jakes made clear what Spirituality is about. Not height, weight, race/color, or persuasionBishop Jakes never fell into the trap of the 'motivationalspeaker', spurring me to swimmin pools; movie stars, etc. Heexpounded on how to overcome our perceived limitations, which is much different than making a bunch of loot -robbers and thieves usually don't fare better after a big score.Two novels I've read take it another level:'That CaucafricanDistraction' and 'MAMAsense' by HW Benjamin"},{"Title":"He-Motions: Even Strong Men Struggle","review":"A recent Dallas Morning News column profiling T.D. Jakes quoted a University of Houston sociology professor saying that Jakes is \\"incredible in how he's able to diagnose people's pain. He has an uncanny ability to put a finger on the human condition.\\" Jakes' new book He-Motions illustrates the verity of the professor's statement. In He-Motions, Jakes nails the issues and challenges Christian men face today in trying to fulfill their many roles and pursue their dreams.Jakes writes from his heart and soul as a pastor, father, husband and entrepreneur. In the opening pages, he describes his motivation for writing: \\"I want to share what I've learned. I want to cut through so much of the junk imposed on men today and talk heart to heart about what it means to be a man, not in some touchy-feely group hug kind of way but in an honest, soul-bearing way, which also respects men and honors the women who love them and whom they love.\\"Jakes thoroughly succeeds in fulfilling his desire for this book. Not only does he address male readers, but he also targets female readers who hope to gain insights about men. Jakes' no-holds barred writing offers refreshing candor for those wanting an honest assessment of who they are and where they are in life.Jakes writes about his childhood, his ministry, his family and his ups and downs in life-always tying stories to life lessons for readers. It does not take the reader long to discern that Jakes possesses a vast breadth of wisdom and understanding about the inner workings of men in our culture.Jakes writes that \\"a man must value himself.\\" He-Motions can help readers make great strides in finding value in themselves-regardless of their circumstances. He encourages men to refuse to become discouraged but to keep moving toward their destiny while simultaneously enjoying the splendid moments of life's journey.The book is written as if Jakes is in the room having a one-on-one talk with the reader. If it was in fact such a talk, it would surely involve laughing, weeping, praying and dreaming. One such example of the conversational style is when Jakes writes about balancing family and career.He writes, \\"I'm here to tell you that if you don't contain your work life and segregate it from your home life, then your career will consume the marriage like a campfire blazing outside of its circle of rocks and roaring into a life-threatening forest fire.\\"There is not an area of discussion where Jakes lets men off the hook. He writes authoritatively about power, money and sex. In the financial arena, Jakes commands readers, \\"Stop asking God to bless an area where you refuse to obey His Word for your life.\\"In one relationship area after another, Jakes' writing leads the reader to self-examination, awareness, forgiveness and improvement. His writing on subjects such as a man's relationships with his father, children, wife, other men, time, money and God is honest and down to earth. It is also practical, as are the questions for men and women at the end of each chapter.Throughout the book, Jakes references the life of David to shed light on the above relationships from a Biblical perspective.Jakes encourages readers that \\"someone needs to know who you are and where you are at all times in your walk and life.\\" This book could be an effective tool to use in a discussion or accountability group to help people grow stronger relationships. I encourage men and women to take advantage of the wisdom and insights Jakes shares in this book."},{"Title":"He-Motions: Even Strong Men Struggle","review":"Real honesty, real answers, a real man!

There are alot of men struggling internally out there and the women in their lives have no clue as to what is going on or how we feel about things. Too often it is stated that men don't understand women, well that saying can also be reversed. In order for us to move on from our past we must understand it, why it happened, how it happened, how to overcome it, etc. This book is a tool for those who really want to understand somethings going on in their lives, or plaguing their past.

Life is a struggle for men and women, but women seem to shake it off because we will cry and scream. Men tend to grow bitter and hold on to past hurts in a different type of resentment.

Macarius was indeed the highly intellectual and experienced man from the secular world, born as he was into a family of the landed nobility. As an experienced Elder he later started the publication of the writings of the Patristic Fathers which was a blessing to all of Holy Russia. Indeed a lucky combination.Fr. Leonid Kavelin, later Abbot of the Holy Trinity - St. Sergius Lavra, wrote this Life of the Elder shortly after his death. Because of this it is an extraordinary and most engaging book, written with the memory of the holy Elder still fresh. This influences the style of writing, but is also a charming, emotional, and intellectual advantage.One can not be untouched by this book and Fr. Macarius' personality is vivid and enlightening.

Where many I Ching books have a specific focus (like the &quot;Buddhist I Ching&quot; or &quot;the I Ching of Romance&quot;) each hexagram has three sets of interpretations which allow you to get a business, relationship or spiritual oriented take on any question. The insights are filled with many current references, and Reifler avoids the trap getting too &quot;new age&quot; or literal about his subject. Don't judge this book by the cover, it's a classic that has now been around for over 25 years. If you already own a translation or two of this book, you may want to think about adding this edition to your library."},{"Title":"I Ching: A New Interpretation for Modern Times","review":"I got my first copy of this book some 25 years ago. In the meantime, I have acquired many other versions, but one is still one of my favorites. I used to refer to it as \\"my second brain\\" because it has been a tremendous help for me for accessing higher wisdom and getting practical solutions to some challenges that bordered on impossible - finding a way when there seemed to be no way out. The wisdom and guidance from this book has enabled me to accomplish some things that were very important for me, but which I didn't have a clue where even to begin to turn into reality. It has helped me to turn some seemingly impossible dreams into reality. For this I am profoundly grateful to the author of this book.I have started using this book when I was a teenager and when some other translations and interpretations of I Ching left me more confused, whereas this one provided easy to understand and straightforward counsel.As you keep on working with I Ching, you begin to develop a \\"feel\\" for different hexagrams that goes beyond words and comes about through actual experience. In time, you don't have to read the interpretations any more because you have the knowingness of the meaning of each hexagram. In time, you may develop a greater and deeper relationship with your higher wisdom, and what you need to know will emerge into your conscious awareness through direct guidance, without the necessity of using outer oracles. But, until you learn to clearly discern the voice of your higher wisdom, I Ching can be tremendously helpful.Other than the simple and easy to understand language of this book, I particularly appreciated that the interpretations of each hexagram are divided in three sections - related to your material life, to your love life and to your spiritual life. This makes the book even more \\"user friendly\\". I think that the book is particularly suitable and the best choice for someone who is new to working with the profound wisdom of I Ching."},{"Title":"I Ching: A New Interpretation for Modern Times","review":"There are so many I Ching books to choose from out there but very few are easy to understand.This book is easy to understand.Its written in simple English so people of all ages should be able to use this book.This book doesnt have several pages for each hexagram which makes asking for guidance a lot simpler than most other books.It can be used for all matters.It has more to offer than most I Ching books even though it has less pages.It still offers a great deal.As a book for beginners I think this book is suitable.I would encourage people who are starting to learn I Ching to choose this book and at least one beginners book first.You will end up keeping this book for sure.The quality of this book is very high.Printed on very high quality.The price itself is very good value too.Its really a good quality bargain.The cover is very appealling too.A little colour inside makes this book more interesting.Nice touch.Overall,this book is one of the best books for anyone interested in I Ching.I have yet to find a book that can offer as much as this book does for the same price and the same high quality in a book with less than 280 pages.I also recommend these books:1)\\"Practical guide to the I Ching\\" By Kim-Anh Lim.2)Symbols of love\\".By Stephen Karcher."},{"Title":"I Ching: A New Interpretation for Modern Times","review":"The copy I currently have of this book is from 1985, having worn out at least one previous copy. I'm delighted to see that it is still available, since I recently loaned my copy to my teenaged son, who was seeking an accessible translation of the I Ching. I was loath to let it leave the house until I verified that it could be replaced at Amazon.The other reviewer is correct that the introduction is rather short for someone not already familiar with the I Ching (or at least divination systems in general), but it is sufficient to allow the user to dive right in. Each hexagram is given interpretations in modern English for the three critical areas of life that three quarters of all divination is done: \\"artha\\" (work), \\"kama\\" (love), and \\"moksha\\" (spirituality). Here's my only complaint then, for one on health would have covered that last quarter!Despite the use of the three Sanscrit terms, the book is faithful to the Chinese cultural context of the I Ching and neither talks down to nor over the head of the reader. Anyone over the age of 14 should be able to read and use this book with success, though those under 30 may refuse to believe some of the practical but not-much-fun advice the oracle will dispense. It's like talking to a reasonably hip Chinese American grandfather.

A truly ancient text (scholars estimate that it is at least 3000 years old) I Ching is a handbook of sortilege, or divination through the arrangement of objects.Sortilege has been used since prehistoric times. Modern dice (\\"Roll them bones!\\") are the direct descendants of sacred goat bones used by diviners who interpreted the future by reading the marks on the bones and the arrangement of the bones when ritually tossed. Other sortilege-based games include Mah-Jongg and Go. Another form of sortilege is the reading of tea leaves.I Ching uses hexagrams (six line figures of solid and broken lines made up of a lower and upper trigam, all of which have independent meanings) to represent its readings. The hexagrams are traditionally constituted by the tossing of coins or yarrow sticks, though other objects can be used. Unlike many other forms of \\"fortune telling\\" I Ching does not in fact answer questions. Rather, it presents the querent with a series of interpretive statements from which the querent is expected to draw conclusions upon reflection. Thus, I Ching is related closely to Zen Koans, many originating in China, which are used as exercises in spontaneous thought.Previous reviewers seemed somewhat surprised at the use of Sanskrit terms in I Ching. However, it should be recalled that Indian mendicants, including the Buddhist sage Bodhidharma, entered China long ago bringing their various systems of thought with them. The Chinese reinterpreted these ideas in their own way, but a word like \\"Karma\\" entered the Chinese language much as it has entered English in modern times.The author of this volume, Sam Reifler, has done a masterful job of presenting the readings of I Ching (often very esoteric and translated very, very obscurely) into modern English in a format which can be readily used by novices and masters alike. On the negative side, no doubt some of the subtleties of the original Chinese are lost, but on the positive side, the typical reader will not get lost in the subtleties of the original Chinese. Rather than being offput by the exotic atmosphere of I Ching, most readers will be drawn into it. If you do find yourself wishing to delve deeper, the material is out there and available to you.You may find yourself reading this book for pleasure, or simply opening the book at random to see what it can tell you. Much like Rorschach inkblots I Ching can unlock your own thought processes and you will take from a reading whatever you may need at a given moment. Many people use I Ching as a daily lesson, a kind of \\"Hexagram a Day\\" spiritual practice.Whatever you choose, enjoy, and may we all ascend to the throne of Enlightenment."},{"Title":"I Ching: A New Interpretation for Modern Times","review":"What helped me is the breakdown of the moving lines and the interpretation assigned. By changing the number of the moving line that I had picked at random before getting this book of remarkable information, there was a noticeable shift of energy like a release and relief of pressure. Felt like a breakthrough for preparation. It really does make a difference having the knowledge in this book. A great book for setting up Hexagrams. I recommend this book by Sam Reifler."},{"Title":"I Ching: A New Interpretation for Modern Times","review":"I love this book!!!!

It is faction of the worst sort - full of homely anecdotes and purportedly accurate conversations but hardly a checkable fact or date in the book. The reason given briefly in an epilogue is that the author's notes were all destroyed in a disastrous fire (of which there is no mention in the body of the book). This should not however have rendered him unable to give verifiable dates. Surely he remembers the date of the death of his best friend and mentor - \\"his rock of stability\\"? Descriptions of events and people are homely to the extent that they sound as if they come from a Country and Western collection. Men are men, women are pretty and virtuous and animals are trusty companions. Even Jack Ruby: murderer, and Mafia connected small time hood (and corrupter of women) likes small dogs and nearly starts a fight to protect one. You can almost hear the steel guitar soundtrack. Despite the lack of timelines one anachronism is notable: the linking of JFK & Camelot in his lifetime which never happened.Not for the serious reader of the Kennedy period - file under Westerns."},{"Title":"Broken Silence","review":"Absolutely ridiculous. Should be listed under fantasy or fiction."},{"Title":"Broken Silence","review":"I very much enjoyed reading Broken Silence. Tex and Don Lasseter have compiled a series of very interesting evidence to conclude that Lee Oswald couldn't have commited the murder of JFK. Tex admits having tought Lee Oswald and Jack Ruby how to use guns, and explains the reasons why these two men weren't responsible for the JFK assassination.So many people took what they knew to their grave (including Tex) about the case, that the question as to who really did it is still a mystery to this day. The book is a very extensive &amp; accurate testimony from a reliable witness of the events.It is a captivating book, very well written and researched."},{"Title":"Broken Silence","review":"Entertaining for awhile, but when Tex mentions cruising with his girlfriend in 1963 and her singing along with the Beatles &quot;She Loves You&quot; on the radio, this kind of blows it since the Beatles did not hit major airwaves until 1964."},{"Title":"Broken Silence","review":"The book is written in a stereotypical Texan voice which becomes a little old by the end of the book.

He talked about the deal that was made, arranged by LBJ the then New President of The United States, to keep him (Ray &quot;Tex&quot; brown) from talking to the Warren Commission and revealing what he knew. I truly question the accuracy of the information in this book. Why was Ray &quot;Tex&quot; Brown so lucky to stay alive for thirty three years, when as he stated many of his friends were mysteriously dying?

Amazed by the strength of her sexual response to the not unwelcome advances of actor Blake Harrison, she finds the confidence to audition for the show and is offered a part.Now Lynne's life is turned upside down as she enjoys the attention of Blake and the newly rekindled passion of her unfaithful husband Nick. Finally in control of her life, all she need ask herself is - has she outgrown them both?__________________________Why 3 stars? I do not think the back cover accurately depicts this book. I was shocked by the unexpected emotional turmoil that the heroine goes through. In a nutshell, she is \\"rejected\\" by her husband, whose return into her life is so that he can have his cake and eat it too.It is one of those erotic fictions that cannot decide whether they are a romance novel or not, making the reader wonder whether or not they should care when the heroine is being used (and not in a good way).I gave it 3 stars because the heroine finally comes to her senses and like a cat - lands back on her feet with the sexy actor.It is light SM - including role playing, a little bondage and light spanking."},{"Title":"The boy inventors' radio-telephone,","review":"Like it well enough to seek other books in the series!

If I wasn't sure about being saved before I started reading it, I'm absolutely sure now. I'm glad its out so everybody can read it and be sure about their salvation. It's extremely important, especially in a world gone mad. Thanks to Ms. Beverly for writing this book so that we can be sure that we are saved folk."},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"When most people think of Black Christians, images of folks quoting Scripture 24/7 or walking around with highlighted halos pop into mind. But in the novel Saved Folk in the House, Sonnie Beverly weaves a tale about three women that puts such stereotypes to rest.Zakia a college graduate, has everything her heart could ever want yet she still feels empty. Nikki a single mother of three, moves to a new state and meets new friends and a new love. And LaKisha, a teenager, discovers that God can melt even the hardest of souls.Saved Folk in the House is refreshingly real and entertaining, for church folk and non-church folk alike.Sister 2 Sister Magazine - June 2006"},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"Once you are saved you allow the Spirit to indwell in you. I have never heard of such nonsense as a person get saved and then goes to a back room to receive utterance. Also speaking tongues is useless if it is not understood by another person, it doesn't do anything to build up the body of Christ if no one interprets it and tells others what the person is saying. The first time I read this book I was impressed and disappointed at the abrupt ending...however, the second go round after much meditation and prayer, I realize that this process isn't something that is based off of biblical knowledge. In 1 Corinthians 14:6-12 states \\"Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction? 7) Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the flute or harp, how eill anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes? 8) Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle? 9) So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will be speaking into the air. 10) Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning. 11) If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and he is a foreigner to me. 12) So it is with you since you are eager to have spirtual gifts, try to excel in gifts that build up the church.In this same chapeter it goes on to say that if anyone who does speak tongue they shoud pray for interpretation so their mind will be fruitful. Therefore, the author states that this is Zakia's power, but this is not true...a person praying in any language to God can release power in their prayer simply through their belief and fervency. I too have been pulled over by cops and I didn't have to utter tongues to pray to God. He heard me just as I was because I was speaking to him with an open heart. This author needs to study the word before confusing masses of people with unsaid truths. Study and show thyself approved!"},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"This book was not good. The writing and the story was all over the place. It was rather boring and felt a bit preachy. I enjoy reading Christian Fiction ( in fact thats all i read), however, the dialouge felt unrealistic and preachy, as did the characters. I never felt a connection to them.I tried so hard to finish this for my book club, but I had to put it down- it was to painful"},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"Saved Folk in the House is Sonnie Beverly's debut novel. Readers are introduced to a set of high school friends at the beginning of the novel. This group of friends and the Virginia community where they reside remain tightly knit through the ups and downs of life. The author focuses on three women from this community.The first woman, Zakia Wilkes, are the eyes in which the reader is reminded how fickle relationships can be and how valuable family and friends are when we are down. As Zakia goes through her college years, gets married, has children and runs her business, she has an epiphany about what's missing in her life. Zakia discovers the missing factor is faith. When she joins a vibrant church, her choice conflicts with her husband who is determined to remain at his family's more sedated church.In the second part of the novel, readers are introduced to Zakia's high school friend and co-cheerleader captain, Nikki Riley. After moving on from her marriage, Nikki decides to start life for her and children fresh in Atlanta. This move brings a new career, friends and church home. Unexpectantly, Nikki finds this move will bring love as well.The novel wraps up with the storyline centered around Lakisha Mitchell. Lakisha's mom has been sentenced to prison. Lakisha and her brother are staying with their maternal grandmother. As a teenager, Lakisha has grown up way too fast and her attitude has a way of getting her in trouble. She is especially awkward as she longs to gain the attention of a certain young man.The novel is split into three parts which were originally three novellas. I didn't realize this at first, but it does explain a lot. The graphic artist did a wonderful job creating a book cover that excites the senses. Once I started reading, I was little let down. I had a difficult time getting connected to Zakia's story. The events in her life seemed to go by way too fast. Nikki's story was my favorite part of the book. The character development was definitely on point allowing the reader to connect to Nikki on an emotional level. In the third section of the novel many of the characters introduced in the beginning seemed to connect more smoothly. Lakisha's story was often downplayed among the multi stories going on in this last section. Despite the minor difficulties with connecting to the characters, I enjoyed the author's nostalgic writing (not many communities like this one today) and found the ending especially endearing.Reviewed by Tyora Moody"},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"As an avid reader, this book was readable- a one day read. It had potential but I feel like I was rushed into knowing the characters (NO character development). Maybe she should have just started the story with Zakia as an adult rather than rushing us through her life...The second half is way better than the first."},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"Brothers, this is one sister who gets us. I was waiting to get dogged out and bashed upside the head the whole book. But instead I was almost feeling like a hero by the time I got to the end from the way Sonnie Beverly portrayed the many men in this novel. They were everything from dogs to gay, yet she handled each with sensitivity and integrity. She didn't apologize for anything the men did and they did it all, yet you could still respect them. I applaud her gift to pull that off. If you think this is a novel for women, don't. Brothers, read this novel and I guarantee you you'll walk a little taller."},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"This book accurately shows how Christians really are, real, down to earth, just like everybody else who have issues and make mistakes, except for one thing, their faith in God. Finally, a realistic novel that breaks it down so anybody can understand what it's like to live your life for Jesus and not be considered a freak, ignorant or a joke. Oh, the ending lets the world know that for unsaved folk the joke will be on them if they don't get it together. And the best part is the book shows exactly how anybody can get it together. I have waited a long time for a novel like this. Finally, it's here. Thank you Sonnie. Do not stop writing. We needed this. We need more of this."},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"SAVED FOLK IN THE HOUSE by Sonnie Beverly is a compilation of three stories about faith in a small Richmond, Virginia community that supports the saying, \\"It takes a village to raise a child.\\" In Part One, \\"Saved Babies' Daddies,\\" Zakia Wilkes has a child from a previous relationship, a great career, a new husband and a huge void in her life. That void is instantly filled when she finds solace in the church; however, this new found salvation threatens to undermine her marriage. In Part Two, \\"Real Saved Folks,\\" Nikki Riley, a saved, newly divorced mother of three moves her entire family from Virginia to Atlanta. While in Atlanta, Nikki races to a church she's seen only on television and into a new life that presents many challenges and conflicts that will test her faith. In Part Three, \\"Out of the Mouths of Saved Babes,\\" God works through the younger children in the community to show that His saving grace and strength is not just for adults only.Sonnie Beverly has put together an outstanding collage of stories that really display how God's blessings can have far-reaching and cleansing effects on a community. Ms. Beverly also showed how a good godly foundation and faith can support a family throughout many generations. I enjoyed getting to know each of the characters and I was particularly impressed with her demonstrating how God can even work through and with children. Although each story had a distinctly different message, they were tied together through the many recurring characters who served as the common thread for all three stories. Although I was reading an advance reading copy, there were a few grammatical and typographical errors that I hope went through further editing before publishing.Reviewed by Brenda M.

It is truly an inspiration."},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"Saved Folk in the House is the debut novel by Sonnie Beverly. It is one novel told in three parts with the characters loosely tied together. All in all, the characters are presented as being full of enthusiasm and eagerness to bring souls into the kingdom and follow the call the Lord has on their lives.The first story is about Zakia, a young mother living the good life but finds herself searching for something that is missing in her life. On a visit to Faith in the Word Church, she gives her life to the Lord and the void is fulfilled. That is until the unthinkable happens in her marriage. With the same exuberance she had doing the work of the Lord, Zakia turns to the Internet. Eventually, she finds her way back to the church. The next story involves Zakia's cousin, Nikki, who leaves her drug-addicted husband and moves to Atlanta with her three young children. She chose Atlanta because she wanted to serve at the Way Maker Church. Nikki believes her destiny is to work at the church as an accountant. An unexpected romantic interest also enters her life. The third story of this novel features three grandmothers; Grace, who is caring for her grandchildren while their mother is in prison. Jean, Nikki's mother who is caring for the children during the summer and Alexis, Zakia's mother, who brings her grandchildren around so they can keep company with the other children. The children spend the summer playing, working and most of all learning that God is a prayer answering God.The characters in the story really did not have much of a voice as Ms Beverly did more telling vs. showing in this book. The story was fast paced and the time frames progressed quickly. The most distressing thing to this reader was the inexcusable stereotyping of \\"saved folks\\" and misinterpretation of what constitutes being saved. This reader believes Ms Beverly based salvation on Romans 10: 9; for full understanding one would have to read further and include verses 10-14. There is more to it than repeating a statement. While I agree sanctification is a process, one cannot be a drug dealer and be saved. The Bible speaks of those who blatantly continue to sin. It is out of order to speak to someone in tongues if you do not have an interpreter. How does one minister if they have not been ministered to by their leader? These type of discrepancies with the Word were very bothersome to this reader and took away from the story. The best part in the book for this reader were the Execs and the positive images they presented of the black male. Finally, as I was reading this book, I had the feeling of deja vu. There were some eerie similarities to another novel this reader read recently.JeanetteAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"The story summary or description seemed to promise some intense real-life situations, and I looked forward to watching the main characters work their way through them. This was not the case. Each problem was presented and solved with little or no drama or intensity. Everybody was beautiful or handsome - all the children where cute, responsible and brilliant - everybody was triumphant - everybody was extremely successful, and sorry for their misdeeds. While I would love to live in a world of 100 percent happiness and wholeness, I'm a bit ashamed to say that reading a novel that saps it out from cover to cover was more boring than entertaining (to me)."},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"If I could give this book 0 stars, I would.

The buffoonery begins (still on the first CD by the way) when Zakiyya comes home from college and her old school friends want to take her out to a seafood buffet to eat. They begin to tell her how to, ummm, how shall I say it? expel her bowels so that she can eat more.

The story line is rushed an underdeveloped. It was like on one side of the page she was in high school, on the next; in college, on the next; graduating, on the next; getting married. I'm exaggerating a little, but there was little effort to develop the story lines in between, that it really feels that way. If the main character was experiencing something difficult, we barefly \\"felt it.\\" There were just surface words that alluded to a tough time.

Thank you."},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"Saved Folk in the House takes an intriguing look at the lives of three women with roots in a small Virginia city. Each is trying to live her life in the best way she knows how.Zakia Wilkes might have made some mistakes in her life, but now things are looking up. She's married to Jay, with a new baby in the house and a wonderful career - everything's picture perfect. But there's a void, and Zakia finds just the thing to fill it in her new church and a relationship with Jesus. Zakia jumps into church activities full speed, but doesn't realize she's leaving her family behind until it's too late.Nikki Riley moves into a new apartment and develops a connection with a much younger man. Can she trust that God will show her the right direction? LaKisha Mitchell is living with her grandmother since her mother is in jail. She wants to do what's popular, although she knows that the popular choice might not be the right one. Will LaKisha follow the direction given from men and women who have already walked the difficult road, or will she follow her own path?It's fascinating to watch these women's lives intertwine with each other through the years. The characters are realistic and every reader will be able to relate to someone or some situation in the story. Zakia experiences trials, yet her reliance on God and the way she listens closely to what He is saying through her prayers gets her through. It is refreshing to have a character suffer consequences due to an over-commitment to church. This is a huge issue these days that the author handled with a fresh perspective and grace.This novel is an excellent example of African-American fiction. It tells a good story, but doesn't get too bogged down with details. I found it compulsively readable, mostly because the characters are so well-defined. My one complaint is that the ending comes from out of nowhere. The final event is not even alluded to earlier, and caught me so off-guard I had to re-read it to see if I had understood correctly. Other than that, Saved Folk in the House is a wonderful book for those who enjoy Christian novels.Reviewed by Melissa Parcel"},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"This book was very touching! I don't know where to begin, so let's see.Saved Baby Daddies: We meet the crew who will take us through the rest of the stories, Zakia has to come face to face with her ways and errors of her life; letting God take over and lead her life she soon learns about forgiveness and letting God take control.Real Saved Folks: We meet Nikki; letting the Holy Spirit lead her to another state, she soon learns God knows what he children want and need in this life. We may not always want to follow and do what He tells us to, but if we just follow Him as our leader, we can't and won't go wrong.Out of the Mouths of Saved Babies: Bringing the crew back together; we learn that the Lord does change and heal people, it might not take overnight to do, but as long as we trust, believe, and have faith; we can't go wrong. Remember the Lord's way of thinking is not our way of thinking.This is the best of I could with the summery of the book otherwise I would've gave the story (ies) away:)Enjoy and stay Blessed!"},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"I am sure all reading this review are wondering what is she saying thank you for. First I thank the Lord for giving Sonnie Beverly faith. Second, I thank S. Beverly for stepping out on faith and sharing a positive book for the reading world out here. Don't worry Sonnie, you will do fine in your writing. Not everybook involving African-Americans have to be, \\"sitting on the edge of your seat, waiting for the worst to happen to the characters\\"; to be interesting. I found it very refreshing that these characters had faith in the Lord and that was all that mattered. I have had a child as young as eleven years old ask to read my book and it felt good to tell her, \\"yes you may!\\". The characters in this book were not perfect people, but their faith in the Lord made them as humanly perfect as we could with to become. I believe this book shows that all things are possible through God, and if you believe in Him, lifes promises He make work out. Thank you again Sonnie for giving your reader something different and hopefully a strong sense of trusting the Lord. You are a wonderful and you have written something that people of all ages and all walks of life can enjoy and learn something from."},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. The characters and the situations were all very believable. I was truly amazed at the writing talent in this debut novel. I laughed, cried, prayed and shouted during the reading of this book. The first thing that I did once I finished reading it was to call all of my reader friends and suggest this wonderful novel. Kudos to you and write some more, I can't wait to read more from you. Congratulations and be blessed."},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"A strong woman along with her brother Zachary raised Zakia in a single parent home.

This book also shows how powerful PRAYER is and what a good influence it is on young children."},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I was in the beauty shop under the dryer when I finished it. All of a sudden I burst into tears and everybody was wondering what was wrong with me."},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"\\"Saved Folks in the House\\" by Sonnie Beverly is three-story compilation/novel based on a very strong story concept of following three women's lives who are all connected to the same set of family and friends in their extended village as they learn to draw on faith and spiritual strength. The execution of the story, however, was inconsistent for this reader. Generally a very fast reader, it took me a while to get through this book due to the underdeveloped characters and dialogue. After reading the reviews and synopsis of this novel, I was really excited about receiving this book and eagerly delving into reading it. This was squelched quickly, however, as the writing was extremely simplistic and less than fulfilling.The first of the three stories centers on Zakia, who despite having attained success in family and marriage, still feels emotionally empty. She searches for fulfillment in many things including travel and redecorating her home until she finds solace in a new church. Her solace, however, wreaks havoc in her relationships and career. Zakia is faced with balancing her new found spirituality with her daily life.In the second story, Nikki moves away from everyone she knows after finding spiritual fulfillment in a television ministry. After relocating to the city where the church is located, everything starts to fall in place for Nikki and her children. In this section we see where faith in action leads.The final story is described as focusing on LaKisha, a young member of the village who is living with her grandmother as her Mom ran into legal trouble and has been incarcerated. LaKisha shows all the knocks that come from a challenging upbringing. Although this is advertised as LaKisha's story, it is really the story of the children of all of the different \\"village\\" members including Zakia and Nikki introduced earlier in the book.The three stories conclude with a bit of a perplexing and rapid conclusion."},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"This was one of those I just wanted to finish. Good thing because the author had a great story going then, all of a sudden, everything wrapped up nice and tidy in a paragraph. I never felt like I got to know the characters.I was disappointed as I enjoy Christ-based authors and their characters. This was not an interesting book."},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"I picked up this book b/c of the Christian aspect, but this was not a good book. I felt the book did not flow well. Everything had a \\"see Jane run. See Jane feed dog\\" elementary style to it.The way the author went through periods of the characters' lives made the book seem rushed. On this page, Zakia is in high school...next page, graduating from college. Just too rushed and everything was in a place.On to the Christian aspects, I'm a Christian and I love the Lord, but I never felt that the book contained the message of Jesus Christ. Sure, there was a lot of church references and things in there, but I never got behind the author and said \\"tell it! or Amen!\\" The speaking in tongues situation was just crazy. As a reviewer below states, there is a time and place for everything and if Ms. Zakia attended my church and went around bragging that speaking in tongues got her out of a ticket, she would get a talking to.The way the main character neglected her family and didn't work on her marriage, etc, just seemed so contradictory. She didn't shed a tear about her marriage, she didn't have conversations with her kids about it, she selfishly didn't introduce her firstborn to his father til near the end, etc.The stories were weak and one-dimensional. Oh, and the out of left field middle section of the book--with a whole new character that I didn't know existed? I SKIPPED THAT ENTIRE SECTION...WHICH HAD TO BE 100 PAGES."},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"The first half of Saved Folks in the House is wonderful. It tells Zakia's story. Zakia is a young black woman in a modern world who grew up in a part of Richmond, Virginia called The Village. Her mother has very high expectations and accepts no excuses.In high school, Zakia had good grades and was popular. Friends of her twin brother Zachary helped her steer through understanding boyfriends. In college, life was different, with temptations of all kinds: drugs, alcohol and sex. This part of the book looks into all the peer pressure, challenges and decisions that everyone faces.Zakia hung tough for as long as she could but then she fell in love with Malik. She ended up pregnant but graduated with honors. She moved back home to raise her son without Malik. Life was full of challenges but then she marries. After years of a great life, she started to feel a hole in her life--an emptiness.Then she discovers a church that answers all her spiritual needs. She is reborn and becomes consumed with church life and converting the world. Her enthusiasm and pushing her beliefs alienate everyone. After her husband leaves, she eventually she learns to balance her faith in her life.The second half of the book is Nikki's story. This part seems very unrealistic. Nikki and her children have a strong faith in God, which is admirable. Because of this faith, she has no real challenges, problems, or hardships. She moves to Atlanta with her children and finds a wonderful apartment. She seems to have no problem affording anything while being unemployed and a single mother.Everyone and everything is wonderful. She wants to get a job at her new church so she gets it. No temptations or hardships are presented, and life is wonderful. The \\"If you believe everything is perfect\\" just a little too unbelievable.Maybe the author should have stopped with Zakia. It was very inspirational and demonstrated with life's challenges and temptations, that there are consequences and then how to deal with those consequences as well as how faith can help get us through these events in our life.Armchair Interviews says: Zaki's character was real; her inspiration and how she dealt with life's challenges were well written in Saved Folks in the House."},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"Okay. Here we go again with someone's opinion about what it takes to be \\"saved.\\" Saved from what??? The message that the author threw out about why she didn't get the speeding ticket was that because she was speaking in tongues. However, the Bible says to obey the laws of the land. When we disobey the laws of the land, we disobey the word of God. So please don't speed. There's a time and place for tongues. The life you save might be your own. Okay. With that said, I'll move on.I did not like the way the story was written -- junior high style. Editing was poor. Tenses were changing -- sometimes in the same sentence. Things went from one extreme to another without detailed explanation. Zakia and Jay could have been a beautiful story if written by a seasoned author. Nikki's testimony should have been kept as a separate book, but her life was too neatly packaged, void of passion (struggle). To say the least, I was really disappointed with this read.I did like what the author stated on page 99, \\"sold-out-for-Jesus . . . tolerant of others.\\" Also, it takes more than repeating the so-called \\"sinner's prayer\\" to make it in the kingdom of God. You have to live a Holy life. There aren't gonna be as many people as the church world thinks that gonna make it in.If this story had stayed focused throughout on Zakia and Jay and with better writing, flow and editing, this could've been an entertaining read. The SmithScale gives this a 1.9."},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"There are three interesting stories filled with characters that you won't be able to forget. She cleverly mixes characters from one section to the next. By the time you get to part three, you feel like you're part of a family reunion.Part One \\"Saved Babies' Daddies\\" tells Zakia Wilke's story. We watch her grow from a young child to a woman who aspires to be a virtuous woman. When she accepts Christ in her life, she feels a new zeal for life. Although spiritually she's found what she's looking for, she neglects other areas of her life. Her story shows the growth of a new born Christian to one that fully understands God's plans for ones life.Part Two \\"Real Saved Folk\\" main setting is Georgia. Nikki Riley, Zakia's childhood friend, relocates there with her children. Divorced and needing a change of scenery, Nikki feels that the move was what she needed. She immediately finds her a church home. She befriends several people, but one of the friends becomes jealous of her without her knowing. Nikki's life reflects the results of being dedicated and obedient to God.The last story \\"Out of the Mouth of Saved Babes\\" shows that being a Christian is not limited to adults. LaKisha has gone through many things for such a young age. Growing up in her grandparents household and having other young Christians around her help LaKisha make smarter decisions in her life."},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"this book is defintely a page turner... this is an awesome work of God... keep up the good work and im hoping that i will be blessed by this author again!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"SAVED FOLK IN THE HOUSE by Sonnie Beverly is a compilation of three stories about faith in a small Richmond, Virginia community that supports the saying, \\"It takes a village to raise a child.\\" In Part One, \\"Saved Babies' Daddies,\\" Zakia Wilkes has a child from a previous relationship, a great career, a new husband and a huge void in her life. That void isinstantly filled when she finds solace in the church; however, this new found salvation threatens to undermine her marriage. In Part Two, \\"RealSaved Folks,\\" Nikki Riley, a saved, newly divorced mother of three moves her entire family from Virginia to Atlanta. While in Atlanta, Nikki races to a church she's seen only on television and into a new life that presents many challenges and conflicts that will test her faith. In Part Three, \\"Out of the Mouths of Saved Babes,\\" God works through the younger children in the community to show that His saving grace and strength is not just for adults only.Sonnie Beverly has put together an outstanding collage of stories that really display how God's blessings can have far-reaching and cleansing effects on a community. Ms. Beverly also showed how a good godly foundation and faith can support a family throughout many generations. I enjoyed getting to know each of the characters and I was particularly impressed with her demonstrating how God can even work through and with children. While I would have preferred one complete novel versus the short story format, each story had a distinctly different message, but were tied together through the many recurring characters who served as the common thread for all three stories. Although I was reading an advance reading copy, there were a few grammatical and typographical errors that I hope went through further editing before publishing.Reviewed by Brenda M.

It was awesome and definitely a page turner. I could not put it down; anxious to see what was on the next page. I related to many of the characters mentioned and their day-to-day situations. With the excitement and intrigue, cannot wait for the next book."},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"Good point a previous reviewer made. Add to the list crack addicts, playas, murderers, all of them, believably saved! How encouraging for those who may have made some bad choices in their lives to see how others overcome the consequences of their decisions by following Jesus. I can't think of a ministry in the church, from singles, to substance abuse, to marriage, again, all of them that wouldn't benefit from having it's members read this book."},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"Thanks to Sonnie Beverly for proving that our stories can be told realistically without vulgarity. How refreshing to see real issues dealt with openly, honestly, and with Black people having profanity free conversations. Who knew it could be done. It's done in Saved Folk in the House and it's done well."},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"If this book isn't a best seller, then something is really, really wrong. How can a writer manage so much with such wisdom over so much time and bring it all to such a glorious end except for sheer brilliance.Saved Folk in the House tells three stories; In part one, Saved Babies Daddies, Zakia's story traces her life from childhood to adulthood showing how she overcame every obstacle in her life, and there were many. We can learn so much from Zakia, especially know-it-all Christians. Kudos to Sonnie Beverly for showing how folk should and shouldn't act once they get born again. But even before that, Sonnie brilliantly shows how little kids can cope in dysfunctional situations, how high school and college issues should be dealt with and how to make the transition into adulthood after school, even when major setbacks befall you. The problems and the solutions are laid out skillfully. You are thoroughly entertained and inspired as you watch Zakia fall down and get back up victorious.Part two, Real Saved Folk, is about Zakia's friend, gutsy Nikki Riley who's strength and courage has to come from a higher source, yet it is so real having to deal with the decision to leave a drug addict husband and relocate three children as a single parent to a new and strange place. What is waiting for her there is something wonderful in friendship, love and romance. Had she not had the guts to make the move, she would have missed out big time. Nikki shows women how to just do what they have to do to obtain the best life has to offer. Just brilliantly written.The last part, Out of the Mouths of Saved Babes, is about Zakia's, Nikki's and other kids from their neighborhood/village. The kids, the parents and the grandparents all come together for a very eventful summer. All of these people are living such real lives you forget that they are saved folk. The message is clear that living a life full of prayer, faith in God, love and support for your family and friends always leads to the desired results. The kids will simply blow your mind. There is a murder trial going on and the way the kids come through is totally genius.The ending was genius, brilliant, awesome, inspiring, amazing, astounding, breathtaking, overwhelming, just splendid, I can't say enough. Being saved I saw two endings, one for saved folk and one for unsaved folk, so Sonnie is speaking to everybody with this book. The first ending satisfies regular readers just looking for a good story with a wonderful ending, while the second ending, on the same last page as the first ending, totally satisfies the hope of all real saved folk. BRILLIANT BEST SELLER!!!"},{"Title":"Saved Folk in the House","review":"I received this book as a gift and couldn't have been more disappointed. The storylines were drawn out and weak.

Since then it has gone from a new shiny black paperback into a dog-eared, highlight-filled, cover-torn mass of paper that resembles what might have been a book. The reason -- it goes with me everywhere.This is the perfect book for any young Christian who has any bit of athleticism in their veins. We all get discouraged, we all get angry, we all want to quit at some time or another when we participate in athletics long enough.The Bible is full of motivation that is perfect for the challenges athlete's face both on and off the field. The only problem is it is surrounded by a bunch of other stuff, that today's active youngster doesn't want to wade through just to find the point.This book provides short excerpts that are already categorized to common sources of need for young athletes. All one has to do is turn to the proper page and wahlah!, they can easily see the advice that the Bible gives for people in their situation.Be warned. It will never take the place of one's own Bible, because it lacks the background info that is often important.

If you only read one section of the book, the modern chapter would be the obvious choice, for this is where the author's enthusiasm for Mies, Le Corbusier, Aalto, and so on, is most apparent, and where his pithy arguments (one long paragraph per building) are most compelling. Other chapters on Art Nouveau, neo-classicism, and what he terms &quot;Organic&quot; and &quot;Robotic&quot; architecture are similarly instructive, although his Postmodernism chapter is more than a little thin. It's not that this much-derided style (1970s through early 1990s) did not deserve scorn from critics, it's just that Glancey has not done his homework in his own criticism. For one, apart from certain glaring factual errors--such as claiming that the Portland Building no longer exists, which would be wishful thinking--he frequently dismisses all such PoMo architecture as one big joke, colossal shenanigans writ large for everyone's torment. Even if you accept this argument (and it is quite compelling in the hands of an incisive author), Glancey all too often sketches over or simply ignores the design logic and historical background for each such &quot;joke,&quot; preferring instead to deploy curt British witticisms, sarcastic jibes that typically fail to amuse readers across the Atlantic. That said, aside from this spotty chapter, Glancey's research is fairly good and the obvious candidates for notable 20th-century edifices are mostly included--save for such inexplicable omissions as the wondrous Gamble House in LA and Frank Lloyd Wright's influential Unity Temple in Oak Park, IL. The other major annoyance is his heavy emphasis on British architecture, and not just on worthwhile figures like Rogers, Foster, et al., but on an array of wretched Brutalist hackwork from the 1960s, concrete bunkers and high-rise housing ghettos that should never have appeared in a book designed around supposed architectural highlights. It almost makes you symphathize with the early PoMo architects who saw these late-Modern creations as the nasty and inevitable excesses of the International Style, and decided to go overboard in a wholly different direction. If Glancey really wanted to show the legacy of corporate and bureaucratic modernism, he should've included a picture of the demolition of the Pruitt-Igoe housing project, a concrete eyesore that won many awards from the critics before its residents found it to be completely unlivable and fled from it in droves."},{"Title":"20th-Century Architecture","review":"I received this book for a Christmas present several years ago (I believe I was 13). Even now, I still find myself frequently picking it up and glancing over its many pages.Many buildings are simply represented, and because of this overwhelming variety, the book serves as an excellent introduction to those who feel lost in the immense world of architecture (like me). The written portions describing the buildings are very concise, giving you adequate backround information and description. Photographs are on the smaller side, taking up half a page, but are well-chosen and give a &quot;feel&quot; to the writings.I still find quite a thrill in flipping through its many pages, viewing the great variety of architectual works contained within it.Greatly enjoyed, and extremely edifying! Buy it for anyone who shows the slightest inkling of an interest in architecture. It will fascinate any creative mind."},{"Title":"20th-Century Architecture","review":"I thought this book portrayed some of the greatest works of the twentieth century including some of the best architects.

He depicts Beerbohm as so subtle, so exquisite, and sensitive in his art and observations that he doesn't need anyone else, someone who can spend years on a drawing to get the caricature of his subject just right and then is satisfied if just one other person sees it and no one else.That seems too subtle for me, perhaps I am wrong in that but this book doesn't convince me that that is a worthy or admirable way to spend a life or use a talent.He depicts Max as an elf-like, ethereal character, somewhat removed from real life. I kept waiting to be drawn into this magical world but I wasn't, as my young son likes to say, \\"das ist langweilig!\\" - booooooring!Not sure who is at fault, Behrman is highly regarded and so is Beerbohm, the combination of the two in this context just doesn't add up to anything for me. Perhaps there just wasn't enough material included, it read as very surface and not a compelling portrait of a man who is obviously much more interesting than shown here."},{"Title":"The Patriot","review":"Pearl S.

Reading the book almost 70 years later, we of course have the historical perspective of Mao Tse Tung's communist revolution that came to rule China in 1947. The portrayal of Chiang Kai-shek who was eventually forced to Taiwan as a shrewd politician who takes over as a revolutionary only to oppose the communists was extremely interesting background. I also greatly appreciated Buck's examination of the difference between Japanese and Chinese culture. The romantic love story between I-wan and Tama created the sweetness in the book. [Before I discuss plot, those who would prefer not to see spoilers should stop at this point.]The story begins as I-wan is a young adult. He is thrown into jail for reading revolutionary literature where he meets En-lan. Because I-wan's father is a wealthy banker, he is able to secure his own and En-lan's release. The backstory from En-lan of the Chinese prisons and the routine executions of young men for political reasons is chilling. I-wan becomes involved in the revolutionary movement as his older brother I-ko becomes involved in the fast life of gambling and women. The house maid or slave Peony is told about I-wan's politics. I-wan's political activities put him on a death list which results in his banishment to Japan, while I-ko must be exiled to Germany for stealing from the bank.This sets up Part Two of the book where I-wan is taken to the house of one of his father's associates, Mr. Muraki, who gives him board & room and starts him off in their family business. Muraki's daughter Tama graduates university and is prepared to marry an unattractive General Seki, just as I-wan realizes he has fallen in love with her. Tama's older brother Akio who is very businesslike has refused his father's request of an arranged marriage and lives with his girlfriend. I-wan hopes that Tama will refuse to marry the old military man. War intervenes in China. Tama's brother Bungi serves and returns home a changed man. One drunken night, he reveals his secrets to I-wan. This also serves to open I-wan's eyes that the Japanese papers do not report objectively about what is happening in China. After Akio's suicide, Tama also makes it clear to her father that she will not marry General Seki. I-wan and Tama's marriage is arranged through the traditional channels and begrudgingly blessed by his family. Two sons, Jiro and Ganjiro soon are playing about I-wan's home. But increasing war rumors circulate. I-wan meets I-ko at the harbor in Japan. I-ko urges him to return home and fight for his country. This is one of the most interesting parts of the character I-wan who loves his wife and children, but regards his Chinese nationality as important. It leads to his decision to depart for China to fight the Japanese.Part Three reunites I-wan with his school buddy En-lan and the now revolutionary Peony who married En-lan. They fight in the mountains as communists against Chaing Kai-shek. An agreement is reached that puts them all on the same side to fight the Japanese. Differences in war strategies come to the fore as the Chinese adopt a more traditional guerilla war. I-wan comes to appreciate the sense of order in Japan which results in less chaos and criminality. The novel concludes as Chaing Kai-shek informs I-wan that he had I-wan's brother I-ko executed for a criminal. We get hints of how I-wan will bring his family to China to live in his family's land in Western China.This is the first novel I've read by Pearl S. Buck. Her command of story, character and the broad universal themes of war & peace, chaos & order, duty to country vs. duty to family, makes this a breathtaking adventure. Buck is a master storyteller. \\"The Patriot\\" is an extremely satisfying reading experience.

Battaglia to Quang Tri","review":"This book is proof that self-publishing can work well. I know this author, and he originally only wanted to document his experiences for his sons. The idea was to teach them the reality of war without the harrowing emotional experiences the author lived through. His story grew into this book, and many readers in addition to the author's sons are benefiting from this effort. The insights are invaluable to anyone interested in the soldier's experience, that is so rarely talked about in our culture. A good read, indeed, and anyone who grew up playing \\"fort\\" can relate and remember."},{"Title":"My Father's War Stories: Mt. Battaglia to Quang Tri","review":"I grew up in the anti-war vietnam era and always wondered how people could willingly go to war. This is the first book to help me understand the relationship between childhood games, pro-war movies/media fantasies and the harsh reality of &quot;waking up&quot; in a battlefield. The author's childhood romatic ideals of his father's war is shattered by his own experience in the damp jungles of vietnam. This as a must read for all young people and especially important in today's era of uncertain war."},{"Title":"My Father's War Stories: Mt. Battaglia to Quang Tri","review":"A good read, this book is also a thought provoking look at growing up and the thinking, experiences and instincts that lead the author into, and ultimately out of, war. In that regard, it's a kind of spiritual journey, but one that gives you an almost anthropological look at people's attachment to territory -- whether it's a neighborhood fort, an encampment perimeter, or a homeland.That said, it's anything but dry. There's a broad range of experience here, from the humorous and nostalgic to the grimmest reality. And while some of it will seem familiar to the reader, the telling offers a fresh perspective on soldiering that's well worth pondering. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"My Father's War Stories: Mt. Battaglia to Quang Tri","review":"I loved this book. John has a wonderful narrative voice and his stories of childhood remind me of my own. Though I grew up ten years later and did not have to serve in Vietnam, his experiences growing up resonate with me: roaming the neighborhood in gangs, building forts and playing war. His misadventures in Vietnam remind me again how thankful I am that I was too young to serve. I highly recommend this book. It is a good read whether you served in Vietnam or just played war as a kid."},{"Title":"Ceres, Celestial Legend, Vol. 8: Miori","review":"This is a really good book, and you should read it. It looks into Toya's and Aya's relationship and Yuhi's affection for Aya. A girl who looks just like Aya shows up, apparently Toya's girlfriend from before, and Toya gets hit by a car while in shock from seeing Miori again. He regains his memory from before... but he loses all memories of his year with Aya. There's also a teeny bit of comedy from Yuhi's 'emotional breakdowns' concerning his jealousy, enough so you don't end up screaming or crying at the end, or something.However, if you buy this volume, you MUST buy the next one. This one's last few pages are the most intense part in the whole book, with a bit of build-up, but not that much. It also gives you a huge cliffhanger, and I pretty much ran around in a panic trying to get the next volume. Save yourself the pain :D."},{"Title":"Ceres, Celestial Legend, Vol. 8: Miori","review":"Yu Watase never fails to deliver, and this book is no exception.

Yu Watase does push some emotional buttons here, taking her well-developed characters to the max and putting them in situations that show their true colors(especially Yuhi...read the book, and you'll see what I mean). If you've seen the anime and think you don't need to read the manga, you're completely wrong...So much was left out of the tv series...The characters really are taken to a whole new level(especially Shuro,in my opinion(but that's another book, not this one...).

The war, ostensibly about religion, but, as usual, really just about aristocratic power conflicts, especially between the Hapsburgs and the Boubons. The war redrew borders and cemented Europe politics until WW1. Written in the 1930's by a woman historian, it is a difficult read with 500 pages of endless political intrigue. I enjoyed it, but it's only for those seriously interested."},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War (The Folio Society edition)","review":"I agree with other reviewers that the book contains a lot of useful information. But this is really _a lot_. The book is overcharged with names and dates, and, especially, with references. I'm not a professional historian, rather, an amateur, maybe that's why the book was quite heavy for me. Another problem, though quite subjective, is the language. For me, as non-native English speaker, the author tends to use too complex (though excellent!) English phrases which makes the book quite difficult for quick and comprehensive understanding."},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War (The Folio Society edition)","review":"A year or two ago I became interested in the 30 years war because of an offhand remark by a friend after I described my ancestry - &#34;Your DNA could restage the 30 years way all by itself&#34;. I'm not a professional historian - I'm just a techno-geek who wants to read about my distant ancestors.This is the third book on this topic that I purchased, and the first one that I can sit down and read like a novel. The narrative is clear, engaging, and fun. It explains the background and prelude clearly, and makes each step quite accessible to me. It isn't achieving this by sacrificing detail or source - somehow the author just managed to hit exactly the right level for my needs and abilities.If I had bought this book first I wouldn't have felt the need to buy the other two books.Having praised the book let me say there are a few small problems. For example, the map of Central Europe in 1618 is not quite &#34;pathetic&#34;, but it is woefully inadequate for the book. Many times a certain territory is mentioned and is not marked on the map. Cities can be impossible to find (not helped by the fact that the soft cover binding made a good 10% of the map unusable). As the war progresses the map of 1618 becomes less and less appropriate for discussion of the geo politics of (for example) 1640.

Wedgwood's narrative breaths life into the crosscurrents of religion, politics, economics, military operations, and leading personalities. Her solid analysis of the underlying situation, the trends and the final results brings the whole picture into focus while supplying fascinating details. As a comparison, if you have read any history by Barbara Tuchman, Wedgwood's style is similar and just as engaging, suitable to take in the full flavor of this pivitol half century, and not just a dry compilation of facts and figures.

However, it is burdened with the infuriating weakness of presenting untranslated French, German, and Latin phrases within a book that is published for English-speaking readers. If I were an editor I would not tolerate it. First, the author is not justified in assuming that English-speaking readers have her command of foreign languages. For example, those of us who study science tend to know less in this area than those in the humanities. Two languages, maybe, but we seldom speak or write a third.

However, if you travel to Germany, you'll hear endless stories about the Thirty Years War at almost any tourist site that you go to.

There was a web of political intrigues spreading from Austria, France, and Spain. To achieve their aims, the rulers of these countries caused a lot of bloodshed and terror in the lands of the Holy Roman Empire. I really recommend this book because it does a good job of explaining how a meaningless war can drag on endlessly and in the end accomplish little."},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War (The Folio Society edition)","review":"What a mess!--I mean the conflict described herein, not the exquisite narrative. Basically, for those unfamiliar with the war, it describes a series of campaigns that arose, nominally at least, out of religious conflict within present day Germany and evolved into what we might now call a proxy war fought on German soil between France and Spain, the Hapsburgs and the Bourbons, for European preeminence--with the Danes and Swedes thrown in for good measure. It reminds one of why Germany was so powerful when it finally got its military and political act together in the past century. As divided as it was in the 17th Century, one of the German alliances actually came within a day's march of Paris during these campaigns---It brings to mind the comment back in the early 90's after the Berlin Wall fell by some waggish fellow on a BBC programme that the reunification was making Germany's neighbours nervous, \\"France last week offered to surrender.\\"Wedgwood does an excellent job describing this war and brings new life to the English narrative historical tradition in doing so. She can rightly take her place beside Gibbon, Hume and McCauley in combining a meticulous description of events with colourful descriptions of the men (and women) who were players in this grisly drama that left what I suppose we'll call Greater Germany a wasteland for the most part. She is equally adept at describing the horrendous plight of the commoners: Resorting to cannibalism, at the mercy of the soldiery of different nations, and the general breakdown of law and order among them---as when a father tries to take a soldier to court for deflowering and murdering his daughter. The defence is simply that had the victim in question not been so overprotective of her virginity, things would never have come to this pass, as she is at depicting the petty, time-consuming squabbles of the aristocrats at the various Diets. Particularly important was where one sat at these convenings. One was liable to start a new round of fighting by insulting a Prince or Diplomat by not putting him in his right spot at the table.All this makes for a splendid work on a nauseating period in history. It is THE recommended book, I should say, for all those interested. But, personally, I think I'll fall back and choose something less....gruesome....for my next read."},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War (The Folio Society edition)","review":"For the English-language reader Wedgwood's book, which has been in print for over sixty years, is still an excellent introduction and synoptic narrative of this lengthy and turbulent period of European history. It gives brief and judicious biographical sketches of the major political and military actors of three generations: The principal antagonists at the outset -- Ferdinand II of Austria and Frederick V, Elector Palatine; the condottieri-style generals - Spinola, von Mansfeld, Tilly, Wallenstein, Piccolomini, Christian of Halberstadt, Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, the duc d'Enghien (Conde); the contentious minor rulers -- Maximilian V of Bavaria, Johann Georg of Saxony; the northern monarchs -- Christian IV of Denmark and Gustavus Adophus of Sweden (and his daughter Christina and prime minister, Oxenstierna); the \\"spoiler\\", Cardinal Richelieu; the new Emperor Ferdinand III and his cousin, the warlord Cardinal-Infant Ferdinand of Spain; and many others. This book is written in a traditional English historian's prose style that is clear, eloquent and totally lacking the jargon of concurrent and later social and economic histories, while still covering these aspects of the period. In spite of some reviewers' claims of a \\"Protestant bias\\" in her interpretation, the author seems extremely fair when assessing responsibility for the long-running disaster of the war, taking the position that it was the self-serving political interests of the participants (dynasties, rulers, generals and paymasters) that kept the war going at the expense of the social and economic welfare of the vast majority of inhabitants of Germany and Bohemia.Although I am not familiar with this new edition (and Grafton's introduction) I emphasize that any reissuing of this book should have a brief scholarly introduction which supplies more details on the constitutional arrangements and crises of the Holy Roman Empire during the sixteenth century, with a special emphasis on the composition of the Bohemian estates and the conflicts between the estates and the Habsburg king-emperors. The extent and internal organization of \\"the Bohemian crown lands\\" should also be outlined. A succinct review of the political status of Lutheranism, Calvinism, the Bohemian Brethren, and other Protestant confessions throughout all of Europe around the year 1600 and a note on how their status had altered by 1700 would also be useful in \\"setting the stage\\" for the events of 1618 and understanding the relgious-denomination consequences of the war.The author supplies sufficient details on the major battles, but this is not a work of military history. As Wedgwood knows, battles were only significant in the larger view as a result of their political consequences. And it is in the elucidation of the underlying politics of the war (including how political prospects shifted with the waxing and waning of military fortunes) that Wedgwood excels. In her analysis of the general European situation at the outset of the war she proposes that there were three sets of forces which underlay and drove contemporary events. Each was a source of conflict and each might cross-cut the others, complicating the declared interests and objectives of the dynasties and nations involved. In brief, the forces were: (a) Religion, with three major competing factions (Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist; she notes that the conflict between the latter two forms of Protestantism was often as extreme as it was between each of them and the Roman Catholic Church). (b) Nationalism (French, German, Czech, etc.), which was a new force on the scene, crystallizing the idea that political entities might be defined by nationality (which here equals some combination of ethnicity and native language) rather than conceived of as polyglot territorial agglomerations brought about by dynastic interests. (c) Monarchic-constitutional issues, which were especially complicated and ambiguous within the \\"constitutional\\" grouping of major and minor powers known as The Holy Roman Empire (HRE).The constitutional problem was twofold. Within the small arenas of developing nation states and the yet smaller ones of traditional rulerships throughout Europe (duchies, counties, \\"free-city\\" areas ruled by town councils and mayors) contests over the basis and extent of the rulers' powers and privileges were taking place. Aristocrats, oligarchs and merchants had traditional corporate bodies (estates) reluctant to cede their own powers (taxation, the organization of military service) to a central authority. The same conflict was also being played out on the larger scale of the Hly Roman Epire, that loose grouping of special obligations and exemptions which was the final residue of an earlier system of vassalage binding together the elected Emperor (who had been a Habsburg for several centuries) and the smaller rulerships of Central Europe. The religious reforms, rebellions and wars of the sixteenth century had produced a system that appeared to resolve some of the potential problems through the won privilege of cujus regio, eius religio (\\"whoever rules, his religion [is the religion of the ruled area]\\"). In the year of the war's inception, 1618, this new balance was very fragile, comprising four Catholic and three Protestant imperial Electors. In Germany the special arrangements regulating relationships between the Emperor (resident in Vienna or Prague) and local rulers and guaranteeing a great deal of political autonomy to the locals, especially the Protestant Electors, had been somewhat codified by the Augsburg Treaty of 1555, and were known as the \\"German Liberties\\". These would prove to be especially important to the three Protestant Electors at the outset of the war.In the developing continental war one could be pro- or anti-Habsburg based on any one of the above factors or any combination of two or three of them. For example, a Catholic ruler (including the papacy) might seek Protestant allies in order to combat Habsburg territorial expansion in his direction or to combat constitutional changes in the Empire which affected his position adversely. Or a Protestant power might accept the Habsburg \\"program\\" in any given case because it did not wish to disturb constitutional arrangements that were to its advantage (this characterization is apt for Saxony and Brandenburg during the first twelve years of the war.)As Wedgwood notes, all three considerations (religion, nationality, constitutional relations) could be and were used cynically to advance the positions and interests of individual rulers and factions. From the point of view of rationality or predictability, political choices and commitments were often self-contradictory (e.g., a Catholic power supporting a Protestant venture; a German Liberties party accepting occupation by the army of a foreign power, etc.) or temporary expedients that made the overall European situation more chaotic. The war began locally in Bohemia, but its complications and consequences radiated outward as far west as Spain and England (even farther, to the Caribbean naval theater), as far north as Sweden and northeast to Poland, as far south as Italy and southeast as Transylvania; in other words, it was a European continental war with global impact.When the war broke out in 1618 it was over the Habsburg violation of a \\"constitutional guarantee\\" of religious freedom in Bohemia (the concessions stated in Rudolf II's Letter of Majesty). And here is where individual personalities and beliefs played an important role. Ferdinand II, who had knowingly violated the terms of the Letter soon after being selected by the Bohemian Diet as King (and therefore the first in precedence of the HRE Electors) was determined not only to expand the political powers of the Habsburg dynasty in Bohemia and elsewhere, he was firmly committed to the goals of the Catholic Counter-Reformation (i.e., re-Catholicizing all of the areas within the HRE which had become Protestant during the last one hundred years). When he was deposed by a special convention of the Bohemian estates (the defenestration of his deputies in Prague being the signal event of this deposition), the crown of Bohemia was offered to the Elector of the (Rhineland) Palatinate, Frederick V, who considered himself a champion of the Protestant cause. The religious zeal of these two antagonists led to extreme fixed positions at the very outset of the war.Given the other major conflict hovering in the background -- the Spanish Habsburg determination to recover the now Protestant area of the Netherlands which had become the successful and defiant (Dutch) United Provinces - the war soon became international. While the entry of France and then Denmark followed by Sweden, into the war during the 1620's changed its nature and extended its duration, Wedgwood concentrates much of her analysis on the behavior of the two Protestant Electors, Johann Georg of Saxony and Georg Wilhelm of Brandenburg and one Catholic ruler, Maximilian of Bavaria. It is her contention throughout the book that Johann Georg and Maximilian in particular could have prevented the war's spread and forced Ferdinand into a compromise very early in the course of events that acquired their own dynamism once they got out of hand. Despite their religious differences these two were always strong \\"German Liberties\\" proponents, and each had the same view of the Austrian Habsburg rulers: they should be kept for the broader protections they offered, but kept in place with respect to encroachments on the traditional rights of local rulers. In the end both of these rulers survived the lengthy war in spite of numerous diplomatic and military reversals (Saxony switched sides and joined the Swedes for several years, while Maximilian's position was constantly and secretly supported by his nominal enemies, the French, as their potential foot in the Habsburg camp.) Wedgwood believes that the price of their survival was far too costly for the rest of Germany.Wedgwood's gloss on the changing nature of the conflict is that by the year 1635 the war had become one of great-power politics, and that the earlier religious and ideological causes were losing their ability to motivate the antagonists. Her summary of the changes emphasizes the following:(a) Religion had discredited itself as a plausible source of political programs and a legitimate cause for war. Religion was becoming more interiorized and private, and losing ground philosophically and ethically to the new prestige of empirical and applied science (this was the era of Galileo and Kepler, with Descartes, Harvey, Hook, Newton, Huygens, etc. on the near horizon; a time of laboratory science and scientific societies.) As the basis of a political program religion was viewed cynically by those who saw the devastation it had brought about.(b) For thinking men, nationalism began to fill the emotional void in public life left by the withdrawal of religion as the underlying motive for political and cultural action. This was very obvious in France, but even true of Ferdinand III, for whom the new main cause was the construction of an Austrian-based hereditary monarchy whose additional obligations as the Holy Roman Imperial protector of far-flung German Catholics were no longer perceived as worthwhile. In the minds of both Germans and Austrian Habsburgs the Holy Roman Empire was becoming an honorific entity with ambiguous and weak political commitments in Germany. The Elbe-North German-Pomeranian ideal empire of Wallenstein was never again revived as a dynastic program. Austria began to move south and east (toward Italy, Croatia, and Hungary) in its expansionist aims.(c) The control of immense polyglot, multi-religious, mercenary armies and their huge camp followings had become a pressing matter of concern for all of the political authorities that hired them - they were neither religious nor national in their motives and aims and were in fact independent \\"mobile states\\" unto themselves, cynical and rapacious and often as dangerous to their paymasters as to their foes; whenever their immediate prospects for pay and maintenance looked bad, they changed sides. The most successful mercenary generals had become mini-sovereigns. Officers were all \\"out for themselves\\" and for their troops (rather than for the cause or nation of their paymaster), since without troop loyalty they had no means of personal advancement -- the most famous commanders, Ernst von Mansfeld, Wallenstein, Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, the Swedish general Wrangel, all expected (and some received) grants of territory and titles of nobility as their rewards for service. The \\"national\\" armies of conscripts that came to the fore in the 18th century was the answer to this problem.The pace of the war wound down during its last five years (although there were several major battles fought even then), which was a period of extended negotiatons in M&uuml;nster and Osnabr&uuml;ck, with the \\"final treaty\\" being signed late in 1648. For the next five years a series of conferences met at N&uuml;rnberg to implement and enforce the peace treaty and to deal with difficult problems raised by demobilizing huge armies. Many of the loans of this period, which were raised to cover the demobilization costs, were not paid off for a century. Individual rulers such as Charles of Lorraine and the Duke of Savoy (who got nothing from the treaty) refused to vacate various fortresses for five or six years, but the war did not break out again. France and Spain continued at war with each other, but not in Germany. Numerous soldiers, especially officers, went into mercenary service all over Europe. Others took to the hills as professional bandits - for the next 20 years merchants traveled through certain parts of Germany and Bohemia in armed caravans.Wedgwood accepts the more recent (1900-1930's) historical estimate that the population of the Imperial German lands (excluding Alsace and the Netherlands) dropped from about 21 million in 1618 to 13 million in 1648. The number of dislocated people was also substantial. While she acknowledges that the number of towns and villages destroyed and other \\"infrastructural\\" and economic losses were very large, she feels that all contemporary sources (e.g., the pamphlet literature of the next 100 years) exaggerated local losses, since all parties in the war continued to seek indemnities and restitution. The free peasantry benefited briefly, since landowners were desperate for manpower to restore their estates - prices fell while wages rose for a number of years, which increased the standard of living of peasants and artisans. But within a decade of the peace treaty the landowning gentry was pleading with Imperial, royal and local rulers to impose legal restrictions which would re-create bonded, serf-like conditions for peasants. Town councils now became pawns and bureaucrats of the dynastic courts of their rulers and also implemented restrictive legislations on peasants (e.g., prohibitions against mobility, domestic industry, and household craft production -- a trend which later historians refer to as \\"neo-serfdom\\"). Class stratification was as rigid as it was before the war started. There was a new, large class of mobile petty nobles and gentry seeking court-backed military and bureaucratic appointments, at the expense of town and peasant taxpayers.Germany and the Austrian-based monarchy and empire were totally excluded from the international competition to establish overseas colonies and from the developing \\"Atlantic trade\\". For a number of years the outlets of Germany's major rivers (Rhine, Elbe, Oder, and for Brandenburg-Prussia, Vistula) were controlled by foreign powers, reducing Germany's commercial strength. Hamburg was the exception, becoming the major maritime merchant city of the North Sea coast, at the expense of the other Hanseatic cities and the Scandinavian powers. The only medium-sized German state to emerge with positive prospects was Brandenburg, soon to become the administratively efficient and militarily powerful Prussia. The peace, while ending the \\"wars of religion\\", set the stage for a long series of \\"nationalistic\\" wars that subsumed dynastic and religious sources of conflict. France replaced the Habsburg Spanish-Austrian coalition as the menacing and tyrannical continental power willing to disturb the peace. Austria turned to the south and east and Spain lost its great power status and became an economic and cultural backwater. There was no politically or culturally unified Germany within the boundaries of the old Empire (French culture began to reign supreme) and the cosmopolitanism (its openness to outside influences) of this area during the 18th century, instead of being a source of pride over its achievements, became a source of lament for later cultural and ethnic purists of revived German nationalism.Author's Judgment and Conclusions: In terms of responsibility for the overall disaster, Wedgwood points to the futility and self-destructiveness of sincere religious zeal in the cases of Ferdinand II and the Elector Palatine. But, from the point of view of failures of practical (and ethical) politics, she highlights the behavior of Maximilian and Johann Georg, who could have prevented the spread of the conflict in 1620 and could have brought the war to an early end in 1635 if they had agreed to work together on a \\"unified German program\\" which would have forced Imperial compromises and concessions had they both stood behind it. Between these two she sees the Saxon as the greater victim of military circumstances (pressed by the Swedish juggernaut) and therefore less culpable for the mess, while she judges the Bavarian as too subtle and too ambitious in pursuit of his own dynastic and territorial ambitions at the expense of a general settlement good for his fellow Germans, thus identifying him as the more culpable.Beautiful in its style and concision, Wedgwood's final summary is also gloomy (as one might expect of a work completed in 1939, on the verge of World War II):\\"As there was no compulsion towards a conflict which, in despite of the apparent bitterness of the parties, took so long to engage and needed so much assiduous blowing to fan the flame, so no right was vindicated by its ragged end. The war solved no problem. Its effects, both immediate and indirect, were either negative or disastrous. Morally subversive, economically destructive, socially degrading, confused in its causes, devious in its course, futile in its result, it is the outstanding example in European history of meaningless conflict.\\""},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War (The Folio Society edition)","review":"C.V. Wedgewood wrote a good historical account of a complex historical episode. Her book, titled THE THIRTY YEARS WAR, is a \\"classic\\", and those who are interested in the Thirty Years War or diplomatic history will benefit from this book. In other words, the book is \\"timeless.\\"Miss Wedgewood begins THE THIRTY YEARS WAR with a careful account of Germany during and immediately after the Reformation. This historical phase is important if readers are to understand the complexities of the Thirty years War. Of particular note is the Peace of Augsburg which the Germans agreed to in 1555. Miss Wedgewood's assesssment of these prior events is crucial to comprehending her book as well as the Thirty Years War(1618-1648). Readers should be aware the the Germans were not politically united, and historians could easily refer to Germany as the Germanies. Miss Wedgewood emphasizes this point very effectively.Miss Wedgewood examines the political and religious status of the Germans in the early 17th. century(early 1600s). The religious and political tensions were serious, and the religious divisions between the Catholics and various Protestant sects, especially the Lutherans and Calvinists, were dangerous to say the least. Miss Wedgewood clearly informs the readers \\"who the players were.\\"The above mentioned tensions are important to further understand why \\"The Definistration of Prague\\", which occured in 1618, was such a serious diplomatic incident. The \\"incident\\" was the reason for the beginning of the Thirty Years War. In other words, this was the spark for a European and especially a German tragedy.Readers may know that the Thrity Years War gradually began as a series of conflicts which could have ended the eventual destructive nature of this war. For example, The Happsburgs, the German Cattholics, defeated the Czech Protestants at the Battle of White Mountain in 1620 which could have ended the conflict. However, the German Lutherans joined the war in 1625 only to be defeated. The Danes entered the war in 1629, and they were also defeated. The tragedy that had been incubating exploded.In 1631, the Swedes under their king, Gustavus Adolphus (1611-1632) joined the war with devestating consequences. Gustavus Adolphus was the one true religious zealot, and his religious enthusiasm only made the bloodshed far worse. He lost his life in 1632, and the Swedes lost their ruler.Some readers may be perplexed that the French under the leadership of Louis XIII (1610)-1643)and Cardinal Richleau (1585-1642) ended the Thirdy Wars Year on the \\"Protestant\\" side. The French saw this war as a dynastic war, and their fears of powerful Hapsburgs in their eastern and southern borders (German and Spain) posed a diplomatic threat. In other words, Louis XIII and Cardinal Richleau did not see the war as religious conflict. Miss Wedgewood handles these diplomatic complexities very well. One should not that the Catholic French financed the Swedish intervention until the French declared war on the Hapsburgs in 1635.Miss Wedgewood treats events after 1635 very well. The war was a stalemate which caused disaster for the Germans. Neither side could pay their mercenary troops who vented their frustrations on innocent civilians commiting rape, looting, mass murder, etc. This in turn resulted in the destruction of agriculture which caused considerable famine. Miss Wedgewood's detailed examination clearly reveals the excesses of all this tragedy which could not prevented until both sides exhausted themselves.The fact that the French used this war to exhuast their Hapsburg rivals is clear for any who reads this book. The fact that the war ended as a \\"quitters' peace\\" is also made clear. Miss Wedgewood makes a good case that the end of the Thirty Years War and Peace of Westphalia may have saved European Civilization. One should note that Peace of Westphalia (1648) was actually a series of treaties of the parties involved.With some exceptions, the Thirty Years War was the last modern war in which the Europeans fought each other and thereafter tried to avoid civilian casualties. There were exceptions of course, and the fact is ironic that this book was published just before World War II erupted in 1939.Miss Wedgewood's THE THIRTY YEARS WAR is not dated. Her thesis regarding this tragic war could be applied to most total wars. The fact that the 20th century was history's bloodiest century so far makes this book quite relevant. Her prose makes this book readable and useful. She has done detailed research, and her writing style clarifies a complex era. Her book should be on every serious history student's reading list."},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War (The Folio Society edition)","review":"Several decades after its writing this is still the most readable single-volume history of the war in English. Wedgwood's debatable opinions about the war, formed from '30's pacifism, do not intrude."},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War (The Folio Society edition)","review":"Wedgewood's &quot;Thirty Years War&quot; is the best possible introduction to this forbiddingly complex and dauntingly obscure subject. It throws brilliant light on a very murky but critical period in the formation of modern Europe and the rise of the nation-state.Although the book focusses far too narrowly on the purely German aspects of the conflict, and views the conflict overly through the prism of Catholic/Protestant dynamics (hence only 4 stars), it remains a triumph. The reason? Bravura writing. &quot;The Thrity Years War&quot; is elegant, mordant, vivid and utterly engaging. A stunning pen-portrait of the horror, foolishness, absurdity and ultimate purpose of Europe's first 'Great War'."},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War (The Folio Society edition)","review":"I knew very little about the Thirty Years War going into this one. I thought it was a predominantly German war, but beyond that I didn't know. To my surprise I learned a great deal about this ever so important war from Wedgwood's superb and well documented history.This war was a strange one in that the major players of the war kept changing sides with one another. Add to that the mercenary soldiers who would just as easily fight for either side and you have a weird interaction between opposing forces that ultimately dragged the war on longer than it probably would have. The principle aggressors, obviously, stayed their course, by the likes of Saxony, Bavaria, Brandenburg and so on oscillated from side to side. Siding with the Swedes and then against them in order to oust foreign intervention. It made for a rollercoaster of a war.Wedgwood did a fantastic job in compiling her research and then forming it in to an easily accessible narrative history. Her grasp of the nuances of specific territories made my understanding of this time period a lot easier to relate how each territory effected one another and why they ultimately were fighting. The shocker for me was reading how big of a role Sweden played in furthering the initially religious war, and then to eventually turning it in to a territorial war when France became a major player. In both the destruction caused was way over the top and extremely destructive to the land, in some case not recovering for over 2 centuries. I understood why armies did this to the lands they went through, to deprive their enemy of any sustenance or ability to harvest food or create an economy, but this war seemed to be a lot more harsh than other wars to that time.I would certainly recommend this book for any interested in time period. Wedgwood navigates through the religious and territorial conflicts that shaped modern Europe and ultimately had a large part in the wars of the 20th century.4.5 stars."},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War (The Folio Society edition)","review":"Narrating a war of this duration and complexity cannot have been easy work, and the description of Wedgwood as \\"the greatest narrative historian of the twentieth century\\" may well be justified. I cannot endorse the statement unequivocally because I have not read them all and am in any case not a historian, but this is one of the most serious and thorough works I have encountered. It is a little on the heavy side for the lay reader, although admirably clear, and I might have docked a star but for its magisterial heft.The thing that most strikes me about the book is the gut-wrenching horror of the suffering described. Wars always entail horrific suffering and in any case the life of the peasant in the Europe of the time was subject to such strictures that one can hardly imagine war making it worse. Well, imagine again, gentle reader. For 30 years of at times quite sustained conflict, vast armies encamped and decamped across Germany like a plague of heavily-armed locusts, eating the land literally bare. Such hatred was inspired that at times the armies were almost fighting a war of the combatants against the civilian population, and the protagonists struggled to feed, let alone pay, their troops. The civilians themselves, when not butchered, were subject to such hunger that they would boil leather clothing, dig up their dead or be found frozen with their mouths full of fibrous grass. Atrocities took place repeatedly. Magdeburg, in particular, was razed to the ground to the last building aside from the Church - of course - and only a small handful of inhabitants survived. I understand that the town has an air of blight to this day which I now suspect stemmed from the evil of that time. Later the taunt of \\"Magdeburg Quarter\\" was heard when Habsburg troops attempted vainly to surrender.The second thing that strikes one is the sheer complexity of the state that was known at the time as the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. The involvement of the Swedes was known to me at the time of reading as I lived for some years in &Uuml;berlingen, where Schwedentag is still celebrated. However, I was not aware of the extent to which the Empire was actually a conglomerate of tiny fiefdoms and electorates with a patchwork of different confessions. The country was not divided down the middle into Habsburgs versus Swedes and Bourbons, but made up of such tiny statelets that the addition of religious division must have resembled the scene in the Evil Dead 2 where the hero's hand is possessed by a demon and beats him over the head with a series of plates.It has to be said that while this war started as an act in the play of the Reformation, with the Defenestration and the rebellion in Bohemia, it lost some of its religious character as time went on. It was a generational war, and perhaps it is not surprising that its aims and alliances shifted somewhat. With the entry of the Swedes and then the Bourbons, it shifted from a straight counter-Reformational conflict, which might be described as the failed Last Crusade, to a war of dynasties, and the result was the final end of Habsburg dominance and the Holy Roman Empire. It might plausibly said that this war ushered in the modern world and put an end to the Middle Ages, although I am not sure that professional historians demarcate the periods thus.There are some rather dashing figures which make the book easier reading, in particular the charismatic Swedish King Gustavus, who fell in battle and without whom the Swedes were almost instantly a spent force. In one entertaining episode, we find him reconnoitring by the Danube, where he is hailed by insolent enemy troops from the other bank as to the whereabouts of their King. \\"Nearer than you think!\\" he hails back and wheels about. He is probably the nearest this dismal period of history with so many dismal leaders comes to a chivalrous knight.This is a book of grand ambition and no little corresponding success. It is not light entertainment, but if you are interested in the formation of modern Europe or the history of the Reformation this book has to be in your collection."},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War (The Folio Society edition)","review":"Excellent read for anyone from lay people to academics.

But many history books make this mistake."},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War (The Folio Society edition)","review":"Although I bought a used copy, the book was in excellent condition."},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War (The Folio Society edition)","review":"This is quite simply one of the finest works of history produced by an English or American historian during the twentieth century. It occupies a place of honor on my bookshelf alongside the works of Steven Runciman, Peter Green, and C. Vann Woodward.Wedgwood's book has three great virtues: (1) the clarity and directness of her analysis; (2) her extensive research in a wide variety of incredibly obscure sources in many different languages; and (3) her remarkable gifts as a literary stylist. She writes beautiful, classic English prose and has a genius for portraiture. Moreover, she has visited many of the sites of the events in question and her feel for the physical background of the story is a particularly engaging part of the book.To most history lovers, the Thirty Years' War is an obscure and impenetrable thicket considered too much trouble to explore. But Wedgwood recognized that it was one of the decisive episodes in early modern European history. It delayed the unification of Germany by two centuries; began the slow relative decline of Austrian power; paved the way for France's superpower status under Louis XIV; and accelerated Spain's decay into the sick man of eighteenth-century Europe.One of the other reviewers suggested that Wedgwood's account was marked at times by debatable interpretations influenced by 1930's pacifism. I can see where that idea might come from, but I disagree with it. Certainly, one of Wedgwood's concerns is why the statesmen of the time were repeatedly unable to bring an end to this horribly destructive war, which took on a life of its own that defeated the original intentions of just about all of the participants (much like the Great War of Wedgwood's youth). But in contrast to a lot of other people in England in the mid-1930's, Wedgwood recognized the Nazi regime as the unmitigated evil that it was. Her book seems to have been written in part to explore how it was that Germany's past history had produced the country's monstrous new regime.I also have a slight disagreement with the suggestion by another reviewer that Wedgwood skimps on military history. The major battles -- particularly Breitenfeld, Nordlingen and Rocroi -- are discussed here in vivid and memorable terms. But Wedgwood doesn't make dramatic battle descriptions an end in themselves. To Wedgwood, the outcome of battles is important insofar as it affected the balance of political forces and thereby made it impossible at a series of critical points to bring the war to an end.Finally, I have to quote some representative passages to show Wedgwood's gift for language and deft portraits of the major participants. This is perhaps my favorite of the latter:\\"General and private opinion flattered the archduke [Ferdinand II]'s virtues, but not his ability. Kindly contemptuous, the greater number of his contemporaries wrote him off as a good-natured simpleton wholly under the control of his chief minister Ulrich von Eggenburg. Yet Ferdinand's apparent lack of personal initiative may have been a pose . . . . He does not appear to have taken political advice from his confessors, and his subjection to the Church did not prevent him from laying violent hands on a Cardinal and defying the Pope in pursuit of what he himself felt to be right. Repeatedly in the course of his life he twisted disaster into advantage, wrenched unexpected safety out of overwhelming danger, snatched victory from defeat. His contemporaries, unimpressed, commented on his astonishing luck. If it was luck, it was indeed astonishing.\\"Here is her elegy for the power of imperial Spain following the disastrous battle of Rocroi:\\"It was the end of the Spanish army. The cavalry survived, but they were so broken in discipline and morale as to be useless without that splendid infantry which had been the strength of the army. They had not lost their reputation at Rocroy, as the Swedes had done at Nordlingen, but they had died to keep it. . . . In the centre of their position on the fields before Rocroy there stands today a little modern monument, an unassuming grey monolith, the gravestone of the Spanish army; almost, one might say, the gravestone of Spanish greatness.\\""},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War (The Folio Society edition)","review":"This is by far the best book ever written on the Thirty Years war and this judgement is unlikely to change very soon.

One might well expect that the combatants, even if they had reached no closure, would fall back exhausted. But no: there was worse to come-another 18 years of pillage and devastation until at last the participants, by now nearly bled dry, at last reconciled themselves, if not to an understanding, then at least to go home. Oddly enough the Peace of Westphalia, which at last brought the conflict to a conclusion, came in time to serve as a template for the modern political world.This latter fact might be reason enough to read C. V. Wedgewood's classic account of the conflict. But there is a happier reason, and that is that her exposition is, from start to finish, a delight. In his introduction, Grafton calls her \\"the greatest narrative historian of [the 20th Century,\\" and it is hard to quarrel with him: she is brisk precise, compassionate, mordant and energeticHaving said this, it is no contradiction to say that her story doesn't really gain traction until the coming of Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, the man who, as it is said, secured the permanent establishment of Protestantism on the continent. Gustavus is the only character to get a chapter of his own and from Wedgewood, the fullest personal description. \\"Coarsely made and immensely strong, he was slow and rather clumsy in movement, but he could swing a spade or pick-axe with any sapper in his army. ...\\" Wedgewood goes on for several pages like this. It is all good reading, and in the end, it is not quite hero-worship: no matter how much she may seem to admire Gustavus (and perhaps, to a much lesser extent, some of the other protagonists), still in the end the primary focus of her attention is on the German peasants-the poor pawns, battered and abused, in this miserable contention. Nobody knows how much population Germany lost in the Thirty Years' War: some estimates say 40 percent. Whatever the number, it is hard to imagine any feats of heroism or achievements of policy than justify all the bloodshed and is fortune.Grafton says Wedgewood writes like Gibbon. In the end she writes like herself, but against Gibbon, a better comparison might be Tacitus: Ferdinand \\"was no a clever man but he had a certain unconscious ability for appropriating the ideas of clever men.\\" John George of Saxony \\"had been known to sit at table gorging homely foods and swilling native beer for seven hours on end, his sole approach at conversation to box his dwarf's ears or to pour the dregs of a tankard over a servant's head as a signal for more. ... [H]e drank too much and too often. ... It made diplomacy difficult.\\" Gustavus (again) \\"had, like many great leaders, an unlimited capacity for self-deception. In his own eyes the Protestant champion, in Richelieu's eyes a convenient instrument against the House of Austria, he was in sober fact the protagonist of Swedish expansion on German soil. Sweden stood to gain. Protestantism stood to gain, but the German people stood to lose.\\"\\"Just imagine,\\" someone said, \\"if Gustavus had not taken a bullet at Lutzen in 1632, we might have a Lutherana Pope!\\" Maybe. Instead we are left with a heritage no less durable for being unintended: the system of nation-states, with individual sovereignty and at least the rudiments of religious freedom-also, perhaps, the notion that nothing is worth fighting for quite this much, and that we are often better off just cultivating our garden.And yet a final irony is that Wedgewood published her first edition with the echoes of Hitler's rhetoric in her ears. In an almost unexampled instance of contemporaneous comment, she remarks that \\"three centuries have smoothed every scar from [the] placid landscape, even as the philosophy of the new Germany [sc., in 1937] has submerged the spiritual landmark. \`Freedom of belief for all the world'-forgotten yearning of an age forgotten among men who have no choice but to believe what they are told.\\""},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War (The Folio Society edition)","review":"Wedgewood's history was written in 1938, when the German states were \\"reunified\\" under under Nazi rule into the \\"Third Reich\\", so she approaches the question of the 30-year civil war of the \\"First Reich\\", or Holy Roman Empire, from this perspective. She refers to the monument still standing on the battlefield of Breitenfeld, which commemorates the struggle for \\"freedom of belief\\", as a forgotten relic of a bygone age. However, she added the footnotes and the bibliographical endnote to this edition in the 1960s, so the references were updated to that time.It still has a well-deserved reputation of being a solid factual account of the war, which was insanely complex as well as terrifyingly violent. As with most historians of her era, she concentrates on the narrative facts: who raised an army from where, where they marched it to, who they met, the battles they fought, and the results. However, its great strength is that she adds short but pithy character sketches of the main protagonists, which are good enough to be helpful, and opinionated enough to be intriguing. This prevents the story from getting bogged down, and holds the reader's interest well. At times she also goes into details of the collapse of civil society, and the horrific human consequences of the war, but perhaps not as much as a more modern author probably would have.As with many popular works, she has a strong set of opinions, amounting really to a bias, but as with any popular work, this also helps to keep the reader's interest, whether you agree or disagree with her. For her, the Austrian and Imperial ruling family, the Habsburgs, can almost do no wrong. When Ferdinand II or Ferdinand III demand new rights and powers as the emperors of the the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, she describes them as taking the normal sorts of steps that political leaders did at the time, who were always seeking to enhance their own grandeur. Of course, she has a point, that we cannot so easily judge an historical political figure by the standards of our own day. Nevertheless, when anyone opposed to the Habsburgs resists, she describes them as rashly putting the unity of the German nation at risk. When anyone other than the Habsburgs seeks to enhance their own power within the empire, they are, for her, recklessly endangering the nation to further their personal ambition. Characters like Maximilian of Bavaria and Wallenstein, are, for her, acting wisely in the empire's best interests while they are fighting for the Habsburgs, but when they deviate from their alliance, they are succumbing to personal ambition and endangering the prospects of peace and Geman unity. After each great defeat for the Protestant cause, she describes their despair with gusto, and describes the elation of the Habsburgs and the Catholics with glee. When crucial battles go the other way, she often tends to mitigate the consequences.Her spin on the events does not detract however from one's enjoyment, and it is the first account of the war I have read that lays out the sequence of events with such clarity and detail. In fact, her account is factual and detailed enough for a fair observer to be able to conclude at the end, despite all her spin, that the war was started primarily by the Austrian Habsburgs' determination to enhance their power by bluster, legal pressure, and if that failed, by sheer armed violence. The Austrian Habsburgs stood firmly in the way of any peace agreement, and succeeded at different times in alienating all their supporters, including their relatives in Spain, and even the Pope. The war only finally ended when the supply of funds from the Habsburgs' Spanish colonies dried up, and the Habsburg crown was bankrupt. Even so, her criticism of the unreasonableness of the Swedes, the other German princes, the Dutch, the French, and the free German cities, is not always misplaced.As the book goes on, she gives brief descriptions of the famines, the plagues, the massacres, and the other terrifying consequences, showing the kind of pacifist sadness of the pity of war common to her era. The consequences of the Thirty Years War were so horrific that they need little embellishment to cause shock, and it almost staggers belief that a whole population of such a size could be brought to such a level of desperation and suffering. Alhtough she could have given more detail here, this kind of digression into social history was not conventional for a historian of her era, and there are many other books which cover that.I'd found Schiller's history of the war hard to follow, and Wedgewood filled the gap quite nicely. One of the best parts of the book is the first few chapters, where she gives a lively description of the constitution of the Holy Roman Empire, and a description of the constitutions of the different states, the nature of the differing religious sects, and the personalities of the main protagonists. This is essential for understanding what comes next and why people acted as they did. Without this description, the entire story is hard to follow. The book is worth getting for this section alone, but the rest is also good."},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War (The Folio Society edition)","review":"I finished this book on Dec. 21, 1968, and have never found a better book on the 30 Years War. I read 50 books in 1968 and this work won my &quot;best book read this year&quot; award. The book is full of little touches that make it more than a history, e.g.: concerning the monument to Gustavus Adophus' greatest victory, Breitenfeld: &quot;The monument still stands, set back from a quiet country road in the shade of a line of trees. Three centuries have smoothed every scar from that placid landscape...&quot; or these words on the death of Ferdinand II: &quot;On February 15(1637)at 9 in the morning his body and soul parted one from the other, the one to moulder in the vaults of Graz, the other to receive the reward for which he had laboured so long...&quot;"},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War (The Folio Society edition)","review":"This is the best single-volume account of the Thirty Years War(1618-1648). The war was very complex but Wedgwood provides singularclarity. Other interpretations are possible, but her vision is strongand memorable. The Machiavellian machinations are head-spinning, one hasto read carefully, the reward is a solid understanding of not only17th C dynastic politics but how Medieval politics operatedbefore the rise of the nation state.Wedgwood is an old-fashioned historian like Gibbon, retelling the eventsin highly-readable prose, focused on the \\"great men\\". This can beproblematic, the Thirty Years War was more than just the decisions madeby a few elites - social, economic and other forces were at work. Hersources are almost all 19th century. There are no new insights on thewar, it is a retelling of established views. As a political narrative itis not only a great work of history but also literature."},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War (The Folio Society edition)","review":"I want to first agree with what the other reviewers have said regarding the readability of the book, and Wedgwood's beautiful writing. I would like to add that for those interested in a general history that gives decent accounts of the battles, this is the book to get. Parker's book, while probably more up to date andthoroughly researched is not up to the task when it comes to detailing the fighting.I can't give it five stars as it is a bit outdated and so much new research has been published since. Still an solid general history and great choice for a first book on the subject."},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War (The Folio Society edition)","review":"This is really a quite excellent book about a difficult and confusing episode in history. Wedgwood (yes, she is related to the porcelain people) does a very admirable job of disentangling the many threads that wind their way through the events so that even a reader completely unfamiliar with the story can follow along and understand not only what happened, but to some extent why and, more importantly, what the ramifications were.That this book remains perhaps the single best work on the subject more than 70 years after it was written is a real testament to both the scholarship and writing skill that characterize it. That Wedgwood was able to write such an illuminating text while still in her twenties is all the more remarkable.If you want an introduction to a pivotal turning point in Europe's transition from the Middle Ages to modern times, you cannot do better than this book. The one caveat that makes me withhold that fifth star is that Wedgwood gives very short shrift indeed to the enormous suffering that ravaged Central Europe for the 30 years of the war. By all accounts the horrors afflicting the civilian population almost defy belief: starvation, plague, the depredations of the soldiery, massacres, cannibalism... The list goes on and on, but one would hardly know it from reading this book, which maintains a relatively high-level view of events and limits discussion of smaller events to the individual doings of the leading characters, mainly kings, emperors, and their ministers and generals. I think this approach is very helpful in terms of following the threads that give the war its wider meaning and keeping readers' focus on these, but when all is said and done I must say I came away feeling that something vital was missing. The war now seemed so orderly and clean--and utterly devoid of human presence. I wish Wedgwood had devoted a chapter to what the grand schemes meant to an ordinary citizen."},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War (The Folio Society edition)","review":"With its daunting history of the intrigues and politics of this complex period, it's hard to believe this book was written by a 28 year old woman (the V stands for Victoria - she used her initials because she felt that a woman historian wouldn't be taken seriously in 1938).As long as the reader undertands that this book focuses more on the politics and strategies of the period than the military history (and more on the northern European geopolitics than the southern), he or she will not be disappointed.The way in which she seems to get into the minds and motives of the numerous characters almost 400 years ago is nothing short of incredible."},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War (The Folio Society edition)","review":"My word, what a fine book this is! Narrative history is out of fashion, which shows what ninnies many historians are. If you don't know the basics of what happened then how can you make sense off your study of gender neutral macrobiotic armour manufacturer, from a feminist perspective, or whatever esoteric marginalia you choose to bore your doctoral supervisor with.Wedgwood has created a lasting work which makes sense of this pivotal conflict. It deserves a place on the shelves of all historians of the early modern period."},{"Title":"The Grand Unified Theory","review":"This book is a rewarding journey into a spiritual world that I (and I think most of us) want to believe exists, yet we have trouble holding in awareness for any extended period. Robert Haynes gives us all a work that holds its fixation on this spiritualism and holds us as readers there in amazement. For this, and for this alone, the Grand Unified Theory is a wonderful work of art. Haynes skillfully carries his reader up, up, and up....and holds him/her there for the duration of an exalting read. Since there is no such thing as a Grand Unified Theory in science, there may be the inkling of one in our hearts, and this books gives us a glimpse."},{"Title":"The Grand Unified Theory","review":"Simply wonderful! The author displays a wonderful wordsmithing talent. The best poems should &quot;take the top of your head off&quot; and each one of these poems does just that. What a breathtaking piece of work! I am eagerly awaiting further publications by this incredible poet."},{"Title":"The Grand Unified Theory","review":"Robert Haynes' lines, such as \\"Sometimes the grandfather clock/squawks like a crow, perched on the finial,/its wings are raised like an archangel\\" or \\"Where time and light come together--/statuesque as a physics lab\\" send the reader to galaxies that literally flip the mind inside-out--then it expands as if on an acid trip.

Chapman has the rare ability to strike a golden balance between theory and practice, and between rigour and informality, such that the theoretical actually illuminates the practical. His discussion on power transformers is the best I have seen anywhere, and he maintains that same high quality throughout the book. Along the way, he has even managed to correct a subtle misconception that I had held for several years concerning Lenz's law. The print quality is superb and the diagrams are sharp and clear. I would like to answer a comment that another reviewer had against this book, namely, that this book uses log or semilog scales. I think we should be grateful that Mr. Chapman had the good judgment to use log or semilog scales, or else we are going to have a book that is hundreds of miles long and wide!"},{"Title":"Electric Machinery Fundamentals","review":"I actually taught a junior level class from this book. I didn't like it for teaching. It felt like I was doing Electric Machinery Details, not Fundamentals. Curiously, my copy of this book has been floating around work for awhile now, and gets used quite often...mostly because it does have lots of details. Between this book and the Shaum's outline for electric power systems, it seems to get almost everything done.In short, if you could pick this book up for cheap (say below $40-$50), then I'd consider it. Otherwise I think you can collect a few other books out there out of the used sections and get the same job done.Just as a matter of record, I think more than $100 for any book is just plain outrageous (and I won't pay it). So you can use that as a gauge for how much this book is worth to you."},{"Title":"Electric Machinery Fundamentals","review":"This book (4/ed) seems like a first draft that has since been expanded (copy&paste;) and reorganized but never actually finalized. For instance, the order of presention of DC and AC machinery has been reversed since the 1st ed., but regrettably the AC material now placed first uses concepts introduced much later. The first two or three chapter are decent, but then the book falls apart, becoming more of a flawed summary of various machineries.There are numerous errors throughout; while these on their own do not significantly degrade the quality, they do reflect that little effort has been made since the first edition. The text feels superfical; it leaves very few traces of either true commitment to teaching or of genuine interest in fundamental concepts from the author. (Had the author cut down on the amount of material covered, he'd be in a better position to improve his presentation of the fundamentals in future editions.)Fitzgerald's classic Electric Machinery (6/ed) eloquently presents fundamental concepts and is better in all aspects, including the narrative."},{"Title":"Electric Machinery Fundamentals","review":"As a textbook, for the first electrical machines course, the main advantages of this book are;1- Sufficient number of worked examples and chapter end problems. 2- Sufficient number of diagrams, well selected and helpful.The weaknesses1- The typing mistakes; I have pointed more than 50 of them appeared in the second edition and, repeated in the third edition.2- The graphical solutions are not drawn with \`easy to follow' scale, especially those with log or semilog-scale."},{"Title":"Electric Machinery Fundamentals","review":"I keep falling back to this book with motor concepts.

Ms. Paley is very clear about the importance of play during the early childhood years and brings her beliefs across in a simple and convincing format. I bought a copy for each member of our team with the hope that it will illicit thoughtful discussion and lead us toward some needed changes in our views of what is significant in our relationships, interactions and guidance of young children as we make policies, and set out to prepare children for elementary school and beyond."},{"Title":"A Child's Work: The Importance of Fantasy Play","review":"After reading this book, I realized just how much pressure must be on Kindergarten teachers today. There are expectations put upon them to prepare children academically for first grade when so many of them were not prepared for today's Kindergarten in the first place. From then on, it's a snowball effect in which each subsequent teacher is trying to catch every child up on academic standards. What ever happened to preparing them for life?Einstein said, \\"Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school.\\", and this book follows that train of thought. As more time passes, play is devalued more and more... then people wonder why children have to critical thinking and problem solving skills. It's evident that so much can be learned through fantasy play and storytelling... much more than simply learning what you need to pass a test.Reading this book renewed my hope for what Early Childhood Professionals can do in classrooms to get back their roots in play. I highly recommend reading this if you work with young children or have children of your own!"},{"Title":"A Child's Work: The Importance of Fantasy Play","review":"Vivian Gussen Paley is one of the best advocates for children baing allowed to learn through play. She reminds us of how we used to learn, how we used fantasy play to calm our anxieties, and also the need for us to stop and really listen to what children are talking about. This book is a must have for parents, and teachers of children aged 0ne to eight, it offers an insight to the value of children learning to learn. Fantasy play encompasses every aspect of the curricullum and the value that should be placed in this type of play."},{"Title":"A Child's Work: The Importance of Fantasy Play","review":"At the time of writing this review, I am the only one (out of 7 reviewers) who has not raved about this book. I was very much looking forward to receiving the book, largely based on the other reviews. But when I got it, I was disappointed enough that I actually returned it. Already a believer in the importance of fantasy play, I felt Gussin Paley was preaching to the choir, and I wasn't interested in only reading transcripts from children's fantasy play. The book is very thin to begin with, but without the transcripts there wouldn't be enough to form a book. I was hoping for more insights into how to encourage group fantasy play for the children in my care and how I might direct them most efficiently. Perhaps I would be better off ordering the Tools of the Mind book."},{"Title":"A Child's Work: The Importance of Fantasy Play","review":"Used this in a college class about play!

The themes of the book are seemingly progressive compared to the current academic expectations and preparations for children in the classroom. Yet, Vivian Paley contends that our schools have actually departed from the play-based nursery school and kindergartens of the past. Throughout the book, she criticizes the disappearance of dramatic play from American schools. She feels that the absence of play has become a major obstacle in children's path to learning and asks that storytelling and play be brought back to the classroom.Dramatic play in the classroom setting is the child's \\"work.\\" As children explore character, setting and intentions, like a professional actor does, they learn more and understand more about their lives. Dramatic play teaches socialization and life lessons that children have trouble grasping otherwise. Through their difficult work, they grow as human beings."},{"Title":"A Child's Work: The Importance of Fantasy Play","review":"An inspiring book about the importance of play in pre-school, especially storytelling and dramatic play.

There were a few junkies in my units. Probably more than I knew. I remember one guy named Walker. Guys would start junkie pools and put in a $1 and pick a date when you thought he'd O.D. by.

This book spans the period of 1944 through 1990 and focuses on the lives of the participants at what appears to be a straightforward dinner party. As the evening progresses, unexpected and unusual things occur. The book goes on to tell the story of the effect these events have on the lives of those present at this dinner party.By slowly telling the story, uncovering information bit by bit, the writer creates a feeling of suspense. I was reluctant to put the book down, and felt slightly uneasy until I was able to finish it. I enjoyed the unusual characters the writer was able to create and felt that they were right at home in the setting of this novel. Mary Wesley also allows the reader to feel that they intimately know the characters by the end of the story. Somehow she is able to accomplish this with a minimal amount of detail.I totally enjoyed this book and I have no qualms about recommending it to readers who enjoy the genre of comedy of manners. I am eager to read other books written by this author."},{"Title":"Dubious Legacy","review":"This was my introduction to Mary Wesley. I liked this book very much and I intend to read Wesley's other books. A Dubious Legacy kept my interest, my attention and was responsible for the discreet smile I presented throughout its reading. For, indeed, the doings of three couples through several decades in mid 20th century -- the subject under scrutiny in this comedy of manners -- was portrayed with humorous detachment and unwavering perspicacity. Ms Wesley is very good at placing her characters within the axioms of each decade's mores and develops insightful cameos of each era's preoccupations.This is a short novel, a succinct book, developed in a fast tempo, keeping all along a mystery we hope to unveil. The central characters look at first as banal as they can be, but soon we realize appearances are misleading. These six upper middle class friends in the English country side are the source of great social commentary made by an ironic and warm narrator, a painter as it were, using few incisive strokes. The result is great fun and speedy reading, a book which I would recommend to anyone wishing to be intrigued and entertained."},{"Title":"Dubious Legacy","review":"Yes it was engaging but still strangely unsatisfying.

Surely, the \\"big bang\\" was as great an event intellectually as it was physically.There is much to commend in Farrell's collection of innocent facts in this book, but it is seriously marred by the sloppiest scholarship I have ever encountered. Viz., on p. 69 Farrell knowingly speaks of \\"Alfred North\\" Russell, whom he later describes as codeveloper of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Words fail.Again,on page 76 he gives the EFE and claims that the terms are summed over indices, which they are clearly not."},{"Title":"The Day Without Yesterday: Lemaitre, Einstein, and the Birth of Modern Cosmology","review":"This book was a joy to read. I'm an astrophysicist who does a lot of work with general relativity, and I had absolutely no clue how deep and important the contributions of Lemaitre are to my own field! What was particularly fascinating for me to see was how deeply Lemaitre's thinking was driven by data and observations. Over much of its history, general relativity has been a rather mathematical subfield of physics; it is taught in math departments rather than physics departments in many British universities, for example. It's much more common for this data-driven thinking to be applied to work in relativity today than it was in during Lemaitre's era.That's just one one thing that I was fascinated by. The book is extremely well written and enjoyable; I read it on my morning train commute to the office and nearly missed my stop several times. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in an in-depth biography of an underappreciated founder of modern cosmology and astrophysics."},{"Title":"The Day Without Yesterday: Lemaitre, Einstein, and the Birth of Modern Cosmology","review":"I strongly recommend The Day Without Yesterday to anyone with an interest in physics, astronomy and the history of the universe. As well as being an excellent layperson's introduction to Lemaitre's development of the expanding model of the universe (what has become known as the \\"Big Bang\\") it provides an excellent description of how real scientists deal with new data, theories and their philosophical implications.Up until the mid Twenties, virtually all scientists (from ancients like Aristotle and Lucretius to the greats of early and modern science such as Newton and Einstein) had envisioned an essentially static universe. Lemaitre (a World War I veteran, Catholic priest, and physics/mathematics PhD) realized that Einstein's field equations equations implied an expanding universe, which must have had its origin in a \\"primeval atom\\" containing all matter in the universe. Lemaitre also made important contributions to \\"black hole\\" theory and other areas of theoretical physics.He was appointed to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences by Pope Pius XI and was made its president by John XXIII, who also (somewhat to Lemaitre's confusion) appointed him to the pontifical commission to study birth control. (Lemaitre died well before the commission provided its report to Paul VI.)Although a certain amount of familiarity with mathematics will help, you don't need a great deal of knowledge about the field to enjoy Farrell's writing. I would class The Day Without Yesterday with books like Longitude and Galileo's Daughter, which provide a good popular introduction to an important transitional period in science while remaining accessible to the general reader."},{"Title":"The Day Without Yesterday: Lemaitre, Einstein, and the Birth of Modern Cosmology","review":"Georges Lematre may just be the Rodney Dangerfield of cosmology - he just can't get the respect he deserves [in the book I'm currently reading, it says \\"Modern cosmology is based on the big bang theory proposed by George Gamow...\\"]. _The Day Without Yesterday_ by John Farrell goes a long way towards making the case that Georges Lematre should at the least share the title of the Father of Modern Cosmology. In the book, we follow the trajectory of the life of Fra Georges Lematre, priest, mathematician, and physicist, played out against the first 2/3rds of history of the 20th Century and the history of modern cosmology. We learn of Lematre's \\"primeval atom\\" - the original version of the big bang - and his interactions [or lack thereof] with Einstein, Hubble, Gamow and others. I am pleased to report that Lematre lived long enough to hear about the discovery of the cosmic background radiation and the vindication of the big bang. Lematre is a good example of the fact that religion and science need not conflict. I highly recommend this fine book to fans of biography and the history of science."},{"Title":"The Day Without Yesterday: Lemaitre, Einstein, and the Birth of Modern Cosmology","review":"John Farrell's fascinating and compelling biography of the Belgian priest who one-upped Einstein and laid the foundation of new branch of science is simply wonderful. Written with a vibrancy that is uncommon for scientific biographies, Farrell has brought forth a true-life story of an unlikely hero who looked to the stars and found the secret of the universe. It doesn't get better than this. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"The Day Without Yesterday: Lemaitre, Einstein, and the Birth of Modern Cosmology","review":"Being undoubtedly a book on History of Science, \\"The Day without Yesterday\\" is narrated in such a delightful way that on reading it one feels like going through a very fine story, almost a novel.In his book, John Farrel places the \\"obscure\\" Belgian priest Georges Lematre in the place he deserves in concern with the make up the Primeval Atom model of the Universe, which turns out to be Big Bang theory. This is also true with respect to the so well known Albert Einstein and also to all the others who contributed to the development of today's cosmological theories. For instance, in page 98 one can read Hubble's law might just as easily have been called Lematre's law, since Lematre, although under much more theoretical terms, had proposed an equivalent velocity-distance relationship two years earlier than Hubble.Elaborated equations or heavy scientific arguments are not presented in this book, which makes it highly recommendable for anyone who is not a specialist but interested in understanding modern cosmology. Several elucidative notes and a glossary of specific terms, as well as a list of commented bibliography, are very helpful for those who may find some difficulty in dominating the inherent scientific language.Unfortunately, a few details are not strictly accurate, but surely neither they interfere with the historic and scientific coherence of the book nor do they diminish its outstanding value as a source of pleasurable reading."},{"Title":"The Day Without Yesterday: Lemaitre, Einstein, and the Birth of Modern Cosmology","review":"I checked this book out from the library in hopes of learning more about Lemaitre, and up to a point I was satisfied. Certainly, there is more biographical information about the man than I have seen elsewhere, and there were interesting sidelights about Eddington and Gamow. However, this is in no way a definitive biography, and as mentioned by at least one other reviewer, the explanations of cosmological models given are quite inadequate and downright confusing at times. This whets the appetite but does not satisfy."},{"Title":"The Day Without Yesterday: Lemaitre, Einstein, and the Birth of Modern Cosmology","review":"The most absorbing, detailed, instructive, provocative book ever published about 20th century Physics and the individuals who transformed the way in which mankind perceives the cosmos. An exciting work, a scientific biography of the first magnitude that reads like a thriller.This definitive biography illuminates the complexity of Mr. LeMaitre, who walked a tightrope between pure science and theology. LeMaitre's remarkable research shook the foundations of thought in both the hallowed halls of Science and the citadels of power within the Vatican."},{"Title":"The Day Without Yesterday: Lemaitre, Einstein, and the Birth of Modern Cosmology","review":"Hubble knew about the work of Slipher, Lematre and Einsteins. Lematre (as well as Friedmann) understood the consequences of general relativity and the big bang better than Einstein himself.Nevertheless, &#8220;Glory instead would pass to a large mass of ego named Edwin Hubble&#8221;. Bill Bryson, &#8220;A short History of nearly Everything&#8221;, Londen 2003, p. 114Farrell idientifies Lematre correctly as the real father of the &#34;Big Bang&#34;."},{"Title":"The Day Without Yesterday: Lemaitre, Einstein, and the Birth of Modern Cosmology","review":"I'm fascinated by Lemaitre. He was both a cosmologist and a priest; what a perfect person to discover the big bang. This book is mainly about his life and discoveries but also serves as a general history of cosmology. All the major players in cosmology from Einstein to Guth are included."},{"Title":"The Day Without Yesterday: Lemaitre, Einstein, and the Birth of Modern Cosmology","review":"Don't bother with this one.Let me rephrase that. I did not get anything helpful from it.I was looking for a good biography of LeMaitre... This one was not it.I found it to be very superficial; neither an in-depth treatment of LeMaitre's life nor an explanation of his theories.I must add I'm not a scientist. I enjoy reading about physics, and have a ham radio license... I can differentiate a simple function... but will never be able to discourse with my scientist relatives.Still, there is way too little explanation of the equations.The book seemed to be based largely on other peoples' biographies. I would have liked more discussion based on LeMaitre's actual works and letters.I also hate books which repeat a point over and over throughout. For example, calling Gamow an alcoholic, reminding us he died of cirrhosis, alone and isolated, and that he was from the Ukraine, was tedious.Last, in this non-prioritized list, the book's chronology was very jumpy.A good editor would never have published this thing without several serious re-writes.It's hard to believe this is the same book those other guys apparently read."},{"Title":"The domestic life of Thomas Jefferson","review":"Jefferson was a giant, and this book chronicles his extraordinary life through his letters and the letters of others, lovingly assembled and edited by his great-granddaughter. At various points, it is moving and tearful; elsewhere it is joyous and humorous. At all times, Jefferson's seemingly-unlimited talents and brilliance, as well as his qualities as a decent human being and his erudition, shine forth.The greats of American history come alive through their correspondence and Jefferson's letters to others: Washington, Franklin, Adams, Madison, Monroe, Henry and Hamilton, to name just a few. Also, Lafayette and Bonaparte of France. We witness firsthand the American Revolution, this nation's founding, Jefferson's years in Paris, the French Revolution, and his presidency.However, perhaps three things stand out most of all: the depth of his love for his family and the meticulous care with which he nurtured each family member; his love for Monticello and his desire to return there and be rid of the burdens of public office; and his relationship with John Adams that, once breached, is finally restored at the end of their lives.Remarkably, both presidents died on the 4th of July, 1826. To paraphrase the words of Jefferson, two \\"Argonauts\\" sailed on, leaving this country forever changed and better because they had passed here. \\"I steer my bark with Hope in the head, leaving Fear astern,\\" Jefferson wrote to Adams in 1816. From being Secretary of State and Vice President to two terms in the presidency, involving the Louisiana Purchase and the Lewis and Clark Expedition, Jefferson never lost his love for or his belief in this great country.He was a farmer; he was a scholar; he was a scientist; he was a diplomat; he was a leader and a politician; he was an accomplished horseman who was faithful to his belief in the need for at least two hours of exercise each day; he was a husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather; and he loved music, birds and his gardens in Albemarle County, Virginia. And he was an American."},{"Title":"The domestic life of Thomas Jefferson","review":"This biography was written by Jefferson's grandaughter to show &quot;the beauties and charms of his domestic character.&quot; It is primarily through using his letters, which include over the years, those to his daughters, grandchildren, his sons-in-law, Layfayette, John Adams, Madison, lady friends in France, and others. The circumstances under which these were written are described.Interesting to me were new insights into why Jefferson continued to serve in politics when he found it repugnant, his observations about the the French Revolution and Napolean, and his great affection and fatherly advice on health, education, and character building found in the letters to his daughters, and some grandchildren. In one instance, he discusses raising chickens. He also describes the pain of losing his wife and child, and a grandchild, to Abigail Adams.Puts a little more flesh on the events, and on a giant of the 19th century. Good book to read in spirts."},{"Title":"PERDITA'S PRINCE (Georgian Saga)","review":"A study of family genealogy often explains the present-or in this case, the past.In late 1700s George, Prince of Wales, was every bit the scandalous Prince Charming, the lover of older, married women that his great-great-great nephew, the Duke of Windsor, was. George, who later became King George IV, even tossed over his mistress, Maria (Perdita) Robinson, in the same manner that the Duke of Windsor got rid of one of his mistresses. He wrote her a letter and refused to take her calls.In both cases, the princes had a morally upright, dull father who never cheated on his wife. Filial rebellion and serial adultery are long-standing traditions in the British royal family.In this book Jean Plaidy highlights the life of Perdita Robinson, George IV's first serious fling in a life full of flings. In it, she tells a lot about the character of George IV and sets the stage for &quot;The Sweet Lass of Richmond&quot; and &quot;Indiscretions of the Queen.&quot;Plaidy does us all a service by writing easy to read, entertaining novels about the British monarchy."},{"Title":"PERDITA'S PRINCE (Georgian Saga)","review":"George, Prince of Wales (later George IV), rebels against his puritanical father as soon as he is able. He takes mistresses, eats and drinks to excess, gambles, and joins forces with his father, the King's, enemies, the Whigs. Soon, Charles James Fox and William Brinsley Sheridan are running his life. Then, one night at a performance of Shakespeare's &quot;A Winter's Tale&quot;, he sees Mary Robinson playing Perdita. She becomes George's first official mistress, among several in his lifetime.This book gives an accurate portrayal of aristocratic life in the eighteenth century. It also gives you an inside look to the lives of some of England's most celebrated personalities. Although many of the characters could hardly be called admirable, this book is an excellent choice for anyone interested in the time period or English history in general."},{"Title":"PERDITA'S PRINCE (Georgian Saga)","review":"Prince George, George and Charlotte's first born, was chomping at the bit to get away from his saintly parents. He was tired of being cooped up and not allowed to do anything, which, to him, basically meant gamble, womanize, drink etc.His parents try to mitigate this by taking him to the theatre. For him to be seen by the public and show people he was in their favour. Little did they know George would fall in love with the actress on stage and cause them many a night sleeplessness.Mary Robinson, the actress, has already had adventures of her own by the time George spies her and, after some thought, moves into this one with the Prince of Wales. Plaidy spends adequate time on her life before George and shows both of their personalities very well. Perdita's as a bit over the top and George as a young man eager to explore where he will.It's a love story, finally, but it's not to last. George has no notion of fidelity, though he maintains he does, and after a bit drops Perdita, who has no intention of letting him go without a bit of a fight.This book is ok. I'm not one for love stories, and while this one is, it's not lovey dovey. Plaidy does a good job setting you up for the actions of Prince George is subsequent novels, so this one is important to really get the full story straight. I felt it did linger in places where it could have moved on so that's why it got a three from me, but it's a pretty high three. Worth a read."},{"Title":"Hidden Wisdom in the Holy Bible (Quest Books)","review":"If you think, like the author, that the bestselling and most widely read book of all time cannot be understood without exploring the hidden meanings behind the words, parables, stories, prayers and sections -- then this is your book. It is simply astounding that modern bible study manages to miss so much of the fundamental original meanings about life and death, good and evil, God and Humanity, Person and Planet, etc....but this book goes a long (in fact a very long) way in getting down the road of deeper understanding of the esoteric meanings behind such dramatic mooments as those that took place in Bethlehem or on Golgotha."},{"Title":"Hidden Wisdom in the Holy Bible (Quest Books)","review":"If I may make a quick addition to the other review here, in reference to the great white brotherhood. Among those who study western occultism, the phrase \\"Great White Brotherhood\\" is a common phrase.It is generally a refrence to those various groups, fraternities, and organizations which (while different) all share a number of qualities which aim at the perfection of mankind and ultimately in enlightenment. Various groups such as the rosicucians and others have been said to be part of the great white brotherhood. The use of the word white has nothing to do with any racial remark, but rather to the white of purity of soul. And brotherhood refers to a collection of like-minded individuals, and not to a fraternity (women are of course a part of the \\"brotherhood\\").Ultimately, many people have viewed the Great White Brotherhood also to include those individuals who have attained enlightenment, and who continue to try and aid humanity today from other realms of existence.It is unfortunate that hate groups have caused people to hear this phrase and immediately think about the worst of things. :("},{"Title":"Hidden Wisdom in the Holy Bible (Quest Books)","review":"Any serious Bible student is already aware of the grave inconsistencies that the Bible contains. For instance: The supposed \\"Virgin Birth\\" is grossly contradicted by the geanology of Jesus, as recorded in the first chapter of Matthew, which clearly specifies David's lineage culminating in Joseph, NOT Mary. When a literal translation is insisted upon, (religious dogma) the real truth (behind the allegory, symbology, numerology, indeed even absurdity)... is surely missed. According to Hodson (and I fully concur) the writers of the sacred text wrote in such manner as to conceil and reveal simultaneously, the eternal salvavic truths. After interpreting the Bible (and other world scriptures which contain many of the same myths!!) based on the KEYS of the sacred language, much of the discord between the apparent contradictions vanishes. This book offers such keys and compels the reader to a higher overstanding.What is most interesting to me personally is Hodson's use of the term \\"Great White Brotherhood of Adepts\\", of which I am yet at a loss. It is evident through the writers references and perspective that he is a white man... examplified with his reverence for Greek Mythology (stolen) and his use of the above term. He tries not to give credit to the African origins of the Ancient Wisdom... Yet is unable to deny the historicity that the Egyptians (and even earlier races of black peoples) possessed the Ancient Wisdom and that Kemet was home to the Mystery Schools of Initiation thousands of years before there was such a Caucausoid Race!This book is insightful and reminds us that the real enemy is selfishness, and the illusion of separateness from the Divine.

I enjoyed Bree Hart's character because she did things just fo the excitment of it. The part that bothered me was when Graham and Bree started to fall in love. It got REALLY corny after that. I'm not saying this to down anyone, but thing don't always end up in marriage. In my opinion the story was a little unrealistic. Like I said before, it was a good book, but I expected more from it."},{"Title":"Love On the Run (Arabesque)","review":"I have previously read &quot;A Forever Passion&quot; which introduces the Hart family. That book tells the love story of Marcus Hart and Sydney Tanner (excellent book too!). &quot;Love on the Run&quot; continues the Hart family saga with the love story of the youngest child, Gabrielle &quot;Bree&quot; Hart. In this book, Bree escapes her overbearing family for New York City. Her plan is to prove to her family, especially her controlling mother, Victoria, that she can live her life on her own terms. While in New York City, she discovers that her family has hired college professor, Graham Lane, to bring her home. But when she finds out he is investigating who framed his sister in an insider trading scandal, Bree is determined to help him solve it.This was an excellent book, which I definitely recommend to readers who love a good plot. I do, however, suggest that everyone read &quot;A Forever Passion&quot; before reading this book. You will be able to understand each character better."},{"Title":"Love On the Run (Arabesque)","review":"This is the sequel to &quot; Forever Passion&quot;, and it was wonderful. Well worth the wait! It had just the right amount of suspense and romance. Bree was a spitfire and Graham was just what she needed to slow her down. The corporate scandal was a nice touch. A little confusing, but it did add some depth to the story---not just a sappy love story. It was great visitng the Hart clan again. I can't wait for the third installment of the Hart family saga.

Historically astute as I am, I've found the Flashman papers an easy and enjoyable method with which to buff up on history in the 19th century. This is my third encounter with Flashy. Had a blast with each one, but the subject matter in Freedom was somewhat more familiar than the first (Flashman) and second (Royal Flash) offerings. Fine with me, I learned much in the first two. Not for the squeamish or prudish, Flash finds his way to America aboard a slave ship and works his way North on the underground railroad. Coward that he is, Flashy let me down in the final packages. What a cur! Regardless, I'll continue with his exploits and let you know how he's doing. All for now... ta-ta."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"Fraser is at his best when Flashman is woven into intricate plots involving detailed historic events. Less interesting, boring, when involved in general history. This and \\"...Angel of the Lord\\" I find to be his two worst books."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"In the 3rd installment of the Flashman novels, Harry Flashman (rogue, dandy, coward) takes on the mid-19th century trans-Atlantic (and within-America) slave trade from pretty much every angle. Although I thought it was not among the best of the Flashman books, it's great entertainment, and provides a great &quot;feel&quot; for the period. Who other than Harry Flashman could, in the space of a few months, inadvertantly find himself chatting with a young Disraeli, then a young Lincoln? And then (who knew??) provide inspiration for &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot;? And meanwhile be a slave buyer, slave stealer, slave emancipator, slave protector and, well, slave, while still being the irrepressible Flashy (oh, yeah, not for kids or for the easily offended). A fine book -- lots of fun."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"Flashman is shown at his vile best in this installment of his saga. Signed unknowingly onto a slave ship by his malicious father-in-law to get him out of the country following a scandal, Flashman plunges up to his whiskers into that century's nastiest business. Sailing under an insane, Latin-quoting captain, who brings his tea-serving, equally insane wife along for the voyage, Flashy's misadventures take him from the Slave Coast of Africa to the whorehouses of New Orleans, from the back roads of Mississippi to the frozen Ohio River. Fraser's research into the slave trade is compelling; this is one of the more detailed fictionalizations of the slave trade in most of its horrors that I've ever read. The author gets credit for layering his dark satire onto this diciest of subjects, not something every author would have dared, and not sparing it in the least. It is, of course, almost the perfect vehicle for Flashman's unPC sensibilities, if the reader will forgive the anachronism. His encounter with Abraham Lincoln is absorbing even while satirical; Fraser presents a Lincoln with a frontier-tuned wit that penetrates further than can the capital's shallower sophisticates ."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"Harry Flashman, the lovable misogynist, blackguard, cheater, liar, adulterer and above all coward, has returned in another rollicking adven- ture by George MacDonald Fraser.Shanghai-ed aboard a slave ship by his miserly Scottish father-in-law, Flashy soon finds himself smuggling &quot;black ivory&quot; across the Atlantic. Caught by the Yankee Navy, he masquerades as an abolitionist agent fighting the slave trade from within--and finds himself running slaves once again, this time north on the &quot;Underground Railroad&quot; to freedom. The author manages to create a story that is at once humorous, bawdy, witty, poignant and historically accurate. A must-read."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"Unbelievably funny. From the first brilliant sentence, we have the pleasure of being witness to a series of non-stop, hilariously horrendous mishaps visited upon poor, despicable Harry Flashman. The plot is as tight and the writing as crisp and witty as any book in the series.In \\"Flash for Freedom\\", MacDonald Fraser puts old Flashie through a wringer as incredible as it is unbelievably harsh. From a high-powered political house party, during which he puts the moves on Fanny Duberly and makes mildly anti-Semitic comments to future PM Disraeli, Flashman is politically ruined when he almost murders a man, is then forced by his malicious Scotch father-in-law to lay low on what Flash later discovers is a slave ship, goes on a slaving expedition in Africa, fights the American Navy, is coerced by the Underground Railroad into running a supercilious slave to freedom up the Mississipi, then becomes a slave driver on a Southern plantation, eventually being forced into slavery himself, subsequently escaping to freedom with an attractive octoroon, inspiring \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" and running into Abe Lincoln along the way. MacDonald Fraser somehow makes it all seem plausible. Phew! As usual, we learn a good deal about history. Although Flashman couldn't give two pence about slavery, GMF paints a vivid picture of the brutality and corruption of the institution, while pointing out the necessary complicity of the Africans themselves and the naive romanticsm of the Abolitionists towards the slaves. John Charity Spring, one of the best characters in the Flashman series, is introduced in this novel. As with all of these books, you'll learn something through your laughter."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"Fraser has created another excellent Flashman adventure. The first half (or so) of the book concerns how Flashman ends up serving unwillingly in the crew of a slaving ship (after running afoul of his despicable father-in-law). The second half of the book - a bit weaker than the strong first half, I think - involves Flashman's exploits in the American South after he gets dragooned into helping the Underground Railroad. Flashman encounters a soon-to-be retiring Congressman Lincoln a couple of times during the course of the novel, and these scenes should be fun for fans of Abe.The plot is strong, the pacing very fast, as we've come to expect from Flashman, and the dialogue is lots of fun. Fraser's historical accuracy is as good as ever. This is the third Flashman book I've read, and it's almost as good as the first book in the series (\\"Flashman\\"), which I liked quite a lot, and it's considerably better than \\"Royal Flash,\\" the second book in the series. I'd recommend \\"Flash for Freedom\\" to anyone who's enjoyed the series so far. As with other Flashman books, if you're easily offended by bawdy - though not obscene by any stretch - language or activities, you should take a pass on this one."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"Accused (falsely, amazingly enough) of cheating in a friendly game of cards, the Victorian rogue Harry Flashman injures the accuser in a rage. His reputation damaged, Flash joins a ship's crew until the scandal cools down - only to realize to his horror (his own neck being on the line, of course) that it's a slave ship. Here begin Flashy's adventures on the high seas and America, where at various times he is dragooned and bluffs his way into nearly every role concerning the slave trade: buyer, trader, seller, driver on a plantation, underground railroad smuggler, anti-slavery double agent, almost even a slave himself at one point. It's all tremendous stuff, full of the usual (on Fraser's part) erudtion and wit and (on Flashy's part) lechery, as well as, of course, the historical tweaking: Flashman meets a young Disraeli, a young Lincoln, and even serves as the inspiration for Harriet Beecher Stowe's famous book. Superb historical parody, historical fiction, and pure entertainment all in one. Oh, a final thought: Flashy's definitely gotten a lot braver since the first book. Scared or not, it takes guts to pull a gun on a killer, or even keep one's wits enough to play-act in the face of danger. That's most likely a good thing, of course; as a reader, one can take only so much helpless, quivering terror from the narrator."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"If you are easily offended, then you will probably be offendedby &quot;Flash for Freedom,&quot; but if you are in search of well-written, yet hilarious historical fiction, then Flash is yourman. Be forewarned though, if you are not careful you willlearn more about history from this book than any textbook."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"I can certainly see why some readers of this book have been put off by the difficult (and frought) subject matter; or rather by its treatment. Fraser's interpretation of these events, as revealed by his cynical and self-serving narrator can be challenging and unsettling. In FLASH FOR FREEDOM we are presented with a panoramic view of the slave trade both as an (horrific) economic process and as an expression of a deeply ingrained racism born out of what we now refer to as \\"Imperialist\\" attitudes.But before you write this book off as a thinly veiled excuse for a misplaced and romantic nostalgia for an earlier age, take a moment and consider the not inconsiderable achievements in storytelling that the author has accomplished here. After all, something as fundamentally wrong as the slave trade required certain social and economic conditions to develop and to flourish. This, it seems to me, is one of Fraser's great strengths as a writer of so-called \\"historical fiction\\". More than most contemporary writers, he is able to divorce himself from the compulsive moralising that afflicts much of our public language today (not an offence in itself, except that most of it reeks of crowd pleasing \\"correctness\\" and insincerity), and recreate not only the events of an earlier age, but the attitudes that helped to foster them. We may find many of these repugnant by the standards of our own self-declared enlightenment, but it doesn't make them any the less true.Therefore, the question becomes, \\"Does the author endorse or fail to codemn the brutailty that the novel graphically details?\\" The answer to this it seems to me is readily accessible in the text and in the working out of the plot. Without wanting to give anything away, as much of the fun is lies in its suspense, the final stages of Flashy's nightmare journey and his reaction to these events serve to personalise the full horror of the slave system and bring home the extent of its barbarity. If our narrator doesn't manage to summon up much sympathy for anyone but himself, well, Fraser is remaining true to Flashy's essential character - as he should. Anything else would be unconvincing.What I really like about Fraser as a storyteller is his ability to spin a rattling good \\"yarn\\" that moves at a pace, his apparently effortless skill with language (and period language in particular), his ability to create lively and interesting characters and the depth of his research. So many recent attempts at historical fiction fail in one or more of these areas that I find myself to be immensely grateful to be in the hands of a master of the genre.And Flashy remains, despite (or perhaps, because of) his apalling behaviour, a narrator of great interest. I couldn't help but feel sympathy for his plight and curiosity for his fate - although were he a personal acquaintance I wouldn't trust him with either my credit card or my girlfriend! What's more, Fraser has the rare skill of creating a varied cast of interesting and well drawn supporting players, from the monstrous to the heroic, and all shades in between. Even well known historical figures get their turn, and the author can throw a surprising light on them as well.Highly recommended if you want your historical fiction to be more than just a grisly picture postcard of an earlier age. I look forward to many rereadings of the books in this wonderful series."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"One of the finest in what is likely the greatest series of historial comic novels ever. Harry Flashman is one of Victorian England's most decorated heros and its most craven coward and in this book finds himself unwillingly thrust headlong by his own Scottish merchant father-in-law into the slave trade. During this book, Flashy poses as slave raider, government anti-slave agent, overseer and slave stealer. As always, Flashy's quest to entrench himself in the Garden of Earthly Delights along with his unrivaled ability to create enemies propells him from a quiet card game with Disraeli and friends inexoribly along a twisted and tortuous road that will continue on to Africa, Cuba and New Orleans and in other novels will find him accompanying John Brown on the Harper's Valley raid (Flashman and the Angel of the Lord) and eventually to the Battle of the Little Big Horn (Flashman and the Indians) which he survives to his own great astonishment. Among the cast of unforgettable characters he meets is the mad cashiered Oxford Don and slave ship captain, John Charity Spring, who lashes his crew with the cat and numerous classic Latin quotations. Abraham Lincoln makes several unforgettable appearances as well. Not for the prudish or the PC crowd, but there's scarcely any equal to it for both enlightenment and entertainment."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"Harry Flashman, England's most irrepressible scoundrel, is back for more international adventures. Flashman meets all the greats in this superb historical novel from the future British Prime Minister Disraeli to the future American President Lincoln. Fraser makes things consistent, I'll give him that. Flashman is still looking out for, well Flashman, but somehow he ends up winning accolades for committing criminal acts that seem to somehow get misinterpreted. Not that Flashman minds or cares mind you. The novel centers around the issue of slavery during the mid-19th century before the American Civil War. Flash for Freedom is another example of historical story-telling that is packed with real events. Losing his chance at a political career, Flashman is forced to join a ship of slavers headed for West Africa. Flash makes eyes at an alluring Amazon there and then finally ends up in New Orleans. Posing as a dead naval officer, Flashman manages to lie and cheat his way across the country with nothing on his mind except vengeance against his miserly father-in-law and getting into the pants of every half-way decent woman he encounters. Filled with twists and turns, you'd think ol' Flashy was done for except for the fact that he is writing this posthumously sometime in the future when he has become an aged Flashman. This book has it all with lots of adventure, romance (well sex anyway), intrigue, humor, drama, and much more. Highly recommended for those interested in history or those who just want to read the adventures of a lousy no-good scumbag who somehow manages to get us to root for him!"},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"Hope this review survives since the first did not.The notorious Flashman meets his matches (John Charity Spring, M.A. AND Abraham Lincoln)while precipitating the American Civil War.

Set in the deep south before the end of slavery, it is an education about that part of the world before the Civil War, and also allows Flashman's casual brutality, cowardice, and cunning to really come to the fore.Read something recently that reminded me of Flashman,Hong Kong 97, A Corporate Satire. This book is set in Hong Kong in the 1990s, but the main character is a manager working for an American company. Hilarious."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"There aren't many public school novels being written and read these days. Rowling's Potter-series is an exception (and in my opinion they are not all that good). However if you are old enough to have readTom Brown's School Daysthen the Flaashman series may be of interest. If you have enjoyed Kipling's Indian stories then Flashman is also worth a try."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"Having become completely hooked On George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman series I am determined to read them all in sequence. This is the 3rd installment of the Flashman papers which follows Flash as he is forced unawares to work on a slave ship in order to escape prison in England. From there his adventure leads him to the African coast and ultimately to some close calls and narrow escapes in the United States. Along the way he meets runaway slaves, American bushwackers, New Orleans whores and even a certain congressman from Illinois with a nose for falsehood and a bright future.Flashman is a Victorian era rogue who does whatever it takes to survive the most treacherous and dangerous circumstances as he provides both a colorful and somewhat fanciful view of the world in the 1840s and 50s. Every volume I've read so far has been entertaining and often very funny.What sets Flash For Freedom apart from the first two volumes is Fraser's vivid description of the horrors of the slave trade . For what is essentially a comic novel the scenes of brutality depicted in Africa , aboard ship and then again in the US as Flashman encounters the cruelty of the pre-civil war south are as realistically portrayed as any I've come across in literature of a more serious nature. The genius of Fraser's writing is the ability to expose and shock with historical accuracy while still entertaining by providing Flashman as an impartial self-interested rogue always on the lookout for a good time in even the most dire circumstances. On to volume four."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"I consider \\"FLASH FOR FREEDOM\\" to be one of George MacDonald Fraser's better works. First of all, I thought it took a great deal of guts on his part to write a serio-comic story that featured African slavery or race in the 19th century American South as its main theme. The only other works of art that I can recall that dared to even touch upon the subject seemed to be an episode of \\"BEWITCHED\\" called (5.02) \\"Samantha Goes South For A Spell\\" in which Samantha Stevens ends up trapped in 1868 New Orleans, the 1971 movie \\"SKIN GAME\\" and its 1974 remake, \\"SIDEKICKS\\". And despite the novel's grim subject matter, Fraser provided some very funny moments. However, the one aspect that really stood out to me was the novel's collection of some of the most interesting fictional characters created by Fraser. Yes, the novel had its share of historical figures like Benjamin Disraeli, King Gezo and Abraham Lincoln. But the fictional characters proved to be the novel's finest assets. Fraser introduced his readers to characters like the imbecilic and pathetic Looney, the Dahomey Amazon that took in interest in Flashy, the intense and enthusiastic Underground Railroad agent Mr. Crixus, the conceited and self-involved George Randolph, the ever suspicious slave trader Peter Omohundro, the pathetic Mandeville and his cold and controlling wife Annette, and the brutish slave catcher Buck Robinson. But two characters stood above the rest. They were the beautiful, yet ruthless and determined fugitive slave, Casseopeia; and the psychotic master of the Balliol College slave ship, Captain John Charity Spring. In fact, I would say they were among the best of Fraser's creations.However, the novel had its share of flaws. Its description of the Underground Railroad was historically incorrect. Most of the African-American characters were poorly conceived, with the exception of two that happened to be light-skinned. And the novel's second half seemed to be marred by uneven pacing.Fortunately, the virtues outweighed the flaws. Fraser did an excellent job of creating semi-humorous story from the grim topic of slavery. The story had its share of drama and action. It provided a detailed account of the Atlantic slave trade during the mid 19th century. And the novel also featured some of the most fascinating fictional characters in the entire FLASHMAN series. In the end, I believe it is one of the best novels written by George MacDonald Fraser."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"Our intrepid hero, Harry Flashman, is back for volume three of the Flashman Papers, a narrative of the life and times of one of the most ne'er-do-well wastrels to ever grace the pages of a published autobiography.This installment picks up where the second volume left off; Harry returns from his Continental adventures, having matched wits with one of the greatest statesmen of the 19th century, Otto von Bismarck, and changed the course of European history as a result. Soon, however, Flashman once again finds himself in a pickle, as a result of his roguish behavior. Forced to flee polite society until the resulting scandal blows over, Flash is relegated to crewing aboard a slaver, as it plies its trade on the African subcontinent and into Caribbean waters.Following capture by the U. S. Navy, his adventures continue in the American South, where he is constantly on the move, just one step ahead of his presumptive captors. As has become the custom in Harry's autobiographies, well known historical events pepper his experiences, as Abraham Lincoln plays a starring role in this adventure.As in the previous two Flashman novels, our Harry is revealed as the premier coward and opportunist of his era; faults which he quite willingly admits and even boasts of. In one of his numerous, desperate scrapes, his self directed exhortation captures the true Flashman spirit:\\"...-bristle up the courage of the cornered rat, put on the bold front, and to hell with them. Bluff, my boy- bluff, shift and lie for the sake of your neck and the honour of Old England.\\"Uproariously funny and entertaining, this installment is every bit the equal of its predecessors."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"Harry Flashman, bully, undeserving hero, and cad, is forced to leave England on the sudden after a fight over a card game. He lands on the ship of what may be Fraser's best original character, former Oxonian and classics-quoting slave ship Captain John Charity Spring. When the ship is captured in the Gulf of Mexico after doing a slave run, Flashy changes sides with his usual elan, and is brought to America as a minor hero. He soon finds himself facing an uncommonly bright young Congressman from Illinois, one of the few people ever to see through Flashy, who will meet him again during (the as-yet-unpublished, alas) Flashy's Civil War experiences.A delight, as we get to watch Flashy rogue his way through stunning dangers, as Fraser gives us detailed pictures of the 19th century slave trade, the South, and the Underground Railroad.

Live forever, Harry &amp; George! (And keep writing)"},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"Having recently returned from his stint as the fake consort to the ruler of a German dukedom, and having survived a series of encounters with the young Bismarck, Capt. Harry Flashman is back in London and taking it easy. He's playing cards one evening at a country house (in a company including Benjamin Disraeli, no less) when he's set up by an old enemy with a grudge (which Flashman brought on himself, as he usually does) -- and suddenly he's accused of cheating and of attempting to murder his accuser. Unfortunately (or perhaps not), his hypocritical Scots father-in-law is also present and manages to get him out from under, and send him out of the country for awhile until the whole thing blows over. And Flashman finds himself as supercargo on a blackbirder, heading down to Dahomey for a cargo of slaves, thence over the Middle Passage to the Caribbean. Not that Flashman has any particular scruples about slavery as such, but it's definitely a hanging offense if they're caught by the Royal Navy. Fraser relates all the adventures that follow, from the squadron of lethal Amazons from whom they must flee in Africa, to their capture by the U.S. Navy off the American coast, to his impersonation of a Royal Navy officer working undercover against the slave trade, to his escape from the government in New Orleans, to his impressment by agents of the Underground Railroad, to his own flight up-river. And that doesn't even mention his stint as an overseer on a Mississippi plantation, his hooking up with a beautiful runaway quadroon, his flight over the ice floes on the Ohio River, or his two run-ins with Congressman Abraham Lincoln. All in all, Fraser maintains his usual break-neck pace and Flashy comes out ahead of the game -- more or less.Still, there's something about this outing that puts it well below the level of the other narratives in the series. Perhaps it's that the author's depiction of the American antebellum South hits too close to home. On the other hand, while I have no illusions about that time in that place, Fraser seems to think all Southerners behaved like, and shared the political and social opinions of, the worst of the slaveowners -- which is not the case, any more than all Southerners today are ignorant, NASCAR-worshiping rednecks. It may also be that, not being British, and having no personal experience of India or Afghanistan, I'm simply not aware of how Fraser's noteworthy political incorrectness would strike a modern education resident of Delhi. Anyway. While there's considerable action and adventure here, the book left me rather unsatisfied."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"As with all the Flashman Papers I enjoyed this adventure. I am still confused about the chronological sequence of GMF's books.I can't seem to locate one that deals with the Civil War, where Flashman was supposed to have interacted with the Generals of that era. Several references are made to activity during that time, but I can't find any expanded version...I have now read all the Flashman series and can't find one that deals specifically with the Civil War. Very confusing."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"Flashman, his credentials are lying, cheating, womanizing, cowardice and incredible honesty! This is a rollicking romp through the American slave trade era. Besides an entertaining read it is factual, well researched, and ... well ... almost educational.Good historical fiction moves a character through real historic events, providing insight as well as information. Fraser is a past master."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"The Flashman name has become synonymous with cynical tales of military history in the Victorian era. Because of this, it's easy to forget that several of MacDonald Fraser's Flashman books do not actually deal with any Victorian era conflict at all, and the third packet of the Flashman papers is one of these.At first glance, buffs of British military campaigns might be disappointed that no military conflict forms the background to \\"Flash for Freedom!\\" Yet the story remains one of the most interesting and well-told of the 12 book series, with Flashman in fine fettle as the cowardly anti-hero. There is a background to this story however, and that is the 19th century Atlantic slave trade. Flashman finds himself alternately running slaves, driving them, selling them and smuggling them to freedom, all of which duties he executes with his usual selfish, and entertaining, disregard.MacDonald Fraser carefully places Flashman in such a variety of situations as to give a fairly comprehensive picture of the state of slavery at the time, from London to the African coast, from Havana and across North America, making the book as interesting and educational as any the author has written. This backdrop gives the story a depth that may otherwise be quite missing. In the foreground, our anti-hero continues to whip, whine, wheedle, and romp his way through a series of successive adventure scenes, serving to make the book quite as action-packed, not to mention as funny, as any experiences described in any of the other books.While none of the Flashman books make quite as compelling reading as those dealing with the British presence in India (having served in India himself, MacDonald Fraser was probably able to give these books a much greater depth of detail and emotion) \\"Flash for Freedom!\\" nevertheless takes a well-deserved place amongst the best of the rest. Highly entertaining, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"Given that my introduction to the Flashmen series almost coincided with the tragic (although not unexpected) death of George Macdonald Frasier I have made it my news years resolution to let people know about his wonderful books.They wouldn't be good without the main character Sir Harry Flashman VC; who without ever really meaning to became the most highly decorated solider of the Victorian Era. This is all of course just a byproduct of his attempts to save his own worthless hide, with the reader cheering him all the while. They are also outstanding in their great attention to historical accuracy backed up with a large amount of footnotes.This particular installment \\"Flash for Freedom\\" involves a particular set of circumstances whereby Flash is forced out of London and takes passage to America on a slave smuggler under the command of the dubious personage of one \\"John Charity Spring.\\" He meets some notable figures of the time most famous of who is probably a young Mr. Lincoln.

For example, Flashy observes as his slave ship slips down an African river: \\"[Captain] Spring knew his business; he took the wheel himself, and with only the foretopsail spread we drifted slowly between the green banks, the leadsmen chanting quietly, and the first hint of dawn beginning to lighten the sky over the black jungle mass astern. It was a queer, eery business, gliding so silently along, with only the mumble of the slaves, the creak of rope and timber, and the gurgle of water to break the stillness; and then we were clear of the last banks and the sun shot a great beam of light ahead of us across the placid surface of the sea.\\" A really fun read!"},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"Flash for Freedom! is the third in the Flashman novels by British author George MacDonald Frazer (1925-2008). The novel was first published in 1975.The Plot: Harry Flashman is relishing in the fame he has won for his exploits in the First Afghan War. At home in London he learns his unfaithful wife Elspeth is pregnant. His father-in-law does not like Flashman. When Flashman is accused of cheating at cards at a fancy British home it is father-in-law Morrison who orders Flashman to go abroad until the dust from the scandal dies down. Morrison is part owner of a slave ship captained by the eccentric Captain John Charity Spring. Spring is a classical scholar but a cruel master to his slaves. Flashman is taken on as a crew member on the ship called\\" Balliol College.\\" The vessel travels to the West Coast of Africa where over one hundred male and female slaves are taken aboard. The Middle Passage is described by Frazer in horrifying details. The British deal with Chief Gezo who sells the slaves to them. The African scenes are vivid and terrifying as the sailors must escape from the Amazonian warriors launched against them by Gezo. This section of the novel reminds this reader of Alex Haley's book \\"Roots\\".The ship arrives in America but is captured by the United States Navy. Harry Flashman escapes. He travels to Washington D.C. where he first encounters Abraham Lincoln an anti-slave congressman from Illinois. Harry seeks to work his way back to England. He works as an overseer on a slave plantation having sex with Annettee the owner's wife. Flashman leaves the estate.Throughout the novel he assumes aliases. He longs to be back home in the United Kingdom. America is a strange, savage and wild land to the young Briton. Flashman helps a beautiful light skinned slave named Cassy escape to freedom. Cassy and Harry have many adventures. The finale of the novel occurs when Harry is called upon to testify at the New Orleans trial of Captain Spring and his crew for piracy and operating a slave ship.This book is an exciting look at America in 1848 as the California Gold Rush and the Mexican War captured the headlines. We also see how the slavery system operated in its cruel subjugation of African-Americans. The novel is a riproaring novel filled with sex, exciting escapes from danger and a good view of nineteenth century antebellum America. Flashman is a forceful narrator who has a keen eye and an insatiable wit. Another triumph for Frazer!"},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"Among series characters, I'd have to guess that there are few as unredeemably roguish as Harry Flashman. Unlike most fictional cads, Harry is unrepentant, and those who expect him to see the light and become a better person are sure to be disappointed. But for those who understand Harry for what he is - a coward with no scruples, as he'd be the first to admit - the Flashman Papers are wonderfully fun historical novels.Flash for Freedom! is the third volume of the Flashman Papers, and though the events in these volumes are not fully in the same order as their chronological publication, in this case, the third volume does immediately follow the events in the second one (Royal Flash). As this novel begins (in 1848), Harry is again enjoying his life of idleness, but when he tries to run for Parliament, things go very wrong, and he is forced to go into temporary exile. Harry is put aboard one of his wealthy father-in-law's ships and forced to work, something he never likes to do. Moreover, he is more than a little disturbed to find out that he is on a slave ship.Not that Harry has moral qualms about the slave trade, but he just doesn't like to be put in a position where he could be convicted of a hanging offense. He will wind up going from Africa to Cuba and eventually to New Orleans (and other places in America), and throughout, he will be exposed to all sorts of sides of the slavery issue: besides smuggling, he will act as a slave driver and as an agent of the underground railroad. Throughout, Harry takes no real side, merely trying to survive to make it home to England.Even those who are used to Harry's natural villainy may be a little put off by his casual racism, but this is actually nothing new for him; he's always looked down on other races (as well as most other non-English people). But Harry Flashman is not supposed to be a role model, and for all his bad qualities, he also has a charm and humor that is endearing. It is Flashman's narrative that makes this a great set of offbeat historical novels (a genre that is usually on the serious side), and Flash for Freedom! is as good as its predecessors."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"Harry Flashman is Horatio Hornblower without a conscience and afraid of the water. Great series."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"Hard to take! Bundle 3 of the Flashman Papers exposes Harry at his nauseating worst - smug and cowardly, vile in thought and deed, and appallingly callous in his racism. Racism is a touchy subject for me. If Harry or his creator had been physically accessible, there might never have been a volume 4. Only the perception that Flashman wasn't Fraser, but just a 'fallible narrator' in literary terms, helped me keep my anger until control long enough to wonder where the book was going. Sure enough, in the end, despite his cowardice, Flashman partially redeems himself - in his own eyes by getting out of scrape after scrape once again, in my eyes by at least recognizing and paying grudging tribute to the humanity and courage of two others - one a runaway woman slave whom he rescues utterly by chance; the other a historical personage, a back-country congressman named Abraham Lincoln. A major part of what makes Flashman a tolerable rogue is that his cynicism about himself is matched and bested by his cynicism about everyone else, from his miserly father-in-law to Bismark, Gladstone, and Disraeli, a cynicism that usually hits the mark.Harry's description of conditions on the slave ship Balliol College are nightmare material but entirely factual, as is the sadistic racism of the slave traders. I suppose that hearing and seeing such horrors through the eyes of a partcipant, however unwilling, delivers an emotional jolt that many people will prefer to avoid. This is not one of the \\"funny\\" Flashman books, and in the end it's not entirely satisfying to find Harry saving his own hind quarters by saving those of the villain who captains the slaver. I'm giving the book its five stars for literary accomplishment, but I'd strongly recommend to anyone with a shred of innocence and susceptibility remaining to skip it and hope for less beastliness in volume 4."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"Flashman, that 19th century fictious bad boy who finds himself changing the course of history, and his fantastic adventures are certainly an acquired taste. For me it's at best a hit-or-miss affair. It works best when the author focuses on historical events and less so on Flashman's womanizing and toilet humor. Thankfully, 'Flashman for Freedom!' hits the mark. Flashman keeps his trousers on (..well, most of the time), and the reader gets to learn some things about the 19th century slave trade not normally taught in (USA) schools.The story has really two parts. In the beginning Flashman finds himself on a British slave ship bound for America after picking up its human cargo in Africa. Without getting too gruesome, the author describes the whole slave transportation business is stark detail. Afterwards Flashman finds himself in New Orleans and, through no desire of his own, embarks on journey up the Mississippi with a slave trying to reach (free) Canada. I found all this rather interesting if not entirely plausible (after all, we are talking about 'larger than life' Harry Flashman).Bottom line: less bawdy than other Flashman novels but more educational. Certainly among the better Flashman books."},{"Title":"Flash for Freedom!","review":"In the late 1960s, a journo named George MacDonald Fraser had the inspired idea of taking Harry Flashman, the cowardly villain of Tom Brown's School Days, and having him rebound from his Rugby School disgrace by embarking on a military career. Since the nineteenth century was a period of more or less continual warfare, with Queen Victoria's soldiers in the thick of most of it, Fraser had plenty of opportunities to land Flashman in all kinds of trouble, and he made the most of his rich material. Flash for Freedom! is the third Flashman novel and the first American adventure. An ill-advised card game with Benjamin Disraeli turns Flashman into an unwilling officer aboard a slave ship bound for West Africa. From there we get a tour of the Middle Passage, a run-in with a Yankee patrol ship, and a top-to-bottom exploration of the antebellum American South, with Flashman an unwilling participant in the Underground Railroad, an increasingly willing plantation overseer, and finally a slave himself. Fraser's taste for provocation is at its edgiest here: the depictions of the degraded King Gezo of Dahomey, and the cowed behavior of the chained slaves, border on outright racism. On the other hand, the book's descriptions of the daily operations of the Peculiar Institution have a cumulative horror that chills the blood. This is all the more remarkable because Flash for Freedom! is at heart a comic historical adventure, with one of the great antiheroes of modern literature. The novel also features two of Fraser's greatest characters: Cassy, a runaway slave who brings Flashman as close to true heroism as he ever gets, and slaveship captain John Charity Spring, a disgraced Oxford don who is never more threatening than when he quotes lines from classical literature in the original Latin. There's a breakneck pursuit across the frozen Ohio River and a meeting with a young Illinois politician named Abraham Lincoln, who sees through Flashman more or less immediately. AT the risk of sounding prejudiced, I would argue that this and the second American book, Flashman and the Redskins, show Fraser's series at its best."},{"Title":"Luther's Works Lectures on Genesis/Chapters 1-5 (Luther's Works) (Luther's Works (Concordia))","review":"This is perhaps the best commentary I have yet read (I haven't had the chance to read any of Calvin's yet, so I can't compare them). If only someone today would write an up to date commentary with the same style as Luther. I think what I liked best was how Luther explained how each idea related to philosophical thoughts, esp. how they related to Aristotle's ideas. If there were a modern commentary which did that, I would be very pleased. Unfortunately, many of Luther's views are out of date. Here are just a few that I found humorous:1. Luther thought the sun was revolving around the earth, and since things that move fast get hot, Luther was worried that the sun would start on fire.2. Luther claimed that birds fell dead in the ocean in the winter, and were raised to life in the spring (which he used as evidence for the resurrection)3. Luther claimed three living things as signs of the Fall: flies (which I can understand), butterflies, and toads (couldn't he have thought of something worse that butterflies and toads?). He also claimed that toads were vicious, and that butterflies were an abomination, both of which were obviously created after the Fall to torment mankind.Those are just a few of the things that had me rolling with laughter while reading this book. On a serious note though, Luther does provide some excellent Scripture interpretation, and this is a very fine commentary which I think is well worth the read.

You find out everything about Chi (Elda and her sister, Freia) as they were in the past, and that Hideki loves her and all that... I guess it was a happy ending, if thats what you're looking for. It was weak, other than that. It happens really fast and is just like any of the other steriotypical girly manga that I try to stay away from...At least you get about 4 pages of colored art in the front..."},{"Title":"Chobits, Volume 8","review":"This is the last volume of chobits.

Unlike the previous volumes of Chobits, this last one includes 7 extra colour pages in the front. Amazon has kindly included 5 of the pretty coloured-pages so do check it out if you are curious by \\"search inside this book\\". A nice treat for anyone that loves Chobits and would like to see some original manga artwork by Clamp.Back to the actual point of the review, the content of the last volume of Chobits. All Chobits' fans *cries* as this is the last one. ... It was nice to have this graphic novel devoted only to Chi, Hideki, Chitose Hibiya, Zima, and Dita. None of Hideki's other friends are in this volume. I suppose the side-character's stories have been finished or up to the reader's imagination.In any case, I enjoyed reading this volume as I picked up a lot more 'history' of Chobits' origin compared to the anime series. In my opinion, the anime series never really did explain if Chobits existed or not and the intimate questions between our beloved Chi and Hideki. Chobits is a myth created by owners/masters that dream of there persocoms being able to think for themselves (A.I. - Artificial Intelligence, whoa kinda worries and reminds me of Animatrix...). Sadly, the truth is learned that Chi like every other persocom is just that. She is not an AI but she is uniquely different compared to the rest of her kind. Hideki obviously knows about it but does not wish to know her full potential of how special she really is, all he cares about is her being alright! *aww* ^_^I have to say this even though Hideki and Chi makes a cute couple, Zima and Dita are the sexies couple in this manga. =P hee hee"},{"Title":"Chobits, Volume 8","review":"I am sad the series ends:( I just got the last two books! now for my reviewChobits is far by my favorite anime. I had a good time reading while it lasted. It a romantic cute story with some humor put in.

But seriousely now people, the ending was practically obvious! but still, the last book had alot to be desired but still it was good.So here we are with the close to this wonderful series.

The story gets a 10/10.Artwork:Well, dont be fooled by the cuteness of the covers of all 8 mangas. but, the artwork is still GREAT. Although, all the nakedness sets it just a little lower. But, it's still very baeutiful! Artwork gets a 8/10Characters:The characters are what make this manga brilliant. Hideki is JUST so damm funny! i LOVE HIM! Chi is the cutest thing I've ever seen! Every HUMAIN and PERSOCOM is beautiful! But theres one downfall:Making a 12-year-old pervert a pro at persocoms is very DUMB. Characters get a 9/10Well, that's all I got! Chobits is a great manga, and I recommend it to EVERYONE! Even though it states OT-Older Teen-Age 16+ on the back, I don't think it's that much to fuss about.

Overall, it was very sweet.The art is is as good as ever. Great looking characters and detailed environments.

Don't get me wrong; I love CLAMP's stories and style, but the way they end their stories invariably invokes a single response: &quot;Uh, what?&quot; I liked it. But, plotwise, it was certainly not on par with the rest of the series. Perhaps the fact that I had long since figured out what was going to happen made it that less enjoyable for me.Volume 8, being the last volume, is a tad shorter than the previous seven.

If you saw the anime first like I did, this book answers a lot of the questions that the anime left out.It's a real tear jerker, just because it's such a great story.

I would have given it zero stars if I could, but this rating system won't allow it.I have a very good reason for canning the series. Unfortunately, that reason constitutes a major spoiler. So, if you want to know why I trashed it, you'll have to read past the warning.**** WARNING. MAJOR SPOILER FOLLOWS. *****OK then, here goes. The spoiler concerns the ending.No, it wasn't tragic or sad per se. In fact, Chi really did find her \\"someone just for me\\" in Hideki. But there was a catch in their relationship. And that catch was just plain stupid. Frustrating. Idiotic. Inane.Here's why. It turns out that Chi's \\"Reset\\" button is located where the vagina would be on a human woman. In her case, a \\"Reset\\" would erase her complete database - all of her memories, programming, \\"emotions\\" (whether they're real or simulated by programming). She'd lose her life with the \\"someone just for me.\\"Earlier in the series, when she's been abducted by the hacker, she says something that suggests that only this \\"someone just for me\\" can be allowed to touch her there. She has defensive programming which causes her to resist anyone else's attempts to do so.Sure, she'll allow that \\"someone\\" to touch her there. Unfortunately, if she'll still \\"reset\\" - essentially destroying her memories and personality.In other words, after 7 Manga volumes in which Chi searches for this \\"someone just for me\\" and finally finds him, it turns out they can't make physical love.The male protagonist, Hideki, passes the test of \\"pure love\\" by agreeing that he still loves her even though he can't make physical loveto her.Well. Thank goodness the fairy tale of emotional love wasn't ruined by physical love making, eh? We certainly wouldn't want Hideki to make love to a machine now, would we? Of course, emotionally loving a machine is just fine. Solid logic.After seeing the anime series, which didn't directly suggest such a limitation on their relationship (all they said was \\"there are things people can and can't do, and there are things persocoms can and can't do\\"), I thought the story was so great that I bought all 8 volumes of the manga and devoured them in a one-day reading session.I'm sorry I did. The manga ruined the story for me with that asinine ending.Junk. You blew it, CLAMP. I won't even dignify this trash by trying to re-sell it on Amazon. Also, I wouldn't want to inflict it on anyone else. It's going straight into the garbage where it belongs."},{"Title":"Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail","review":"This is an extremely well illustrated and beautiful volume, accompanied by interesting text--shedding light on the ships, battles, and men of the &quot;age of sail&quot;. Bernald Ireland has written widely on this period. If you enjoy C.S. Forrester, James Nelson, Marryat, Pope, O'Brien, etc. but are basically a landlubber, you need this book. The illustrations are fascinating and the boxed inserts on notable admirals, ships, battles are a nice touch."},{"Title":"Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail","review":"Ireland's history is excellent. It covers all of the major points, and gives good insight into topics that rarely make a basic history. His commentary on the major battles, tactics, and personalities is excellent. His background chapter on the Royal Navy provides important instruction on sailing and naval vocabulary. However, wonderful art and illustrations really make the book special. All too often, excellent histories are undone because readers can't picture the events. Ireland solves that problem for us. Every page includes relevant illustrations. We see the ships; we see the men; our minds can build an accurate and detailed picture of the events. Given that, the absence of maps in strange and dissappointing. But that's about the only criticism I can level at this otherwise outstanding volume."},{"Title":"Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail","review":"I found this book appealing for the many color images presented of period paintings. The diagrams depicting the trim of the yards and sails during certain evolutions (e.g. tacking and boxhauling) also were informative.Unfortunately, there are several inverted images. Examples include: p. 11 \\"Plymouth Dockyard\\" (Pocock); p. 135 \\"Admiral John Jervis\\" (John Hoppner); p. 196 \\"Forcing the Passage of the Sound 1807\\" (Robert Dodd); and p. 123 \\"Brunswick v. Vengeur 1794\\" (John Harvey).I was also disappointed that the editors chose to split the image of \\"Howe on deck of Queen Charlotte\\" on pp. 132-3 across the page - Howe is bisected by the spine!There were also some surprising technical errors. Unless many other sources are mistaken, Ireland's statement on p. 113 that a Sixth Rate was a commander's billet is problematic; all vessels that were \\"rated\\" were post ships and, thus, a post captain's command.Although Hibernia (p. 185) certainly was enlarged relative to Ville de Paris 110, Hibernia was 'rated' at 110 guns, not 120 (citing Brian Lavery's \\"The Ship of the Line\\" and the Naval Chronicle. Of course, the relationship between rating and the actual number of guns was not precise. It is also interesting to compare the bows of Hibernia (p. 185) and Caledonia (p. 193); it appears that Caledonia does not exhibit the round bow, though in her draft (R. Gardiner - \\"Warships of the Napoleonic Wars,\\" Naval Institute Press) the round bow is clearly indicated.I found the book appealing from a visual perspective; if one is interested in finding quantitative detail regarding the ships of this period, other sources might be found more useful."},{"Title":"Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail","review":"The sudden popularity in the 1990s of Patrick O'Brian's sea stories set in the Napoleonic wars quickly spawned a whole cottage industry of nonfiction books to provide context and technical explanation for readers who were a little shaky on the difference between a marlinspike and a dolphin-striker. And if the book was heavily illustrated, all the better. Ireland has been writing in this field for a long time, including a lengthy relationship with Jane's, and this is one of the better entries in the post-O'Brian competition that I've seen. While there are charts to lay out the divisions of the seaman's working day, and the organization of the crew, and standing rigging vs. running rigging, and so on, the author is more concerned with the growth of the Royal Navy -- and those of its rivals, especially the navies of France and the U.S. -- and with the histories of specific warships, as opposed to classes or types. He defines the \\"age of sail\\" here as 1760 to 1820 (basically the reign of George III), when the navy was almost continually at war and technological innovation was nearly continuous. There are chapters on the Seven Years War, the American Revolution, Britain's wars against the French Republic and Napoleon, and what is referred to in the U.S. as the War of 1812 (but which was largely a sideshow from the British point of view). His narrative is often technical in focus, which will delight and absorb some readers and probably bore others, and there are a great many reproductions of marine paintings and engravings and editorial cartoons from the newspapers, as well as detailed airbrush renderings of ships. There also are numerous summary biographies of important naval figures scattered in sidebars through.While this wouldn't be the first book I would recommend on the subject -- that would be one of the works of Brian Lavery or Nicholas Blake -- it's still well worth the reading. The only things I can criticize, in fact, is the lack of a glossary of terminology and the complete absence of maps."},{"Title":"Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail","review":"Ireland gives detailed verbal descriptions of naval battles that I was actually able to understand, no mean feat. He also posits reasons why some commanders made particular decisions in these battles. I also appreciated his biographical descriptions of figures in naval history.The wealth of wonderful pictures and his ability to express tactics make this a fine book.

The intriguing name comes from the rather prosaic fact that it includes five thousand characters. It uses an antiquated transliteration system (Wade-Giles), it doesn't have simplified characters (won't help in reading material published in the PRC) and there probably hasn't been a new entry added in fifty years.So why would anybody want a copy? Because there are items in this book that you won't find anywhere else without a lot of digging, such as: the Chinese character names of all of the dynasties, along with their capital cities, the various sets of characters used for enumeration (I have never found these anywhere else), all Chinese surnames, including all of the two syllable surnames, a compilation of all of the characters used in the Chinese calendar with an explanation on how the calendar works, and a wealth of other goodies.

Nevertheless, Fenn's classic work still remains one the old standard pocket dictonaries. As the title suggests, the dictionary lists five thousand Chinese characters in their standard form (although common variant forms are included) with their associated meanings and common compound words. Also given is the characters radical, phonetic element, alternate pronunciations and frequency of occurrence. The characters are listed alphabetically according to their pronunciations, which is given in the Wade romanisation based on the traditional dialect of Peiping (now Peking). Make useful tables of linguistic, geographical and historical information, and indices are also provided, including an index listing the characters in their traditional radical order. All in all, this dictionary is well adapted to be a pocket companion for the traveller to China, containing all the information required in an everyday environment at the time of publication.

Every character is listed with both the dictionary key (\\"radical\\") and the phonetic in parallel columns. The phonetic is keyed to a list of phonetics (which follows Soothill's numbered list). Now, suppose that you want to know what the phonetic means when used as an independent character: you take the number that is printed in the phonetic-column and turn to the Phonetic Index at the beginning of the book. Locate that number and the Index gives you the page number of the phonetic in the body of the dictionary. If you only use a dictionary to look up words to find out what they mean, this won't be of any value, but if you are actually studying the characters it is very useful.The only other dictionaries that I know of which permit you do do this are Bernhard Karlgren's \\"Analytic Dictionary of Chinese and Sino-Japanese,\\" a classic work that is still valuable, and Rich Harbaugh's \\"Chinese Characters: A Geneology and Dictionary.\\" Karlgren is rather difficult to use, and the definitions in Harbaugh are rather minimal.

Probably few people would guess that a book about electing popes would be such a page turner, but I had difficulty putting it down when I started reading it. Facinating and very funny at times. My favorite moment has to be when the author is in St. Peter's square when the new pope's name is announced. Greeney's wonder at the election of a Polish pope leaps accross the years and grabs you in an amazing way.I highly recommend this book to anyone even marginally interested in the subject. I just hope it will be back on the presses soon!"},{"Title":"The Making of the Popes 1978: The Politics of Intrigue in the Vatican","review":"Thirty-three years have past since the publication of Andrew Greeley's first book on papal conclaves. I read the book after reviewing his second such book, The Making of he Pope 2005, (Little, Brown, and Company, 2005). I found the earlier book illuminating and well worth the reading time---concurring with the assessment of Garry Wills, to wit: \\"Greeley shows vividly what a narrow and inbred little group on men runs the church of Rome from its Vatican wasp's nest...The book is essential to any modern understanding of papal politics, and not a bad book to read for understanding politics in general.\\"Greeley does a superb job chronicling the events and circumstances surrounding the death of Pope Paul VI, the election of his successor Cardinal Albino Luciani whose mysterious death after only 33 days in office as the smiling Pope John Paul I led to the election of Poland's junior Cardinal Karol Wojtyla, who as Pope John Paul II became the first foreigner (non-Italian) pope since 1522.The author's commentaries on church history and pervading issues are still relevant for those seeking to understand how the church can still be in crisis mode 34 years after John Paul II began his papacy with such promise as the most gifted pope the church has ever had. Greeley quoted Harvard's Thomas Crooks who said of Wojtyla in 1976: \\"one of the most impressive men Iv'e met in my life ... an absolutely radiant personality.\\"Although there were great expectations for this gifted pope, his ecclesial experience was limited to monarchial structures and policies -- powerful centralized authority with no tolerance for dissent or pluralism -- that were necessary for the survival of the Polish Church under siege by a Communist government.As Greeley commented when speaking of the coalition that was forming to support the election of Cardinal Wojtyla: \\"As in every coalition some participants were more likely than others to be disappointed by their favorite in the months and years after his election.\\"A reader of this book should not be surprised at the disappointment of many as John Paul II, in line with his Polish experience, emphasized discipline, doctrine, and tradition while undermining the reforms of the second Vatican Council (1962-65). This, in turn, gave rise to the organizational structure and governance of the contemporary institutional Catholic Church that continues to hemorrhage members....a patriarchal, non-collegial, non-democratic church focused on rules, regulations, and doctrinal orthodoxy, a church seemingly cold and unsympathetic to the issues and challenges faced by ordinary Catholics (both lay and religious) in the modern world.The following quote from Thomas Paine's 1776 \\"Common Sense\\" applies equally well today to Greeley's comments and the many writings on reform of the Catholic Church*: \\"Perhaps the sentiments contained in these pages are not yet sufficiently fashionable to procure them general favour; a long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a superficial appearance of being right, and raises at first a formidable outcry in defense of custom. But the tumult soon subsides. Time makes more converts than reason.\\"This book deserves to be reprinted.------------------------------* For example , see: 1) Gary Wills, Papal Sins: Structures of Deceit (Doubleday, 2000), 2) Robert McClory, As It Was in the Beginning: The Coming Democratization of the Catholic Church, (The Crossroad Publishing Company, 2007), 3) Matthew Fox, The Pope's War: Why Ratzinger's Secret Crusade Has Imperiled the Church and How It Can Be Saved, (Sterling Ethos, 2011), 4) Michael Crosby, Repair My House: Becoming a Kingdom Catholic, (Orbis Books, 2012), and 5) Tom Fox, \\"Hans Kung calls for open church revolt,\\" The National Catholic Reporter, October 9, 2012, [...]"},{"Title":"The Making of the Popes 1978: The Politics of Intrigue in the Vatican","review":"Excellent document.in 2008 can be considered a little old.

You must get it."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I enjoyed reading this novel. It was exciting but had a touch of humor as well. Great work, Mr. Koontz!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"What a disapointment By The Light Of The Moon was.Having recently completed another of Koontz's latest books, 'From the Corner of His Eye', I felt compelled and excited to continue reading his new works. I have completed around 13 of his novels, and have to say that this is the worst I have read yet.The story itself isn't too bad, however the characters are incredibly annoying, and make the story not only tedious, but several times (and for the first time ever with a Koontz novel) I struggled to stop myself from putting the book down (gasp!)...unfinished.The story begins when a young comedian (who is the most annoying, sarcastic, argumentative character of all time) teams up with a man, and his autistic brother following an attack by a stranger.I found myself growing easily bored by the pages and pages of nonsense bickering, and repetitive rantings. The tale continues as the characters find out more and more about themselves, and what they must do to 'save the world' from evil.Quite a ridiculous ending, and not a book I would recommend."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I'm so thrilled to be able to write my review because it means that the book is over and I can now donate it to my local library. B-O-R-I-N-G.Also, thank God, Jilly's plant Fred vanished somewhere in the chase. I guess Koontz's editors weren't all THAT bad."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Think metaphor - and think LOTS of them - to the point where the writing becomes a rant. And while I mostly agree with some of the social ranting, this just isn't good literature. It becomes tedious and tiresome and absurd - the run on sentences enough to choke a reader. In the past, I found Mr. Koontz' books to have a clever premise, to be thought provoking, and to have an &quot;unable to put down&quot; element. This one I put down quite easily. Actually, Dean Kartoontz seems to be the scary monster that is emerging - too great now for a critical editor that would chop this book in at least half? However ... if you wish to read something that is as tedious as listening in excruciatingly complete detail Grandma's latest surgery and the subsequent ill conceived complications and reverberations and protracted recovery, well, then this might be just the book for you!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I have never thrown away a Dean Koontz book but last night I could not take it anymore! By Chapter 12 they were still riding around in Dylan's SUV, being chased by an invisible nobody and Jilly was still being an annoying, very dislikeable character.I knew I was not going to like this book when she was introduced with her plant \\"Fred.\\" Her pointless chattering drove me crazy. I was thinking to myself \\"Is Koontz for real?\\" And then after she meets Dylan, she continously tries to bait him into arguements and they talk about nothing for over half of the first 100 pages!!!!Please, if this was your first time reading one of his books, this was one of his worst, give him another chance. Try Fase Memory or my all time favorite, Intensity."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I was a bit skeptical at 1st about reading this novel - since Koontz last few novels were sketchy. But the plot sounded good and I was immediatly sucked it.This was an awesome read. I was sorely disappointed it had to end. By the end of the book - I was still pumped with ideas - more to add - and even ideas for a sequel. But I found myself even more disappointed - Koontz does not usually do sequels. :(All in all - I was blown away by this piece. Loved it.And I am now on my way - to more Koontz. Hehehe."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"This is the fifth novel I have read by this author and I thought it was really great. The characters were greatly developed and the humor in the book made it even better. The action keeps the reader involved and the story does not get tiresome. The only complaint I have is the ending, which I felt took a 180 degree turn out of no where. Don't know if Koonts plans on writing a sequal to the book as another reviewer suggested but I hope not because I do not believe it could live up to this one. Regardless, definetely read this novel, it will be worth your time. I also suggest Tick Tock by Koontz if youre looking for a shorter humorous read."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I admit, after reading other reviews of the novel, several of which said that this was Koontz's best, I was dissapointed.While the characters were funny and endearing, I didn't feel they were as well developed as, say, the couple from \\" Dark Rivers\\" or the characters from the Christopher Snow novels. I guess I was dissapointed that they had actual lives before being injected with the stuff, and that they had to give up their lives as if being a comedian and an artist aren't worthy enough- I say what's the worth of life without laughter and beauty. The character of Shep was interesting, but terribly inconsistent, and I was annoyed to find him a veggie at the beggining of the novel, extraordinary in the middle, and then reduced to saying \\"cake\\",\\"ice\\" and \\"tasty\\" at the end.While I enjoy the chased/ chasers aspect of the novel, the antagonists barely appear in the story( What- three times?), so it's easy to forget they exist. The tautness, intensity and cardiac arrest induced by, for example \\" Dark Rivers\\" or \\" Intensity\\", etc. is just not in this novel.Part of the reason I enjoy Koontz's books is because of the humor, but in the beggining of the book, dare I say it, it was over the top and became irritating. The \\"I'm not a rapist, I'm an artist.\\" bit was excellent, though.I guess to sum it all up, I guess I was dissapointed that I wasn't reduced to a sodden mass of tears at the close of the novel. \\" By The Light Of The Moon\\" only left me satisfied- usually after a Koontz novel I'm reassured of the innate goodness of humankind, awed by the possibility of technology, impressed by the redemptive power of love and courage, or just plain moved.Despite all the compliants listed above, \\"By The Light of The Moon\\" is still a great read and worthy of your time- Koontz at his not so best is still EXTRAORDINARY!- and I eagerly await his next work."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I love Koontz, there are no ifs, ands, or buts about it. Nonetheless, despite enjoying some of recent works, &quot;From the Corner of His Eye&quot; and &quot;One Door Away from Heaven&quot; included, I have noticed that while Koontz's ideas remained fresh, his writing had gotten a little stuffy and verbose. The man can absolutely spend three pages describing the texture of the dew on the thorn of a rose. I enjoyed the quickened pace of this book and the subject matter as well. Though Koontz has shown more brvity in this novel, he has also stayed true to his norm of creating characters that are enjoyable and developing them fully. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I am a dedicated Koontz fan, have been for a few years, but what is it about him that attracts me? I must be perfectly honest: this book seemed fluffy to me, at first. So did his last, and the one before that. But why, then, am I hooked after reading the VERY FIRST WORD. Yes, that's right; it's a cliche, but I was hooked after the first word. He always does that to me, and I can't explain why.Maybe it's the plot and the characters. Here, Koontz presents two people who are as real as you or I: Dylan, an artist travelling the country with his retarded brother Shep; and Jilly, a struggling comedian with a past that causes her to hate men. Two entirely un-related people, perfect strangers, until they are assaulted by the same man--a \\"Frankenstein\\" doctor, who injects them both with a mysterious substance.It isn't long before weird things start to happen. Jilly begins to predict a massacre at a church, while Dylan is suddenly overcome by the urge to just GO certain places...and stop the crimes happening there. And Shep is maybe affected the strangest of all...because he has this unique ability to transport himself miles away...and across time...But they are being hunted by enemies of the doctor. But in this guess, the enemy of my enemy is NOT my friend. Pursued by men who do not hesitate in killing, Dylan, Jilly, and Shep must try to survive the guns and bullets...in order to see if they will surive the liquid that flows through their veins.A novel packed with revelation, with characters that jump off the pages and sit next to you, BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON is perfect Dean Koontz. Maybe that is why I was hooked; because perfect Koontz is as perfect as you can get."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Dylan is an artist whose parents died and left him in charge of the care of his younger brother Shep, who is autistic. While staying in a hotel after selling some of his art work. Dylan wakes to find that he and his brother have been injected with a strange substance that won't kill them but can certaintly get them killed if the men in the black SUV's get ahold of them. While fleeing these men, they run into a woman; Jillian, traveling with her pet jade plant, Fred. Jillian has also been infected with the same substance and now the three of them are running for their lives trying to stay away from those chasing them and all the while trying to discover what and why.The story is fast paced and fun. It is a work of fiction after all and some of the plot is kind of silly and far fetched. The characters are well developed and Koontz does a fantastic job keeping Shep true to form through out the whole story. Many questions from Dylan and Shep's past are also answered during their odyssey.All in all, it's another enjoyable read and worth the effort and time to get through it."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"This book is a decent, light read. If you don't take it too seriously and you know where to skip over some of the overstuffed descriptive jargon, it is fun. Just wade through some of the verbosity in the beginning and you will be hooked. I enjoyed it and felt it was an improvement over the last couple of books which seemed to have a bit too much verbal &quot;filler&quot; and completely unbelievable characters. If you are looking for on-the-edge-of-your-seat old-style Koontz suspense you will be disappointed, but if you enjoy the mellow, morphed (perhaps psychotropically enhanced?) Koontz of his last &quot;phase&quot; it is a pleasant ride."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"This book reads like a movie you love watching. Lots of action. Great dialogue. Fun ending.Okay, a couple of details. One, this book has great wit. Koontz protagonists are a female comedian, a large man who paints up beat pictures, and an autistic adult (think Rain Man). The narrative echoes the humerous thougts of the comedian, and the observant mind of the artist. Koontz easily switches styles of narration as he goes from character to character.Two, this novel portrays both the great evil within humanity, as well as the great value of human life.Three, real action, with regular people thrust into unreal situations. Fun.Four, the story turns like a Dicken's plot. Characters come in and out of the story, and pop up again at unexpected times.Five, the book has an active love story that never subjects us to sexual details nor melo-dramatic distractions. The best of the falling in love is portrayed, but it never becomes the focus of the story. Very grown up. Didn't overtake the story, which has enough going on without needing added drama.six, doing good. Doing good is the goal. The fear that all of us have when needed to do good is demonstrated over and over again. Courage, as a virtue, is exaltedReads fast, and never stops being an obvious fiction. Saturday Matinee adventure story, from beginning to end."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Excellent! One of Dean Koontz's best. Very interesting and totally unique plot.. Didn't want to stop reading it once I started."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Dean Koontz generally gets on a writing train and rides it for a little while. Because of this, the books that come from the same train ride generally end up very similar. Ex. Velocity, The husband, and The Nice Guy are all basically the same plot. This book happened to be written right before one that would become much more famous, Odd Thomas. Because of this there are a lot of similarities in, if nothing else, the characters and the flow of the plot. This was great during the first of Light of the Moon. I enjoyed it very much. The last quarter of the book felt forced and cheesy. It left me wanting more depth than I actually ended up with. (thankfully that was fulfilled in the landmark Koontz that was Odd)This story follows Dylan and Shep, the O'Conner brothers, and the Jillian Jackson, companion that they meet on the road. They happen to all be staying in the same hotel as \\"mad scientist\\" (for lack of better word) who is on the run from his \\"business partners\\". He injects what he calls \\"stuff\\" into Jillian and Dylan separately claiming that if he doesn't survive his work will. After they find each other and begin being hunted by the infamous partners mentioned by the mad scientist, they begin to discover that there are some strange side effects to the injections that they have been given. They even find themselves arriving at a crime scene before a crime is ever committed.Dylan's brother Shep is autistic which brings in interesting point of view to the story.Not perfection, but it is surprisingly better than a brief once-over of the plot would lead you to believe. I would compare the quality of this book to the sequels of Odd Thomas. Not as good, but definitely worth reading..."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"With his previous successful string of novels such as \\"False Memory\\", \\"From the Corner of His Eye\\", and \\"One Door Away From Heaven\\", Dean Koontz is writing on a high that all of his reading fans hope he never comes down from. \\"By the Light of the Moon\\" is no exception; with his gleaming and terrorizing elucidation of how the increase of technology and science can ultimately lead to our civilization's doom. Koontz has the great aptitude for knowing what truly scares people and develops complex, decipherable pieces of work that illuminate the mind and often move the soul.While staying the night at an innocent-looking motel, Dylan O'Connor and his autistic brother Step are mysteriously injected with a strange substance by a crazed, maniacal doctor. Proclaiming that introducing the weird potion is his last resort and cautioning them that they need to run for their lives from the evil, governmental men that will want to get to them; the scientist is brutally gunned down by a group of agents. Teaming with the frazzled comedian Jillian Jackson, the three set out together in a cat-and-mouse chase from the evil henchmen who want to do more than just chat. As the hunt persists, the effects of the potion kick in, causing Dylan to have an incredible urge to help people, Jillian to have horrific hallucinations, and Step to have the brilliant power that allows him to teleport himself and others throughout space and time. As the government agents get closer and closer to their prey, the trio must learn what their qualities mean, how they use them to survive, and ultimately why fate chose them as the recipients.Much faster paced compared to his two previous novels (which were both well over 600-pages in length), \\"By the Light of the Moon\\" explodes from the first page and never stops running. Koontz skillfully depicts the autistic Step in a very honest fashion; using the frustrated Dylan to portray exactly the difficulties of dealing with someone that has such a challenging psychological disorder, but also the love and triumph that comes from the way the two sacrifice for each other. With a middling conclusion that seems slightly rushed (sometimes a common theme with Koontz novels that are so well-written from the initial chapter; it appears as though any conclusion does not fit the bill), \\"By the Light of the Moon\\" is not one of his absolute bests, but will certainly thrill his fans and perhaps even draw in a few who have never read his immaculate work."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I love the older books by Mr. Koontz - always good versus evil, a man, a woman and a dog taking on the evil government employee(s). In past years, I had become bored with his work, everything seemed to be the same plot, but decided to read him to see if he's cycled back to the old style. This is a good read, and I'm giving it 5 stars for that; however, the ending is disappointing and seemed too anticlimatic and a little immature - forming a club? Could this be the first in a series? I hope so. It's a great concept with very likeable characters."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I liked the whole premise of this book. It had a pretty good foundation. But I was very disappointed in the ending! The whole idea of forming a 'club' seemed childish, in my opinion."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I was almost afraid to read this book. After enjoying Koontz's books for so many years, I have been rather disappointed with the last three or four offerings.This one, while not quite up to the old standard Koontz set for himself (when he included his middle initial \\"R\\" as a necessary part of his name) was enormously better that its recent predecessors.The autustic character was just a bit too much like \\"Thomas\\" in \\"The Bad Place\\" but the two \\"good guys\\" were much more \\"normal\\" people than he has populated in other recent books.The \\"bad guy\\" could have been fleshed out a lot more, I feel. And the last few pages were anti-climatic and on the verge of being silly.And, to complete what I did not like about the book, I found myself skimming or skipping over paragraphs and even pages of tedious writing.Saying that, though, leaves A LOT of great reading. If you have given up on Koontz in the past few years, give this on a try. If you hated \\"Corner of the Eye\\" (which I rather did) you just might find this book better.And we can all hope for the return of the writing that Dean R. Koontz has done so well.Oh yes--he just had to get a lab retriever in the book. But this time it was only a picture on a jigsaw puzzle!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"The characters were real people, especially the autistic young man, Shep. Koontz's writing is detailed, captivating and lively. While three people run for their lives, strange things begin to happen to them. What were they injected with? Will they survive? By the Light of the Moon is truly a page turner and not to be missed."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"The first couple of chapters are hard to deal with. Unecessary character development and detail almost made me stop reading this book.But, hold on, it gets good. Dylan and his autistic brother Shep are injected with a mystery substance that unleashes some pretty amazing powers. At the same time, in the same place, comedienne Jillian is attacked and injected with the same substance. The three band together and share their individual experiences caused by the injection. Visions, teleportations and psychic warnings plague the trio throughout a harrowing 24-hour period. Most of the story revolves around them being chased by men-in-black type characters who have one agenda: kill the three of them as quickly as possible.The end was a bit of a let down, but for the most part, the book was exciting and kept me interested."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"My last Koontz experience was One Door Away From Heaven, which left me irritated and little else. That was especially hard to take after Lightning, which was such a treat.With this newest novel, he's not quite up to the level of Lightning, but he does help us forget One Door Away from Heaven, with its relentlessly cutesy wordplay and characters that never quite become sympathetic.By the Light of the Moon stays nice and tight--almost a bit too tight, because it doesn't give us full enough pictures of the parents of Jilly, Dylan and Shep. Such extra character development would give us more insight into how the protagonists became the people they did, even before their &quot;evolution.&quot;It's not sophisticated science fiction by any stretch. If you don't like &quot;derivative,&quot; stay far away. It's probably no accident that Book-of-the-Month released this as a dual selection with Michael Crichton's PREY. The premises are identical, though you can be sure that the writing styles are lightyears apart.But if you basically like Koontz and put down One Door Away from Heaven feeling a bit flogged, try this one...and hope that some day, &quot;Lightning&quot; will strike again."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"A great read for anyone who's looking for good entertainment. Solid, well--developed characters, a thrilling story line. I especially loved the relationship between Dylan and Sheperd. It's absolutely poignant and touching. It just comes to show the range of Dean Koontz' talent. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Two strangers, Jilly and Dylan, become linked when a mad scientist knocks them out and injects them with a strange serum while mumbling about the fact that they'll either go mad or be very much improved by his \\"stuff\\". He warns them that sinister killers will soon be after them if they don't hit the road asap. When Jilly discovers that her car, stolen by \\"Frankenstein\\" (as they dub him), has been torched with \\"Frankenstein\\" still inside she begins to take the dire warnings seriously. Dylan, an artist traveling around the country with his autistic brother Shephard, advises Jilly to join them on a mad ride away from the ominous, as yet unseen, baddies. And thus begins their life altering road trip.The book, although a suspenseful road trip into the darkest corners of hell, shines because of its characters. Thirty year old Dylan has been the sole caretaker of his younger autistic brother Shep ever since their mother died tragically ten years earlier. Dylan is a kind soul who is eternally patient with his sometimes difficult brother and loves him unconditionally. His life has been shaped around caring for Shep and initially he's almost too good, too patient, and too kind to be believed but as the book progresses he becomes less of a saint. His transformation will change him in ways that shock, appall and amaze him. I found his character the most emotionally compelling. Jilly is a quirky comedian whose good humor hides a dark. She travels with a houseplant named Fred (I kid you not) in lieu of a man. She and Fred have many enjoyable one-sided conversations and Jilly prefers his company to that of a real man. And then Dylan, a panicked and very bossy Dylan, comes into her life and instantly gets on her last nerve. Their initial sparring adds a bit of lightness to the tense plot but once they realize they've been altered by the \\"serum\\" and that they're truly on the run for their lives they learn to get along (and begin to like and respect each other) and the plot takes on a much more somber tone.The story takes place over the span of what I believe is little more than 24 hours. But in that short time span these three characters lives will forever be changed. The \\"serum\\" gives them strange, awe and fear inspiring abilities and forces Dylan and Shep to face a very dark moment in their past that they've done their best to put behind them. It's creepy, and moving and continually takes unexpected twists into dark corners. The pace is fast though Koontz has a tendency to be a little too long winded and overly descriptive but I've come to expect this when I pick up a Koontz novel and it's sort of comical and comforting all at the same time.I read this as an unabridged audiobook and the actor did a fine job. He had a strong, compelling voice that didn't set me to snoozing and he didn't do any of those cringe-worthy falsetto female voice performances that grate on my nerves. I always knew when Jilly or Dylan or Shep were speaking. The only downer? There's no famous Koontz dog character here! Instead we get Fred the plant. And Fred has about as much personality as, well, a houseplant. About halfway thru the story he's stuffed in the trunk never to be heard from again. Poor Fred, we hardly knew ye.By the Light of the Moon was interesting, suspenseful and filled with characters I enjoyed and it made my stressful ride to work something I *almost* looked forward to. 4 stars."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"This was the first book I've read by Dean Koontz, so I can't compare it to his other works. However, I did enjoy reading this books. The characters were very real and likeable. There were certain things in the book that could have been changed to make the story more believable, but overall this book was enjoyable."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Dean Koontz has been a favorite of mine since the late seventies. Quite truthfully, I find his books to be highly entertaining. By the Light of the Moon is frankly one of his best works to date. The only disappointment I felt after the last page was that the book had ended.Dean Koontz does take a different strategy with his tapestry of plot. Instead of weaving back and forth with various strands of his plot as he did with Strangers and Mr. Murder, Koontz basically stays with his three main characters once they are introduced. As has been usual with Koontz as of late, his new novel only spans a few days.Koontz starts his novel with a true North by Northwest feel in that he appears to place his characters in the wrong place at the wrong time. An unusual plot twist in the novel's last pages takes a surprise turn that will take most readers totally unaware, and Koontz shreds the wrong place at the wrong time into something else entirely.Dylan O'Conner, an artist on his way to an arts festival, and his autistic brother Shep are ensconced in a hotel room. Nearby, Jillian Jackson is a comedian on her way to her next gig. Those three find a trip to get fast food and root beer to be a suddenly dangerous proposition. Attacked by an amok scientist, Dylan and Jillian are forcibly given injections that may-or may not-have positive consequences.To compound matters, there is a goon squad that wants to kill the amok scientist and anyone with whom he may have had contact. Jillian, Dylan, and the synonym spouting Shep find themselves on the run and that strange things are beginning to happen within their bodies.The next few days in the three character's lives are a wild non-stop roller coaster ride that is virtually a thrill a minute. Koontz has a unique way of peppering his suspense-filled pages with humor, especially in the personage of Shep O'Conner. One can easily compare the unusual character that is Shep with Tom (M-O-O-N spells Tom) from King's The Stand. Both characters are immensely charming and quite more than they appear to be.Easily, these three characters rank as some of the most charming and unique personages found in the Koontz universe. Koontz somehow finds a way to allow the characters to grow and become three-dimensional during the book's non-stop action and brevity of time that makes up the story's setting.This is also one of the few Koontz books that does not feature a loveable animal. The goon squad that chases Shep, Dylan, and Jillian never develop as characters because they remain a constant background threat. Normally, Koontz loves to get into his evil characters' heads and reveal their sickness. He pretty much avoids doing that with the exception of the chilling Dr. Frankenstein. (For those who have read the book, the pun with chilling was intended. Sorry.)Those who have not had the pleasure of experiencing the Koontz universe could not hope for a better introduction. By the Light of the Moon is a master at work and is a wonderful weaving of suspense and comic relief."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"They're just so available. However, the plots just seem to get sillier and sillier. The &quot;justice brigade&quot; (or whatever they call themselves)? It's too cartoonish. Luckily I listened to the audio version and was able to get a lot of work done while it played in the background. Since the action moved so slowly -- including the incredibly tedious and copious conversations with Shep -- I could easily tune out periodically without missing anything. Just like you won't be missing much if you don't read the book at all."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"This book along with One Door Away From Heaven lacked the urgency and helpless fear factor so needed in a horror story. I like happy endings, don't get me wrong, just not mushy endings like this and the former book had.The villain in this book, although a very bad man, was not scary enough, compared to the deviates in books such as: Intensity, or From the Corner of His Eye. The method the bad guy (Dr. Proctor) vandalized his victims was somewhat spooky, but the effects were dismal. I guess I've read too many of his better books, as well as books by S.K. to get to excited by such a mellow thriller. Keep writing Dean, but please try to scare me."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"In \\"By the Light of the Moon\\", Dean Koontz violates Elmore Leonard's rule of writing #10---\\"Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip.\\" There is a lot that can easily be skipped.Once you strip away the redundancies and verboseness, you will find a pretty suspenseful cat and mouse thriller. However, you must abandon 100% of your disbelief.The plot is at its most interesting when the focus is on the nanotechnology computers.Two of the three protagonists are almost interesting, but the autistic brother is truly tedious. The villains are evil and easy to dislike.For true Koontz fans only---and some of them may have a problem with this one."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I have read all but a few of Koontz's books over the past 10+ years and his writing is getting more and more formulaic and less interesting. He forces a kind of humor onto the characters that is embarrassing to read: he is totally off the mark with the humor and it left me groaning. I could only get through about 70 or 80 pages before returning it to the bookstore, but in those pages, the main female character was grinding me and I found her to be unbelievable as someone I would empathize with or tolerate for 400+ pages.Dean Koontz has continued to disappoint me with his last 3 or 4 novels. His previous release to &quot;By the Light of the Moon&quot; was an improvement over his two before that, but he is nothing like he was in his prime, with &quot;Watchers,&quot; &quot;Strangers,&quot; and others from the previous decade.All in all, I think I am done with Koontz, sad to say."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I was disappointed with FROM THE CORNER OF HIS EYE and ONE DOOR AWAY FROM HEAVEN, but the Dean Koontz I've grown to admire is back with his latest thriller, BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON.You can read any of the other &quot;reviews&quot; here for a plot synopsis, but I'd like to instead commend the book on several notes: he has finally gotten rid of a canine sidekick, which is a nice temporary reprieve. Secondly, the action is fast-paced and he doesn't go on ad nauseum with rambling details as he has been prone to do. I also like the &quot;vague&quot; ending, which leads one to believe that there could be a sequel somewhere along the line, or so I hope.I do see similarities to the movie UNBREAKABLE, where normal people become superheroes of sorts, and Shep's character is somewhat cliche (and gets on the nerves from time to time with his repetitions), but these are easily forgiveable. Let us remember that Koontz has taken a fascinating idea, that of nanotechnology (doing a better job of it than M. Crichton did in his latest, PREY), and also infuses that human emotion, the draw of thriller, an element of psychology, and good ol' fun. I haven't enjoyed a Koontz book this much since FALSE MEMORY. The key to his writing is taking characters we can relate to and putting them in scenarios that are reasonable, but mind-bending at the same time.At no point does he &quot;talk down to the reader,&quot; and, what's more, explains things very well, not leaving questions hanging like the aforementioned works at the top of this critique have (at least in my case).Kudos to a job well done, Dean, and I can't wait to read what you come up with next! Don't make me wait too long, or I may have to call up Jilly to ask her what she sees in the future."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I had just finished reading \\"Prey\\" by Michael Crichton when I pulled this latest work by Dean Koontz off the bookshelf. So, the last thing I expected was another tale of nanotechnology gone awry. Crichton provides some hard science to back up his premise, but that kind of background is sorely lacking here. Don't get me wrong, I like Dean Koontz. Few writers of this genre can write so eloquently about people you can care about. But the characters here are stereotypical of Koontz characters from earlier novels. Dylan, the too-good-to-be-true travelling artist and Jillian Jackson, on the road comedienne, meld together like other characters from Koontz novels gone by. The only thing missing is a dog. But, then again, Dylan's autistic brother, who is a main player by the way, is even named Shep. All three are injected with a serum by a total stranger while staying at a motel in Arizona. The serum will affect their lives one way or another. What it appears to do is causes them to be drawn to situations of great peril and allows Shep to develop the ability to \\"fold\\" from one place to another. They are also pursued by what amounts to be, according to Koontz, \\"former Russian Spetznaz or American Delta Force gone bad\\".The situations are, at times, cartoonist at best. The bad guys who pursue the three heroes, in SUVs no less, are reminiscent of the Low Men in Yellow Coats and their big cars from \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\". The \\"folding\\" that is introduced, which helps Dylan, Jilly, and Shep get out of some tight spots, reminded me of Scott Bakula and his sidekick Al in \\"Quantum Leap\\". Human volunteers would not subject themselves blindly to nanotechnological injections, even if they were prisoners in Mexico, as the villian depicts here. And, please, no one, no matter what kind of whacko they might be, carries a briefcase with a bomb inside with him, just in case he needs to fake his own death.The dialogue is, at times, even worse. Koontz refers to one bad guy as a \\"human rodent\\". After folding into the arctic, he later writes that Shep \\"...returned sans the scientist\\". Sans? Still, the way this novel ends, it appears as if the ol' Moonlight Club will be back for a sequel. Maybe they'll bring the real Dean Koontz with them next time as well."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Dylan O'Connor (an artist), his autistic brother (Shepherd), and Jillian Jackson (a strugling comedic) were injected with some \\"stuff\\" by a \\"mad scientist/doctor\\". The \\"stuff\\" has some fascinating effects either positive or negative or even both. They are merely trying to survive by some mysterious group of people trying to murder them, maybe because they have been effected by this so called \\"stuff\\". All characters have an interesting pasts.I'm certainly saying that BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON is worthy of your time. Like koontz says \\"it is an exercise in pace.\\", the story moves along as smoothly as waves crashing down a beautiful ocean while the sun is setting down and going to sleep into the deep deep darkness. As all of the koonts novels, characters are lovable and believeble just like the story itself. The way dean koontz word his stories and paragraphs are beautiful and gauranteed to send a little tingle down or maybe up your spine. Koontz is improving book-by-book. Besides thriller, horror, action and all the koonts genre this book is simply funny at times. In BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON, koonts shows more of his comedic sight of things and his sense of humor to make the book come alive with every genre you can think off. But also besides entertaining this book also has the deep meanings of human beings and life, like other koontz book, which was profoundly felt by me. This book is packed with tons of beautiful metaphorism and similieness, which sometimes are hard to understand but most of the time just amazing.As many fans would say \\"sometimes the early koontz is the best koontz\\", which is true because koontz has changed and his early books are classic and the best. But he has improved in many ways and is one of the best. But sneaky koontz has bunch of tricks up his sleaves and he's gonna spit out more classics in the future to come.BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON will be a instant classic and might be one of koontz best work to date. If you are a koontz fan, it is a must read for you. If u like interesting thriller/horror/suspense genre with a little bit of humor sprinkling it is a must read for you. If you want a book that moves fast and is extremely hard to put down then cancel all your plans and read this. If you want to be touched emotionally..read it. Basically everyone should read it...it is a satifying read because as always and once again Dean Koontz makes yet another brilliant entry in the anals of classic suspense. :)"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I have read plenty of Dean Koontz. I have not appreciated much of the gore he includes, but liked his story telling abilities. By the Light of the Moon is by far one of his best pieces, leaving out much of the distasteful stuff and utilizing his writing abilities. Certainly well worth the read."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I have attempted to read By the Light of the Moon several times on my commute to work. I have read many of Koontz's novels and this one is very hard to get into. I find the characters annoying and their constant bickering is very tedious. I have only read 100 pages, but I don't think I will waste my time reading more."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"When Dylan O'Connor heads out to an art exhibit with his autistic brother, Shep, he thinks this is just another road trip. He plans to sell a few paintings, spend some quality time with his brother, and overall, enjoy himself. He certainly never imagined he'd be abducted by a madman, tied to a chair, and injected with what can only be described as &quot;stuff&quot;, even by the madman himself. Then, things only get more complicated when Dylan realizes that his brother's also been injected, and the two meet a pessimistic, negative comedienne, who - you guessed it - has also been injected with the mysterious &quot;stuff&quot;.Now, the three of them can only depend on each other. The cops can't be of any help, and they're being chased by madmen who seem even more intent on doing them harm than the original mad scientist who got them into this mess to begin with. What follows is one bizarre adventure after another, as the three try to figure out what this &quot;stuff&quot; is doing to them, whether the effects can be controlled, and whether any of them can ever return to a normal life after all of this.Though the premise is bizarre, and the storyline itself is just as odd as it promises to be, BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON is utterly fascinating. Written in beautiful, entrancing prose, and offering unique insights into the human condition, this is one book that's hard to put down. I often found myself wondering whether events could get any stranger - and they always did. Koontz's imagination never fails to surprise, offering more brain candy than your mind can handle, and inserting enough metaphors and intelligent themes to make you realize that there's something deeper behind this seemingly unrealistic, yet intriguing story."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I've read almost all of Koontz's books, but this is one of the worst. It was so boring. A novel about 3 people on the run from some mysterious (government?) people after having been injected with some mysterious substance that makes them undergo some mysterious transformation should be fast-paced. Yet this plodded on, and plodded on, and plodded on. Oh yeah. It plodded on. Koontz's editors need to be slapped too. Why did they let Koontz use all the flowery language? Koontz, I'm sure, had to go purchase a new thesaurus after writing this novel, because he had to have worn his old one to shreds. Some of the wording in this novel is so awkward that it seems obvious Koontz was just flipping through lists upon lists of synonyms to find words to use--well, most of them don't work, and they seem completely amateurish. The writing style just didn't fit this story. I skipped pages upon pages in this book, but missed absolutely none of the plot (what little there was). Skip this book at all costs. ++For a similar story with a slightly better execution, read Micheal Crichton's Prey."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Firstly, let me say that I am a long-time Koontz fan, and have read all of his published books. Among my favorites were &quot;Strangers&quot; (ironically, the first of his books that I ever read) and &quot;Whispers&quot;. But this one has almost gotten me to the point where Mr. Koontz's self-serving prose style gets me to say &quot;enough already...!&quot;. The scene in the California house, with the big shootout, was so completely ruined by Shep's constant, overdone, ANNOYING repetition of &quot;where's the ice?&quot; that I found myself literally skipping pages until I located the absolute LAST &quot;where's the ice?&quot;, and I tentatively resumed reading from that point on. Mind you, this involved skipping about ten pages, if not more. The Shep character, in general, was SO completely overdone that it took what could have been a sensitive portrayal of autism and turned it into the reader wanting to scream &quot;kill that kid, already!!&quot;. It's too bad, since the story itself is engaging and interesting -- but it's utterly defeated by this masturbatory style of prose. A suggestion for Mr. Koontz: PLEASE get away from the &quot;how much descriptive prose can I cram into a 24-hour story&quot;, and return to the type of multifaceted, intertwining-storyline, longer-timeline works that are actually engrossing and captivating. Time is free -- don't be so stingy with it...!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I liked this book, but the end is kinda weak.....it just seems to end too convenienly. After tearing through the book at record speed, I was expecting more. I liked the relationship between the two brothers, it was very touching. But its not a bad read. If you like his other works, you'll like this."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"The preceding criticisms about this book's abrupt ending are right on target. It was dangerously close to a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; ending where the hero wakes up and finds it's all been a dream, the principal characters are on the fringe of bankruptcy and suddenly get an inheritance, etc. It just wasn't made an integral part of the story and a scene at the North Pole (no kidding!) couldn't save it.But in other ways, this was Koontz developing the themes that Koontz knows best. In this book in particular, published just a year or so after 9/11 and a half-century-plus after the demise of the Third Reich, the villain here is the recently-expired century's version of the devil: the Utopian:&quot;These were times still hammered by the utopian schemes that nearly destroyed civilization in the previous century, ideological wrecking balls that swung through the nearly years of this new millenium with diminishing force but with sufficient residual power to demolish the hopes of multitudes if sane men and women weren't vigilant.&quot; (pg. 65, Bantam Books paperback edition)Among the most poignant non-thriller scenes in this novel are Dylan's confronting of his conflicting feelings for the autistic brother whom he loves but whose need for care and attention is frequently exhausting and has in a sense consumed Dylan's life. Anyone who has had long-term experience as a caregiver for a family member will identify with Dylan's simultaneous need to &quot;vent&quot; and his very real love and concern for his sibling.Koontz has been known to continue characters over more than one book, such as his Christopher Snow character. If he should do that with this novel, it might redeem the ending somewhat. But this book is a good read for Koontz fans and generally recommended."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I liked this book all except the ending. It seemed too rushed. Too convienent an ending but the rest of the book was excellent! I'd give it 31/2 only because the stand up comic wasn't as funny as a stand up comic should be, there was no pet besides a plant (which was rather cute), and where the ending lacked the rest of the novel dragged just a bit."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Anyone of Dean Koontz's books are awesome and I recommend anything that he wrote but &quot;By the Light of the Moon&quot; first comes to mind. The story is not only very suspensful but very...deep. It gets better as you read and if you have a night to yourself then please read this book! Get yourself some hot chocolate and a blanket and you're set. :)"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"It is rare that an author's works continue to improve over the number of years that Koontz has been writing. I've read almost (or maybe all - can't keep track) of his books and I couldn't put this one down."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I have read every published novel by Dean Koontz and continue to marvel at the depth of his imagination. BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON is no exception, although, initially, it was burdened by labored and esoteric prose--so much so that, for a while, I thought I had ventured into a Toni Morrison novel. As usual, however, this author's wit and remarkable imagination prevailed, and allowed me to connect with the characters, and wonder at their amazing, albeit involuntarily induced, capabilities. The concept of &quot;folding&quot; will never mean the same to me again, and I am &quot;much improved&quot; by this wild experience.(Read and reviewed March 21, 2003)"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Build, build, build. Koontz again demonstrates his uncanny ability to spin a quality yarn. The suspense built at a breakneck speed (literally at 100 mph+ in one scene). My heart raced along with Dylan as he flew down the interstate. Koontz is a master at keeping the reader just outside the margin of understanding without isolating him from the forward movement of the story. This combination makes for a truly exciting read! The ending was rather abrupt for me. While the wrap-up was satisfying, it seemed to move quickly from a black and gray suspense novel to a red, white, and blue comic book ending. It was an unexpected finish with a couple of clever twists, but left me wondering &quot;Why did he end in such a way?&quot;Of course, what can we expect from the master of suspense?Keep 'em comin', Mr. Koontz!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I have read Koontz's books and for a hile had been a little disappointed, however By the light of the Moon lives up to all my expectations of a Dean Koontz novel :) I really enjoyed the fast (which is reminent of Dark Rivers of the Heart)pace and the awesome technology (Nanobots, which make all Koontz novels just that bit more believable? who knows what will happen in the future). However the ending was very superhero-ish and made me think of Mutant X (TV Show) with all their special powers and wanting to use them for good. Koontz hasn't done very many sequels, but this has a feel of part 2 coming up. I really enjoyed the characters in this novel and how they jelled together. Koontz often writes to a loose \\"formula\\" and this fits right in to it. Man, Woman and Dog (This case autistic brother)find trouble with new technology and must keep one step ahead at all times. Shep (autistic brother) brings a lot of light humour to the novel which breaks up the intencity of the action, just at the right moments. I laughed a lot during this novel. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"There are three books I've read recently that I thoroughly enjoyed: THE DA VINCI CODE, BARK OF THE DOGWOOD, and BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON. While I did like ODD THOMAS better than BY THE LIGHT, I nevertheless enjoyed it! I thought the characters were particularly well developed and the premise was fascinating.Also recommended: The Da vinci Code, Bark of the Dogwood, In this Mountain"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I usually can't put his books down but this one I kept leaving. The lead characters weren't nearly as compelling as many of his others. For anyone who has never read Dean Koontz - please don't let this be your first! He is a terrific writer but this story just isn't as good as his other stuff. I trudged through this book wondering when would it end. Thankfully it wasn't very long."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"The problem is this could have been a great story had Koontz's editor cut out about 1400 &quot;where's the ice&quot; lines and other annoying &quot;Shep lines&quot; at what could have otherwise been some suspensful moments. If this was not written by Koontz this story would have never been published. This was probably the most annoying story that I have listened to, (used BOT) and stayed with because just when it gets really, really annoying and you want to bail on it you also want to see what happens since you have so much time invested. The only advantage to reading it as opposed to listening to every single word, is that you could skim many, many sections as you read and that might make it tolerable."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"When I picked this book off the shelf at the store I didn't know that it had anything to do with a character having autism. I have autism so right away I was very interested in reading this book because reading books on autism fiction or non-fiction is one of my favorite types of books to read. This book I enjoyed reading. Every time that I would put the book down I would say to my son that this book is good. For me to be interested in a book with so many pages and actually liking and finishing it I must say the book was just that good."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"The three main characters of the book are Dylan, a hulking optimistic artist; his younger brother Shep, who is autistic; and a beautiful pessimistic comedienne named Jilly.Jilly's life intersects with the two brothers when the three are injected by the proverbial mad scientist with a mysterious fluid that soon has the threesome experiencing superhuman powers, even as they are hunted by a cadre of trained killers intent on keeping the mad scientist's inventions from the world. By the end of the book, the three have evolved into something more than human, and they seek to use their gifts to improve the world.I wanted to give Koontz every benefit of the doubt on this book, having just come off of the spectacular (by Koontz standards) Odd Thomas. What I found is that this book straddles neatly the improvements found in Odd Thomas and the pitfalls that have plagued his writing since the eighties. There is humor to be found throughout the book, particularly in the use of exaggerated and thickly strewn metaphors. Some of it works, and some of it doesn't. I didn't really mind it once the book got going, but what I couldn't forgive as easily were the characters, which were only different from the cardboard cutouts that have peopled his earlier works in details and professions. Dylan and Jilly are philosophical opposites who are attracted to each other. Yet, they're both seemingly incapable of moral uncertainty, and not just because they are compelled to do the right thing. Dylan is a model older brother, caring for the too-adorably autistic Shep with no thought to his own needs.Another big criticism concerns the verbal sparring between Dylan and Jilly, which is so contrived that it wouldn't seem out of place on an old-time radio show. For example, as men with guns are bearing down on them, Jilly trades barbs with Dylan as he tries to convince her that he is not a serial killer (there is no reason for her to believe that he is one).I also can't help seeing a similarity between Koontz's books and the films of M. Night Shyamalan. Odd Thomas is about a man who says, in a joking reference to the movie Sixth Sense \\"I see dead people.\\" In this book, Dylan can see the crimes of people with whom he has physical contact, exactly like Bruce Willis's character in Unbreakable. And he has another book from this time period that deals with a large-scale alien invasion, ala \\"Signs.\\"Despite these criticisms, the book takes a fun idea and moves us fluidly from one action scene to another. The pacing is very well done, and it was certainly a page turner. I plan to still give more of the recent Koontz a try."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"This is the fifth novel I have read by this author and I thought it was really great. The characters were greatly developed and the humor in the book made it even better. The action keeps the reader involved and the story does not get tiresome. The only complaint I have is the ending, which I felt took a 180 degree turn out of no where. Don't know if Koonts plans on writing a sequal to the book as another reviewer suggested but I hope not because I do not believe it could live up to this one. Regardless, definetely read this novel, it will be worth your time. I also suggest Tick Tock by Koontz if youre looking for a shorter humorous read."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I admit, after reading other reviews of the novel, several of which said that this was Koontz's best, I was dissapointed.While the characters were funny and endearing, I didn't feel they were as well developed as, say, the couple from \\" Dark Rivers\\" or the characters from the Christopher Snow novels. I guess I was dissapointed that they had actual lives before being injected with the stuff, and that they had to give up their lives as if being a comedian and an artist aren't worthy enough- I say what's the worth of life without laughter and beauty. The character of Shep was interesting, but terribly inconsistent, and I was annoyed to find him a veggie at the beggining of the novel, extraordinary in the middle, and then reduced to saying \\"cake\\",\\"ice\\" and \\"tasty\\" at the end.While I enjoy the chased/ chasers aspect of the novel, the antagonists barely appear in the story( What- three times?), so it's easy to forget they exist. The tautness, intensity and cardiac arrest induced by, for example \\" Dark Rivers\\" or \\" Intensity\\", etc. is just not in this novel.Part of the reason I enjoy Koontz's books is because of the humor, but in the beggining of the book, dare I say it, it was over the top and became irritating. The \\"I'm not a rapist, I'm an artist.\\" bit was excellent, though.I guess to sum it all up, I guess I was dissapointed that I wasn't reduced to a sodden mass of tears at the close of the novel. \\" By The Light Of The Moon\\" only left me satisfied- usually after a Koontz novel I'm reassured of the innate goodness of humankind, awed by the possibility of technology, impressed by the redemptive power of love and courage, or just plain moved.Despite all the compliants listed above, \\"By The Light of The Moon\\" is still a great read and worthy of your time- Koontz at his not so best is still EXTRAORDINARY!- and I eagerly await his next work."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I love Koontz, there are no ifs, ands, or buts about it. Nonetheless, despite enjoying some of recent works, &quot;From the Corner of His Eye&quot; and &quot;One Door Away from Heaven&quot; included, I have noticed that while Koontz's ideas remained fresh, his writing had gotten a little stuffy and verbose. The man can absolutely spend three pages describing the texture of the dew on the thorn of a rose. I enjoyed the quickened pace of this book and the subject matter as well. Though Koontz has shown more brvity in this novel, he has also stayed true to his norm of creating characters that are enjoyable and developing them fully. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I am a dedicated Koontz fan, have been for a few years, but what is it about him that attracts me? I must be perfectly honest: this book seemed fluffy to me, at first. So did his last, and the one before that. But why, then, am I hooked after reading the VERY FIRST WORD. Yes, that's right; it's a cliche, but I was hooked after the first word. He always does that to me, and I can't explain why.Maybe it's the plot and the characters. Here, Koontz presents two people who are as real as you or I: Dylan, an artist travelling the country with his retarded brother Shep; and Jilly, a struggling comedian with a past that causes her to hate men. Two entirely un-related people, perfect strangers, until they are assaulted by the same man--a \\"Frankenstein\\" doctor, who injects them both with a mysterious substance.It isn't long before weird things start to happen. Jilly begins to predict a massacre at a church, while Dylan is suddenly overcome by the urge to just GO certain places...and stop the crimes happening there. And Shep is maybe affected the strangest of all...because he has this unique ability to transport himself miles away...and across time...But they are being hunted by enemies of the doctor. But in this guess, the enemy of my enemy is NOT my friend. Pursued by men who do not hesitate in killing, Dylan, Jilly, and Shep must try to survive the guns and bullets...in order to see if they will surive the liquid that flows through their veins.A novel packed with revelation, with characters that jump off the pages and sit next to you, BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON is perfect Dean Koontz. Maybe that is why I was hooked; because perfect Koontz is as perfect as you can get."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"This is a great book! One of the best books by Dean Koontz!

She stumbles outside, runs into Dylan and Shep as they are fleeing the scene.

Jillian's car blows up and several black Suburbans roar into the motel parking lot as the three of ease out the driveway and head for the interstate.They have been injected with tiny nanobots, minute machines that work miracles in their brains, giving them powers of perception and prediction that make them very dangerous. However it is not so easy for them to get away, because when they perceive a horrible wrong about to be done, they are compelled to right it, no matter the danger, no matter the cost. And every time they help someone, their pursuers seem to find out about it and get ever closer.As usual, Dean Koontz has written a frightening thriller that not only will keep you reading through the pages, but will educate you about the cutting edge of a science that can have horrible ramifications on our future.

I don't have a problem suspending disbelief but I found the childish solutions and happy-sappy endings to be a little more than I could fathom. There is no doubt that Dean Koontz is a master of suspense and story-telling but I feel some of the scenes should have been condensed to avoid getting glazed-over eyes and that the intensity of the story faded later on in the book.

The characters are coincidentally thrown into a plot together against their will and find that their fantastic new abilities tie them to links from their past which were always voids of questions.Koontz does a great job of character development, realization and evolution from quiet citizens to team leaders.

The story line is fast-paced, as Jilly and Dylan mostly try to do what they feel is right though not always agreeing. In spite of a climax that sets up sequels rather than closure, genre fans will send the grandmaster back to his usual best selling status, deservedly so.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"There is something very hypnotic about this novel. The story itself is a bit tedious and in the end, you may feel that the conclusion is less than satisfying. That being said, I would recommend this novel based on atmosphere alone. Koontz has the ability to draw the reader in by creating a unique tone that works well for the elements of this story."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Read Blue Moon's review. I absolutely agree that this over-descriptive, boring bantar was a waste of time. I would have rather watched Rainman with Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman 10 times in a row. I have just listened to and read the last of Dean Koontz. Snore."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Enjoyed the book so much I bought the audio version so I could enjoy it again."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"In fairness I should say that I'm a HUGE Dean Koontz fan to begin with but I LOVED this book. The only bad part was that it had to end. The main characters are very three dimensional, the plot was just complicated enough, the pace fast and good and, as with all Koontz's books, I'm a sucker for a happy ending. It was an exhilarating read and great fun!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"\\"By the Light of the Moon\\" takes a while before it gets really interesting. At times, Koontz tries too hard to be funny, which results in some rather awkward dialogue. Some parts of the book are overwritten, with far fetched metaphores, which slows down the pace. Koontz's books are usually real page turners that I can finish in a day or two. This took a while longer because it wasn't quite as gripping as his best works. The ending, however, is spectacular. Some of Koontz's books ends rather abruptly, but I liked the ending of this one very much.\\"By the Light of the Moon\\" is a bit uneven. It doesn't rank among Koontz's best works, but it's much better than his bad ones (One Door Away from Heaven, The Taking). Recommended to Koontz fans. Those new to Koontz may want to read some of his other books first."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"This was my 1st Dean Koontz book - I had never read him before. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I have since become a real Koontz fan..."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Simple review Not even close to one of Koontz's great,good or even readable novels. Love the author but as usual he didnt tie the ending to the book or even give the ending any time to develop. Also that Jilly charachter not only does she have big issues, she carries around a plant for company that she holds conversation with but i hate her apperance everytime shes in the book i had to skip over her dialouge if she wasnt arguing with Dylan she was saying something that just made me dislike her more. Ive never had a charachter in a book where everytime it was their turn with dialouge i cringed. Koontz what the hell is going on?"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I couldn't put this book down, I ended up reading it in a day."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"One of the best things about this book is that it's fairly short by Dean Koontz standards - approximately 400 pages - and it goes right to the point from the first sentence. The action practically begins in the first chapter and doesn't stop all the way to the end. If you've got a free weekend and you want some good entertainment through books, I highly recommend that you pick this one up.Also, this is not the usual trend of gory fiction you would normally get from this genre, which is good. This story doesn't just focus on the suspense of the plot. It also focuses on the characters. The relationship between Dylan and Sheperd is poignant and touching. Dylan plays the role of the brother/father and Sheperd is the younger brother with a mental disability. Throughout the story Dean Koontz presents a quasi--3D portrayal of these two characters. I could almost feel them in real life. That's how solid Mr. Koontz' writing is in this particular story. I won't say much more because I'd be giving away the plot. All I can say is please read this book. You won't regret it. I promise."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Dean Koontz' By the Light of the Moon was a fun & pleasurable escapist adventure thriller. I enjoy Koontz's gift for creating interesting story characters, and it is refreshing to follow the lives of relatively wholesome main characters whose strength of character and values are reinforced and revealed through conflict and danger. I especially enjoyed reading about Dylan's viewpoint of the power of positive thinking as a diluted reflection of divine power. The adventure was enjoyable and easy to visualize.While I enjoyed this book, I will have to agree with some other reviewers that this story dragged a little at times with little too much description of Shep's autistic behavior and speech. I also felt that the story was incomplete and came to an abrupt ending. Koontz took great care in unfolding revealing & developing the main character brothers Dylan and Shep's abilities, but the development of Jilly's special abilities was somewhat sketchy in description and it was left unexplained as to how she came to believe she shared Shep's special ability. The ending was left partially unresolved. I'm left wondering about the hired mercenaries and the investors as well as the survival of the main characters. Maybe that was done intentionally for further adventures for Dylan, Shep, Jilly and perhaps even Parish Lantern?"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I've read most of Koontz' recent works and a theme is starting to develop. His novels are often slow moving, but heavy on characterization and flowery use of the English language. Eventually, the story starts moving, and the goodness of humanity prevails. In BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON, Koontz delivers an entirely familiar novel. Dylan O'Connor and his autistic brother are attacked by a madman and the beginning of the novel. The man injects them with an unknown substance that promises to change them in dramatic ways. The man also injects Jillian O'Connor. Before this man fleas, he warns them that they will be pursued to the ends of the earth by men trying to destroy his life's work.The unlikely pair leave town, barely escaping golf-clothed, suburban driving heavies. The injection changes each of the three differently, but profoundly, and they must learn to deal with these changes while fighting for their sanity and lives. Shep, as the younger, autistic brother, is fun. Dylan and Jilly seem to be standard Koontz heroes.While the pages were filled with description and characterization, and not much movement in plot, I still kept reading and enjoying the journey Koontz took me on. However, the pace and plot would have been bad enough for me to not recommend this book, but the ending changes it for me. I'm definitely not going to spoil it for you, but it begs for a sequel, and not because nothing is concluded, but because I want to see where Dylan, Shep and Jilly go next."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Another fantastic thriller from Dean Koontz with more than a little humour injected into it by way of the eccentric comedian Jillian and her pet plant.Unlike most books that try to combine chilling suspence and laugh-out-loud humour, this book succeed and really makes the cross-genre work. This is a brilliant novel that will have you laughing one moment and ducking under the covers the next.I would reccomend this book to all fans of Dean Koontz or of the thriller/horror genre especially if you like books to be scary but still manage to have a nice, lighthearted feel to them."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I have always enjoyed reading Mr. Koontz's books, they have such a sensitivity. But definitely my favourite one is By the Light of the Moon. I enjoyed this topic about new abilities and the fact that the characters face these new abilities with courage and trying always to do the best they can, they don't even struggle to use them for their own good or for evil...they just become heroes. But the best of this book is that the author shows these characters and the fact of having these new abilites from a funny and witty side."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Good page-turner. I hadn't read a Koontz book in years and it lived up to what I expected, which was something escapist and a little bit chilling. Don't expect a hard-core fright fest here, just a mystery with a supernatural edge. Don't think too hard about the plot or you'll probably snag a loose end and unravel it! Oh, and speaking of metaphors, Koontz does tend to employ some really terrible extended metaphors in his writing -- but that's ok -- we don't read Dean Koontz to experience literary finesse!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Outstanding book....a real page turner. You will not want to or be able to put the book down. A very enjoyable read. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Well, Koontz finally has written a book without a dog in it. Though they do show up in a puzzle. :) This book shows that the author has a command with the English language. His descriptions are beautifully crafted. Even so this book is a very fast read. But the end of the book leaves you wanting more. It is as if he did not finish it, or there is a sequel in mind.By the Light of the Moon follows the tried and true formula, normal people who are unwillingly brought into a government conspiracy. This time the bad guy is a mad-scientist. While the good guys are a sensitive he-man, his impaired brother and a man hating heroine. Our trio ends up on the run from ex-special forces teams.A doctor who claims that the substance will either kill them, or drastically change them for the better injects our trio with a serum. But now that they are injected, the men who are looking to kill him will want to kill them as well. And so the three begin their flight from danger. But their flight takes on various directions, as they are lead by Dylan's new ability of precognition.Our heroes are Dylan O'Conner, who is an artist and guardian of his autistic brother, Shep. Dylan is a man who has sacrificed everything to take care of his brother. Then there is Shep, Dylan's autistic brother. Who is a walking thesaurus. His episodes may seem redundant, but imagine what it is really like. I think that Koontz did a good job of writing this character. And finally our heroine, Jillian Jackson. Jillian is a comedienne that is just filled with"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"This book was, without a doubt, one of my absolute favorites from Dean Koontz. The characters are very likeable, and the premise is one that I haven't encountered in fiction before (although I'm sure there are others out there). Given the paranoia that seems to be incorporated into everyday living, and stories of government funded research involving anything that could potentially be used in an offensive rather than defensive manner, it seems entirely plausible that nano-beings could be injected into a person who is later hunted down. Realism mixed with a hint of fantasy makes this book one of the best reads out there."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"\\"By the Light of the Moon\\" was the 2nd Koontz novel I read in 17 years. The first \\"Midnight\\" scared me so much as a 12 year old that it took 17 years to overcome the stigma. ;)In hindsight, \\"By the Light of the Moon\\" was probably not the best choice of books to reacquaint myself. While not spooky, the plot was at times trite, and the ending rushed and almost comic.The main characters have become unwilling guinea pigs to an egocentric brilliant scientist. The \\"stuff\\" that he injects affects each person differently, and you best hope it is for the good. Fortunately for the sake of the novel, all 3 of the victims use their newfound powers to right wrongs before they can occur, and escape the bad men in dark Suburbans.The conclusion that includes the confrontation of evil-scientist Proctor, and the formation of the \\"Moonlight Club\\" is almost a true comic book without the nifty illustrations. I've heard wonderful things about this author and am eager to try other books, but if this is your first time, or first time in awhile, this novel may not be the best pick of the litter."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I have to say I enjoyed &quot;By the Light of the Moon.&quot; I listened to the audio version of this book and the narrator did a STUPENDOUS job narrating Dylan, Shep and Jilly. The plot? Dylan is staying at a hotel when a wacky and deranged doctor injects Dylan with a mysterious liquid he calls only 'stuff.' The stuff, he says has the ability to change a person into something better...Or destroy him. When Dylan manages to escape the doctor, he is joined by another hotel guest who has also been injected. Together they flee mysterious generic bad guys across the country.I liked this Koontz novel mostly because it had more of a science fiction flair and less of a horror flavor which I rather liked. Also, there were no dogs, and better still, no body-part collecting serial killers. Thank you, Mr. Koontz! I like variety, and this book was both appealing because of its lack of gratuitous gore, and thought provoking, because of the message. The only thing I didn't like? What happened to the doctor at the end....And...Also...At times Shep's repetitiveness got old. Especially in the narrated version, when you couldn't easily skip the words...I think Shep must've said &quot;Ice and Cake&quot; at least two-hundred times.... 5 Star effort. Only surpassed by Fear Nothing."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Back when I read books on a regular basis, I was a huge Dean R. Koontz fan. Now that I've returned, I see that Mr. Koontz has dropped the \\"R,\\" improved his already impressive writing style, and kept the same basic characters types that he's always used. Again, I do consider myself a Koontz fan. When I decided to get back into reading, I made sure to include a couple of Koontz books in my splurge.\\"By the Light of the Moon\\" starts fast and maintains that same pace from start to finish. The fictional science behind the plot is just realistic enough for suspension of disbelief, and the side-effects of the villain's wicked \\"stuff\\" are clever and become increasingly inventive as the story moves along. Koontz starts off with your standard, generic, run of the mill \\"psychic\\" powers, but then he gets more creative.The only drawback about this book, and many other Koontz books I've read: The characters. This is NOT to say that they are \\"two dimensional\\" or \\"unbelievable.\\" Taken on their own, they are fine. If this were the ONLY Koontz book you ever read, you would have no idea that this is his short coming, and for those single time readers, I would say this book is actually 5 stars.BUT, for those of you who have read Koontz before or intend to read him again, you will find that he has once again brought us the same characters: The withdrawn man with a sad background; the hardened, withdrawn woman with a terrible background; and the third party (in this case, a brother), usually related to the man, who is deficient or handicapped in some way (in this case, autistic). And, against all odds, this lonely man and lonely, disgruntled woman somehow manage to find their mutual lights at the end of the tunnel ... you see where I'm going. In some ways, Koontz would have been better off just making all of these books ABOUT the same characters, and turning them into a series of sequels. Character wise, that's what we end up with, anyway.But again, setting that aside, I really enjoyed this novel. I don't want to give anything away, but this books ends on a PERFECT note to set it up for a sequel. I don't think Koontz does them, but I wish he would in this case. I would LOVE to read it, and after all, in a sequel, the characters are EXPECTED to be the same."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Koontz tells a far-fetched story with stimulating ease. I'm not a huge science fiction fan which no doubt colors my opinion, but I loved the encompassing writing style that envelopes the reader from the beginning and the continual hook at the end of each short chapter which pulled me to the end of the book.I expected more from the ending, but Koontz makes getting there a lot of fun and creates characters one can cheer for and a fast-paced assortment of scenarios that show their development as they drive through the mystery of their newfound gift/curse.It was a fun but not necessarily memorable read.Dane Hicks, author of THE SKINNING TREE and A WHISPER FOR HELP"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"this story isn't quite as intense as the dean koontz thrill rides i'm used to- but i loved it all the same for the gentle message of hope it contained. positive and uplifting AND you can let your teenagers read it."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"This is a page-turner. And that's worth something. By the end it gathers some comic-book traits reminiscent of the legion of superheroes.A book is all too often a product of its time and culture. This book is so annoyingly \\"politically correct\\". When our pc heroes get the upper hand and defeat an evil villain, they are so careful not to harm the evil one. We're taking an opposition to capital punishment to a foolish level when our conscience cries out to us not to harm Hitler, to make sure he doesn't stub his toe while under our supervision. The red-blooded and more natural reaction would be \\"kick his butt\\". This bloodless, goody-goody quality is very annoying to me.Oh no, don't leave the poor bad guy out in the cold. He might freeze his tootsies. Oh gee, that would be too bad wouldn't it. He just killed your mother and father, stupid! That's the sort of namby pamby attitude that annoys me. It is annoying because it is purposely put in there to appeal to the bloodless ones among us who would pedicure Hitler before leading him to his golf prison.Shifting back to the positive, and this book does deserve a positive review, we get some interesting plot lines. The characters aren't very well developed. They are set pieces. The friendly bear, the wisecracking chick, and a rather cardboard autistic boy.It's easier to quibble than to praise. So here's another quibble. The entire book can be summed up by its most repeated phrase, with Jilly patiently and lovingly saying to Shep \\"Come on, sweetie, fold us out of here\\" while the bullets whiz by and the boy is saying \\"ice, ice, ice\\" or \\"cake\\".It reminds me of a He-Man cartoon I once saw. Someone was in deep trouble, the villain was on the doorstep, and He-Man was slowly walking to the rescue. One of my kids had this episode on tape, so I saw it over and over and over. I always yelled out at the screen \\"Take your time, He-Man!\\""},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"It was pretty good. He's had much better and I have been disappointed with the last few books and their lackluster endings but nonetheless, a good read. Buy the paperback though."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I just finished &quot;By the Light of the Moon&quot;. I rather enjoyed it but not as much as his earlier novels. I used to be a huge fan of his books until after &quot;Sole Survivor&quot;. After that it seems like Dean Koontz has been on a weird downward spiral of books that just don't add up or live up to our expectations. He has become too formulatic and predictable. I gave this book 2 stars because I always love his characters and his colorful use of prose but this book did have a comic book angle to it, especially near the end. (**spoiler**) I wasn't expecting it to end in such a silly way but it did. I mean come on! The Midnight Club? And what was with them all discussing near the end about giving themselves alter-ego names? Plus I really rolled my eyes with the scene of the plane flying pass the moon giving off an image of a &quot;tiny-winged silhouette&quot; ala Batman style. I felt that Dean had watched &quot;X-Men&quot; a couple of times and couldn't come up with any idea's for a book and just used his old formula with a super-heroes twist and heard through his editor about Michael Crichton's latest idea of nanotechnology. I wish that Dean would get his head out of the teleporter and show us his real mind power!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"As usual, Dean Koontz starts out strong, gets far-out ridiculous, and then ends it with the most dull, sappy ending.

Give them a chance instead of praising this rubbish pot."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I am a big Koontz fan having read all of his books. By the Light of the Moon was a big disappointment. The story's well written, and its initial premise was very interesting. However, as it developed it became very cartoon like and seemed to better fit a comic book (X-Men to be specific) than a Koontz novel. It would have been much better had it followed the suspense angle of having been injected by something and trying to determine who, why and what than turn into a fantasy involving people that were really not very interesting. I'll continue to be a Koontz fan because I typically find his stories to be very interesting and well written. By the Light of the Moon is, however, not going to be one of my favorites. I was so looking forward to the next Koontz book too!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Well, it has finally happened. Dean Koontz has actually strangled himself on metaphor, adjective, simile, etc etc etc. I paid full price for this turgid paperback and even with the leisure reading time of a cross-country flight, found myself skimming and flipping over pages to find the storyline. You can practically see him typing away, sighing with delight over every flowery, ornate turn of phrase that further obscures the plot. His lumbering try for humor reminds me of a simliar tragic attempt by Robert Ludlum some years back.I bought this book on the basis of some of Koontz's early works (Watchers, Twilight Eyes) and if this is what he is passing off as literature now, I'm finished.&quot;By the Light of the Moon&quot; is not even worth a trip to the used bookstore - it went straight into the recycle."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Koontz's last few novels had excellent villains, but the stories had lacked that certain something that makes his novels like Lightning, Fear Nothing, and Intensity so special.

It has renewed my interest in is work, and I look forward to the next."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Dean Koontz's by the light of the moon fell short in my book.

Entertaining, fast-paced, got right down to business at the first sentence. Nice touch, Dean Koontz."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"We stopped reading Dean Koontz about 20 years ago as his plots and often very long stories were just a little too fantastic, in the supernatural sense, for our taste. We see in the two decades since, he has been a prolific publisher, with the now some 40 novels to his credit implying a bazillion fans.\\"Moon\\" gets off to a fast start: Dylan O'Connor, a struggling artist and caretaker for his semi-autistic brother Shep, and a struggling comedienne, Jilly Jackson, heretofore strangers, are all accosted in a motel by a \\"mad\\" doctor-type guy who overwhelms each and injects them with some sort of \\"stuff\\" featuring his life's work. He also warns them his enemies will be seeking them out. It turns out the payload was a zillion nanotechnology machines that influence brain function (ala the nanotechnology cameras and such in Michael Creighton's latest \\"Prey\\"). Each of the recipients is affected with different supernatural powers: Shep can \\"fold\\" people (teleportation); Jilly has strange visions (and learns to fold), and Dylan has sightings based on touching things (ala King's lead character in Dead Zone). The action unfolds as the three run from the chasers while acting on Dylan's need to make things right from the visions he is getting off people and objects. A somewhat poorly crafted ending, almost in the Superman style of good over evil, brings the tale to a somewhat abrupt end.Like King, Koontz has a vivid imagination and apparently can put his ideas into writing without difficulty. He seems to love to turn a good phrase, with at times prose better suited to poetry or some other genre. We thought that except for the fast start, much of the book dragged along until the second half when everybody, including us, has a better idea of what's going on and then the suspense really builds. The ending will probably disappoint most readers; we weren't at all sure it was a natural denouement of events. For our taste, we still think Koontz is a little too \\"fantastic\\", but note that in a not too crowded niche he seems to enjoy great success."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Dean Koontz is one of the most unique writers in the world today. The characters in his books are so psychologically advanced to the point of the reader knowing how they will react to a situation. His latest book is no exception. By the light of the moon was an excellent book with the suspense starting early and never taking its foot off of the accelerator. It is a book that is easy to read yet has a very intricate plot to it. I recommend this book for anyone who likes suspense novels because they will not be dissapointed here."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Easy read, interesting topic. Mr Koontz will there be a part two??"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I have all of his books! I have read all and would lend them out and not get returned, so sometimes have to buy other copies. I have originals of some of his first ones. No one can get to the 'heart of the matter' aswellas Dean R. Koontz. They are not so 'far out' as to not be believable, but makes you lock your doors and check under your bed and closets. He brings out the most natural of life as we all view and puts that twist on it to question everything. The first I read, I was hooked. I'd love to a 'book critque' as I do read so much, but he's the best and as a person, he pours his life in his stories and sometimes takes more out of him than many think. That's why I love how he can go from something so scary, then so funny and silly, but that touch of horror in there. He's a wonderful writer and deserves much more recognition than he gets."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"While I tend to like Dean Koontz quite a bit, I'm sad to conclude that this book is simply too derivative and too slowly-paced to be considered among his finest efforts. I'd have to rank it among his worst, in fact.As a tale of scientifically engineered superhumans, _By the Light of the Moon_ is strongly reminiscent of Koontz's earlier (and much superior) novel _Midnight_, with one crippling difference: in _Midnight_, a heroic band of normal humans are on the run from the superhumans, while here, the roles are reversed. As it turns out, pretty much the only way to keep the odds interesting in a battle between human bad guys and superhuman good guys is to make the latter act inexcusably dumb at times. Hundreds if not thousands of sci-fi and fantasy writers before Koontz have been forced to accept this, and Koontz unfortunately fails to find a better solution.For instance: shouldn't it be a matter of basic intuition that, when on the run from unknown villains who appear to have access to every last piece of information about you that is a matter of public record, the *last* place you want to go in search of refuge (even for a moment) is your primary residence? So, of course, that's precisely what our heroes do. The predictable assault by heavy artillery goes on for 32 pages, which is 32 too many.Nor do Koontz's fallbacks on cliche end there. Just as Superman has his Kryptonite and Green Lantern has serious issues with the color yellow, the most powerful member of Koontz's heroic trio -- the one who possesses an ability that should be able to get them out of almost any scrape -- suffers from an autistic disorder. Any way you slice it, *far* too many pages of this book are spent on desperate efforts to get poor Shep to snap out of his Rain Man routine and get with the survival program. It's supposed to be suspense, but since we're fairly certain that Koontz isn't about to let Shep's failure to act get any of our heroes killed, it mostly just adds up to tedium as we wait and wait and wait some more, again and again and again, for our autistic hero to step up inevitablely at the last possible moment.Then, factor in the attempts at humorous dialogue that simply do not work. (Maybe Koontz subconsciously knew this, and that's why he decided to make our heroine an aspiring but so-far unsuccessful comedienne?) Then, factor in the flowery, borderline-pretentious writing style, in which every simile that works is accompanied by a large handful of painful clunkers. Koontz is capable of so much better, and I'd rather he took a five-year sabbatical to rediscover his muse if the alternative is more phoned-in rehashes like this one."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"After having read app. 40 books written by Dean Koontz, I am getting more and more critical and apprehensive of his increasingly flowery style. Just 140 pages into By the Light of the Moon I found myself skipping pages and finally putting it aside with disgust. From now on, Koontz is taken from my buy-on-sight list and I'll never again buy one of his books that involves an intelligent canine or autistic brother, where the action takes place in just 24 hours (and thus begging for the disgusting extended prose and flowerly writing style) or is about a couple of people on the run for unknown persons and unknown reasons. Let alone, novels that include all of the above!!!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Having come off the great, one-day, page turning read of \\"One Door Away from Heaven\\", I found this book to be tepid and only mildly interesting.Mostly this has to do with Mr. Koontz's on again off again descriptive vomiting. Maybe I am not the sharpest tool in the shed but I can usually pick up on a scene without a ten page description of the current surroundings. Or the ad nauseum thought processes of the characters. However, this trait does not hold true in all of his books so I can't say it is a fatal flaw. It seems to be either book filler or the author exploring his descriptive vocabulary. Either way it is not a constant event.Also, Stephen King fans might note the obvious rip-off of \\"The Dead Zone\\" in Dylan O'Conner's special abilities. Hopefully Mr. King is a close friend and won't take exception to the obvious theft of his character!...and I whole heartly agree with my fellow reviewers in the synergy this book has with Crichton's \\"Prey\\". Koontz, with his obvious over the top descriptive desires, could have come up with something better. Maybe Crichton just beat him to press and he didn't feel like revising. Who knows?"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I've read almost all of Dean Koontz's fifty plus books, and this is one of the more enjoyable ones. BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON is unique because it involves characters who develop superhuman powers, much like the characters in a comic book.This is new territory for Koontz, but he makes it a lot of fun, and the action in this novel is fast-paced and suspenseful. This book isn't a classic, but it definitely is one of Koontz's better recent efforts, filled with humor and Koontz's unique brand of spirituality. Koontz also does a fine job of portraying a character who is autistic -- he manages to humanize the character without making him sentimental.BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON contains a LOT of dialogue, and therefore reads very smoothly and quickly. I read this book in a single afternoon. As other reviewers have pointed out, the ending of this novel was indeed abrupt, and almost begs for a sequel. Koontz, however, has already stated publicly that there will be no second book featuring these characters.I heartily recommend BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON, but my advice is to seek out other Koontz novels if you're a first time reader. In particular, try WATCHERS, FEAR NOTHING, INTENSITY, PHANTOMS, or ODD THOMAS. I also recommend TICK TOCK and LIFE EXPECTANCY if you want a more humorous novel. Those are his very best ones, and will turn you into a hardcore fan like me."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"The is my first book by Dean Koontz, and I am not rushing to buy another. The plot read like a bad TV movie. The overall concept was interesting, but the way it was carried out was a little hard to swallow. The science should have been researched and explained more. Also, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to take the ending seriously or not. Koontz's depiction of an autistic character, however, was comical and poignant. (As a footnote, I was led to believe that this was a horror novel, but it is not. I am not letting that affect my review, though.)"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Koontz is good. I always read his books and wonder, 'how on earth did he get himself into this mess? (meaning, did he get himself so involved in writing the story that he got himself in such a deep puddle) Then I wonder, how is he going to get himself out? Unfortunately, with an abrubt ending. There have been a couple of his stories in which he ends, or wraps up everything in a chapter or two. Much too soon. By the light of the moon falls in this category. The story itself is great. It's a little farfetched, but hey, it could happen in the near future. The ending is too quick. And I felt the characters, though fleshed out excellent - as always - tend to see thier situation too casually. They have been injected with God knows what, and they're cracking jokes? They're dialogue is too kiddish. But it's still enjoyable. And it gets even more enjoyable a little more than halfway past the book, with a shocking twist. Oh, and the excerpt of Odd Thomas (at the end of the paperback) looks promising."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"By the Light of the Moon is a terrific return to the types of stories that attracted me to his books in the first place. With its liberal use of humor, suspense, and action, I found it to be on par, albeit in a different style of writing, with Watchers, Lightning, The Bad Place, Cold Fire, and other titles by this remarkable author. Recommended."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"This one will be more enjoyable for new readers of Dean Koontz than longtime fans. While it's suspenseful from the very start, the story never seems to develop into more than a conglomeration of parts from other Koontz novels-one sensitive guy with one autistic brother, one spunky independent woman, dozens of those unstoppable government agents and an evil scientist.(Of Koontz's last four novels, only &quot;The Face&quot; has been truly memorable. Skip this one and get a copy of &quot;The Face.&quot;)"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I love Koontz! I have read all of his books but this one was just a huge disappointment. It dragged on and on and I was so glad to reach the end. This is not an example of the Koontz I remember."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I just finished reading By the Light of the Moon. Totally riveting....totally cool. I loved the story line. Goes to show me that Dean Koontz has a fantastic imagination, with total believeability.in his stories. I enjoyed this very much, and I am sure anyone who reads it will love it as well."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Whoever writes the summaries on the hardcovers of Koontz's books is a better writer than Koontz himself. Sorry, just had to get that out. Anyway, I can't really make a judgement call like that because this is actually the only Dean Koontz book I've ever read and I don't really plan on reading another one anytime soon. It began really, really well (especially the bit in the fast-food lady's house with her psycho knife-wielding grandson) but slowly I became more disappointed as the story went on. Like I said, this is the only Koontz book I've ever read all the way through, but I have read the summaries inside the hardcovers of \\"By the Light of the Moon,\\" \\"Odd Thomas,\\" \\"The Taking,\\" and \\"The Face,\\" and as weird as this sounds, I really think whoever writes those should write a book of their own. That's all I have to say."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"As a Koontz fan for several years, I eagerly await his new books. Although better than One Door Away From Heaven, in which I was very disappointed, By the Light of the Moon still does not have the same sharp horror and intrigue as many of his earlier books. Koontz has a great sense of humor, one that I appreciate. However, he has been over using it at times taking you out of the action of the book as you become too aware that you are reading a book, if that makes sense. Certainly not a bad read, and thankfully not as long as some other recent novels, I give this book 3 1/2, if Amazon would let me. Perhaps Koontz needs a vacation to rework his brilliant mind."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON begins with Dylan O'Connor and his younger, autistic brother, Shepard, driving across Arizona to an arts festival in New Mexico. After they stop at a motel for the night, Dylan leaves his brother in the room for a while and walks across the street to a restaurant to get some food. Dylan then makes his way back to the motel room and is clubbed from behind on the walkway as he attempts to open the door. When he wakes up, Dylan finds himself tied to a chair and about to be injected with an unknown serum by a mysterious, crazy-acting doctor named Lincoln Procter. The serum is Procter's own creation. It will cause Dylan's mind to either deteriorate or to expand to unbelievable magnificence. Once Dylan is injected, the good doctor warns him to take his brother and to run away as quickly as possible because there are hunters now closing in on them at that very moment. Their intent is to kill Lincoln Procter and anyone he has injected with the serum. After the doctor disappears, Dylan frees himself from the chair and hurriedly gets ready for the hostile journey that will change him and his brother forever. As he and Shep are preparing to leave the motel, they encounter Jillian Jackson-a female comedian who's also been injected with the serum-coming out of another room. The three of them have only seconds to readjust to this new situation as black Suburbans swiftly pull into the motel's parking lot, each one filled with deadly killers who are on the lookout for Dr. Procter. The trio barely manages to escape with their lives, but the hardest and most dangerous part is still ahead. Each of them will see miraculous changes within their own bodies and minds over the next twenty-four hours. They will develop the powers to see into the future and to transport themselves long distances in the blink of an eye. It may not be enough, however, to keep them alive as their pursuers close in for the kill. As with the author's previous two books (FROM THE CORNER OF HIS EYE & ONE DOOR AWAY FROM HEAVEN), this novel also uses cutting-edge advances in science and technology and theories on time travel and teleportation as a focus point for the storyline. The average human being uses less than five percent of his brain capacity. If a method could be found to increase one's brain capability to forty or fifty percent, or even more, what wonders could we expect to see? What would mankind be able to accomplish? Mr. Koontz is able to see and understand where modern science and research are headed at this very second and simply takes it to next level, which may be within the realm of possibility ten or twenty years down the road. He doesn't see the future of humanity with a negative gleam in his eye, but rather with a wondrous, child-like anticipation, understanding the goodness that mankind is capable of perpetuating, if given the opportunity. In BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON, the characters of Dylan and Shep O'Connor and Jilly Jackson are skillfully created to portray the \\"everyman\\" that's in most of us. They don't want what's thrust upon them. Yet, once it's realized that they can never return to the normalcy of their previous lives, none of them hesitates to move forward into the great unknown and to use their new powers to help those in need and in trouble, putting themselves at risk time and time again to do what they intrinsically know to be the right thing. This is therefore a passionate novel about what it takes to face unimaginable fear, knowing that you could die at any second, and to become a hero in the grandest sense of the term. If you want to spend several hours reading a book that's not only fun and entertaining, but also purer magic within the scope of possibilities that it sets forth, then BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON is definitely the one to get. This is certainly a book that will delight you in many unexpected and thought-provoking ways because Dean Koontz has his fingers on the pulse of humanity's heart and soul, and there's no one better to pass along the message than him. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"This is the last straw. Koontz has managed to create a work of total rubbish and disappointment that I have come to a decision never to enjoy anything by him again. After feeling a little betrayed by some older works, I read One Door Away From Haven and wondered what had happened to Koontz's style. He seemed to be making an effort to write a way he could not write, trying to impress his readers, trying not to go stale. Well, congratulations. 'By the Light of the Moon' was the worst book yet.I waited a long time before I read this, but because I had nothing else and it was staring at me from the library shelf, I thought, why not?I read three chapters and that was enough for me. Dean Koontz needs to take a break from writing for a while and wait to find something he really wants to tell the world about. He has it in him, I know that, but for some reason does not always use it.This was so bad, that I got the impression Koontz had done it on purpose to see if it would be published. I found myself laughing aloud while reading the book, not because I found it funny, (and does Koontz ever try to make it funny!) but because it was just so terrible. I got the impression Koontz was talking down to his readers.It started off with a man named Dylan, an artist, buying take out food for he and his mental brother. Koontz litters this section with sly remarks and \`witty' jokes. They simply were not funny. Dylan then is knocked out, tied to a chair, and given some foreign liquid (STUFF!) with a needle. Koontz spends 16 pages on this one scene, detailing with some paragraph long sentences every fleeting thought Dylan has. It was so bad, I read one extraordinarily long sentence out loud (13 lined paragraph, all one sentence,) and had to take 4 breaths to finish it. It rambled on, and on, and on...The scene is meant to be a little scary. Dylan is being drugged, he's tied up, for God's sake. Koontz himself fails to recognise this and continues with his uselessly unfunny remarks, referring to the mark the needle left behind on Dylan's arm, \`a booboo.' He seems to make light of the situation as if it does not matter much to the story, as if Dylan is not that afraid and is more concerned about what article of laundry is being used as a his gag.Koontz manages to go into tangents on unrelated subject matter during this scene, completely inappropriate for what is happening. This is a serious situation that is happening to our hero, but Koontz treats it like a joke!I decided I could not read 431 pages of this, and took my bookmark out.Terrible, terrible, terrible!!And by the way, who carries a plant with them across America? I could not have stood that character for another page more. What an annoyance \`Jillian' was.Koontz either has lost his mind, or is pulling our leg. Well, that was the last straw; goodbye Koontz. If I had to find one highlight about this atrocity of a \`novel' it would be that no character had a remarkable canine friend that we are suppose to care about. The story is not fit for publication. I've read post it notes better than this."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Dean Koontz has never been my favorite author; same characters, same plot, same ending. However, lately his stories and characters seemed to be improving and showing a little diversity. What a dissapointment this book was. I was really aggravated when I realized I was halfway through it and nothing more had happened then was told in the descriptive blurb and reviews of the book.The characters of Dylan and Jilly were sterotypes of philosophical male artist and angry female comedian. There was nothing unique about them and the use of similes/metaphors in their thoughts and feelings was overdone like a steak left on a flaming grill until it becomes a blackend lump of nothing that resembles the soul of a depraved lunatic. At least Shep was unique in that he was not a typical autistic. His situation and autism may not have been based in reality, but at least they were interesting.The climax of the story was only a platform for Koontz to preach a little sermon. If I want to hear preaching, I will go to church.I read pretty much for the entertainment of a good story. If I happen to be educated along the way, that is a plus. Unfortunately, this book did not provide either entertainment or an education."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Seems like Dean Koontz has done it again. With By the Light of the Moon Koontz adds another title to a genre he seems to be trying to perfect: That of the seemingly unfinished book. Take From the Corner of His Eye, One Door Away from Heaven and add them to By the Light of the Moon and what do you get? Three novels with insanely long titles that just leave the reader hanging after the last page. After I finished reading Moon I honestly expected there to be an author's note at the end telling me how Koontz wants to spend more time with Dylan, Shep and Jilly. I was extremly disappointed. Never mind the fact that his three protagonists are the most undeveloped characters I've ever read about. Why is it that, even though they are being \\"pursued\\" by the men in the suburbans, most of the time you can forget the antagonists even exist. Also, is it just me or does it seem like Koontz has a contract with Ford and needs to promote their SUV line at every opportunity. I don't know, maybe I'm just frustrated waiting for a new Dark Tower or Christopher Snow novel or maybe I'm not old enough to fully grasp the \\"ambitious exploration of the intricacies of human relationships\\" by the new \\"thought-provoking\\" Dean Koontz"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"The product was just as described, new, and I am very pleased with what I recieved. I would definately order from this individual again if what I was looking for was available."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I hadn't read him before. Probably not his best book but you get a sense of his style. Parts of it seem written off the top of his head almost like a beat poet. The overall plot and characters didn't amount to much. The main ones were realistic but not that exciting. The bad guys were not realistic at all and the way they connected was like a cliche. Still there was enough to make it interesting. I'm sure I'll read another of his books again, and try and pick one with better reviews."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I agree that this is not Koontz's best story but it is a very good one. I love the themes of power, the past, and memories explored in this book. He has some great characters and the book is perfectly set up for a sequel. Please Mr. Koontz write us a sequel to continue the story!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"In Arizona a doctor invades a motel, injects both artist Dylan O'Connor and his autistic brother Shep as well as (shortly later) stand-up comedian Jillian Jackson with an unknown substance. He tells them that it is his life's work and will have some unknown effect. And he warns them to run before his enemies kill them since they are carriers now. Indeed shortly after, the doctor is killed by heavily armed men.From then the chase is on as Dylan, Shep and Jillian drive around the West, only steps ahead of the assassins. Within hours, the effects of the injections materialize but none of them has the same effects...The basic idea for the story is really great because I just needed to know how they would change after the injection. Unfortunately the effects are not well chosen by the author. At least Shep's new skill is quite ridiculous. (Where did Koontz get this stupid idea from? Star Trek - beam me up Scotty?)The main characters in the book are not the best as well. You will probably start to hate some of them even if you are supposed to like them.The whole book covers only a very short time span. Some parts are even in real time. And unfortunately some of them are just too long. A car \\"chase\\" scene reminded me strongly of \\"Dark Rivers of the Heart\\" where he made the same real time mistake and dragged a scene in wild water several pages long (until I couldn't take it any longer and skipped pages).Finally the novel has an abrupt ending and the solutions to the plot/riddles were not really satisfying up to then.In the last couple of years I read a lot of Koontz's books but this does not rank among his best. The story's basic idea is really great but unfortunately the implementation is not.If you are not acquainted with Koontz so far, instead of this book, I strongly recommend reading \\"Intensity\\", \\"Fear Nothing\\", \\"Lightning\\", \\"Dark Rivers of the Heart and \\"Dragon Tears\\" and especially \\"Strangers\\" and \\"Mr Murder\\"!!!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Dylan O'Connor and his autistic brother Shep are on a road trip when they are ambushed by a stranger. Dylan is injected with something that is supposed to change him, something wonderful...if he doesn't die first.Jilly and her plant Fred are also traveling the same route and she discovers that she too is a \\"carrier\\" like Dylan. She joins forces with the brothers, and their race for survival relies on their quick wit in evading those who follow them and Shep's ability to remember the man who injected them.The story has a \\"Rain Man\\" mood, laced with Dean Koontz' expert ability to create suspense and mystery. What is the purpose of the injection? Is it for the good of mankind or is it pure evil? For years, I've read Koontz, back when he was Dean R. Koontz, and for years I wondered whether he was a pseudonym of Stephen King's, like Richard Bachman. Regardless of who Koontz is, he rates as one of the true masters of suspense and horror. Sometimes the scariest things are those based on fact rather than fiction. And Koontz has a way of making us believe anything is possible. A great read!By the Light of the Moon should be read with ALL lights on! I salute you, Mr. Koontz!~ Cheryl Kaye TardifAuthor of Divine Intervention"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Dean Koontz is an expert at blending suspense with humor; some efforts, such as \`Tick Tock', are uneven, but in \`By the Light of the Moon', Koontz gets it right. The plot is tight and the action starts from the first page: Dylan O'Connor is injected by a truly \`mad scientist' with an unknown substance with uncertain effects. Dylan, his autistic brother Shep, and Jillian Jackson, a standup comedian who's also been injected, decide to find out who the scientist was, and what exactly they were injected with. The action takes place within hours, and as the effects of the injections become apparent, they have to outrun some kind of secret organization intent on killing them for what they have become. There is both tension and humor in this book, especially from Jill and her companion, Fred (whose end we never really know). My only quibble with this novel comes toward the end: it seems rushed, as if Koontz simply wants to end the story (and maybe set up a sequel?). However, for the most part, this is a great story, and a good addition to Koontz's other works."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"This novel may suffer more by comparison to the other works by Koontz than it does on it's own merits. Having read most of Koontz's book this one seems routine and formulaic, as though the author were going through the motions and is somewhat impatient about getting the thing over with. While many of Koontz's book use a very similar formula they nevertheless succeed in maintaining the attention of the reader and creating sympathy with well drawn characters. One character in this novel is a female stand up comedian who drives around a plant that she talks to. She is never quite as endearing as the author intends. There are many tense and amusing moments as there always are in a Koontz novel but overall this is not one of his best."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Since there are numerous descriptions of the book's content, I'll forego that. I had gotten away from reading Koontz for a few years, but when my book club picked this one to read and discuss, I found myself wondering why I stopped reading him in the first place.Nanotechnology is the theme of this book and Koontz delivers one good read along the way. The autistic character Shep is portrayed realistically and with sympathy. His brother, Dylan, seems too good to be true sometimes. I liked the bite to Jilly, and her &quot;pet&quot; jade plant. What's missing, though, is the ever-present dog. What happened?It takes a good portion of the book to explain what has happened to the characters, but it's all interesting. I was left with the impression this could be the first in a series, and I'm hoping that's the case."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"**1/2I used to get a huge kick out of Dean Koontz. Still do, rereading some of the old stuff. But why, I wonder, do I keep expecting him to come back into form?He's still a master of pacing, hurling you on through the pages. But it's like the Cheshire cat, fading til only the smile is left: any clear premise, plotting that involves actual cause and effect, and all the other accoutrements of narrative, have been wafting away, til now only that heart-pounding pace remains.Koontz didn't convince me that any of these characters were real: the miraculously sweet autistic brother, the pair of misfits, thrown together because the same mad scientist attacked them both with a mysterious hypodermic needle, who are destined to fall in love because at the start they're always at each other's throats for no reason. Uh-huh.That hypodermic induces wild talents - a familiar Koontz theme by now. But why do the talents have to be meta-wild? The mad scientist's brew has &quot;a different effect on each subject, not always lethal.&quot; What ever happened to the speculative fiction principle of introducing one otherworldly variable, and playing out its consequences? When everything's otherworldly, the plot loses its logic and gets flabby.And then there's the usual chase by nightmare agents of some shadowy power, from which the government can't protect you. But this time, neither the agents' motives, nor their powers, nor the limits to their powers, ever become clear. It's just one long series of chase scenes with no particular rhyme or reason. And a new character, a paterfamilias ex machina, appears out of nowhere to resolve all our heroes' difficulties at the end.Oh, I won't deny it qualifies as readable. But somewhere in the book of counted sorrows, Koontz's declining attention to his craft is adding to the count."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"This book is definately an enjoyable read, but you must be a patient reader who doesn't expect suspense or action in every short chapter. Overall, the plot is well laid out except for the end. However, like many of the new Koontz books, most of the book is dedcated to introducing character's personalities and establishing two of the character's interest in each other. The last 50 pages are where the (short) action and (rushed) conclusion lies.The characters are relatively static in this book. However introspective Dean projects them to be, they follow a very predicable path of thoughts.It is easy to see how the plot, characters, and the character's thoughts were heavily influenced by the events of 9/11. This isn't a bad thing, but adds to the static quality of the characters and a trite ending. The ending has more of a Marvel Comics feel than any other Koontz book.You will be disappointed in this book if you regularly enjoy Koontz's books, and especially if you prefer older Koontz to his newer stories. You might grow tired of his endless metaphors that seem to be inserted just because he is very good and making them. However, it is worth the read, and shouldn't be passed up entirely, but there's no rush :)"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Koontz has amazing skills. If you doubt it, read the first three pages and then try to put the book down. (Heck, read just the FIRST page!) Koontz has the ability to drop the reader directly into a situation that's impossible to turn away from. In this tale, a young man named Dylan is traveling with his autistic younger brother Shep. Dylan is abducted by a strange man who injects Dylan with a strange drug. The man tells Dylan that the drug is his life's work and that Dylan will be changed; in what way, even the man doesn't know. Then the man disappears...Dylan and Shep meet a woman named Jillian, who has also been injected with the drug. Together, they seek to outrun the armed men looking for the doctor and his latest creation. But along the way, Dylan and Jillian discover that they now have strange powers...VERY strange powers. And Shep...he's acting even more unusual than he normally does...And what does all this have to do with images of doves, a church, and ice? You'll have to read the book to find out.Koontz also has the ability to write likable characters that we feel like we've known all our lives. The theme of the good guy (or girl) overcoming evil is certainly not new, but it takes on a whole new meaning after 9-11. Koontz doesn't exploit that connection, but helps us understand through his characters how ordinary people can make a difference. It's very refreshing, and in a way patriotic.But Koontz also has a good time with his story. The first meeting and the initial exchanges between Dylan and Jillian are funny, natural, and right on target. Unlike some other critics, I enjoyed the touches of humor. Koontz mixes humor and danger like oil and water, but somehow manages a mixture that works.The weakness of the book? Others have cited it: the ending. I'll say only this: when you get there, you'll understand why it ends the way it does. Is it satisfying? In a way. Could it have been better? Probably. But Koontz is the author, not me. He knows what he's doing. So sit down, strap yourself in for an exciting, strange ride. Enjoy.431 pages"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"It seems Koontz has been on a mission since &quot;Dark Rivers of the Heart&quot; to skewer all forms of elite self-righteousness and woe-is-me victimhood mentalities. &quot;By the Light of the Moon&quot; continues this trend and I am very thankful.Based on conversations with several people who had been long-time Koontz fans, it seems that a dividing line formed has formed since &quot;Fear Nothing.&quot; Either you love his latest stuff or you hate it. If you are in the former camp, you will enjoy this one.The story is fast-paced with lots of action and plenty of humor. Koontz continues to have strong female characters. What I find interesting is that they never seem to be strong at the expense of the male character. In Koontz's world-view, it is possible for women and men to be strong side-by-side without a need to dominate the other.My biggest disappointment with this novel, as with his previous three, is that is does not feature Christopher Snow. I keep waiting for a part three of the Moonlight Bay story."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"This is a magical book following in the tradition of his last offering, One Door Away From Heaven. It lifts and moves and allows us to believe in wonder. Koontz uses words they way we all thought that faries and and wizards use magic in ways that that take our breath and inspire wonder and most always work for the good and the just, making life just ever so much better for having been said."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"(3 &amp; 1/2 stars) I definitely enjoyed this new Koontzbook, but not quite as much as his last one, One Door Away From Heaven. The plot unfolds in a manner very familiar to the author's regular readership. Three people are thrown together by mysterious circumstances, and then they're on the run, fleeing from a faceless and vaguely menacing enemy. As in nearly all of Koontz's novels, there is an unknown phenomenon at work, something that is not really explained until the book is at least two-thirds complete. When it is finally explained, I was dismayed to find out that the secret involves the same theme as Michael Crichton's latest book, Prey. Having just read that one a couple of weeks ago, it was frustrating to see that the two writers based their stories on the same idea.Despite the bestseller redundancy, though, By The Light does have several positive aspects that kept me reading it. The &quot;powers&quot; developed by the three characters are intriguing to think about (although Jilly's power is poorly established in the first half of the book). The relationships between the characters are generally gratifying to experience as they are happening. There is genuine suspense and excitement along the way. All in all, this is not one of Mr. Koontz's best novels, but still decent enough.One final thing that I pondered while reading this book.... Dean Koontz creates these (usually) likeable characters in his books, but then we never see them again once the particular book is finished (with a couple of exceptions). It would nice if he would bring some of the best ones back again in future stories."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I bought this Koontz book on audio (to listen to as I drove back and forth to work) It is truly one of his best novels to date. when I left the car I could not wait to get back into it to listen.

I was amazed by the intricasy of the plot, and the depth of the story design. This novel is just begging for a sequel, and I hope Koontz delivers"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Dean Koontz has a way with words, doesn't he? He is so deft that I laughed out loud several times in this book at the way he describes the most mundane of everyday things. A fast food restaurant, the clashing colors of hotel room decor, the blazing heat of a desert afternoon, all become perfectly realized in just a few dancing words.Jillian Jackson is an unlikable, prickly woman who takes everything the wrong way. Instead of a pliant, lovely heroine who falls into the hero's arms, she argues with Dylan O'Conner and accuses him of being a potential serial killer. She insults him, tries to get Dylan to abandon his autistic brother, and implies that O'Conner is mentally unstable for not placing Shep in an institution.Of course there is a tender and wonderous creature under all these scales and thorns, but it takes a while for Dylan, Shep, and the circumstances of the novel to bring her out.Shepherd, an autistic, is another character destined to defy the hellish Peter Singer and his followers of eugenics. Disabled, imperfect, and spectacular, Shepherd reminds us all to treasure every human being no matter what.The plot is relentless, the characters live in your heart, the deeper themes are beautifully evoked, Dean Koontz is simply the master. Don't miss this one."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Dean Koontz has a recipe, and has once again applied it for our reading pleasure. Take two strangers, both loners who realize that their lives are far from complete, but who are coping pretty well. One or both of them have some sort of dependent who relies on them completely. Apply some sort of strange person or being who threatens them. Mix them together under conditions that require they flee together from unknown or not understood terrors. Stir in encounters with people who need help, which the couple individually or together can and do provide. In the end, serve up with justice for the bad guys and at least the potential for happy every after for the couple. Using this tried and true recipe, Koontz has cooked up another savory dish for us in By the Light of the Moon.Dylan O&#65533;Connor is an artist, who travels around and sells his landscapes at art shows. He cares for Shep, his autistic brother, who travels with him. They are orphans, whose father was a suicide while they were adolescents and whose mother was murdered by a burglar five years later. Jillian Jackson is a standup comic waiting for her big break while traveling the western club circuit in her vintage Coup de Ville and her sole companion, a potted plant named Fred. They happen to be staying overnight in the same Arizona motel when a stranger knocks Dylan on the head and injects him with some strange serum. He tells Dylan that people are chasing him and will kill him when he is caught. Since he doesn&#65533;t want his life&#65533;s work to be lost, he has injected Dylan with the results of his research, and warns Dylan that the people chasing him will also kill Dylan if they figure out he has received the serum. He also tells Dylan that the psychotropic &#65533;stuff&#65533; he has given him does something different to everyone, with an effect that is &#65533;...interesting, frequently astonishing, and sometimes positive.&#65533; With that he leaves Dylan, bumps into Jillian and injects her on the spur of the moment, and then takes off in Jillian&#65533;s car. As she pursues, Dylan is preparing to run, and then bad guys arrive and Jillian&#65533;s caddy explodes. Fleeing together, they begin to experience the effects of the &#65533;stuff&#65533; (and come to find out Shep was injected as well) and begin their strange journey. And it is an exciting one."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Another great story told with the usual Koontz flair. It grabs you from the start and compels you along without a pause. It will be hard to put down. I do miss the usual trusty, faithful pet dog in this one. I guess one of the characters might fill that void emotionally."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"See book description above.Dean Koontz's last few novels have been somewhat average. This time around he has come out of his rut (not a big rut, of course) and served up some fantastic reading. The subject is the ever popular nanotechnology, though with Koontz you get the nanotech with a big dose of the supernatural. Koontz writes this novel with a certain flare. The prose, as well as the dialogue, is top-notch. Jilly (&quot;I should warn you I know Karaoke&quot;), Dylan, and his autistic brother Shep, make for an original and very likeable group of protagonists.Dean Koontz has written one of his best novels and I highly recommend this to all his fans and to those looking for a fast paced thriller."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Read the first page and you'll keep on reading. By the Light of the Moon is typical Dean Koontz, a page turner that will keep your finger wet. Like other Koontz stories, this one is full of drama, suspense, and a thrill a second. It incorporates an extensive chase that lasts most of the book which is similar to One Door Away From Heaven. And like One Door Away From Heaven, By the Light of the Moon is full of inspiration, believable characters and wonderful locations.The novel begins with young artist Dylan O'Conner, his autistic brother Shep both being attacked by a demented scientist at a motel and injected with a mysterious substance. Also attacked and injected is Jillian Jackson, an attractive young comedian. They are warned to take off immediately because, the doctor informs them, he is being hunted down by people who want him and his discovery killed. And the chase is on.If the book has a problem it is the ending. But, as others have pointed out, this may set up a sequel to this story. That would make most Koontz readers very happy. You'll want a full pot of coffee and lots of munchies for this book."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Let's face it...there's a lot to love about Dean Koontz's writing. Some people become his ardent fans because of his unbelievable imagination. He can take the reader on a journey so filled with vivid detail that it feels like being transported right into the book's setting. Where does he get the ideas?Although the plot and imagery would be reason enough to read his novels, the thing I enjoy most is the characterization in his better books--and this is one of them! These characters live and breathe, and make you like them (or hate them). In By the Light of the Moon, the relationship of two brothers is portrayed so beautifully that I wish I could know them. The younger, autistic brother Shep is unforgettable. How I hope there will be a sequel to this wonderful story. I heartily recommend it!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Dylan O'Connor and his autistic brother, Shepherd, check into a hotel on their way to one of Dylan's art shows. A seemingly mad doctor randomly picks him --- or so it appears to be --- injects him with some \\"stuff\\" and warns him about a group of diabolical folks who will hunt him down to destroy the doctor's \\"life's work\\". The \\"stuff\\" has some fascinating effects, which are \\"without exception interesting, frequently astonishing and sometimes positive.\\"Another hotel guest, Jillian Jackson, a standup comedian with a bit of a chip on her shoulder, falls victim to the same insane doctor and the trio hooks up out of necessity. Shortly thereafter, the evil doctor dies in a ball of flame by the hand of the very hunters he warned them about. A wild series of chase scenes spans the following 24 hours, with some skin of your teeth escapes, fingernail chewing scenes and a few pages best read with one eye closed.It is a classic good versus evil story, with flashbacks to a time when Dylan and Shepherd were younger, a time when Shepherd's autism was cemented. Dylan makes some astonishing discoveries about his brother and his feelings for him. While the brothers are enmeshed in their revelations, Jillian has her own demons to deal with. Despite the immediate problem of staying ahead of their pursuers, the three aid each other in tackling the weighty issues of their pasts, plus look to their somewhat questionable futures. The psychotropic drug alters their lives forever and they become a weird variation of American superheroes.It had been a while since I read a Koontz book. If I had any criticism about this one, it would be that he seemed to take more care with his earlier writing. That, or my reading palate has matured. I'm certainly not saying BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON isn't worthy of your time. The story is highly intriguing and moves along at a good clip. And, as usual, the author rounds out his characters with rich personal details. He endows them with believable flaws that make them more charming. Nevertheless, I tend to agree with a fellow who commented on one of Koontz's recent novels when he said that the author must be getting paid by the word. He felt that it was a pretty good 250 to 300-page thriller but, unfortunately, it had taken him 600 pages to write it. BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON clocks in at a few pages over 400 and I reiterate that he pens an engrossing tale. He just might have done it quicker. However, since the sole purpose of the book is to entertain, why grouse about a few extra pages?As I said, BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON is a worthy read, despite its stretched length. Koontz fans will gobble this one up. Old-time fans, like me, though, may prefer the days when he was struggling to entertain his reader, not to please his publisher.--- Reviewed by Kate Ayers"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"In Arizona a doctor invades a motel, injects both artist Dylan O'Connor and his autistic brother Shep as well as (shortly later) stand-up comedian Jillian Jackson with an unknown substance. He tells them that it is his life's work and will have some unknown effect. And he warns them to run before his enemies kill them since they are carriers now. Indeed shortly after, the doctor is killed by heavily armed men.From then the chase is on as Dylan, Shep and Jillian drive around the West, only steps ahead of the assassins. Within hours, the effects of the injections materialize but none of them has the same effects...The basic idea for the story is really great because I just needed to know how they would change after the injection. Unfortunately the effects are not well chosen by the author. At least Shep's new skill is quite ridiculous. (Where did Koontz get this stupid idea from? Star Trek - beam me up Scotty?)The main characters in the book are not the best as well. You will probably start to hate some of them even if you are supposed to like them.The whole book covers only a very short time span. Some parts are even in real time. And unfortunately some of them are just too long. A car \\"chase\\" scene reminded me strongly of \\"Dark Rivers of the Heart\\" where he made the same real time mistake and dragged a scene in wild water several pages long (until I couldn't take it any longer and skipped pages).Finally the novel has an abrupt ending and the solutions to the plot/riddles were not really satisfying up to then.In the last couple of years I read a lot of Koontz's books but this does not rank among his best. The story's basic idea is really great but unfortunately the implementation is not.if you are not acquainted with Koontz so far, instead of this book, I strongly recommend reading Intensity, Fear Nothing, Lightning, Dark Rivers of the Heart and Dragon Tears and especially Strangers and Mr Murder."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"In some respects, the book reminded me of another of his novels which I read recently, called The Bad Place...although if I said more than having a significant character with autism, I'd probably be ruining a few plot developments *grins*.I'm not going to summarize the plot, as that's been well done already above.I've read a number of Koontz novels, and it's interesting how he's refined and honed his skills over the years - from attention to detail and vivid descriptions that lets the reader really visualize the world that the characters inhabit. What really sets him apart is making the reader not just identify with the characters, but really helping you get inside their heads and understand them. This doesn't mean just a cardboard-cutout description...it goes right down to giving them quirky traits, such as relationships with plants.If nothing else, Koontz excels at unravelling a mystery with ever-increasing speed, drawing the reader in with a greater sense of urgency, all the while dropping subtle clues throughout for the reader to work out the solutions.There was a suggestion that Koontz was leading to a sequel, but as endearing as the characters are, that's not really his style. I'm fairly certain, that as much as I'd like to see the characters come back, I feel that he'll trust us to revisit them by re-reading the book, while crafting other novels and bringing other characters to life.I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I thought that the book was on the boring side which is unusual for Koontz but I really thought that Koontz knows nothing about autism. He made the autistic character act like he knew nothing and had characters say stupid things about the autistic character. People that have autistic children do not even compare the autistic character to their children. I dont even understand why Koontz even made this character autistic.Dorothy Ham"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I am normally a fan of Dean Koontz, but not since his annoying character Christopher Snow, has Koontz come up with a more tiring cast of characters. Literally pages of text are devoted to monosyllabic exchanges between the hero and his autistic brother. Cute the first time, tiring thereafter. The plot of the entire novel is acceptable, but it never builds any depth and actually ends with the heroes discussing themselves as super-heros, capes, tights and all. This is so far from his best work that I almost believe it was written by a ghost writer with his name attached to attract sales. This is one where I would have to say to not just wait for the paperback, but wait for the paperback in the used bookstore."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I am an avid Koontz reader and really enjoy about half the books I read of his (the ones that are too creepy for me go to the library).I enjoyed this book very much, and it will be in my personal library to be read again and again."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I was fooled into purchasing this paperback in an airport, since I needed something with a strong plot to read on the plane and this book has a compelling beginning. However, after about 30 pages or so, once the Jillian character and her plant, Fred, are introduced, I began to suspect I'd made an error. By that time I was trapped on a cross-country flight with nothing else to read. Thus, I finished this novel, but certainly would not have if there had been something else to occupy me on the red-eye.The characters are really lame, especially Jillian, but also the \\"mad scientist\\" fellow and Parish Lantern, whose name is supposedly symbolic, but in the end seems just dumb. And the plot is certainly not up to what I expected from Dean Koontz.I have read only one other of Koontz's books, but as I recall that one was much more engaging than By the Light of the Moon. Perhaps this is merely an abberation, but I will definitely be cautious about buying another Koontz novel, and never without some back-up entertainment. What a bore!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"This book started out really well, and I liked most of the characters. But the last 100 pages of this book are just absurd. granted, it is a science fiction suspense thriller, so a little bit of imagination is needed to make it work. But even the genre has expectations of somesort of realism, and this book falls short.I will however, applaud Koontz for doing a great job with Shep, the autistic character. I thought that he showed what families with autistic children go through in their care of an autistic family member.I do agree that by the end, Jilly gets real annoying. You could tell from her one-liners why she still worked second rate comedy club jobs.Not one of Koontz's best by any means. That honor still goes to Fear Nothing."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Before I start, I want to say that DK has done SO much better, i.e. Watchers, Intensity, Coldfire and Odd Thomas. There.That said, this book had two of the most annoying characters I've ever come accross. Jilly was such a B#%$! I absolutely could not stand her! Ugh! The \\"Rain Man\\" brother even though he should have had my sympathy, had me wanting to chuck the book across the room.These people acted like everything that happened to them was just...well normal! No reactions whatsoever. Just endless corny bantering. Hello people. Get real. That's my two words for DK as far as these out-of-reach characters that he's been dreaming up as of late: Get Real. People like to read about Real People."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"\\"By the Light of the Moon\\" was great with the exception of Shep. He was excruciating. What's up with Dean Koontz and autistic characters? They're self-centered, self-absorbed, and expect everyone around them to wait on them hand and foot. They contribute nothing to society or even their own households for that matter. The family member or members who are sentenced to care for him are basically his indentured servants for life.Not only must you prepare and serve them all their meals, you must meet with their rigorous demands regarding the preparation and presentation of the meal (only certain colors or shapes, etc.) God help you if you forget to cut off his bread crusts or fail to sculp his mashed potatoes into the proper shape. He will refuse to eat, he will go hungry, then you must feel all manner of guilt until you rush to remedy the food faux paus to meet with autistic boy's rigid standards, bowing and scraping with apologies because your round food upset autistic boy.He never has to work or lift a finger to help in any way. He is free to indulge in his favorite pleasures and pastimes day in and day out, while his family members/servants tend to his every need. Poor autistic boy. Sometimes he experiences anxiety (despite the fact he shouldn't have a care in the world.) Heaven and earth must then be moved until autistic boy is back in his comfort zone.Should autistic boy decide he wants something specific (oh, cake for example) there will be no rest for anyone around him until his demands are met and he is not only presented with cake, but presented with cake cut into a shape he has deemed acceptable. It doesn't matter if your appendix just burst or the house is on fire, autistic boy wants cake. And cake he shall damn-well have. 911 will just have to wait.Your being shot at? Too bad. You're not going anywhere until autistic boy decides it's okay. It doesn't matter to him if you get shot, he's got something on his mind.I keep wanting him to be killed off, but know for a fact it could never happen. You can't kill off autistic boy. He will continue to have his every whim catered to for the rest of his long, leisurly, and pampered life.Yes, I know it's not his fault, but that doesn't make anything I just said less true or make the character any less annoying."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"There are few major authors as dependable as Dean Koontz. While rarely writing anything that could be considered \\"great,\\" he is at least consistent with turning out good work. Unfortunately, at times, this consistency is also harmful; there is sometimes the sense that Koontz is always putting out the same book with just the names and plot device changing.As is typical with a Koontz book, this story deals with a nice guy and a nice woman who are suddenly placed in a horrific situation and must pair up. In this case, each is forcibly injected with an unknown substance by a mad scientist. Complicating the situation are the shadowy (government?) forces chasing them and the guy's autistic brother who is brilliant in some ways but limits their mobility (many Koontz books have some sort of \\"special\\" person or in isolated cases, animals).This particular book deals with the dangers of nanotechnology; in this way, it is similar to Michael Crichton's Prey (which I read right after this book). For Crichton, however, the ideas behind nanotechnology are the driving force in his book and are explained in great detail; here it is merely a plot gimmick to move the story along and is \\"explained\\" in a page or so.Once again, this is a good, not great book, maybe three-and-a-half stars if such a rating was available. New Koontz readers will not be overly disappointed, and for Koontz veterans, this one once again shows that he is nothing if not reliable."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I was really suprised by this book. I am a Koontz fan, but this was a complete let down. The dialogue between the characters was boring.

I enjoy interesting and intelligent writing but this was over the top, talk about rambling on, on every nuance these boring characters experience. Then the over descriptive science facts, If I wanted a lesson in science I would have turned on the Discovery channel. What could have been easily 3 chapters took 8...blah, blah, blah.

I had never read anything from him but I was willing to give it a try since I had read an excerpt from 'Odd Thomas' and it seemed kind of good. I picked up 'By the Light of the Moon' and 'Tic Toc'. The former starts of pretty good and quite intriguing, but as the story unfolds it turns to crap. I'm not going to say what the book's about 'cause quite frankly, it's not memorable and so, I don't remember much.As for 'Tic Toc', it's far, far worse. Here's the premise: An alien hides in a doll and tries to hunt its master and manages to kill a whole bunch of people in the process, except of course, the master. It's a comedy. I admire the fact that he played with fire trying to mix horror and comedy but I'm sorry, Koontz got toast 'cause it's just not good.

It wasn't until recently that I started reading this novel. Big mistake on my part. The novel began well enough, but then began a downward spiral. It had one of the oddest plots I've ever seen, and that alone normally wouldn't put me off a book. But in addition to the bizarre story line, it seemed as if Koontz had wrote the book, and then went back and looked up every word he had written in the thesaurus and replaced it with a synonym. Simple sentences were unneccesarily drawn out, and some of his figurative language (especially that which involved Middle Eastern conflict) was flat and boring. Truly one of the worst reads I've ever had the displeasure of enduring."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I love Dean Koontz, but this book was just beyond ridiculous. Three people are injected with \\"nanobots\\" and are suddenly clairvoyant and able to warp themselves from one place to another with the flick of a wrist? Since when does nanotechnology have ANYTHING to do with ESP/Clairvoyance? The three characters were shallow and unlikeable, the autistic brother got on my nerves since nothing he ever said made sense. Usually, with off-the-wall characters like this, Koontz has their seemingly enigmatic prattle eventually reveal or explain something. Not so with \\"Shep\\". The book never explains why anyone cares about killing the three main characters or why anyone is following them. The ultimate ridiculous conclusion of them holing up with the \\"Twilight Zone\\" radio host is simply... dumb!

Ive only tried one other Koontz book (\\"the face\\" i think its called) and although that was better, it was still filled to the brim with endless, focusless conversations that are extremely unrealistic.

The characters were boring: I hated Dylan, Jill and Shep equally at the end, and the bad guy was just annoying. The science sucked: nanotech is nowhere near as advanced as he wants it to be, and he has the worst grasp of advanced physics I have ever seen in print. And the writing was awful: the dialogue was unfunny and unrealistic (significant because Jill is supposed to be a COMEDIAN) and the continual repetition drove me very close to committing hara kiri. The only way this book could have been worse is if a magical golden retriever descended from heaven to shoot lasers out of its butt and defeat Proctor. At this point in his career, I seriously think anyone else with a grasp of the english language could do better.To my credit, I have a 20 yr old high functioning autistic brother, and my significant other is a researcher in the field of nanotech/ nanochem at a top US university.

Koontz argues, like Shakespeare, that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in the common man's philosophy. And he touches on enough mathematical and quantum mechanics aspects so that you are thinking physics not Harry Potter. God's world is indeed complex and wonderful and I am so glad when an author &quot;folds&quot; me out of the everyday.Those who did not like this book apparently gave up on it too soon, as one is tempted to do during the talks between Jilly and her potted plant, Fred (who mercifully disappeared early in the book). But hanging in is well worth it. I rank this with &quot;From the Corner of His Eye&quot; as one of recent Koontz's best. Here too, there is a lot of love and compassion countering the action and violence.Also, it takes a writer of Koontz caliber to gracefully use autism as a (believe it or not) fascinating, and even amusing, story vehicle (Nanobots meet Autistic Brother).Now.

At night. In a motel. Something whacks Dylan O'Connor over the head and when he comes to he's duct taped to a chair, being injected by a crazy doctor/scientist who informs him that the fluid in this syringe is his life's work and has a different effect on every individual, and sometimes the effect is even positive. The doctor warns Dylan to flee before he is hunted down and killed. Then the doctor himself flees. But not fast enough. By the time Dylan has worked his way free, gotten together his things and his high functioning autistic brother, Shepherd, made his way outside the motel and encountered Jilly Jackson, who has also been injected; by the time all this has happened, the enemies have already arrived in black SUVs and blow the doctor to bits in Julie's car. Dylan, Jilly, and Shepherd run for their lives. It doesn't take long for the effects of the unknown substance to manifest themselves, and the three are soon caught up in a wild web of seeing visions, preventing crimes, and folding from here to there.I didn't have high hopes for BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON so I can't say I was disappointed. I found the writing style immature, the conversations truly laughable, and the characters more like two dimensional cutouts than real people. The beginning was slow, with Koontz taking whole chapters to say what he could have expressed in a couple of paragraphs. I have never much appreciated his brand of horror, in which he tries to make far out situations scary by continually mentioning blood, crosses, snakes, guillotines, darkness, eyeballs, death, doves, fire, etc., rather than creating ordinary situations gone wrong that I can identify with and therefore find truly terrifying. And I am tired of his personification of animals, although this time I have to give him credit -- in BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON it's not a dog but a jade plant named Fred. Why Fred gets almost a whole chapter to himself at the beginning of the book, I'll never know, since he disappears somewhere in the narrative never to be seen again.The pace does pick up near the middle of the book, with the suspense increasing once teleportation comes into play. Shepherd is also very well portrayed within the confines of his autism; of all the characters, he behaves the most realistically. And while the nanotechnology was a bit lost on me and therefore I can't form an opinion of its plausibility one way or the other, it did serve as an interesting explanation for the effects of the \\"stuff,\\" as the mad doctor called it. About the ending? Let's put it this way: It didn't seem much worse than the rest of the book.If you're looking for a serious scientific novel about nanotechnology, I don't think this is it, but BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON certainly contains plenty of hallmark Koontz and will probably satisfy fans."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"In my humble opinion, it is the worst, or should I write least favorite book I've ever read. Shep this, and Shep that. The novel was extremely irritating to the point I just wanted to pull out the pages and sling it across the room. This is my second Koontz book I've read. The first was &quot;From the Corner of His Eye&quot;, which was wonderful. It is on my list of top novels. This book, by my opinion, is garbage. Find out for yourself if you like it or not. I would strongly recommend getting and reading &quot;From the Corner of His Eye&quot; though."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"This could be a good book but it desperately needs a better editor."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Koontz is one of my favorite authors, but this is a disappointment. I thought it would never end."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"This book sounded more like a comic book than a novel. And Dean Koontz is getting to caught up in the September 11, terroist .... I mean the climax of the novel in the church was very corny. I won't spoil it for people still reading the novel. (comic book) Watch out, it's a bird, no it's a plane, no, it's the midnight club, with shepherd(the autistic teleporter). No offense, but this book was just horrible and the ending really made me want to toss it out a window."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Dean Koontz has done it again. By the Light of the Moon is thrilling, and there's no doubt about it. Jillian Jackson, as well as Dylan O' Conner and his autistic brother Shepherd O' Conner all have something in common. These strangers have all been assaulted by a demented scientist and injected with a strange substance. Soon after, the three of them are forced to flee their motel, as mysterious men in black SUV's give chase. Adding to the intensity of their situation is the actual effect of the substance injected into them. They develop strange abilities. Jillian receives ominous premonitions, Dylan can feel the problems of others by touching anything they come in contact with, and Shepherd can fold space to teleport. These powers lead them to find the mystery of the scientist who kidnapped them, as well as his connection to their own pasts. This book manages to give a lot of information for a story that recalls only a few days. It portrays autism with an almost comical accuracy, and with the exception of the ending, which some may dislike, manages to stay raw and suspenseful throughout.Mr. Koontz did his homework. His portrayals of autism are realistic. Shepherd is Dylan's autistic brother. He has very strange autistic tendencies. He frequently repeats the same word or term multiple times, and cannot be coaxed out of his trance with any sort of ease. He showers for nine minutes. Exactly nine minutes. In fact, he only eats food that is cut into squares. Shep refers to all other food as being too \\"shapey.\\" The biggest issue with Shep is that he acts as if he is in his own little world. Sometimes he stands in a corner for hours, refusing to move. Even his own brother took a while before realizing that Shep was more than a burden.This book has about four hundred and sixty pages, excluding extraneous pages at the end. Keeping that in mind, take into account that the story takes place over a time span of three days. This means that Koontz expressed more than the story at hand. However, though the time is short, much happens in a short period of time. Most of my summary took place over the first half of the novel. This is neither a compliment, nor is it a criticism. Some may like the action-packed sequences that are described in a hundred pages but only happen for five minutes. Others may feel overwhelmed.The three main characters endure a lot. They leave a motel and escape certain death, save a woman from her knife-wielding son, confront the mystery of the death of Dylan's parents, and save a wedding from the evil of three armed assailants. This is great. Suspense? Sure. Action? Of course. My only gripe is the ending. Take NBC's Heroes and mix it in a blender with an episode of Power Rangers and you will get the ending. It's a bit too campy for my taste. The three end up settling in one area and prepare to establish new identities as......heroes. As I said before, these are my opinions. However, you have also been warned.Overall, this is an action filled page-turner with a lot of suspense in every page. This is a book that really makes you just stand (or sit) in awe of Koontz's master storytelling skills.J. Bowman"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Lately, the past few books from our prolific writer have been, well, boring. Lots or words that really don't take you anywhere interesting. This on the other hand, offers a glimpse into what his books used to be about: fast-paced, a few tricky turns you didn't see coming, and much better pacing.With that said, his portrayel of an autistic character was actually not as interesting as I thought it could be. In fact, the whole Shep character was a bit of an interruption of a good book.I also felt his use of &quot;nanotechnology&quot; was abysmally lacking in description, and having just read Prey, was a bit disappointed that Koontz didn't go into more detail like he usually does. Who knows, maybe it would of bogged the book down further.It's a &quot;good&quot; book, average, nothing spectacular, and bordering on his newfound fascination of all things good and heaven-sent. I'm just thankful he didn't start his obsession in this book with God, the afterlife, and &quot;how to be happy&quot; in five easy steps. Read it for what it is; but don't expect classic Koontz. For that, you'll have to go back many years for some good, white-knuckle yarns that only he could deliver."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I was happy it was a library book and I didn't waste money on it. Went nowhere fast. I just couldn't get into it - too much superfluous discription that was really boring. After reading 95 pages, I just gave up. Don't get me wrong, I love Dean Koontz, and can't wait for the next book, but I was very disappointed with this one. Maybe he was trying something new, but it didn't work for me - wish he would write another Christopher Snow book. They were the best, but then, so was the Watchers and Lightning!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"On the whole, I found this book a terrific read--likable protagonists, a thrill a minute. But I wasn't impressed with the ending. It seemed to hint at sequels involving a comic-book type of superhero vigilantism.Another element I found disturbing was a fashionable new ideology: Any and all users of terror tactics are lumped together as \\"evil\\" and \\"fanatical,\\" regardless of the nature of the underlying cause. Terrorism is appalling, but not all causes are morally equivalent.A sign of this \\"the cause is irrelevant\\" attitude: One sequence in Koontz's novel has men decribed only as \\"hate-filled bigots\\" (or something like that) attacking an event that's a very implausible target . What do these attackers stand for? We're never told. If they're hostile to a specific race or religion, other events would have been attended by more of the targeted people. If they're hostile to specific individuals, we aren't given a clue. They're simply \\"evil,\\" gunning for victims because that's what \\"hate-filled bigots\\" do."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I've just finished reading By The Light of the Moon, and I am convinced it is his best book since The Bad Place. It has all the elements Koontz is known for using; the protagonist thrown into an unknown situation and forced to flee for his life; the sinister pursuers from an unknown source with intent to kill; and the extra little science-fictiony twist that subtly shifts the action from the realm of a simple thriller to the realm of the fantastic. This is Koontz at his best!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"After his last book where, if memory serves, dogs ended up being spiritual beings, I had some hesitancy about buying this book expecting maybe more of the same. I'm glad I bought it. It was short and to the point and kept me turning the pages to the very end. I found that the actual cause for the protaganists flight was less important than the continous action and excitement generated by their flight from the &quot;bad guys&quot; and the final outcome. Of course it's obvious that a sequel is in the offing. I'd buy it.Chuck Bollinger"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I really think the past few books that Dean Koontz has written have been his best, this one is really good as well. There is no dog in this book but we get all of what we love about Dean Koontz and what makes him one of the best there is today. I have read 38 of his books and not one has been dull, he is really great!!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"... but I liked it. What seemed so extraordinarily unrealistic at first is some of the super powers the main characters have. I highly doubt that an enhanced mind could give you 'Star Trek' like powers (you know what I am talking about if you have read the book).THIS PARAGRAPH CONTAINS A SLIGHT SPOILEROne thing I really like is when Dean Koontz finally explained how it was that the 'stuff' gave Dylan, Shephard, and Jilly their super powers. It was almost like he knew that Michael Crichton was writing the book 'Prey', and wanted to correspond his book within a month of Crichton's."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"My all time favorite Koontz was Dark Rivers of the Heart, but he has surpassed that with this new novel. I absolutely could not put it down. Very different from Crichton's Prey which also deals with nanotechnology. A must read for Koontz fans, and if you've never read him, what a place to start!!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Dean Koontz's new novel goes to the heart of what it means to be good in a time beset by malice. The story of two brothers, Dylan and Shepherd O'Conner, and Jillian Jackson, the traveling companion whom evil chance - or divine design - bestows upon them, BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON unfolds over twenty-four hours as these intrepid souls race to puzzle out a vicious violation committed against them. Dylan, an itinerant artist, has devoted his life to caring for Shep, an autistic whose challenges may lead them to disaster as they traverse perilous paths only steps ahead of deadly pursuers. Jilly now sees nightmares before them, and her visions prove prescient as they move together through darkness and light toward a destiny beyond the realm of imagination.This is a really great novel, and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in a good read. Also good is steven king's dreamcatcher and Paul Omeziri's Descent into Illusions."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I had heard great things about this book, and Koontz' storytelling skills, and was very much looking forward to learning a thing or two from a high quality best seller. The opening paragraph is sensational, and gives great promise for a pleasurable read. But when you get to the second paragraph, and the third, and the fourth and the hundredth and thousandth (if you make it that far), you will only be baffled: how could such a sloppily written book have garnered such praise?Almost every single sentence of this book breaks the first several rules of good writing, in the ways they describe action and setting and in the profligate use of gerunds. &quot;While looking out the window, blah... Scared in a way he thought was wring, blah... If he had been ten years older, blah... From Safford to Globe, blah... Travelling to the city, blah... As the lights receded, blah...&quot; This is the entire book: over and over and over, the same patterns, embellished here and there with clusters of putrid prose.The point of view slips from a) Impervious Ignorant Dude to b) Clinical Misogynist (the omniscient narrator) to c) Misogynist's Catholic Teenage Daughter on Acid. None of the latter are as convincing as the first. All of them need an editor to strip their thoughts and speech of introductory clauses. It doesn't help that the characters each have expository monologues in the middle of the book: sure, you may have heaved the thing out of a top floor window in frustration, then picked it up again months later, but it really should not be up to the principle characters to tell you, on page 209, what the antagonist set as the theme on page 3. Thank heaven for Fred, the jade tree, who never tells what could otherwise be (and probably already has been) seen. He should have a book all his own.If you've never been a teenaged Catholic girl on acid, and that sounds like fun to you, go ahead and spend $1.99 on a remaindered copy. If you're looking for a great, visceral mystery/suspence/best seller, try elsewhere."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I didn't mind the first chapter where the guy gets konked over the head, but when Dean Koontz threw in the comedianne (who is of course, tall, blonde and beautiful - how cliche), then it all went down hill.I mean, really? a woman wanders out into a deserted parking lot, asking for help, packs her bags, takes her plant \\"Fred\\" with her and - then argues for about 4 damn pages with the guy before jumping into the truck. Seriously?This is AFTER she's seen proof that they were going to get killed by several professionals in black SUV's. She be-labors the point that the hero might be a serial killer?You stand there for 3 - 4 pages, trying to use \\"tour de force\\" bad humor. Utilizing \\"put-downs\\" and \\"come-backs\\" on the guy you just asked for help? and then after reading the agonizingly long 4 pages of bad one-liners - she jumps in the truck with him and his autistic son anyway without his permission - that is.. after several gunshots are heard when they could have been gone 4 pages ago?Sorry folks, it just doesn't make any sense. I would have shoved her out of the damn car and told her to fend for herself. Her AND her natty plant.I noticed that most of Dean Koontz's \\"heroines\\" usually state: \\"I know karate\\".. and can't fight their way out of a paper bag. But i guess this must be to appeal to the male audience that believe all females are stupid, cute, and cuddly but actually really \\"strong\\" and \\"maternal\\" that way. And in the end the hero is left fighting for his life while the female is in the corner clutching someone else who's just as helpless yelling: \\"Watch out!\\" great.. bravo..Most women who know karate (which isn't rare) don't announce it. Your butt is usually kicked by the time you've figured it out. But that doesn't appeal to the most audiences that are concerned with \\"demasculinizing\\" the big burly male characters."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Koontz waxes philosophical on several subject of social concern along with weaving an imaginative plot including a unique hero attached to the two main characters."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Intriguing action packed from page one to the end. Science fiction at its best. Will keep you riveted to the book."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I have been a fan of Dean Koontz books since some time in the mid 1980's and found myself grabbing each new read as it came out. This summer I decided to re-read some of the books to refresh my memories.By the Light of the Moon was one of those delightful and surprising books. The \\"surprise\\" was never quite figuring out the doctor's motivation and in particular why he picked Dylan and Shep initially to carry on his \\"life's work\\". As more details are revealed so is the connection. Each of the three main characters Dylan, Shep and Jillian have been injected with a secret serum and it has a different effect on each of the characters. By working as a team the three are able to develop strategies that help them to avoid being caught by the \\"government men\\" who want to get their hands on this serum. Shep is autistic and yet his \\"power\\" seems to be the most unusual and magnificent of the three, a real gift. Jilly, a total stranger to Dylan and Shep until that strange night when they were injected, becomes a real part of the \\"family\\". She has wonderful patience with Shep and his actions related to his autism. In addition, Koontz does a great job of exploring autism and showed me what it must be like to live with and be responsible for an autistic family member. As Shep accepts Jilly as part of the \\"family\\" he grows and changes, and yet realistically is not \\"cured\\" of his autism. His gift does give him increased self-confidence and helps to go beyond his shyness to help the other two.I really enjoyed the suspense of thinking I knew the doctor's motives, only to find that Koontz adds more to the story right up to the end.I recommend this for all Koontz fans and for those who may not have tried Koontz, this is a great book with which to begin. Koontz is an author who explores the inner strength of characters and a belief in there being some goodness in humanity."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"This book grabbed hold of me with the first paragraph. Any book with the potential of having characters with superpowers is my kind of book. It took this book a while to really take off but when it did.... When you get close to 75 percent through get ready and get comfortable. you wont be able to put it down. And you wont be disappointed in the ending."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"This was the first Koontz book that I've ever read, and based on the reviews that I see here, I must have picked one of his better ones.I agree with one reviewer that this novel contains elements of The Matrix and X-Men. In fact, it occurred to me that Koontz worked in cultural cinematic elements from the early 2000's, as the book's imprint is 2002. I guess the novel is a product of its time, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. The Parish Lantern character, the talk show host based on Art Bell of Coast to Coast, is a great choice to bring the story together at the end. In fact, if Art Bell has read this book, I'll bet he was tickled.The humor is superb. And I don't need to give you a plot spoiler. It's enough to say that Koontz's novel is jolly, optimistic, good-hearted, and satisfying at the end. Read it if you like your suspense mixed with high technology, humor, and the supernatural."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I really enjoyed this book, the mystery, the fast pace, and the endless action!!

This is such a wonderful story.I love the dynamic of the characters, and it is a fascinating storyline to me. Iwould love to see Koontz write another book or two with these characters."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"It's quite interesting to discover that with the publication of each of Dean Koontz's books, there is a formula at work: each year the stories improve, while the writing suffers. By the Light of the Moon is no exception, with a writing style that often annoys, with its stupidly open manner and constantly inane similes that force the reader to question why bother? The trick is to stick with it to the end, and By the Light of the Moon eventually pays off.The story is an average one that seems to be all the rage at the moment: three characters (one an autistic man of twenty) are injected with an unknown golden liquid by a mad scientist subdues them, ties them up, and then sticks in the big needle. There is the warning from the doctor that the effects of this liquid can be both good and bad, and then he flees.So the three characters are irrevocably brought together to fight for their survival. Fortunately, it turns out that the mysterious liquid does good for all of them: one gains the ability, by touching objects, to know who last touched it and if they are evil, and is unable to stop himself from ending that evil. Another has visions of the future that actually will happen somewhere at some time. While the autistic man has the great ability to be able to fold time and space, transporting him and anyone else to anywhere and at any time, whether it be the past, present, or future, presumably.One would think this a great story, but the simplistic and annoying writing keeps getting in the way, as well as the plot that has very little depth. But ultimately, By the Light of the Moon is worth working through for the amusing ending.Originally published on May 12th, 2003.Go to BookBanter ([...]) for over five hundred reviews and over forty exclusive author interviews, and more."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"One of the best Koontz books I have listened to in a while!

I can't quite describe my feelings after fighting to finish this book. I was so tempted to put it down many times throughout; yet, came back, hoping I would finally understand...NOPE! Just a lame attempt (from an otherwise great other) to fill some pages and make a buck. Shame on you, Mr. Koontz, for using the autistic Shep (who I really wanted to like as a character)to fill your pages by repeating the same phrases OVER and OVER and OVER...we get the picture! We saw Rain Man!!! Simply put, it just wasn't a novel I can rank as a favorite - the whole injection, nanorobot, theme could've went somewhere, but it just didn't happen in this one. Sorry guys, I hope I enjoy The Face and his newer ones more."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I've read books from Dean Koontz before and always enjoyed them, but &quot;By the Light of the Moon&quot; was a disappointment. I couldn't even finish this book. The 2 main characters(Dylan and Jillian) were annoying, there was too much describing of things and the action took too long to unfold."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"It is interesting to witness the maturing of Dean Koontz as demonstrated by his books over the years. As do we all, Mr. Koontz learns that the horror contained within the human species is far more terrifying than anything supernatural.I read the much anticipated new book over a weekend, and must admit that the nanobots were reminiscent of those in Cold Fire but the result in By the Light of the Moon though, were far more entertaining. Mr. Koontz writes a bright, brave strong heroine (a constant in his books) a standup comedian with a sarcastic sense of humor that doubles as her shield. Our reluctant hero is not as well trained as those men in previous books, no past military training, no guns, which is refreshing. And then there is the autistic brother, Shep, whom Mr. Koontz creates with tenderness and empathy. I especially enjoyed the introduction of Paris Lantern, (gee, who could that late night paranormal talk show host be really?) as I have enjoyed Mr. Koontz as a guest on a late night paranormal talk show.The book had all the right elements and yet it just did not click for me. The new Moonlight Club has the potential for many adventures, but I prefer the Christopher Snow XP man clan. Of course opinions are like elbows, everyone has one!I will look forward to the next Koontz work and will hope for new canine characters in the books- Koontz writes the best dogs, hands down!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"\\"You're no scientist. You're a monster. Science shines light into darkness. But you *are* the darkness. You do *your* work by the light of the moon.\\"- victim to mad scientist, hereinThe plot of this story can be summarized succinctly: the origin story for three not-quite-super superheroes in the mold of Jim Ironheart from COLD FIRE (superheroes whose powers mainly lie in knowing what's going on that needs their intervention, leaving the work of figuring out *how* to help to their ingenuity). The three protagonists' changes are forced upon them by a mad scientist seeking to preserve his life's work, who ambushes them and injects them with a mysterious substance that soon brings on terrifying changes. He arranges matters so that he has enough lead time to escape from them while still allowing them to escape from *his* pursuers, leaving them to identify him and figure out exactly what he did to them when they can take time out to do some research on the net later in the story.I recommend the unabridged audio edition read by Stephen Lang over the plain text itself, as I think this book shows to best advantage when performed rather than simply read on the page. While the story draws in the reader and has plenty of action and character exploration, it's rather slow-paced if one steps back and considers it carefully (it takes ten chapters for the three main characters to be assaulted, injected, shake off their temporary confinement, meet, and hit the road - about 40 minutes of story time).Of the three main characters, Koontz spends a lot of time in the heads of two of them - Jilly Jackson, stand-up comedian, and Dylan O'Conner [sic], professionally a painter but also in the full-time role of caregiver to the third protagonist, his autistic younger brother Shep. Shep's character is explored less directly, and his personal situation is in a way illustrated by the setting (the desert of the southwest) and the experiences his companions are put through - their changes result in sensory overload as they acquire strange new psychic abilities, and they come to understand all too well Shep's occasional urges to take time out when life becomes too much for him.Koontz's vivid, detailed descriptions will make this story appealing for some readers, but might annoy others since they're partly responsible for the slow development even of action scenes (when one bad guy takes a twenty foot fall, for example, we're given a careful description of the clothes worn by the people sitting near the spot where he lands). It's ironic that Koontz has had such bad luck in having his work adapted to the screen - the descriptions make the sequences easy to visualize. They're particularly effective in describing Jilly's precognitive visions, which tend to be surreal combinations of elements from future events with the landscape around her, like the dream sequences in the original film adaptation of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE or in SPELLBOUND: an ordinary bathroom reflected in a mirror showing a combination of stalls and confessional booths; a stream of silvery birds flying from nowhere to nowhere; images of gunfire shattering windows in slow motion.Finally, the development of the story is rather patchy. Once Jilly and the O'Conner brothers link up and begin fleeing the mysterious forces chasing the mad scientist, there isn't much of a plot, in one sense - they have the simple objective of fleeing, and it takes quite a while for them to begin even trying to acquire more information about their situation. The book more or less functions as a quest for the truth about what happened to them, but is so dominated by intermittent adventures in saving people that the searching-for-truth aspects boil down to \\"do net search during a breather, and at the end of the book stumble into one last sequence that ties up the loose ends.\\" (The adventures do contribute, though, in forcing them to learn what they can do and face some of the personality changes compelling them to do it.)If the reader can just sit back and enjoy the lovingly described scenes and forays into character exploration, rolling with the adventure scenarios as they come along without expecting much of a linearly developed plot, this can be quite an enjoyable book."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"It must be nice to be as great a writer as Dean Koontz. His almost limitless talent enables him to take some of the silliest premises and turn them into fantastic books. His novels grab you for a literary roller coaster ride, one you don't dare get off of until the end.For those who are Koontz novices I issue this word of caution: his books can't be fit into any particular genre. In fact he has admitted that he often lets the characters \\"go their own way\\" as he writes the words, and usually they take the stories in directions he never thought of. That must have especially been the case with this novel, which starts out like a techno-thriller and gradually changes into a story more reminiscent of \\"The Fantastic Four\\" than anything written by Tom Clancy.Along the way we get to know a trio of brave, colorful and somewhat disfunctional characters. One is a comedienne who travels with a pet plant she talks to. Another is a professional artist who prefers to smile instead of brood. The third is his brother, an autistic young man who develops some rather profound abilities as the book progresses. Tossed into the mix are a mad scientist with a serious jones for peanuts and cola, a talk show host who sounds a lot like Art Bell, and a small army of professional assassins with enough firepower to lay waste to a city.I won't even bother to outline the plot; it's better to just jump into this one and hold on tight through the twists and turns to the (mostly) happy ending, which I predict will leave you with a confused but joyous smile, as it did me.Scary, shocking, suspenseful to the end, with bizarre plot twists and memorable characters, Koontz's books may seem far-fetched at times, but they never fail to entertain. Enjoy the ride!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I have been a fan of Dean Koontz for a long time. Ever since I found a copy of &quot;Watchers&quot; in a second hand shop and bought it on a whim. I loved it straight away and couldn&#8217;t put it down.But this is not Watchers. Not by a long shot. I found myself struggling to get to the end, and when I got there I was sorely disappointed -it reminded me of X-men, in the not so good way.The story revolves around Dylan O'Connor and his autistic brother, Step. Who are staying at a motel when a crazed doctor injects them with a strange liquid. From there things only get weirder. The pair meet up with Jillian Jackson, a woman who has also been injected. That's when the strange substance kicks in, giving them all special powers. Dylan gets the urge to help people, Jillian gets strange hallucinations and Step becomes able to teleport through space and time. Together the three of them run around trying to escape from the evil government agencies that are, for some reason, trying to kill them...sounds better than it actually is.If this is your first Dean Koontz novel, I suggest you put it down and go find yourself a copy of &quot;Watchers&quot; or &quot;Lightening.&quot; Something worth reading."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I love Dean's novels, with &quot;Watchers&quot; and &quot;Lightning&quot; as my all-time favs. But, this one was so juvenile I had to force myself to finish it. A good novel traps and holds your attention; a great novel puts you there with the characters - this was neither good nor great. In fact, it was downright terrible. The writing is stilted, the characters are 2-dimensional, the main characters are outright rip-offs from previous books, the plot doesn't thicken - it coagulates. Ughh - I felt like I was knee-deep and sinking. And the tone of the book was so pious, I kept waiting for references to the 700 Club to appear. I wanted to believe what was happening to the main characters could actually happen, but the whole book, from start to finish, was so implausible as to make believeing impossible. The ending was over-the-top and way too influenced by the recent influx on the big screen of comic-book characters turned SuperStars. I think Trixie actually wrote this one (sorry, Trix, but you suck); please, Mr. Koontz, make the dog step away from the typewriter!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I guess that I would call myself a middle-of-the-road Dean Koontz fan, but I used to be a much bigger fan of his. Books like Whispers, Watchers, Phantoms, and Nightfall made me a fan, and much of his newer work keeps me coming back. &quot;By the Light of the Moon&quot;, however, is probably his weakest effort. If ever there was a book by a major author that did not deserve to be published, it is this.There is no plot to speak of, the storyline is ALL over the place, and, most unforgivable of all, its boring. In addition, its very frustrating to spend 10 pages reading the unchanging ramblings of the autistic charachter, Shep. When the 2 main characters, Dylan and Jilly, are speaking to Shep, try to count (a.) how many times Shep repeats the same phrase over and over, and (b.) how many times Dylan calls him &quot;Buddy&quot; and Jilly calls him &quot;Sweetie&quot;.Also, lately every Koontz book is a good vs. evil struggle, with evil represented by a mad scientist that always has a very high IQ. Why has he done this so often? He has also used the female comic charachter one too many times and tries very hard to make the dialogue humerous, but believe me, it isn't. Worst of all, Koontz clearly fancies himself somewhat of a techno-buff lately, but by writing about technicalogical details that he unfamiliar with, he only suceeds in exposing his ignorance to the details of technology.&quot;By the Light of the Moon&quot; is just a lazy effort by Koontz, well below the level that he has shown that he is capable of. Koontz fans will probably read this book, but if you are new to Dean Koontz, start with something else."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Steven King once said he could send his grocery list to a publisher and they would print it. This is what Koontz seems to have done.An interesting story is destroyed by Koontz's growing love for rediculous similies and metaphores. They distract so much, it is hard to re-focus on the tale. Action scenes are vaguely described, not nearly as complete as in earlier novels. The character interactions are laughable. The only aspect of the book that held my attention was the hope that it would improve.I used to be a big fan of Koontz. Midnight, Lightning and Watchers are three of my favorite books. However, he seems to be commited to following the same theme, time after time. Young man and woman, thrust into an unwilling adventure, persued by unknown assailants. And don't forget the dopey, yet cute, sidekick that turns out to be the hero, whether it's a dog, kid or, in this case, an autistic twenty year-old.Anyone newly discovering the author would do much better reading all of the above mentioned novels before commiting several evenings plodding through this laughable story.Any commited Koontz fan, like myself, will doubtlessly read it anyway. And come away shaking their head in disbelief."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I decided to give up after 150 pages of this extremely boring book. If you are looking for fast moving suspense you're out of luck. Characters are engaged in pages upon pages of mindless conversation having nothing to do with the so-called &quot;suspense&quot; theme. On the other hand, if you have trouble sleeping this is better than any sleeping pill. Pure psycho-babble.Don't be fooled by the &quot;reviews&quot; on the first two pages and don't waste your money on this nonsense."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Ever since the Christopher Snow novels (Fear Nothing and Seize the Night), Dean Koontz has been perfecting his own sub-genre, the spiritual thriller. His work has fully come to fruition in his two latest books, One Door Away from Heaven and By the Light of the Moon.It's interesting to compare the latter with Michael Crichton's Prey. Both deal with nanotechnology. Both are in the thriller genre. That's where the similarity ends. Crichton is a Cassandra. Koontz is a prophet of the good news (not really the Christian gospel, but something very close). The thing that most clearly separates Koontz from Crichton is the former's deep concern for people, especially those who would generally be considered the dregs of society-trailer park denizens, kids with terminal illnesses, dead-end divorcees. These are the people through whom salvation comes, not the scientists, not the theologians, not the cultural arbiters.By the Light of the Moon, perhaps Koontz' most accomplished novel to date, concerns three misfits, Dylan O'Conner and his adult autistic brother, Shep, and Jillian Jackson, a third-rate stand-up comic. These three share a common, albeit bizarre, thread of recent personal history: each has been infected with an unknown substance, administered by a benign-looking although ego-maniacally demented mad scientist, that will either destroy them or endow them with remarkable powers-or perhaps both. They find themselves thrown together and on the run, from mysterious forces who want nothing less that their termination, with extreme prejudice.What happens is a series a serio-comic chase scenes, personal revelations, and general Koontz-inspired mayhem and high jinks, all ending in a remarkable turn-around-is-fair-play denouement, featuring the most memorable minor character, apparent UFO-obsessed radio-talk-show-host Parish Lantern (great name, btw), since Kilgore Trout.By perfecting the relational-friendly spiritual thriller, Koontz has done us all a great service: He has figured out how to insinuate deep messages into the most unlikely set of story circumstances, all the while entertaining our socks off. For that, I believe he has become the most important novelist of his generation.On a personal note, I am the father of an autistic son approximately Shep's age, and I must say I was very moved by Koontz' conception and portrayal of an individual suffering from this condition. My son, Christopher (his name means \\"Christ-bearer\\"), is about at the same functioning level, and Koontz has exactly caught the mystery and much of the nuance of autism. Except, perhaps, for the depiction of autism by Dustin Hoffman in \\"The Rain Man\\" (based on the son of famous autism researcher, Bernard Rimland), Shep O'Conner is the most accurately rendered fictional autistic character I have seen.Thank you, Dean Koontz, for your quirky, idiosyncratic vision. May it ensue in many more such inspired creations."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"As a long time reader of Dean Koontz books, I have been somewhat disappointed with his most recent novels. Although by most standards they are very readable, they lack much of what has made Dean Koontz a solid best-selling author for so many years - strong characters, tight storytelling. I found the author's recent books to be overly descriptive and somewhat flowery (sorry, but it's hard to describe the exact nature of the problem - also note, I still read them all!).I am very pleased then to say that his most recent novel, By The Light of the Moon is not only his best in recent years but may be his best since Dark Rivers of the Heart.The characters - Dylan, Shepherd and Jilly - are brought together after they have been injected with nanobots, microscopic biological machines, which bring about unique changes in our characters. Dylan is able to identify events already happened or yet to come in the residue left by a person's touch on various objects. Jilly develops precognition. Shep, Dylan's autistic brother, develops the most exciting ability. He can \\"fold\\" from \\"here\\" to \\"there\\". He seems to be able to grasp the edge of reality where he is and fold it out of the way while folding into another location. While this \\"folding\\" can be accomplished in either space or time, the ability to \\"fold\\" into other dimensions is hinted at, creating exciting possibilities for these characters in the future. The author describes this process so eloquently that it reminds one of Stephen King and Peter Straub's young Jack Sawyer \\"Flipping\\" into the Territories in The Talisman and Dark House.The author follows these character's actions with little interruption by the band of black Suburbans following them (full of thug golfers (you'll see!)). This is somewhat unusual for Dean Koontz who usually keeps the tension up by moving frequently from one cast of characters to another. Not so in this book. It works very well, however. The action is fast paced and \\"can't put it down\\" exciting.Some might be disappointed by the ending which sets us up for additional stories, but I loved these characters so much that I can't wait for more.Dean Koontz has with this novel created a new band of superheroes, but done so in a way that we care greatly about them and look forward to getting together with them in the (hopefully, near) future."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Shame on me. Despite my father's encouragement, I've taken this long to read a Koontz novel. It was worth the wait.&quot;By the Light of the Moon&quot; leaps forward from the first few pages. Clearly, Koontz is one of those writers who knows how to start the story at the right spot--in the middle of the action. Within twenty pages, he thrusts us into an otherworldly and suspenseful setting, where three young people will be altered forever.The story begins when Jilly, Dylan, and Shep's lives collide in a motel where a mad-scientist type character injects them with &quot;stuff&quot; and promises that &quot;it does something different to everyone.&quot; Indeed, Dylan begins to feel psychic spoors on objects he touches, Jilly sees visions/mirages, and Shep learns how to &quot;fold&quot; the world around him (read the book to find out more). As they focus their abilities, the characters are bound together in a race to save lives and divert heartache and pain.Koontz masterfully draws his characters, causing us to care for them and their predicament. Shep is an autistic boy, Dylan is the brother committed to caring for him, and Jilly is the stand-up comedian who stumbles into their path. Koontz lets his characters be themselves. He lets us see into their pasts and into their hearts with effective timing and skill. He keeps surprises up his sleeve, and divvies them out at appropriate moments. Although he spices his writing with rich similes and metaphors that add to the mood and direction of the story, I did find the sheer volume of them distracting at times.The climax of the book was my only disappointment. The story moved from fringe characters in a predicament to &quot;The Matrix&quot; meets &quot;X-Men.&quot; The scenes are handled deftly, and the bigger issues of fate and free-will are intriguing to contemplate, but Koontz's comic book ending undermined my enjoyment of the themes he explored."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"The newest series in the new and improved and enlightened Dean Koontz at first disappointed me because it took about one half of the book for the plot to come together and make us feel connected to the characters.Nanotechnology is the latest and greatest science written by the best writers out there (the best being Prey and The Eighth Day), and Koontz puts his touch in a tale of redemption.The novel sets itself up for a sequel of two and that will be great - now that a premise is set, let's run from the get-to, please? A definite read - just have a little more patience - this is no From the Corner of His Eye, but to me that is the tops he's done in a long time.(where is the guy who can only get around in the dark?)what happened to those novels? Any more coming?"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Having read 98% of Koontz' books, I feel a little sad in having to say I find this book one of his worst. For me, the fault lies in the overworking of the autistic young man, Shepherd. So many scenes are drawn out to unreasonable lengths by the redundancy of not only Shep's dialogue, but you know that each scene will go on for a couple of pages and ultimately brother Dylan and friend Jilly will get what they want out of them. Dean has come to be a writer who is getting too involved in his own skills. He overwrites, not only his usual descriptive blabber, but in much of the dialogue. There ARE some wonderful scenes, though: Shep and Dylan revisiting the murder of their mother; Dylan helping out an old cowboy locate his long-missing daughter, and the climactic wedding scene. They're very well done and if the rest of the book had matched this kind of writing, I would have been impressed. Needless to say, it looks like &quot;The Moonlight Club&quot; may be coming? If he can focus a little more on making a tighter narrative and not overdoing his characterization (as with Shep), he may return to his higher level of writing."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"By the Light of the Moon was one of the few Koontz books I'd had yet to read. And over all, compared to his other works, I was still quite impressed with By the Light of the Moon. While it's not my absolute favorite of his, as I reached the ending I found myself quite pleased with the whole of this book.We find Dylan and his autistic brother Shep in the middle of an average day of their lives, in a hotel room, in town for Dylan's art show. Quickly, an average day turns into the strangest, scariest day of their lives- as Shep stands by helpless as Dylan is accousted and injected with an unknown substance by a seemingly crazy man. Minutes later in another part of the hotel another random victim (Jilly) is injected as well. The three of these people find themselves in the middle of a strange nightmare- fighting for their lives and trying to figure out what has happened to them and what's to come.When I read Koontz it often times comes down to whether I enjoyed the characters and their lives. And in that regard, this book did not disappoint- I would certainly enjoy a sequel- which I don't say often. Shep, Jilly and Dylan were all well-developed, unique and \\"real\\".As for the plot itself...I realize some readers do not like books that are about either the supernatural, or other topics that are seemingly unusual, possibly unrealistic and definitely \\"out there\\". However, this IS one of Koontz's books that I felt was NOT too out-there, not too corny or unrealistic. The story kept me turning the pages, dying to know what was going to happen next. As for the final chapters and ending- those were the best part to me! This was one of Koontz's more recent stories that I did enjoy, there have been a few that did disappoint (Tick Tock, Winter Moon). If you're looking for other books of his that are newer are worth the read, add these to your reading list: The Face, Odd Thomas, One Door Away From Heaven. And as for some classic Koontz, try: House of Thunder, Hideaway, The Bad Place, Key to Midnight & Watchers!"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"What I like about Dean Koontz is that no matter what he writes about, whether it's evil bioethicists or your everyday sociopath, he manages to imbue his stories with his own unique style and spirit. You know his hero and heroine are going to be thrust into a life-threatening situation. You know you're in for a roller-coaster ride, but you also know that along the way you're going to laugh, cry and express every emotion known to man. The action in BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON is rapid-fire. Everything happens within the space of twenty-four hours. Reminiscent of INTENSITY, another favorite of mine. Dylan, Jilly and Shep are injected with a mysterious golden serum and, almost immediately, begin exhibiting strange powers like precognition, and the ability to fold space and time. Wow! As a science buff, AND a science fiction buff, I was thrilled when I learned WHY Dylan, Jilly, and Shep were suddenly blessed with superhero powers. And the scene in the church, toward the end of the book, when the three try to prevent a terrorist attack,is one of the best Mr. Koontz has ever written. Astonishing. I loved every minute of this book. I didn't want it to end, and when I finished it I was sorry I'd read it as quickly as I did. I'm looking forward to his next book with high expectations. It's going to take a lot to top this one. But, you know, I have a feeling that he can do it with the third installment of the Christopher Snow series. I miss Chris. Hint, hint...:o)"},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I read all the bad reviews of this book and I have to wonder ... what book were these people reading? I loved the characters - Shep being my favorite. I thought Jilly was completely realistic and I know several people like her. Yes, initially, she seems like a b%@#$, but if you take the time to get to know her and give her a chance, she grows on you. I thought the premise of the story was very interesting, and the inclusion of the Art Bell-like character was humorous. I read it in two days during a cruise and it was a great choice."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"With this outing, Dean Koontz proves yet again why he is the most influential popular fiction writer of our time. Koontz has a mind that delves deep into the American psyche, and there he deftly engages our greatest questions and our deepest fears in a way that effects change. There is no more dynamic way to influence culture than through a riveting story with three dimensional characters who walk off the page and into our minds, bearing questions and challenges that resonate with our own.Many writers can spin an interesting yarn, but precious few can thrill and influence - yet Koontz is the master of both. There are times when his expansive imagination may prove burdensome to the dullest of minds (he wields simile and metaphor like a master magician wields a deck of cards) but his colorful description never detracts from the plot's through line. I won't slow you down with yet one more synopsis of this powerful story, suffice it to say that injecting the protagonist's arm with &quot;stuff,&quot; and forcing him to run for his life with a witty love interest at his side and savant brother in tow makes for a fascinating premise which Koontz rides brilliantly to the climax.Have I said that Koontz is brilliant?As readers, all we can do is hope this storyteller continues to stomach the pain that surely accompanies the birthing of such wonderful if stretching novels. Please, Mr. Koontz, populate the world with more of your stories. May they be fruitful and multiply."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON will keep you turning its pages to find out where the plot takes you, but it isn't Dean Koontz at his best. I felt the story was a little too reminiscent of Koontz's earlier book, THE BAD PLACE.BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON is about a young man and his autistic brother who run afoul of a deranged scientist versed in the cutting-edge field of nanotechnology. After the two brothers are injected with a serum containing microscopic robots that give them unpredictably strange new powers, they soon team up with a young woman who has also been turned into a human guinea pig by the same madman.Although BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON mainly sticks to the same \\"innocents on the run from powerful evil forces\\" formula that Koontz has used many times over, he should be credited with attempting to break some new ground here. His last couple novels, although not wholly successful, have at least been showing that he's moving in some new directions.My main problem with BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON, aside from its similarities to THE BAD PLACE, is that it tends to get a little preachy. The characters wind up a little more goody-goody than is easily palatable.There are some redeeming qualities to the novel as well, however. Koontz's trademark individualistic humor is readily on display, and despite its shortcomings, the novel manages to be more or less entertaining. When I read a new book by Dean Koontz, I always feel like I'm catching up with an old friend, and I guess that's why I'll always keep reading them."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I had never read a Dean Koontz novel before, and this insipid piece of drivel will likely ensure I never read another. Koontz devotes a considerable portion of the narrative to develop an autistic character named Shep while neglecting many other aspects of the novel. All the other main characters suffer from Koontz's fanatical devotion to Shep and the plot essentially represents a conservative, Luddite view of technology (nanotechnology in this instance).Two brothers, Dylan and Shep, stop at a motel in the Southwest en route to various art functions since Dylan is an artist. Simultaneously, a female comedian named Jilly stops at the same motel with her significant other, a houseplant. Koontz struggles to pay homage to Steinbeck in a two or 3-page narrative devoted to the plant \\"Fred\\" and his unique relationship with the comedian Jilly. This evoked painful memories of the turtle crossing the road in The Grapes of Wrath forcing me to throw the book down almost as fast at that supposed classic.Both brothers and Jilly are ambushed by a \\"mad scientist\\" (they still exist) who injects them with millions of microscopic robots who alter their bodies to the point that they each have unique powers (two can teleport much better than Jeff Goldblum did in The Fly).\\"Son of Jor-El, kneel before Zod\\". If you have ever seen Superman, that is what these people become, using their newfound powers for the good of the world and beating the mad scientist Lex Luthor oops...uh sorry, he wasn't fleshed out enough to remember who he was.Some talk show host who resembles John Edwards makes an appearance as a member of the mad scientist's ever-growing club of nanobot injectees. He basically saves the day for our other injectees since the nanobots injected into him have helped him be able to predict the future. Sound preposterous? It is. Koontz's editors allow him to mete out such huge portions of purple prose that a high school composition teacher would even cringe. How this book ever saw the light of day let alone the moon is a mystery. One can only speculate that an author who has received critical accolades would allow such kitsch to bepublished only because of finanical or contractual obligations."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Being a Dean Koontz fan for over 20 years I was very sad to find that I couldn't even get half way though this book!! He has such a great gift for story telling and creating great characters and I liked the characters in this book. There was just too much fluff. The fact that it took Jilly over 5 pages to get her seatbelt on...I could have done it for her!! Very frustrating, very boring and very, very, sad because I doubt I'll ever look forward to reading a Koontz book again."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I enjoy Dean Koontz' books best when they start with action, and \\"By the Light of the Moon\\" kicks off with an ominous event. Dylan O'Conner and his brother Shepherd are attacked in a motel by an apparent madman by the name of Proctor. However, the attack is an injection of \`something' that takes us much of the length of the book to discover. Proctor warns Dylan to leave the motel as quickly as possible because there are those who would see Dylan and Shep dead if these others were aware of the injection. Dylan and his brother leave the motel as soon as Dylan is able to escape from being tied in a chair by Proctor.While hastily departing Dylan meets Jillian Jackson, a struggling standup comedian. Dylan quickly discovers that Jillian has also been injected, and urges her to accompany Dylan and his brother. Let the action begin. The ever-popular men in black SUVs dressed for golf (truly, khaki shorts and golf shirts) show up, and suddenly the motel does not look like a good place to stay; particularly as Jilly's beautiful Cadillac, stolen by Proctor, is blown up shortly thereafter.As Dylan, Shep and Jillian are making their getaway, Dylan touches a frog he was given at an eatery adjacent to the motel, and suddenly feels a compelling urge to go find the person who gave him the frog. The events that occur at this woman's house make you realize that whatever was in the injection was some powerfully weird stuff.Koontz' recent predilection for Dickensian plot complexity still shows up in this book, but to a lesser degree than in some of his recent books. Koontz' does a better job in this book of developing believable characters. Jillian would have been easy to portray as an angry comedian, but instead she is a sweet person that tries to make a joke of everything. Her character is allowed the opportunity to provide details of her history, allowing the complexities of her character traits to be explained. Similarly with Dylan; he is an artist, but rather than being the long-haired brooding stereotypical artist, we find that he has been watching over his autistic brother Shep for many years, and while the reader at first thinks that Koontz is going to forego any development of Dylan's character by using Shep to cover for his lack of personality, we find that Dylan has enough angst to keep at least two psychotherapists busy for decades.Several other reviewers have revealed too many details about the injection and provide too many plot spoilers. Just in case you decide not to read other reviews, I'll not spoil the surprises for you. Suffice it to say that Dylan, Jillian and Shep have at least two other exciting and significant adventures before we reach the end of the book.My biggest complaint about books by Dean Koontz has always been his endings, and this book is no exception. I think the ending was a bit weak. There was plenty of opportunity for the principal characters to have various revelations, to do more, to do something. On the other hand, the ending is a natural lead-in to a sequel, and I'm hoping that Dean plans a sequel for this book; it's just begging for one.As far as recent Dean Koontz books, I think \\"False Memory\\" was more intense; I think \\"One Door Away from Heaven\\" was weaker than this book. Certainly worthy of reading if you are a Koontz fan, but not his best. Coupled with a sequel, this book could later garner a five star rating."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"long...very long ..Koontz streches this book to the limit stupidwaste of time ..took everything I had to finish the book if I had not been bored at work would not have bothered."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I have read and own 15 Dean Koontz books and this is by far his worst. It's boring and with the constant, unrelenting repetitive chanting by its autistic character it's extremely annoying to read. Save your money."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"Not sure whether to give it 4 or 5 stars, because last night I decided to read a chapter of this book to tire my eyes out a bit, and ended up reading until 4 in the morning, having got myself into the condition of being too freaked out to dare to go to sleep! What caused this reaction was the whole part involving visiting the past, and when Shep started going &quot;we're all cold. We're all cold.&quot; I found the portrayal of Shep's autism very interesting and, having only seen Rainman and being no expert, it seemed quite believable. Koontz' last book also dealt with different disabilities and mad scientist who thought he knew what's best for the world, and the disability parts I find very interesting. If there's one thing Dean is good at it's building amazing characters. I also found the nanotechnology idea interesting, never having come across that before. I also LOVED the psychic stuff being fascinated with all that, and I don't CARE how many people have written about it, it never gets old with me. I LOVE the new spiritual aspect of his more recent books, however much I love the older stuff too. I have found the newer ones to much more influential and inspirational to my life, and this one is no different.A few criticisms though, to warrant the lack of 5th star...firstly, Dean, what is going through your head with these names? Parish Lantern? Lincoln Merriweather Proctor? Leilani Klonk? Are you feeling quite ok? Secondly, I know Koontz is often critisized for his over-usage of intelligent canines but I love them and there isn't one here. Finally, the ending of this book was, as I have found with most of his others recently, to SILLY! The Moonlight Club?? It sounds like something from Enid Blyton or something! I will say that this ending does not drag on as much as some others, and doesn't seem as rushed, just...pointless. So, getting better.I love you Dean."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"It is a rare thing for me to give up on a book, I hardly ever even skim read. With this novel however, I went from the determined &quot;it must get better&quot; thoughts to &quot;well I'll skim read this bit&quot; to &quot;I give up, where's the bin ?&quot;.There was so much needless description, the process of trawling through all that prose just to discover that it was a hot day or that a burger bar was clean and sterile was just not worth it.Shame, if the book had been trimmed by two thirds I would have been able to finish and sum it up properly."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I have read MANY Koontz novels, enjoyed about half, and could only recommend one (False Memory) to anyone not a fan of the genre. The reason I continue to endure his books is simple: they are light, easy reads; familiar territory that eases me into a Reading Cycle. There are a few things to expect with every Koontz novel: the hero and heroine will fall in love by the end of the story (if they're not already); an all-powerful killer or secret government organization is trying to kill them; the heroine will be fiery, independant and scrappy; and one of the heroes will be an artist. Dogs and autistic people show up regularly too.By the Light of the Moon possesses all of these things. The characters, in this case though, rise a tad above their stereotyped cliche ridden personalities. Dylan is a decent guy, not overly goody-goody like usual; Jilly is a strong female with a troubled past (as usual) but doesn't overbear the reader. Shep is a well done autistic kid (young man), and the bad guys (black suburban driving super mercenaries) are mercifully kept in the background. The mad scientist is almost believable, though his motives are a bit shaky, and the Lantern character works--though he has a minor role. My biggest quibbles concern the overall plot; the terror of nanomachines injected into humans is interesting, but the results of the injections could have been better; and the whole story \\"clicks\\" together a bit too finely at the end.In short, Koontz is improving, finally. Light of the Moon does not resemble his previous novels (he has a tendency to recycle ideas), and is a decent read. Recommended for Koontz fans, and for those who (like me) have read all of Stephen King's books. Better than Corner of the Eye, and on par with the Christopher Snow novels."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"After &quot;One Door Away from Heaven&quot;, which I consider Dean Koontz' best work ever, &quot;By the Light of the Moon&quot; is a bit of a drop off. It's a good book, but there are aspects that I feel could have been improved, primarily the ending. I also would like to have had more suspense within the chase, a la, when the bad guys are chasing the three protagonists. That said, this is a fine novel, but not quite so fine as I had hoped it would be."},{"Title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I listened to this book on audio a while back (I checked it out of the library) kind of on a whim, knowing nothing of Dean Koontz, nor any of his books. I say on a whim because I just picked it up based on the title, read the back, and it sounded interesting enough that I decided I wanted to read . . . er, listen . . . to it. So glad I did!! I really enjoyed the book a lot. The characters were well written and the adventures that the trio went on while on the run were quite exciting! Brought to mind some interesting ethical questions that I'm sure will make for some interesting discussions in a book club. So if you like suspenseful thrillers, and being kept \\"on the edge of your seat\\" then this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Crash Course for the GMAT, 2nd Edition (Graduate School Test Preparation)","review":"After many years in the workforce, I decided to pursue a graduate degree. The most significant hurdle was the GMAT. Writing and language are strengths for me, but for the past 18 years, I've let computers take care of quantitative issues. So, in short order I had to become reacquainted with math concepts long forgotten, and learn how to take a CAT exam and score reasonably well. All of my research led me to one conclusion: it takes more than one study guide to adequately prepare for the GMAT. The course I followed, with an evaluation of each guide, is outlined in the following paragraphs.For my math review, I selected Peterson's Math Review for GRE, GMAT, and MCAT, 2nd edition. There have been some comments about errors in previous editions, but I found this guide quite helpful, and an excellent refresher on math topics I have not seen in years, but need to know for the GMAT. 4 out of 5.The GMAT Advantage with Professor Dave was selected because of its readability and the questions. The material is challenging, and the more difficult questions in each category provide a good idea of the difficult questions faced on the GMAT. The verbal chapters are very strong and have excellent examples. The math problems are also very good, but the text assumes that the reader already is familiar with most math topics. This is why I recommend Peterson's MAth Review to compliment this guide. Overall 4 out of 5, with a solid 5 for the verbal sections.The Official Guide for GMAT is the best resource for practice questions. 1400 questions are in this guide, and the last 1/3 in each section represent some difficult concepts that will be tested. This book gets the reader prepared for the real questions that will be seen on the exam. In addition, the question writers provide excellent explanations for the solutions, and reveal some elegantly simple ways to solve math problems that at first appear to be very labor intensive. 4 out of 5. (Also, be sure to take the 2 free CAT tests available online from GMAC. These prepare the user well for the GMAT experience.)Finally, I also used the Princeton Review Crash Course for GMAT. I used this as a final review and to gain some additional pointers and time savers. While brief, this book does provide excellent quick reference tips for all question types that will be seen on the test. The idiom list and formulas are worth the price alone. 4 out of 5.I prepared over an 8 week period, with at least 1 hour of review per day, and more often it was 2 to 4 hours. Regular, consistent preparation, using different references that fit your style of learning will prepare you for this rigorous test. Prepare thoroughly with relentless repetition, and take the test. After 18 years out of school, I scored a 690.Good luck."},{"Title":"Crash Course for the GMAT, 2nd Edition (Graduate School Test Preparation)","review":"If you are going for your Masters, use this for study up.

The book is also small and easy to carry anywhere.But I agree with a previous reviewer that there are a few obvious mistakes in the Math Sections:1) As stated by another reviewer, the Permutations formula is wrong (corrects itself in the example.)2) Again as stated by the same reviewer, 100 fish are mentioned in the solution but not the problem.3) I also found an example regarding addition of square roots to be incorrect.I believe most people will really benefit from this book, but again watch out for errors; they should be obvious if you think it out."},{"Title":"Crash Course for the GMAT, 2nd Edition (Graduate School Test Preparation)","review":"The book accomplishes what it sets itself forth to. It is a great panic management tool as it helps you understand the logic behind the test. It is also extremely valuable when it comes to the proposed elimination process.I used this book to study for about 2 weeks after 9 years out of college and scored 700 points using some of the techniques they suggest. One have to consider that I have a strong statistical basis due to my work experience, so the mistakes the book contains in the math section were no concern to me.Not wanting to sound cocky, I have to confess my belief that if you do not catch those errors on your own, there is no book on earth that will help you score well in the GMAT within a week. If you need more than an orientation on how to get through the test, you need more time and other books. The simulated test available for free at gmat.com is a good basis to determine what is it that you need.In two sentences: great book if you have some statistical and analytical background, but little time to study. If you need to develop some disciplines, you need more time, and there is no book that can help you in less than a week."},{"Title":"Crash Course for the GMAT, 2nd Edition (Graduate School Test Preparation)","review":"I purchased this book because I found myself having to take the GMAT with only about two weeks to prepare. Reading the book gives you a false sense of confidence as the questions on the GMAT are much more difficult than the examples. In addition, there were many errors in the book with formulas and answers which makes it difficult to study if you are starting from square one.It is a good book to get your feet wet if you have not studied GMAT material in a while but follow it up with the Official GMAT guide. The book also had some good ideas (like the process of elimination method).Worth the cheap price, but don't expect much."},{"Title":"Crash Course for the GMAT, 2nd Edition (Graduate School Test Preparation)","review":"This book is a good crash course with a lot of helpful tips and rules to remember, BUT when it comes to examples or practice test, author makes a lot of mistakes. What's more, author does not explain well why this answers better over others. And most of the time, when she tries to explain, she basically says \\"it's right - just because it is right!\\" Does it make sense? No? Well, get used to this kind of explanations because this is author's tactic."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Citizen G","review":"I hope they make this into a movie. Raed it and you'll see what I mean. This book is a mystery/suspense story about a female swimmer who had a &quot;brush&quot; with assassins in her past. The past eventaully catches up with her - five years later - and she finds herself in a dangerous situation. The characters are interesting - especially my favorite, a clever reporter watching her - and the swimming scenes are great! I liked the fact that the book focuses on the victims, forcing law enforcement into the background for a change. Pay special attention to the details and different points of view. Although this book is an easy, quick read (two nights max), there are lots of interesting things between the lines."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Citizen G","review":"Very short, interesting, AQUATIC! Pack this little gem in your beach bag and find a spot on the sand. This book is a surprisingly fast and engaging mix of female swimmers, sneaky reporters and elusive, shadowy villains. I read it in two nights, but a day at the beach will probably suffice. You may even be inspired to buy a wetsuit and take to the waves! Recommended for adults and teenagers."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Citizen G","review":"Having been a competitive swimmer in my younger years as well as enjoying a good mystery in my spare time, I decided to pick up this book. This book was an easy read with several twists and turns which captivated my attention from start to finish. I recommend The Confessions of Citizen G to all who enjoy a little mystery from time to time!"},{"Title":"The Confessions of Citizen G","review":"Example: To show the main character's obsessive desire to swim in an interesting way, the author describes similar scenes from different points of view. After the first five chapters (one is long, three are very short), the reader knows there are watchers and people being watched. I found this book to be very refreshing, very easy to read (simple sentences and fragments). For me, it felt a little like fiction noir, a little like Hitchcock, although this book has humor in it too."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Citizen G","review":"This book moves fast. You will never be bored. You will especially enjoy the characters. I would call this an ensemble piece. Many of the characters never formally meet each other, but everyone is watching each other through windows and rear-view mirrors. Great fun. The swimming scenes are especially well-written. A sequel? Definitely potential here."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Citizen G","review":"I enjoyed reading this book.I found it to be an exciting mystery with many surprises.It was difficult to put down and at the conclusion, I felt that I wanted a continuation of the story.I highly recommend, The Confessions of Citizen G."},{"Title":"Leadership Lifestyle: Study of 1 Timothy (Living studies)","review":"A book of passion and practicality, Leadership Lifestyle examines the book of 1 Timothy from the perspective of discipleship and leadership development. Fernando explains in the preface, &quot;To learn how Paul made disciples, I lived in 1 Timothy for more than one and a half years.&quot; This book is the fruit of this extended time of study and meditation.Leighton Ford writes in his foreword, &quot;Every leader should be asking: \`Who is going to take my place? Who is God raising up? How can I encourage the coming leaders?'&quot; To these and other questions, Fernando brings his usual combination of keen insight, multicultural perspective, and intensely practical application.At the end of each chapter are questions for personal application which are effectively designed to help the reader take stock of personal strengths and weaknesses and develop a plan for personal development. Chapters include such subjects as &quot;Leadership as Parenthood,&quot; &quot;The Vision of Grace,&quot; &quot;How to Respond to False Teaching,&quot; and &quot;Possessions: Keeping the Right Attitude.&quot;Leadership Lifestyle is neither a self-help book, nor a manual on administration or program development. Rather, it is a challenge to discipleship and leadership development in the tradition of J. Oswald Sanders' Spiritual Leadership and Walter A. Henrichsen's Disciples Are Made Not Born.Those who are looking for exegetical resources on 1 Timothy might consider the commentaries of J. N. D. Kelly or Homer A.

In a universe gone mad, these Atlanteans - comprised of peaceful scholars, artists, and scientists - have yet to acclimate to their dangerous new surroundings. Endowed with diverse superhuman abilities, they've managed to survive the attacks of the terrifying otherworldly Negation swarm. But now the Negation has deployed an elite hunter dedicated to taking them out. Maybe one hundred thousand years of inadvertent slumber don't seem so bad, after all.CRUX is your go-to read if you're upending your comic book store looking for good sci-fi heroics. As a cherry on top, there's even interesting and complex character work being done here. The shame of it is that CRUX only lasted 33 issues before the CrossGen company folded in '04. Me, I could've stood plenty more of Mark Waid's detailed world-building and rich storytelling and of Steve Epting's sensational artwork and composition. If you've seen Epting's stuff on CAPTAIN AMERICA a few years back, you know how terrific he is.It's a fascinating world they unveil, a desolate Earth set centuries in the future. We (and the Atlanteans) learn that humanity hundred of years ago had followed in Atlantis' footsteps and had undergone the \\"transition,\\" the next stage of evolution. In the intervening years, one of Earth's seed colonies - or, more specifically, an offworld corporation named Terra Cognito - had purchased Earth and transformed it into a global amusement park and museum. But then the Negation forces had attacked and so Earth was abandoned, tourists and company staff scampering off-planet.But the six Atlanteans hadn't abandoned their racial obligation to mankind. They mean to seek out what's left of humanity, if any, and safeguard them, shephered them to greatness. With Geromi, a non-native Earthling serving as tour guide to this strange new Earth, the empath shapeshifter (and embattled team leader) Capricia leads her crew to the long-vanished continent of Australia, on which a pocket of humanity had just been detected. There, they encounter a community of frantic humans slaving away to construct a \\"transition\\" engine so that they could follow the other humans to a higher plane of existence. Except that the localized area is prone to weird temporal fluctuations. Things and people tend to mysteriously vanish. Meanwhile, the scary Negation hunter has caught the Atlanteans' scent. One hundred thousand years removed from their utopian civilization (which now lies in ruins after a great cataclysm), can this squabbling bunch of intellectuals learn to co-exist in time to preserve themselves and the Aussies? Not before losing one of their own, they can't. Not before compromising their ideals, they can't.There's a late reveal here which informs us that there's a sort of cosmic plan in play, and that Capricia is destined for big things. There's a bittersweet feel in reading that bit, since we already know of CrossGen's demise. I came to the party late. I didn't know about CrossGen comics until after the company had gone under. The later issues of CRUX and of most of CrossGen's other titles are hard to come by nowadays. They haven't been collected in trade format. So I wonder, did Capricia ever fulfill her destiny? Or did she and her fellow Atlanteans get canceled, just before? I wasn't there from jump, but I do miss the heck out of the CrossGen universe.And should you ever get a yen for more CRUX stories:-Crux v. 1: Atlantis Rising-Strangers in Atlantis (Crux)"},{"Title":"Tavern Tales","review":"Tavern Tales is a great mixture of fantasy and romance. The stories embrace the modern fairy tale with slight twists and turns that grip the reader until the end.

The details in the book were extremely vivid. I pictured myself as Keely and felt her fear, lonliness, and understanding when she met the wraith.

Through her smooth writing style, Judith made Keely's sheer terror palpable and turned her fear into compassion."},{"Title":"Tavern Tales","review":"Tavern Tales has some very good stories in it about fantasy. Some of them are hard to read. The Wraith's Forest on the other hand was a very good story. Judith Leger drew you into the story with the first few paragraphs and held you there until the last word.

In the Townhouse, she begins with an ordinary English peasant, Martin Reed, as narrator. He describes how he rose to wealth and built the townhouse. The story then switches narrators to fill in the story as the years pass, but the last word in the novel belongs to Martin as a wise old man. A wonderfully vivid picture of medieval England is painted along the way and we meet some equally vivid people. Along with the realism, there's a touch of the supernatural. It's a shame it's out of print."},{"Title":"The Town House","review":"Beautiful. My aunt bought a 1950's edition of this book at an estate sale. She loaned it to me and I could not put it down. What a shame it is out of print. I can't wait to read The House at Old Vine."},{"Title":"The Town House","review":"Norah Lofts is my all time favorite author. I love the way she used such quirky twists of fate and her style of telling the story from the different perspectives of more than one character in the book. She also adds in characters from other books and ties them all together in a most wonderful way. I don't know how she kept track of it all in the days before computers. It's a shame they haven't re-realsed more of her books. All the hype of authors such as Diana Gabaldon (I did love her first three in the Outlander series but now she's seriously off track and I'm wondering if she can live up to her reputation) who can't hold a candle to Ms. Lofts. I love the entire House trilogy but would be hard pressed to pick one favorite of what I've read of this author's wonderful books. Very frustrating that I cannot even find some of the ones I haven't read yet. I've devoured the whole of what's in my library."},{"Title":"The Town House","review":"Before there was Pillars of the Earth there was The Town House.

It sat around the house for several months, before I decided to read it, not expecting too much. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! This is an amazing book, with believable characters and circumstances. It is somewhat similar to \\"Pillars of the Earth,\\" but the story goes down a different route, a different, but a very rewarding one. It was an absolute joy to read, and have read the sequel, and will start the third book soon enough. An absolute joy and an underrated classic."},{"Title":"The Town House","review":"My mother (a great Norah Lofts fan) handed this tale to me years ago and the story has never left my mind. Martin, the serf who counted himself lucky to know his birth year until love made (or ruined) his future, the old mid-wife, the bear tamer, the gypsy's child and the disappointed cardinal, they all remain in my memory along with others I do not name. The Town House sheltered them all at some point and it is easy to imagine their spirits moving between the walls,telling and retelling how chance and choice ruled their lives. If you like historical fiction, by all means try the Town House but remember what I say: once read, part of your memory will dwell in The Town House too."},{"Title":"The Town House","review":"The reviews for this book, and its sequels, were so outstanding that perhaps my expectations were too high. The reviews that the books were 'meticulously researched' and full of period detail might make you think that there is a strong historical component to these books, but in fact these are really period novels, rather than historical fiction. The history that is there is fine- it's just that there isn't very much of it. As for the fiction part, it certainly reads well enough, keeps you moving forward, and (as another reviewer points out) is not full of predictable happy endings. In fact, it is not at all cheery- there are very few characters that you particularly like, and all of them come to a sad or bad end. The concept is tremendous, and the execution is fine, but not as amazing as the other reviews would suggest."},{"Title":"The Town House","review":"An old favorite that I read when it came out, and have re-read many times.

However, Reeder doesn't seem to manage compiling the mountain of data into a flowing narrative. The effect is a bit like watching a homemade movie made with a handheld camera, constantly zooming around and giving a sudden close-up of something. Suddenly, you'll get several pages in which she heavily excerpts other works about a particular person's life, even at the expense of shining any light on Akhamatova herself. In the section she devotes to the poet Osip Mandelstam, we are suddenly told that he \\"had the brilliant idea of getting a cow\\" to survive his exile. In fact, his widow Nadezhda wrote in her superlative memoir that getting a cow was her idea and (Osip) was \\"not keen on my plan ... 'Nothing ever comes of such schemes,' he said.\\" Ultimately, Reeder's biography feels a bit clinical. She does a good job at analyzing the poetry, but Akhmatova herself eludes us.

Young readers get to follow this intrepid group as they hike through the woods, endure thunderstorms, cross tall grass and high bridges, all while Charlie Brown worries about Snoopy and Lucy comments on his strange pet. Snoopy tries to be a good leader, but his plans do not go well. You know how you can tell? Because there are two pages in the entire story where Snoopy has his &quot;cool&quot; eyes; those are where they are just diagonal slits. There is one early on and one at the end, but in between there are few moments when Snoopy is really in control.&quot;Take a Hike, Snoopy!&quot; is based on the comic strips of Charles M. Schulz, adapted by Judy Katschke with art by Nick and Peter LoBianco (who have really gotten good at doing the &quot;Peanuts&quot; gang). This is a Level 2 book, which stresses reading independently (I have yet to see a &quot;Peanuts&quot; book that is not a Level 2 reader) by challenging readers with more-complex stories and varied sentence structure. There is also an episodic nature to the book that comes from adapting four panel daily comic strips. Clearly &quot;Peanuts&quot; is well suited for this task."},{"Title":"Turning Thirty","review":"suffice to say, i read this book last year (I was 29 and hoping it held all the answers), but I had to look it up to remember it.I do remember being entertained by it, but it's not some great, life changing novel.It was a decent, quick, light read, if a little fluffy and/or girly.Good for a day on the beach (or waiting for the subway), I guess, but nothing life changing."},{"Title":"Turning Thirty","review":"sorry, but boring characters and boring story. which would be ok if the prose was good or the insight acute. neither is true."},{"Title":"Turning Thirty","review":"The stories of Matt Beckford's(reaching thrity)life.It tells about his breaking with current girlfrind,job transfer to Australia,moving back to parent's home in UK and memories about chilhood friends and most of all about his age turning 30.The stories are sometimes funny and entertaining but at times boring and lots of nostalgic memories about childhood drinking partners."},{"Title":"Turning Thirty","review":"Mike Gayle makes a point about how our society values perpetual youth, so that when people turn 30, they freak out. I went through it myself in July. Thankfully, the book is written with a lot of humor so that a potentially painful subject becomes entertaining.Our protagonist, Matt Beckford, is a likable guy. A British expat, he's living with his girlfriend in New York. The problem is, his girlfriend doesn't feel the spark anymore, and neither does he, although they're great friends. After an almost unbelievably amicable parting, Matt goes home to England to live with his parents for four months between jobs. (He's getting transferred to the Australia office of his software development company in four months).Once he's in England, Matt catches up with all his old mates from high school, who are all nearing 30 or already turned. He also encounters Ginny Pascoe, a sort-of girlfriend from high school. In the past, they constantly hooked up, but they never had a real relationship. Ginny is dating someone now, but she and Matt start spending a lot of time together. Matt also stays in touch with Elaine via email as he tries to figure out how he feels about turning 30 and his life in general.Mike Gayle has not really caught on in the US, that I can see, and that strikes me as a shame. His books always have likable, funny, immediately relatable characters. They happen to be very funny as well.My one complaint about this book was the ending. It wasn't predictable at all, but it wasn't entirely satisfying. However, he may write a sequel, because this is the book most of his fans have asked him to write a sequel to.

I don't quite know why, because Gayle can write some blissfully (and sometimes wistfully) funny stuff. Plus his characters are endearing, sympathetic and human -- even if sometimes they act rude, egotistical or boorish. Turning Thirty is just as humourous and absorbing as Gayle's previous work, which means it's operating at a pretty high standard indeed."},{"Title":"Turning Thirty","review":"This book was my first experience reading the work of Mike Gayle, and I am please to report that I plan to read more of his books in the future! I enjoyed this book for the most part, which surprised me because I was a bit hesitant to read it since I am still several years from 30 and typically don't read books written from the male point of view.The book did make me think about goals I have set for myself and how life rarely turns out just as you plan it to in high school. I thought the main characters were well-developed and I was surprised by the ending...a nice treat! I cracked up everytime the author mentioned a previous classmate then put in () what he/she was predicted to be in high school and what he/she ended up being.I would certainly recommend this book to any reader around the age of 30. I caught myself thinking of old friends and experiences from my hometown that I hadn't thought of for awhile while reading this one. It's a good book to read if you're starting to feel like life hasn't taken the turns you hoped it would by your 10-year reunion! :)I do recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Turning Thirty","review":"Excellent book. Nostalgic in parts and very funny.One of the few books marketed as comedy that made me laugh.Whether you're approaching 30 or another big birthday this will set you thinking (and laughing)."},{"Title":"Turning Thirty","review":"OMG................This book is soooooo brilliant.It was as though I had stole my brothers diary and was reading it.Mike is an amazing Author.

Rarely do you find a voice which is present, introspective, and relatable for both men and women. But this book accomplished that.It was a great balance of introspection, taking stock, and hopefulness for the future. My favorite quote is about the difference betweeen what turning thirty means for a guy and what it means for a girl. But I won't ruin it for you.I will tell you that I've already recommended the book to three friends, and that I also wholeheartedly recommend it to you!"},{"Title":"Turning Thirty","review":"Turning Thirty was just the right kind of book for exactly the kind of mood I was in. Perfectly pitched between comedy and pathos I loved every single word. This is the first Mike Gayle I've ever read and I would describe it as somewhere between a Steve Horsfall and a Nick Hornby novel, i.e. British, quirky and so well observed."},{"Title":"Turning Thirty","review":"Being a little over two years away from the big three oh myself this book struck a chord with me. Many of Gayle's observations about how one feels as they approach thirty were not only hilarious but also right on the money.Matt Beckford is turning thirty in about 89 days and his life is falling apart! He thought by the age of thirty he would have it all together, the fancy high paying job, the woman who was \\"the one\\" to spend his life with and the trendy house complete with the requisite \\"thirty-people's\\" wine rack. However, Matt finds himself three months away from his birthday moving out of his live in girlfriend's apartment and back to Birmingham to live with, dare I say it...his PARENTS! Now Matt has to figure out what turning thirty really means and he enlist the help of some of his oldest friends to figure it out.This is the third novel by Gayle that I have had the pleasure of reading and he is definitely a very talented and witty author whose voice has never gotten lost in his stories. As popular as Gayle is in the UK it is surprising that he isn't better known it the US however now with the wide re-release of \`TURNING THIRTY' he may just find himself at the top of the US's best sellers list soon."},{"Title":"Turning Thirty","review":"As he closed in on the Big 3-0 computer expert Matt Beckford feels pretty good about his future after the past somewhat tumultuous decade. His symbols that he is making it are his wine rack with wine and his girlfriend Elaine. However, as the countdown to maturity continues, Matt suffers several setbacks starting with an amiable split with Elaine and ending with his forced exile from New York to return to his hometown of Birmingham, England to live under his parents' roof while he prepares for a move to Australia.As the countdown continues, Matt meets friends from his schooldays, which make him ponder the two key teenage questions of life: \\"What am I going to do with my life?\\" and \\"Will I ever get a girlfriend?\\" He soon moves in with an occasional former lover Ginny Pascoe, who lets him use her spare room. To his shock he is falling in love with his hostess even while Elaine tries to reheat their transatlantic relationship.Thought the latter half of this fine contemporary character study seems less insightful and amusing than Matt's earlier splashdown, fans will enjoy this hunk-lit tale of aging. Matt is a terrific lead character as he informs with asides to the audience that all his teen doubts have returned though he inches towards thirty, that his last year or two was a false facade and wonders when maturity will actually come and stay. Fans will appreciate TURNING THIRTY as Matt begins to realize that from the day you are perceived you grow old; he hopes in his case a little more gracefully.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Turning Thirty","review":"Cons: Have you ever looked through someone else's photo album and instead of the person just letting you see the photos, they describe every single detail of every single person on each sheet even if you could care less about them? That was the way most of this book was for me. The majority of the book was about Matt, who left his job and ex-live-in girlfriend in New York to find a new job in Australia but because that job was not ready yet, he moves back in with his parents in Birmingham, UK (I was confused about that at first because I thought he meant Alabama until I looked it up).This is when things start not making sense to me. I found it odd that:* someone would go from one continent to the next continent to the next continent all for a three-month wait instead of just finding another apartment in NY* be jealous of their ex dating someone else when their whole break-up scene was like peeling a banana--easy and no emotion* Matt didn't think it was extremely weird to move in with a past sex buddy when he was under the impression that she had a serious boyfriend--no matter how nonchalant she claims he was (until I found out later details)All that aside, when Matt went home to live with his parents, he caught up with a couple of close friends--his continuous sex buddy, Gayle, and his oldest friend, Gershwin. Now that makes sense. However, he decided to call up all of his old school friends to see what they're doing nowadays. That makes sense too, but pages upon pages of describing to the reader in detail what each school friend who we have no idea who they are was unnecessary. I didn't even care that one of them died because I knew zilch about him.There were a lot of unnecessary details like how the main character's favorite show was ER, but not just that, readers found out how to play ER Live and how he babysat one little girl and played Michael Jackson's album several times while she jumped on the couch, a visitor showed up, and she jumped on the couch again. At one point, there was an email about all of the famous people from Birmingham. Through about 85% of this novel, I was thinking \\"GET ON WITH THE STORY!\\" Pages of details could've been covered in a paragraph or two. After page 150, I gave up and just started reading the emails between Elaine and Matt, which was the most interesting part, and browsing the rest of the book until I got to a good part.Pros: Chapter 54 (page 209) should've been right after Chapter 14 (page 63) when he and his father had a very entertaining \\"talk\\" about life. When Matt moved in with Ginnie, this story took off, readers got some drama, they learned more about the connection between him and Elaine, and Matt stopped complaining so much about turning thirty like it was the end of the world. I enjoyed all of the emailed conversations (minus the rambling and unnecessary facts) and very small, romantic things like Elaine knowing what time Matt was born. I was also impressed that the book did not end the way I convinced myself it would. I will not spoil it for those who haven't read it, but I would've bet money (and lost) that Matt would've ended up in a relationship with the woman who got him a Snoopy card and a self-assembly wine rack.There was a scene when Matt had a fit about a woman picking out an outfit and another on him being dumped that was so amusingly male I couldn't have written it better myself. I think female writers generally have a hard time REALLY placing themselves inside of male characters. These are the types of details I look at in stories that make the sex of the characters seem so genuine.End result: I'll give another one of this author's books a try since one of my Amazon friends likes Gayle a LOT, hope there is less rambling, and more of a pull to the actual plot instead of introductions and random characters because I liked the dialogue in it and enjoyment from reading from the male perspective."},{"Title":"Salam Pax: The Clandestine Diary of an Ordinary Iraqi","review":"When the first war on Iraq started, I watched CNN all day long, cried lots and wished I would die. Before and during the second war on Iraq, I had no TV and therefore couldn't watch CNN, I went to as many anti war rallies as I could and I read Salam Pax' blog. The war happened anyway, but I developed an intense desire to live. That is what this book is about. It is about one man's desire to live, laugh and tell his story; despite conditions around him that would drive most of us into despair. While we heard about Saddam and WMD, this book gives us a peak into the life of an average Iraqi person trying to deal with the crazy world around him."},{"Title":"Salam Pax: The Clandestine Diary of an Ordinary Iraqi","review":"This book was an incredible read...very smartly written by an Iraqi during the &quot;liberation&quot;. I highly recomend this book to get a different perspective of the war."},{"Title":"Salam Pax: The Clandestine Diary of an Ordinary Iraqi","review":"his book, Salam Pax, is a fascinating example of how the Internet sometimes works to bring ordinary people into sudden prominence and influence. Salam Pax is the pseudonym of an \\"ordinary\\" Iraqi who \\"blogged\\" from Baghdad before, during, and after the U.S. invasion of Iraq... This book is, like a blog itself, seemingly a work in progress. Salam is self-referential in the extreme, quoting himself from his blogging, and quoting others reaction to him, meanwhile replying in the book itself. While he is aware of his growing celebrity, he is also very critical of it, continually reminding us that he is no expert.Salam Pax is not for everybody; it required a certain amount of curiosity to follow Salam through his extremely personal preoccupations to learn not only about him, but about his country, and more importantly, the impact of the Internet. If these are topics that might interest you, then Salam Pax is worthwhile. ..For a full review see Interface, Volume 3, Issue 9."},{"Title":"Salam Pax: The Clandestine Diary of an Ordinary Iraqi","review":"Salam Pax started out well. Then he got commercialized. The tone of his writing has changed dramatically, and the influence from the anti-war crowd has all but consumed his writing.I'd love to tune back in years from now after he's been forgotten, to see if he returned to writing from the heart."},{"Title":"Salam Pax: The Clandestine Diary of an Ordinary Iraqi","review":"very well expected, the son of his father. read more about Adnan Janabi, under Saddam Oil Bribes."},{"Title":"Salam Pax: The Clandestine Diary of an Ordinary Iraqi","review":"Blogging is all well and good, but Mr. Pax had a sure-shot sword dangling over his neck if his cloak-and-dagger reportage of Iraq was discovered. With that in mind, it is a marvel enough that this book is in publication.Armed with an Internet connection and a blogger account, Pax leaves no stone unturned in the unabashed description of the attitude of his friends and family towards the US, but also to Saddam Hussein's Baathist dictatorship. The dominant theme of his caustic blog is a deep mistrust of American motives, and the text veritably seers with subdued anger, but Pax's skepticism is informed by a tenacious Iraqi nationalism.Like many people potentially affected by wars, I devour a lot of news sources, including political blogs (some more informative than others) but it is usually difficult to see a clear perspective of the people who are physically on the receiving end of enemy scuds unless you live, breathe and sleep in the context of that news.Pax has done a pretty fascinating job of organizing his book, it is eye-opening! For instance, one big anomaly in global news coverage from CNN/Fox/etc lies in introducing Iraq as this hapless nation fragmented by a bevy of races and religions. Yet Pax strongly argues that following recent protracted hostilities with Iran and Kuwait, Iraq itself has been boasting a very strong nationalistic fabric. I wonder how this glaring reality can escape international scribes?If only the decision-makers in London and Washington take the time to consult the voice of the people (such as Pax's) before waging full-scale wars, their understanding about the country they are now scampering to control can perhaps be greatly helped.I highly commend Mr. Pax on his efforts, and wish the best to his book, blog and other activism endeavours. If this thought-provoking, entertaining, and occasionally even infuriating compilation of his blog entries is anything to go by, I surely will be reading more of him!"},{"Title":"Salam Pax: The Clandestine Diary of an Ordinary Iraqi","review":"obviously the individual who wrote a previous review on Pax's baathist links is the type of moron who skips over a books introduction... please take the time to read this excerpt:\\"...Those who thought his blog was unduly critical of Iraq's \`liberators' made dark insinuations about his parents'Baathist connections. Eventually Salam blew his top, advisinghis detractors to \`go play Agatha Christie somewhere else.' Hismother, he said, had been a sociologist at the Ministry ofEducation, but had given up her job when she was told she couldnot make progress in her career without becoming a Party member.His father had been an eminent economist, but had made a similardecision when faced with the same choice. \`You are being disrespectful to the people who have put the first copy of GeorgeOrwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four in my hands . . . go fling the rubbish at someone else.'In fact, the conspiracy theorists' preoccupation with his family's supposed regime connections misses one of the most compelling attributes of Salam's diaries: he directs his vitriol in all directions. In the last days of the war he managed to describe the Fedayeen, the Baathist loyalists mounting a guerilla defence of Baghdad in the space of two paragraphs as \`sickos', \`chicken s**t' and \`creepy f**s'. If he has been less than reverential about Iraq's occupiers,he has been harder still on their Iraqi critics...\\""},{"Title":"Salam Pax: The Clandestine Diary of an Ordinary Iraqi","review":"I've been reading Salam's blog since before the war started, and continue to do so-- he is certainly no &quot;ordinary Iraqi&quot;-- His written English is better than 99% of Americans, his knowledge of Western popular culture is mind-boggling, and his snide digs at posturing of all kinds is world class. His genius brings us the gift of perspective and complexity in a situation reduced by American television to sound bytes and simple images.Salam shares not only his political views but his opinions on music, pop culture and the absurdities of life in general, with the result that I now have someone in Iraq who I connect with intellectually and emotionally, who I worry about, think of, pray for. Not an American soldier (bless them too), but a citizen of Iraq who wishes for both peace and freedom, and who is deeply ambivalent about what is happening there.Salam proves the saying that the &quot;pen is mightier than the sword.&quot; No &quot;ordinary Iraqi,&quot; indeed, but an extraordinary world citizen writing us missives from a surreal position.Write on, Salam. And be safe."},{"Title":"Salam Pax: The Clandestine Diary of an Ordinary Iraqi","review":"What is going on in people's minds while the politicians and leaders use their own peculiar vocabularies to justify whatever?Salam, thank you, thank you for letting an Iowan get a view without the doublespeak.Not many people could give the absurdities that end in bombs and invasion the kind of authentic black humor that Salam does. I laughed out loud a lot. The book reminds me of &quot;Catch 22&quot; despite the differences of culture, author's voice, time and place.Salam is the author with whom I'd most like to have coffee. Or wine-he can pick.

From many thousands of miles distant the war is reduced for us to a political issue; hearing it from Salam makes it immediately a story of human concerns. If you want a perspective from outside the American political power struggle over the Iraq war, from someone intimately affected, check this book out. Salaam says on his blog today that he doesn't like the title on this edition, I second that but obviously it doesn't change the worthwhileness of the contents."},{"Title":"Salam Pax: The Clandestine Diary of an Ordinary Iraqi","review":"I just finished this and it is wonderful! Salam not only talks about the devistation of his city and the hopes and fears he has of the future. Such topics would be interesting and worthwhile.

His little digs and endless sarcasm are amusing but also get across the message that he dosen't feel 'liberated' nor does he feel the need to be thankful to the Coalition for freeing his country.His blog is fun, informative and thankfully has continued despite months of living in a dodgy police state and under a state of war and then (if that wasn't enough) several months of anarchy!I can only hope that we can see the second book listing his adventures in the post saddam Iraq.

It gave me a great deal of hope, reading this book, that we, as world citizens, may be able to find common ground among all our different cultures.

It is a riveting adventure story that also includes many hard-earned design, manufacturing, safety, and financial tips. The book is distinguished by vivid, active prose that puts you THERE in the picture; experiencing the unfolding adventure as Dave experiences it, and solving unexpected, disconcerting, and possibly life-threatening problems with Dave as they happen.

Indeed they are in my opinion bits of details that are either not taught in grad schools or not emphasized in training people to work with school populations. As opposed to adults, he points up, children's diagnoses are fluid and evolving- there are, if we are effectively treating the conditions, more opportunities to bypass chronicity and co-morbid patterns. Less matching symptom to condition to diagnosis. (Another reason, for the No Child Left Behind Folks- to re-evaluate frequently- not, as they would have, to eliminate the need for the 3 year requirement.) Furthermore, he warns of a real personal irritant, and that is NOT TO TAKE KIDS AT THEIR WORD, when discussing their emotions and their reactions to their world. He puts it better than anyone I've ever heard when he says that when you're ruling out mental illness, depression, anxiety, etc. remember, \\"Kids walk the walk, they don't talk the talk!.\\" You need to use collateral information, observation, medical reports, etc. Some other gems-Always be careful with a personality diagnosis and never diagnose when the youngster is in the throes of an acute mood disorder, depressive reaction, adjustment,etc.The integration of the revised manual with the latest IDEA interpretations is the best that I have found. Read the complicated but controversial 'label' and 'classification' debacle for Social Maladjustment and/ or Disruptive Behaviors. The former does not qualify for an IEP but the latter as a condition of ADD and many others- does. Look out as well for the changes relative to those and the politicized furor over discipline in special education. If an eligible child misbehaves as a result of his disability- technically, that child should not be excluded or otherwise consequenced. They are moving to amend that- truth be told, nobody upholds it anyway- but it can always lead to litigation. I encourage people to remain abreast of those IDEA revisions as well as the ramifications of erring on the diagnosis- high stakes- for the child, and for you.Other updates are more about spectrum disorders, clustering of symptoms and, the diagnosis of conduct disorder- which I understood was no longer to be given to anyone under 18. Any of the disruptive, (externalizing) behaviors - You get my drift- dx's- should be evaluated as to if they are a result of environmental malignancy, (Like that?) or the neuropsychiatric composition of the child. Nature vs. Nurture.The weakness in this and every resource I have checked is in the Learning Disorders. I cannot tell you how many people are wandering around shaking their head over the Disorder of Written Expression DX. Kids who write get it. Kids who comprehend get it. Kids who can write lousy but can write get it- then those kids get accused of laziness and as one mom put it, \\"Is my son using his IEP as a crutch?\\" He covers the changes in PDD, Tics as they are either involuntary muscular movements or if they fall within the category of inappropriate and malignant movements of autism. Difference? The latter are used pathologically to interfere with healthy coping adjustment. (Why ya gotta stay current!)All in all, I'm pleased that this is available for school personnel. The previous reviewer mentioned special education teachers should read it. Here Here! And their supervisors. This is a sensitive and thorough volume. It is refreshing for its insights about the need for certain approaches, to kids, and moreover- to kids in school. He advocates a differential diagnosis and checklists and other interviews.

While many people their age would be excited about parties and presents, this birthday is different for the two cousins. They are eligible to test themselves at the Place and see if they're qualified to be Dreamhunters. The Place is a vast, extraordinary land where dreams of every kind are only accessible to Dreamhunters. A Dreamhunter is a person who can cross over and catch impressive dreams that can be relayed to other people.Dreamhunting runs in the cousins' families. Laura's father Tziga and Rose's mother Grace are famous Dreamhunters whose collections of dreams bring large audiences far and wide to experience them at the Rainbow Opera, a famous dream palace. Despite the fame and wealth, dreamhunting is not always a glamorous occupation, and oftentimes a dreamhunter is on a different schedule from that of their own family. On many occasions, Grace's husband Chorley is the primary caretaker of the Hame-Tiebold household.When it is the girls' turn to try, they each have different expectations. Laura feels anxious while Rose hopes to be a famous dreamhunter like her mother. When the day arrives, both are surprised at the results. Rose doesn't cross to the Place, but Laura does. However, for Laura the occasion is bittersweet; instead of having a pleasant dream called the Wild River, she has a nightmare, and her father has mysteriously disappeared after going on an official job for the government.The family is baffled by the Dream Regulatory Body's explanation and doesn't understand why Tziga would decide to enter the Place without telling his family. Meanwhile, strange events have been occurring that defy explanation. Laura and Rose begin their own investigation, but when Laura continues having unusual dreams and discovers a mysterious letter from her father in the Place, it becomes apparent that there's a far bigger and deadlier secret involving corrupt government officials and their families that no one ever could have dreamed.Set in the beginning of 20th-century Australia, DREAMHUNTER tells the story of a family whose members make surprising discoveries both in and beyond their world, while changing within themselves.

Upon reading \\"Dreamhunter\\" I found myself having nightmares for a few nights - not surprising given the subject matter. I wondered why one would tell such a story to children. Let me be clear that these books are a work of distopian fiction, a cautionary tale about the destruction of a society through the greed and selfishness of it's rulers. Though not gorey and certainly not horror particularly more savvy readers will definitely find this a disturbing read (it is all done in an extremely subtle way and the most disturbing aspects might be over the heads of many young readers). However, this first book especially is upsetting. As I came to the conclusion of the second volume I understood - these works are decidedly activist in the same tradition as Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\". Unlike Pullman, Knox is not so much trying to convey a certain theological and philosophical perspective as she has written a rallying cry for word change. Taken in the context of our current world climate - the erosion of civil liberties and the middle class in the United States - it is easy to see that this series is talking about the present day. She could certainly have marketed them as adult books with no changes, but the choice to present \\"The Dreamhunter Duet\\" to children first shows remarkable intent. Definitely \\"His Dark Materials good\\", strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Dreamhunter (The Dreamhunter Duet, Book 1)","review":"The Rainbow Opera is young adults at it's finest. The fantastic prose rolls over your eyes and the story is astounding, it is literature. Elizabeth Knox has been writing since she was sixteen, and this is her first young adult's novel - but do not turn away from this book in Genre-disgust! It can be read by adults, and those who have have enjoyed it fully. It tells the story of two fifteen year-old cousins, Laura and Rose. These girls are nearing the age in their country when they can have...(meaningless suspense)... A Try.That is what you should do, give this book a try, you will enjoy it. Even if you are The Dark Master Of Scorn."},{"Title":"Dreamhunter (The Dreamhunter Duet, Book 1)","review":"Pros-The characters are fleshed out fully-The dream sequences are phenomenal-Sandman ROCKS!Cons-The books starts out very slow-Laura falls too quickly for a character-The beginning drags on and onWriting:Elizabeth Knox is a brilliant writer. Every word is chosen carefully and with great precision. Each word is strong and forceful that brings the world into focus. With such a masterfully skill of words and world building I can see even greater books coming from Elizabeth Knox. The one big issue I have with the entire book, is that for the first 100 or so pages the story just drags on and seems really slow.Characters:Knox holds the story together by brining out characters that make you feel and want to be the characters. Each character is bold, strong and independent in there own way. You can see and feel the characters grow and continually move forward in their relationships. From the timid to the strong, from the brave to the cowardly, and from the honest to the deceiving each character will rock your socks off.Dialogue:The dialouge helps drive the story, but Elizabeth Knox drives the story forward by some scenes being so written so well that there is little need for dialouge.Book Excerpt:\\"He ran to the edge of the pier and flung himself off of it, headfirst, like someone diving into deep water. Except that the tide was right out, and there was no water, only slick black stones at the base of the thirty-foot piles.\\""},{"Title":"Dreamhunter (The Dreamhunter Duet, Book 1)","review":"\\"It is like nothing else I've ever read. The characters are so real, you'll feel like you know exactly what they look like and how their voices sound and what they would say or do in any given situation. More than that, you'll want to hang out with them. Then the world is so amazing and unique. You will want to go there. You will want to walk into \`the Place.' And you will want to sleep in a dream opera.\\"--Stephenie Meyer, The Twilight SagaStephenie Meyer is right. Dreamhunter is a wonderful book. The writing is beautiful, and the world and the characters are vivid and real. You really do want to go with Laura into the Place and catch a dream yourself, then ride the rail lines to the Rainbow Opera, lie down and experience a dream opera.There is also a complex plot, with a missing father, corrupt government officials, and facinating trips into the dangers of the Place. There is a lot going on here, and I'm really looking forward to reading the sequel, Dreamquake, and learning how the story ends."},{"Title":"Dreamhunter (The Dreamhunter Duet, Book 1)","review":"I'd been meaning to read this for a while, and it finally found its way to the top of my reading stack. I'm so glad it did! The premise is fantastic: highly original and beautifully realized. The mysteries strummed at my mind even while I wasn't actively reading. When I finished this book I was desperate to get my hands on Dreamquake, which unfortunately took a few days. But I DID get it, and loved it too. If you're going to read this (and you should), have Dreamquake ready and waiting, as this is really one book split into two volumes, and you're going to want to keep reading.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Dreamhunter (The Dreamhunter Duet, Book 1)","review":"A great read. I won't repeat a synopsis of the story as other reviewers have done that well.Loved that it was a NZ author and set in an alternate NZ. Knox did not push the place because it really is not relevant. This story could happen anywhere (and is!). However, it is sad to see that some people still mistake us for Australia!!! How do they arrive at that?Definitely an adult novel in theme but Knox obviously expects her YA readers to be intelligent young people and interested in the state of the world, as are her protagonists. She has something also to say about young people, who like Laura and Rose, are frustrated in their efforts to deal with a frightening situation by the adults who underestimate and over protect them.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dreamhunter (The Dreamhunter Duet, Book 1)","review":"I wasn't expecting to love this book as much as I did. I thought it would be just another one of those fantasy novels written by a wanna-be fantasy writer, full of weird names with too many consonants and desperate clumsy attempts at world-building. Wow, was I in for a surprise. Yes, there are new names and you're immersed in a totally new world, but you're learning right beside the main character, rather than being plunged into a pre-existing confusing universe. The novel explores a subject not explored much in YA books (with the possible exception of Lisa McMann's Wake series), the world of dreams. There are some passages that drag a bit, but once the story gets going, you are immersed in an intricately developed universe where dreams are the basis for society's continued productivity. All of the questions, the set-up, everything is addressed and if it isn't resolved in this novel, it is rapidly picked up in its sequel. You are going to want to have the second book handy as you finish the first.Rating: 5/5"},{"Title":"Dreamhunter (The Dreamhunter Duet, Book 1)","review":"I had a feeling I was going to love this book when it was suggested for my book club. I'm a big fantasy and YA junkie so this seemed like the perfect fit for me. This is unlike any book I've ever read before. I was drawn into Laura's world of the dreamhunters. This takes place in the early twentieth century and has a steampunk feel; an alternate history since the dreamhunters entered the world. I enjoyed the struggle Laura felt as she has to grow up once she realizes she is also a dreamhunter like her father. Her cousin is not and she has to do things on her own in order to find out why her father disappeared and what The Place actually is.The relationship between Laura and her cousin is beautiful. Even though Rose couldn't go with Laura into The Place she was still there for Laura. Their relationship is one I wish I could have with my own sisters.It's a unique and interesting story; I loved it!"},{"Title":"Dreamhunter (The Dreamhunter Duet, Book 1)","review":"I picked up this book on a recommendation. The beginning was a little slow for my tastes, as I prefer to be dropped straight into an action scene. But I decided to stick with the book, and I'm very glad I did. It's a beautifully written novel. The world building is superb, and the characters feel so real and dynamic. I recommend this book if you are a patient reader, willing savor character development and let the story gather steam slowly."},{"Title":"Dreamhunter (The Dreamhunter Duet, Book 1)","review":"I can't remember how I found this book; I believe I ran across one of the author's other titles at work, thought it looked interesting, and checked out the rest of her back catalogue. However it happened I'm very glad that it did, because this is the best thing I have read in a long, long time.Fifteen-year-old Laura and her cousin Rose inhabit a world very much like our own - they have Jesus, 'The Mill on the Floss', demotic Greek, hockey. They also have the Gospel of St Lazarus, and the Place: a pocket of land, a fold in the universe, unmeasurable and inaccessible to all but the very few and most elite - the Dreamhunters. The Place is a world where dreams are marked at map locations; Dreamhunters cross the border at one of two points, sleep in a specific grid reference, catch the dream that has its existence there, and take it back to share with a paying audience. For this is 1906 and, in this world, dreams are what cinema became in ours - more, because each dreamer experiences the dream as their own. There are dreams of healing, dreams of adventure, dreams of peace, dreams of romance - Rose's mother, Grace, specialises in these - and, although Laura is initially unaware of this, there are nightmares, too, and Laura's father, Tziga Hame, the Dreamhunter who first stumbled (literally) upon the Place some twenty years before, has his own dark trade in these. When he vanishes, he leaves Laura this legacy, along with a duty to repair the damage he's done. He also leaves her a strange companion to help her with this burden.We end on a shocking climax; this is part one of a two-part story, continued in 'The Dream Quake', which I am impatiently waiting for the postman to bring me any ... day ... now.Dense, complex, and beautiful: I don't have the words to do justice to this story. I only wish I did.It isn't just the storyline that sets 'The Rainbow Opera'/'Dreamhunter' apart: there's something unique and distinctive about its voice that I can't define. The only thing I can think of is that the author's from New Zealand and that perhaps her background and experience colour the narrative in a way that's slightly alien to my understanding.This is one of the best and most original fantasies, YA or other, that I've read in years. In a world where the mundane, the badly written and the run-of-the-mill dominate the bestsellers charts, how is it possible that I only stumbled upon this wonderful book by accident?"},{"Title":"Dreamhunter (The Dreamhunter Duet, Book 1)","review":"i was roped in instantly. it keept my entertainment,and left me wanting the next book instantly."},{"Title":"Dreamhunter (The Dreamhunter Duet, Book 1)","review":"I bought this book on the strength of fantastic reviews and was sorely disappointed. Although the story was interesting enough to have gotten a 3 stars from me, I am giving it a 1 star because I feel that putting unnecessary sexual innuendos (however slight) in a book for young readers is inappropriate. I would not mind if these comments added to the story, but they were all completely superfluous. I am glad I read this first before giving it to my 12 year old daughter,but I am upset that I wasted my money on a book that I can't have my daughter read. This is too dark a tale for young readers, but is too simple a tale for adults."},{"Title":"Dreamhunter (The Dreamhunter Duet, Book 1)","review":"Maybe it was because I developed an indifference after the first few chapters, but I couldn't get into this book at all. I didn't care enough for any of the characters, and many times the prose just fell flat for me. I found it difficult to sympathize with Laura Hame, and although Tziga was quite interesting at times, unexpected inconsistencies in his behavior turned me off.That said, the underlying plot is rather intriguing, and quite original.

Its a very slow, choppy read so far and I've grown bored."},{"Title":"Dreamhunter (The Dreamhunter Duet, Book 1)","review":"Though it is thoroughly different in concept, this book reminded me throughout of Phillip Pullman's His Dark Materials series:His Dark Materials Trilogy: \\"Northern Lights\\", \\"Subtle Knife\\", \\"Amber Spyglass\\". As those are the best books I've ever read, I praise this book highly. The story concept is very original and moving, and the writing is simply excellent. The relationships between the members of the Hame and Tiebold families are touching. I enjoy an author who can utilize completely un-clicheed similes--do you know what I mean? If you do, then you will probably like this book! Her turns of phrase surprised me consistently with their eloquence. This was a joy."},{"Title":"Dreamhunter (The Dreamhunter Duet, Book 1)","review":"Reading Dreamhunter is like walking through a dream. The prose is simple, but elegant, and it has this hypnotic quality that gradually draws you in and feel like something is so wonderfully off. And, like I have experienced in dreams, it is a reality that is wrapped firmly in the arms of fantasy, and it is that feeling - combined with with an alternate history of New Zealand and drawing back further to other tales - which creates a world and story that is very unique.Dreamhunter is one of those stories where I fell more in love with the world than the characters at first. It's set in a sort of alternate history New Zealand - called Southland - in a time period equivalent to the early 20th century. And it's a world where dreams exist in a place (simply called \\"the Place\\") where they are caught and shared as a form of entertainment, of healing, of inspiration... and torture. The real strength of this story was the mystery of the Place and the world of dreams and Dreamhunting. It is obviously a concept well thought out, and it shines through in the novel.As an added bonus, there were many touches that I, as a New Zealander appreciated, and while this might not be the case for the majority of people reading this review, it's just an example of the layers to this story. One example is, as shown in the map in the early pages, the place known to us as Farewell Spit is, in this alternate history, called \\"So Long Spit\\"; a second example is the explanation of some of the history of Southland, the discovery of the Place and the origins of Dreamhunting, through an excerpt from a book called A History of Southland, by Dr Michael King - in real life, the late Dr King was the author of the famous The Penguin History of New Zealand.The one thing that keeps Dreamhunter from earning a full five stars from me is that it is very slow to start. The story is divided into six parts, and the first of which, A Talented Family is a lot of world-building and introductions to characters, and a slow build-up to events. It's not done in a bad sense, but it is very easy to read a bit, put the book down and be a little disinclined to pick it up again. It was like trying to go to sleep so you can dream - in this case, not just a case of setting your head down on the pillow and closing your eyes. Fortunately, once you get to part two (The Try) the story picks up incredibly quickly from there, and becomes difficult to put down. All in all, it's definitely worth getting past that first segment."},{"Title":"Dreamhunter (The Dreamhunter Duet, Book 1)","review":"Very rarely are authors able to invent a truly original fantasy, and even among that group, only a select few are able to take that original idea and make it into a compelling, well-written novel. Fortunately, both are definitely the case with this book. Knox, who is usually an adult writer took a stab at some young adult fantasy fiction and has executed it brilliantly. The world is tangible as are its rules. The characters are real, and are involved in more than \`banding together against a great evil to save the world', which is an all too-often used plot in fantasy books and young adult books alike.There are many subplots, factions between the characters, and political and historical intrigue throughout the text. The relationships between characters is as complex as the characters themselves, and, in many ways, this reads like excellent fiction that happens to be set in a fantasy world. The aesthetics, dialogue, and use of language is, to Knox's credit, written splendidly. I recommend this book to all readers 13+, and I hope the sequel will be just as good.-Lindsey Miller, [...]"},{"Title":"Dreamhunter (The Dreamhunter Duet, Book 1)","review":"Wonderful book and great premise. Can't wait for the second book.Characters are well defined."},{"Title":"Dreamhunter (The Dreamhunter Duet, Book 1)","review":"The other day, I was reading Stephenie Meyer's blog, and she had written about this duet of books, and how much she liked it. Her description intrigued me. She wrote: \\"Then the world is so amazing and unique. You will want to go there. You will want to walk into the Place. And you will want to sleep in a dream opera.\\"A dream opera?I was able to get a copy from my library and, lo and behold, I was finished with it in a matter of a few days. By the end of this first book, I wanted to go to a dream opera and have dreams be dreamt for me. The Dream Opera is fashioned after an actual opera house; however, in this opera, there are beds, instead of chairs, and people from all over come to sleep in the opera, while the dreamhunters take center stage and release the dreams they picked up in the Place. I wanted to visit \\"the Place\\" only because it was described so beautifully, with all the dreams lurking about.In the book, Laura is a teenage girl who is the daughter of a Dreamhunter, and she is old enough to be tested to see if she has the capabilities to be one as well. But this isn't just a story about hunting for dreams, and learning to become a dreamhunter. It's a fantastical and intricate book, with some interesting political intrigue involving the Place, and family mysteries to be solved. In the end it is up to Laura to save the people she loves.

As a fellow fantasy fanatic she also thought I would admire the writing. I, however, did not remember to write down the title. A bit later, upon hearing about writing troubles I had been having, Amy once again recommended Dreamhunter. This time I immediately put the book on hold. And looking back now I am ashamed that I waited so very long to read it.Dreamhunter is Elizabeth Knox's first novel for a young adult audience, although I feel obligated to point out that the genre label here applies more to the fact that her main characters are teens than anything to do with the novel's subject or prose. She is also the author of several novels for adults.Like so many great fantasy novels, Dreamhunter is set in a world not that different from our own. The one reminder that this novel is not like any other period book set in 1906 has to do with dreams.For a very few people, perhaps one in every three hundred, dreams really are tangible in the Place: a mysterious other-world far larger than the few acres of woodland that in encompasses in the real world. The Place hold dreams. Of the few that can enter the Place, fewer still are able to sleep there and bring the dreams back to the general public where the dreams can be performed in private residences or in a dream palace like the Rainbow Opera--a sort of theater for dreams--for the public good. Dreamhunters, when they have enough skill and talent, can make their fortunes by catching the right dreams.No one knows this better than the novel's fifteen-year-old protagonist, Laura Hame, and her cousin, Rose Tiebold. Laura's father, perhaps one of the best dreamhunters ever, discovered the Place and Rose's mother is another very skilled dreamhunter.But, as Laura and Rose are about to learn, all is not right in their world. When Laura's father disappears under mysterious circumstances she and her cousin set out to find the secret behind not only his disappearance but also, perhaps, the very secret of the Place itself.Aside from its thrilling plot, Dreamhunter is a wonderful novel because of Knox's background work. As soon as I opened this book, I felt like I was immersed in Laura and Rose's world. It didn't matter that I had never heard of dreamhunters, or Tricksie Bend, or the Grand Patriarch because Knox incorporated all of these new ideas effortlessly into her plot. I was hooked, almost literally, for the entire 365 pages of this novel.The writing here is rich without being overdone and beautiful without being conspicuous about it.This story opens in the year 1906. The choice of time period, as well as Knox's writing style bring to mind Garth Nix's powerhouse fantasy novel Sabriel. I loved Sabriel (as I love all of Garth Nix's books), but I might have loved Dreamhunter slightly more if for nothing save its ending--one of the best I have read of late.Laura and Rose's story continues in Dreamquake the conclusion of Elizabeth Knox's Dreamhunter Duet."},{"Title":"Dreamhunter (The Dreamhunter Duet, Book 1)","review":"DreamhunterElizabeth KnoxGenre-FantasyDreamhunter is a fantastic read for anyone who enjoys a page turning fantasy. The books main characters are two 15 year old cousins called Laura and Rose. Laura is more drawn back and cautious than Rose, who is outgoing and a big risk taker. They live in a world almost exactly like ours except for that it is next to The Place, an area that only a few chosen people can enter and catch larger than life dreams which can be found only in The Place. Laura's father is the legendary Tziga Hame, who first discovered The Place. Rose's mother is also one of the first dreamhunter's and both of the parents would like their daughters to Try. Every 15 year old is allowed to Try, Trying is an event held every year by the government to recruit young dreamhunter's. About 9 kids will get accepted each year by The Place, to every one else they will just walk the next step on the road and never enter.This book relates to a trilogy of books that I read by Garth Nix because in that trilogy there was a huge wall between the Old Kingdom and The New Kingdom with evil magical creatures on the Old Kingdom side. The difference between that trilogy and this book that I just read is that in the Garth Nix books anyone could cross the wall at their own risk but in Dreamhunter only a few chosen people can enter The Place.I think that Elizabeth Knox has a wonderful style of writing that keeps you on your toes throughout the entire story. Every part of this book was packed with exciting details and vivid descriptions of the characters and setting. I loved this book a lot and I would recommend it for readers of any age.

I have enjoyed and loved all her recommendations in the past, but this one just didn't stick well with me.Most of the recommendations I saw on Amazon raved about the author's ability to transport you to \\"The Place\\" and put you in Laura Hame's shoes for the journey. I did not experience that at all. I kept expecting the subject matter to be more interesting than it really was, and for the plotlines to become more believable. I found all the characters to behave erratically, and I could never understand why they acted the way they did. It was supposed to be based in a world comparatively similar to ours, of course in older times, but I didn't see much in the similarities how they compared.I love fantasy books, and thought this author had a neat idea to convey to readers.

The Place is a parallel world where dreams can be caught and brought back to the real world, where they are 'performed' for audiences. Some dreams can heal, some merely entertain - and others are more sinister. At the centre of the story are fifteen-year-old cousins Laura and Rose, both children of famous dreamhunters, who are expected to follow in their parents' footsteps.I've loved every Knox novel that I've read and this one more than met my expectations, and is probably her most accessible yet. It's gorgeously written in her distinctively dense and layered neo-goth style, the language very textured and evocative.

At first it seems like a real historical place... but then you quickly realize that there is one main difference: the Place, a region of land that only certain people can access, and that holds dreams of all kinds. I particularly liked the whole idea of the Rainbow Opera, where dreams are \\"performed\\" into the minds of the sleeping audience.The writing style was a bit different from a lot of the other young adult fiction out there right now.

The novel is set in a late nineteenth century country that has a mysterious space of land, the Place, at its heart. Only dreamhunters are allowed past its borders. Inside the Place, dreamhunters capture all types of dreams which they can later project to sleeping audiences for money.Having just turned fifteen, Laura and her beautiful cousin Rose go to Try to enter the Place to see if they're dreamhunters. Unexpectedly, Laura succeeds and Rose does not, much like in Ruby Red. At about the same time, Laura's father disappears while in the Place, or so she's told. Laura desperately begins to search the Place with the help of a man she makes of sand, called Nown, that she animates using a song spell she learned from her father. Soon, she uncovers that there is a dark side to capturing dreams.The disappearance of Laura's father clearly rattles her and she changes into a head-strong, unstable young woman. The mysteries she learns burden her mind to an unhealthy degree, which sets her apart from most YA heroines. I'm impressed Knox writes such a flawed character, but I can't help but be disturbed at how Laura becomes so obsessed that she disregards nearly everyone and everything except the mystery, the nightmare, her father has left her."},{"Title":"Dreamhunter (The Dreamhunter Duet, Book 1)","review":"The Place is where dreamhunters go to find dreams. Dreams that are very different than the ones we have ourselves. These dreams can be shared and shown in a way similar to our movies.

Laura and her father are two of these people.When Laura's father, the first dreamhunter known to exist, disappears she has to follow a strange trail of clues to find out what he was working on. A trail that leads to many disturbing discoveries. Will she have to strength to carry on and follow in his footsteps, or will she instead choose to follow the status quo and let his knowledge disappear as he did?I found the story fascinating. There were so many different levels of relationships and personalities that were explored without making the characters overly complicated. The world was where the author lost me a little. There was so much that I just didn't understand. While it was all made clear as the story continued on, I feel like there were many things that I missed and would have understood or appreciated more had I known more about the world itself.

Not everyone can catch a dream, though, or even enter The Place. And the government regulates the country's dream resources and their stewards, the Dreamhunters, through rigorous oversight -- for the public good, of course.Dreamhunters make a good living chasing dreams or working with other dreamhunters to amplify their performances, but none are so famous as Tziga Hame, the original dreamhunter and discoverer of The Place.The story follows Hame's 15-year-old daughter, Laura, as she and her cousin, Rose, come of age to attempt their first Try as dreamhunters. Unfortunately, just before this important rite of passage, Laura's father's increasingly strange behavior culminates in his disappearance and presumed death. According to the government, Tziga was trying to cross The Place -- a dangerous and impossible journey. But Laura believes something more sinister is at work, and knows that she needs to become a dreamhunter herself to unravel the mysteries of her father's disappearance and the secret her family has kept for generations.I really enjoyed this imaginative story. It reminded me a bit of Libba Bray's Gemma Doyle series in its merging of fantasy and historical fiction, and I enjoyed the rich atmosphere Knox weaves throughout the tale. The behind-the-scenes political intrigue was wonderfully developed and added a lot of tension to the story, and a surprising sub-plot that I really enjoyed along with the more fantastic elements of the book.However, if Dreamhunter falls short in any area, it's in character development. I just couldn't bring myself to care much about Laura, the book's heroine. She is kind of flat throughout the tale, despite the fantastic situations she finds herself in. The supporting cast eclipses her throughout, and helps move the action of the story along much better than Laura herself.Overall, I liked Dreamhunter, but I can't say that I loved it. Something is missing that I just can't put my finger on. I hope that I'll find that missing magic in the book's companion novel, Dreamquake. (And some more answers about Nown... I am scratching my head over that mysterious plot point!)"},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"This has been my favorite book on Feng Shui, and I have read many of them!

I loved how it described exactly where each of the energy centers were in the home plus it gave so many wonderful ideas through the clear writing and beautiful photos of easy changes everyone can make to each room in the house for better energy flow! it basically made Feng Shui understandable for the average person. I am excited to give this book again to my friends and family as a Christmas gift as it has been updated with new information and has even more inspiring photos to try and emulate. The only thing I find hard is that I want my house to look EXACTLY like everything the book shows, and that's pretty much impossible!!

I found the 'take action now' summaries at the end of each section very helpful.This book inspired me to declutter a couple of ignored spaces in my house, paint my bathroom, and add a fountain to my fireplace mantle. In the short time since executing just a small percentage of the techniques suggested by the author, unexpected cash has appeared in my life and my fianc&eacute; has a job interview at a firm he has been wanted to work at for some time.

Now I am going to buy my own copy.This is a great guide that just makes sense, no matter what your metaphysical beliefs are.

The premise of the author is that you should love your living space and every (absolutely every!) thing in it. This book is a step by step guide to tackling your house (living space) one room at a time, to achieve the house of your dreams. It is also a very knowledgable and informative introduction into Feng Shui.

What I found, in the book, far exceeded my expectations as a new comer to Feng Shui. Jayme has found a way, in her book, to demonstrate the mindset of Feng Shui. She brings it to life and makes it easy for you to bring Feng Shui into your life. It's as if she is reaching out from the book to touch you. The book is very attractively put together, it is done with style and grace in the Feng Shui methodology. I recommend this book to beginner or veteran, it has an energy of it's own that reaches out and touches you. Every page unfolds to reveal a world that has been waiting for you.Natalie - A Feng Shui're for Life thanks to Jayme and her wonderful book. Spreading Pink Light to all."},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"You know how there are different denomination or sect for any given religion and people literally go to war over the differences? Well, the concept of feng shui has evolved from a very traditional practice to many semi-completely different contemporary derivations imbued with heavily Westernized new-age fantastical ideas. Practitioners of traditional feng shui will assert that contemporary Westernized versions are new age hocus-pocus while practitioners of contemporary Westernized feng shui will label traditionalists as believers of superstition. This book places emphasis on the latter.Putting away the new age-esque material aside, this book provides a great guide to maximizing space using decor and furniture arrangements for optimal sensory engagement and clutter reduction. Before relocating to our new apartment, our last apartment was cluttered with junk beyond recognition. It was on a main street facing traffic and noise pollution. Suffice to say, we were miserable. And our busy life style (school and work) did not alleviate our stress at all. The clutter was so bad that the only way to fix it was to move out and start fresh.When we relocated, I vowed to find a place that is more secluded and easier on the ears and that's what we found. But prior to moving in, I explored around for ideas on how to maximize interior space without cluttering as a mean to reduce stress and mitigate the tensions we've had when pressure rises (i.e. during finals/midterms). That's when I remembered the way of feng shui (my parents are old school practitioners of this). That's where this book came into being.I used the book to help organize our apartment base on the bagua room arrangements, color, elemental association and bagua-associated coordination. Not only does our new place feel much roomier, it is also a lot livelier (we place air purifying plants everywhere; i.e. corn plants, peace lilies, Boston ferns). We also placed aFluval Chi Aquarium Kit, 6.6-Gallonin our living room and the water flow interrupts the otherwise silent living room area, bringing forth a soothing sound of peace and tranquility. We also placed our turtles (we have two red eared sliders and two Russian tortoises) in the family room.Now I do not subscribe to the \\"new-age\\" attributes of Feng Shui like many others (e.g. hanging faceted crystal balls, lighting up incense and commanding evil spirits to depart, mentally cutting \\"umbilical cords\\" of stress causing agents [such as an event or a negative coworker]), but we've placed an Areca palm, a money tree, some lucky bamboo and golden Pothos around the wealth center (our bedroom). Many doors of opportunities opened into our life. I.e. plethora of high paying job offers weeks before graduation, bonuses, etc. Our stress level has decreased dramatically and also tension level during stressful times have all been diminished. Do I connect this directly to feng shui? Again, not me personally. I think these opportunities were a result of our hard work which prepared us for said opportunities and finally, us seizing opportunities as they become available. I bought this book solely for guidance to a clutter free life style and for examples of engaging interior arrangements. It gets a 4 stars because the ideas are effective so far and the photos in the book are gorgeous (it's hard to find a feng shui book with this level of color and photos).I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 star because the new-age material (e.g. thanking trees for their wisdom, wishing for a $20,000 pay raise, relinquishing your stress by \\"shooting it\\" with inner \\"pink light\\", commanding energy resonating from the past with incense to depart (i.e. previous owners of antiques, previous occupants of a housing), etc.) is extremely mind-numbingly cheesy. The book places heavy emphasis on the bagua map and feng shui \\"cures,\\" which ironically could end up cluttering your living space. But if you're into this kind of stuff, you'd be delighted."},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"I bought this book for fun. I just bought a new house and wanted to see how I could add a couple simple Feng Shui techniques to enhance it. The book is easy to read and understand. The author provides MANY PRACTICAL tips and ideas on how to enhance certain areas to enhance the energy there or to attract more positive energies. (Because, let's face it: At least in the eyes of a novice, Feng Shui is not always extremely practical.) Anyone looking for something insightful or looking to positively alter your life and surounding energies should take a peek at this book!"},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"I enjoyed reading Jayme Barrett's book on Feng Shui. As a student on interior design, I was interested in the design aspects of feng shui. As I read more of Jayme's book, I learned about the energy enhancing techniques for your home and office. I have tried some of the tips myself and have felt better about the place where I live."},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"For those out there like myself with a real suspicion of all things spiritual or energetic, this book will come as an enriching surprise. Jayme Barrett has managed to combine western practicality and style with the wisdom and tradition of this ancient art. Hundreds of beautiful photographs and illustrations vividly demonstrate the ease with which these life-changing ideas can be quickly implemented. I've applied many of these concepts to enhance my home, office and personal life, experiencing genuine positive change. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a life makeover. I loved this book!"},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"I really love the ideas in this book! I am a strong Christian, so some of the ideas are a little odd, but overall the book makes a lot of sense. Generally it will create negative energy if you stick your finger in an electrical outlet. A lot of the stuff is just common sense, but I really love the colors and the ideas they give on laying out rooms and putting your space together."},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"I have been buying feng shui books and studying the art for the past twenty years. However, now that Feng Shui Your Life has come into my life, I must say that this is, hands down, the best feng shui book ever.If you can purchase only one feng shui book, this is the one. I have even bought an extra copy to send to a friend in another state so he can re-energize his home. Jayme shares her vast knowledge in a way that is understandable and enjoyable and the photographs are yummy. And all without the woo-woo factor found is so many other books. We readers not only learn how to rearrange furniture and add cures, but also to shift our thinking to a more positive light. I loved her words regarding generousity -- we musn't forget to share our bounty regardless of our means. Thanks, Jayme for sharing your wealth with all of us."},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"I first borrowed this book from my local library and liked it so much I decided to purchase it for keeps.

The pictures are helpful, though i wish there were more pictures. Would recommend."},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"I've received my copies of Feng Shui Your Life other day. Yes, I said copies. Being familiar with the first edition, I was confident that not only I would love the new edition, but this is going to be my holiday/host gift this year. It's so much better than a bottle of wine. The reason I love this book is because whether you have 10 minutes to read or the whole day you always learn about feng shui and Yourself through the clearly written text and beautiful pictures. After reading, it gets you to make little everyday changes or gives you an awareness of the many ways to enhance your life and your surroundings without spending very much time or money. So I've decided to give this book to many of my friends, some may use it just as a lovely coffee table book but eventually they were delve into the book, then again and again."},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"Absolutely wonderful book for anyone who feels their life is too hectic. Much more than just \\"how to\\" feng shui, it shows you how to bring a sense of peace to your life."},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"This book is excellent! This is absolutely the best book on Feng Shui I've ever read! I implemented concepts from the book in my home and life bringing in numerous positive and harmonius changes. I also own a spa in Los Angeles and had the wonderful pleasure of a Feng Shui consultation with Jayme for my business. Since then the business has more than doubled and prosperity and abundance continue to flourish. The space flows with wonderful positive energy and looks beautiful. Jayme I cant thank you enough for all of the inspiration!I Highly recommend this book as well as a Feng Shui consultation with Jayme. It will change your life!"},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"I have just completed this fantastic book and am rereading it again! I have never received so much usable information before from any other feng shui book. The quality of the interior designs and photographs are excellent! This book has been sooo helpful and insightful, and not only does our home feel fabulous, but my husband and I do, too! We are now happier and more grateful for what we have, are completely focused on the careers & lifestyle we have been dreaming about for years, and making it happen on a daily basis. Incredible. It really has changed the way I view everything, and it has been the perfect spring cleaning instrument to help us improve & purify our lives. My family, friends and colleagues have remarked on how I am shining and I attribute it to Feng Shui. In fact, I tell everybody about this book, and a colleague is buying it for herself this weekend, as she wanted to take my book home with her. I won't let this book out of my sight. It's life-changing!"},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"This book truly encapsulates living within a positive environment. The author clearly and concisely explains in detail the ways you as a reader can enhance your space and your environment to better influence the energy around you. It is by no means mystical rather it is a practical explanation on how colors, plants, furniture placement, etc impact our daily moods. It is the type of book that when you're finished, a light bulb goes off and you think why didn't I do this earlier?! The pictures are rich in color and detail and are an excellent example of people who have applied the tactics of Feng Shui to their own homes. I picked this book up and read it cover to cover that day! I applied many of the tips and tricks and have experienced so many wonderful changes in my life since doing so. This book is invaluable when looking to make positive changes either as a fresh start, spring cleaning, moving, or just to enhance your space! I can't recommend this book enough!!!"},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"I have to admit it, I purchased this book mainly for the pictures. I find photos of well-laid-out rooms inspiring.

Oh, and the pictures lived up to my expectations as well!"},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"Jayme Barrett has written a book on feng shui that is highly informative, readable, easy to use, and beautiful to look at. This book absolutely helped me to change tracks. Just beginning to implement the suggestions in this book has resulted in increasing my energy and motivation as well as improving my overall mood. The book is filled with gorgeous photographs by Jonn Coolidge that beautifully illustrate the ideas presented by Jayme. It is a joy to read as well as to browse through the pictures. I've read the book several times now and have begun to suspect that I will have to buy a backup copy since I will probably wear this one out!"},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"Jayme Barrett's book is on my nightstand constantly and I pick it up frequently and re-read passages. I've made a number of changes according to the book's suggestions and have found my home and my life to be changed dramatically. I've also learned to become attuned to little \\"miracles\\" I had previously been ignoring.I don't know that moving things around will make you a millionaire, but you will certainly have the open-mindedness to recognize opportunities when they present themselves!It's about a peaceful existence and the ability to look inside yourself.Pink light!"},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"Finally, a Feng Shui book that is not only beautiful but practical. Feng Shui Your Life (Sterling, May 2003, $24.95) is probably the best book out there to give you not only a visual guide but also easy ways to energize your home or office.While the Author Jayme Barrett is billed as the \\"Feng Shui Consultant to the Stars\\" who has helped the rich and powerful of Beverly Hills, the book works off the principle that even the smallest d&eacute;cor budget can make some type of life changing living space enhancement.In fact, when I met Jayme during my most recent trip to Los Angeles, she told me \\"My motto is that you should love every single thing in your home. You are in control of your house, and you need to create an environment that you feel good in.\\"The book takes an easy, non-compass look at the bagua (the energy center locations). And, photographer Jonn Coolidge has taken breathtaking photos displayed throughout this comprehensive yet easy-read book.As a weekly columnist at www.terrawellington.com and the one and only Consumer Wellness Expert appearing on television, I highly recommend Jayme's book to better your life."},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"This book is an excellent beginner's guide to Feng Shui. It covers the bagua, and gives excellent tips on how to energize your space with things you already have. It also gives a basic space clearing technique. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"I bought this book because it has a 5 star rating. However this book does not even include the basic knowledge about Feng Shui. The author talks about how to make your life happier, how to help people around you. She also mentioned about painting your front door with red color is always good for everyone. It is not true. I found this book is misleading Feng Shui beginners."},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"I bought this book after looking at several feng shui books and after reading the 5 star reviews. It exceeded my expectations! The pictures are beautiful, the layout makes it refreshingly easy to read and overall, I've found the feng shui recommendations to be relatable and doable. I've already put many of them into use in my apartment and it feels/looks great! The author makes feng shui easy and the lifestyle tips offer a deeper understanding of how to create positive energy in your life, not just your living environment.

Oh my gosh, it works! I gladly decluttered the other feng shui books and that silly money toad, and follow Jayme's teaching exclusively. I am thrilled with the daily insights as well as the infusion of revitalizing energy in my life. This is one of those rare, truly life-transforming books, and I'm a five-star fan!

Feng Shui Your Life is an amazing gift to anyone who reads it."},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"I bought this for fun and because I was interested in a subject that was clearly popular. I study interior design and had read a little about Feng Shui and realized that I was half Feng Shuing without knowing it. Now, I draw the line at believing stuff like my good luck is going down the toilet if I flush without the lid down, but I do go along with the \\"no clutter\\" theory. The sound of bubbling water, tinkling of wind-chimes, natural plants, neatness, light-catching crystal, are all soothing elements in a room and this I had been doing before I heard the FS word. As for much of the rest, gimme a break! Buy the book for fun because it is full of excellent ideas and do what you will."},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"I bought this book with the sole intention of just feng-shuing my home, nothing more. I want it to look nice. HOWEVER, reading this book opened my eyes to not only myself and my own desires but to those of the people I love, the people I hate, and everyone in between. It Begins by describing the different types of feng shui and HOW they interconnect with your life. I was one of those that thought, \\"eh that's a load of bull\\" but Now Im one of those stopping within my thoughts and actions and thinking \\"is this good feng shui? will this make me happy? will this have positive or negative outcomes?\\" besides being one of those books that kicks you in the rear and motivates you to get up and clean, its also a very good self help book. who knew? Thanks to this book I find myself excited about every new day and WANTING to be a better person for my cherished ones and the not so cherished lol. A very akunamatata book XD (no worries for the rest of your days sort of phylosophy, c'mon! its from LION KING! XD) The book itself is very beautiful, John Coolidge did a fantastic jjob on the photography and it is def. a book worthy of displaying on your coffee table. You prob. wont put it away anyway, its addicting, and ul read it more than once, I assure you!"},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"This book is awesome! it assumes that the person has some understanding, no understanding, and a great deal of understanding all at the same time!(which i love!) meaning: it gives information to you in an educated way, it allows you to never feel lost or confused, but also helps to give you a detailed and thorough understanding of what Feng Shui is and how to \\"use\\" it. I love this book. i was nervous buying it because i was worried it was \\"all pictures and no debth\\" (like an elaborate home decorating book) but i was so wrong: it is so much better than that. and although it helps you to use it in very modern and practical ways it also gives you the deeper, middle-easter/asian roots of Feng Shui.honestly, if you're looking for a book to give you an educated presentation of WHAT Feng Shui is and HOW to use it, THIS is your book. PLUS it gives SOOOOOO many options and variation to each \\"arrangement\\" or direction. I don't regret buying this book at all. i'm going to keep it handy every time i think about changing my home lay-out or painting a new wall or buying a piece of furniture (or even so much as a frame), this book is awesome!"},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"I just started to invest my time into improving my Feng Shui. I needed a book with a balance of education as well as something I can implement quickly to see improvement.After about a month, I've had some good changes and insight. The book delivers some fundamental principles as well as some straight-forward tips. I use the book more as a reference guide. I can think about a certain room, then go to the chapter in the book for some ideas.I think a person needs to have a little budget and some time reserved in preparation for this book. I think this book is a game-changer, helps in every-way of life!"},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"Clear, direct and simple to implement into your home.

A total classic that you will refer to again and again."},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"I just finished reading Jayme's awesome book and I've been putting some of her suggestions to work in my new home. The book is so easy to follow and the advice is fabulous. Love the pictures, too. This book was recommended to me by a friend who has actually worked with Jayme, and she has implemented many of Jayme's recommendations. Whether you believe in the power of feng shui or not, there are some terrific ideas here. And for the record - since I've started making changes in my home, my real estate business has gone crazy! I am thankful for whatever power is making my business soar - and I'm banking on the fact that at least some of it is owing to my listening to Jayme!

Might be coincidence but a lot of the stuff has worked!"},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"I generally read up on Feng Shui right before I move into a new place so I can figure out where to put my furniture and other belongings for the best flow of chi. I borrowed this book from the library and I love it! I definitely want to buy it and keep it for future reference.It's written in a way that clearly explains why you want to do certain things. It also explains that the basic principles of Feng Shui just make sense - clearing clutter and keeping only the things that you love and that bring a smile to your face aren't just mystical Chinese practices, they are beneficial to many areas of your life, even if you don't believe in Feng Shui.It comes with gorgeous pictures of different rooms that exhibit proper Feng Shui. It always helps to see this stuff in real life situations.But it also goes beyond just your home and office - it also explains how to, as the book is called, Feng Shui your life. I really feel that if I put into practice some of the suggestions put forth in this book, I will feel a lot healthier and happier.I would definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"Purchased this book for a daughter who is getting ready to redecorate. She is planning on going with oriental/contemporay and thought she might like this book. When I got it in I browsed then read. I just loved it. Very well written, the author explains theory, practicality and organizational attributes of Feng Shui. Not just for oriental decorating style. I applied the principals to my work space at the office and was amazed. It made a very organized peaceful environment. Would definitly recommend to anyone whether your re-decorating, re organizeing or just shoving some furniture around."},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"One of my best friends bought me this book after I sent her Jayme's online newsletter...pretty powerful newsletter, I'd say! I read this book daily now and cannot believe the content and context of the information it constantly imparts to me; it is enjoyable beyond what I could have believed. Every paragraph has so far resonated with me and is the direction I have been wanting to go; and now I know I have a scout who has gone out there and blazed this trail and come back inside to write about it! This is a generous woman! Having met Jayme at several yoga studio events, I know Jayme lives what she writes and has an energy of such integrity around her. For me, that counts for everything. The cleanliness, clarity, strength and beauty of this writing portrays who Jayme is, and I can't say enough about that level and depth of life. It is awesome to find it outside of oneself on the pages of a book as grande as this beautiful book is. She has excellent taste in real life (by the choices of her teachers and masters), in my opinion, and I am happy to turn the pages of this book slowly and deliberately and find support on \\"how to do a life well lived\\". This is the perfect book for me. Having just bought a new space in L.A., I will use this book to go forward on discovering who the new me is! Thank you, J.

Maybe she can do a followup with more beautiful pictures. The thing about this book is that it is so timeless. I can't imagine any of the rooms pictured looking dated any time in the near future!All of her designs represent a feeling of peace, tranquility and calm. I sometimes see a book on home decor and when I see the copyright date think it is probably outdated and in many cases they are. The fact that it is based on the subject of Feng Shui means that it also addresses keeping your space clean and clutter free (very inspirational).Did I mention - not becoming outdated?!

I also found much of it superstitious nonsense - this book would have you hang crystals in doorways, hallways and 'a wind chime over your head while you stand at the stove to call in prosperity energy' (P219).

Caution is required when the author moves into broader esoteric topics thatare not her core area of expertise. For example when she talks about how other people can deplete your energy, she recommends \\"cutting the cord\\" as an exercise and suggests imagining a Samurai sword severing your link to the other person. This could be much too consequential, depending on the situation. If it is a friend or relative who is only temporarily exhausting you by their neediness, you will not want to do anything so drastic. It would be much better to imagine \\"unplugging\\" an energy cord temporarily to stop an excessive one-way flow of your energy to them. Then whenever you like, you can plug it back in and reconnect.I feel that the author would better have stayed with her core topic of home design and not recommended deep psychic exercises, of which she has a much more superficial understanding. At least she should not recommend them in such a decisive and authoritative way."},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"I love this book. It's a good coffee table book that my friends have liked flipping through.

There are plenty of ideas to bring order into your house, without looking crazy! I also would recommend Clearing Your Clutter with Feng Shui by Karen Kingston.

Not only is this book a beautiful collection of transforming one's entire life, but the emphasis on the home is what called to me. Teaching yoga, I already know how people's bodies change with dedication, committment, and movement. But, upon putting to use even a few of Jayme's concepts, my and my wife's life has moved in external ways. After cultivating our \\"Wealth & Prosperity\\" center, I was paid handsomely to shoot & lead a yoga video... something I've never done. And the following week, when fitting our \\"Career\\" center with a fountain, candles, and making that space in our apartment feng shui'd, my wife was offered an opportunity to sing, (her creative talent), with a band that she loves. Two huge shifts in our lives. We're definately continuing to develop the other 7 centers of our home.... and see what happens next. I highly recommend this book, (and yoga - shameless plug for yoga), to create energetic breakthroughs. AND it's beautifully written, photographed, and packaged."},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"This is a beautiful book...it really is...the pictures themselves are totally and completely inspiring and worth the price of the book alone!I got this book because I do believe that Energy is everything and everything is Energy and your home is a reflection of that One Energy. Is your house full of old clutter? It could be a reflection of the old emotional clutter you keep inside...is your house nice and perfect? You could be controlling and rigid in your approach to life.I grew up in a house that was almost like a museum. It was filled with all sorts of pretty things, beautiful things, expensive things but we weren't allowed to touch anything. Sitting on the raw silk couches was especially forbidden unless there was company. This was all my dad's doing. In fact, when my mom was alive, our home was always a little bit on the bohemian side of things; a planter made out of an old coffee can, brightly colored throw rugs on hardwood floors, original artwork done by yours truly matted and framed by my mother, plates that didn't match around an old wooden table my dad had built with chairs found here and there. It was an odd, delightful mix but our home always felt cheerful and relaxing.After my mom passed away, my dad threw out all this stuff that he now called \\"junk\\" and replaced it with Queen Anne furniture and Ethan Allen couches and replicas of famous art pieces. Sure, the end effect was beautiful...but it wasn't approachable...it was kind of like my relationship with my dad.When I got my own place, an excessively large master bedroom I rented from a delightful couple, I returned to the Bohemian way of life. An old couch with a Indian Tapestry thrown on top, a repainted corner bookcase my grandpa had made back in the early 40s, a persian rug rolled up and found in the corner of my dad's garage and odds and ends furniture that I found at garage sales and in dumpsters all cleaned and repainted. I think I decorated my entire place for about $112.78 but that little room felt much larger than it actually was because into each and every corner of that place, I put my soul into it. My intention behind everything was the intention of Peace and yes, the energy was high and it was healing and it was place for my spirit to grow wings and learn to fly all on its own. Everyone who entered my space/my place immediately felt a sense of whimisical calm and mystical joy.(At least, that's what I felt every time I entered.)My current home is also very ecclectic. Sometimes I am a bit obsessive about the amount of clutter that goes on in the house because my wife likes to keep things and to be fair, so do I...but does she really need that birthday card she got when she turned seven? So I turn it into a piece of art so it's not just sitting in a box. We try our best to follow the guidelines of this book but in many ways we just follow the guidelines of our own soul and our life has improved in many wonderful ways.There are a lot of people who debunk this philosophy of Feng Shui, but I believe everything is a reflection of who you really are inside...EVERYTHING...every piece of clothing you own, every book you read, every song you listen to is somehow a reflection of what is in your consciousness and we all know that it is your consciousness that determines the direction of your life.At least I pray to the bronze statue of Buddha in my living room that we do...So go get yourself a fountain, a nice green leafy plant, and a little statue of your favorite Deity and start making your house a place of healing/revealing space/place.Peace and Blessings."},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"I've read myriad Feng Shui books over the years, but never one as clear, compelling, and truly motivational and spiritual as this one.Many feng shui books get caught up in what I think of as the excessive elements of feng shui - or the marketable ones. You won't find many three footed toads or alignment of wind chimes in here. What you will find is solid, sane advice for making your home - and your soul - better places to live.I have copied out segments of this book and hung them around my house as inspirations, and this is the one book that I return to again and again.This is a beautiful book; beautiful to look at, beautiful to read, and powerful to follow. It doesn't &quot;should&quot; - it asks questions and thoughtfully suggests alternative ways of clearing the meaningless junk from your home, life, and spirit."},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"I realize that I'm going against the flow here, but I found this book disappointing. The author likes a kind of design of interiors which is linear and modern. I have nothing against that. What I don't agree about, is that the author tries to convey the message \\"My own style IS FENG SHUI\\". No, that's wrong!For example, the author clearly advises against clutter. Well, I have seen unpleasantly cluttered, messy homes and I have seen \\"cluttered\\" homes with a great deal of personality and wellcoming, positive energy. I dislike messy homes, but TO ME, the auhtor's style is exceedingly dry, so dry in fact that it reminds me the rooms of an elegant hospital. There is a picture (repeated in the back cover) of a foyer with blaze orange raincoats hanging from a rack along with blaze orange ... binoculars. To my own personal taste that's Kitch, man! The book reflects a manichaean approach all along, and it reaches the very bottom where plants are listed for being 1) good for feng shui 2) bad for feng shui. This is ridiculous (incidentally, no explanations are provided). Among the plants that supposedly are bad, there are bromeliads and cacti.The truth is that feng shui arises from an intricate interaction between the outdoor space, the indoor space, and the people who live in there. It's a matter of harmony, sacredness and intention. I was grown with very ancient furnitures and lots of plants of any kind in my parents' home: if you put me in the author's space, I'll get sick (and the other way around, probably). \\"Creating Sacred Space With Feng Shui\\" by Karen Kingston undertakes a much better approach because it favors the idea that the people who live the space should do a lot of thinking and work hard to create the conditions for feng shui. What I see in this book is the author's personal opinion of the \\"ideal\\" interiors dressed up with a little bit of cheap, cheasy, new age."},{"Title":"Feng Shui Your Life","review":"I could not put this book down!!

It's rough and ready and merely an attempt to express the argument's gist. Of course - to state the obvious - to appreciate its true probative force (such as it is), one really needs either to read his book or at least a detailed article written by Miller himself. After all, he's the best one to know what he's up to - relying exclusively on someone else's summary nearly always evinces the pitfalls involved with second-hand testimony.- The general idea is to find an argument against the claim that Fido's existing is a brute fact, without relying on any *metaphysical* principle of causality or sufficient reason. Miller thinks he has found one, and it's something like this:(1) Fido is a \`constituent' of Fido's existing. [By \`constituent' of a given ontological whole he means those \`parts' of said whole that need to be recognized under pain of not knowing what the whole is in itself (as opposed to knowing it simply in relation to something else). So he's saying that it's impossible to know what Fido's existing is in itself without recognizing two distinct parts, Fido and his existence.](2) Since Fido is a \`constituent' of Fido's existing, Fido must be able to \`complete' his existence. [Miller spends a long time attempting to explain and demonstrate the meaning and truth of his notion of a subject completing one of its property instances. He also spends a great deal of time arguing that existence can be a property instance. I won't provide either of those arguments here, but suffice to say that according to Miller property instances are in themselves incomplete entities, i.e. they metaphysically require some other entity. For a subject to \`complete' its property instance is for the subject to individuate and make obtain said property instance (which is in itself nothing but a kind of \`pattern' of the ontological whole).](3) In order to complete one's existence, one must be conceivable irrespective of existing at all.(4) Fido must be conceivable irrespective of existing at all. (2,3)(5) But Fido is absolutely inconceivable prior to his existing. [This premise is the result of another long chapter and appendix of argumentation.](6) Since (4) and (5) appear to contradict one another (or at least are in some sort of tension -- a tension that most thinkers would want resolved, irrespective of their views on the principle of sufficient reason and such), some explanation is necessary as to how both can be true. Specifically, it's appropriate to demand that there be something (used widely to include any type of entity) in virtue of which Fido is able to complete his existence irrespective of his existing.(7) Fido does not complete his existence in virtue of his existing, taken as a whole [By definition of \`constituent', Fido's existing is completely derivative on its constituent parts. If Fido's existing accounted for Fido's completing his property instance of existence, then, according to the argument Miller elaborates (not provided here), Fido would no longer be a constituent of his existing, contra (1).](8) Fido does not complete his existence in virtue of any his property instances, including the property instance of existence. [The idea here is that, since the subject is logically prior to any of its property instances, none of its property instances are even \\"around\\" to explain anything until logically after the subject has already completed them - which is, of course, too late.](9) Fido does not complete his existence in virtue of himself qua concrete individual subject. [This premise, for better or worse, is pretty much exclusively based on the idea that if Fido could complete his existence in virtue of himself qua concrete individual (i.e., abstracting from its existence) Fido ought to have been conceivable even prior to existing. Though I think Miller is especially weak on this point, the gist of the argument goes something like this:(a) Ability to complete one's property instancesentails being conceivable irrespective ofexisting - from (3).(b) If Fido completes his property instancespurely in virtue of what he is apart fromexisting (namely, in virtue of being a concreteindividual), he ought to have been conceivableeven temporally prior to existing.(c) But this isn't the case, given (5).](10) Fido's ability to complete his existence must be in virtue of something else other than himself (abstracting from his existence), his existence or any other property instance (abstracting from Fido), or his existing (taken as a whole). [From (5), (6), (7) (8)]. Let this \`something else' be a.That's the first part of the argument. Miller then notes that, if a must also complete its existence, the same question will need to be raised about a as was raised about Fido.Predictably, the second part of Miller's work is to argue against the possibility of infinite regress. (From here on in the argument is familiar in form to the classical contingency model, but the arguments he adduces are somewhat different and certainly more analytic in _expression.)After arguing against infinite regress, Miller speaks about the first thing in the finite chain of explanation (call it m*); he probes what m* must be like to avoid being subject to the same questions as above. He submits that this can only be if there isn't any such thing as m* having to complete its existence. From this he concludes that, in some sense (analogous, not univocal), there is no distinction between m* and its property instance of existence, i.e., m* is \\"Subsistent Existence\\" (ala Aquinas). He then goes on to discuss what the notion of Subsistent Existence entails, its relationship to everything else, etc.Anyway, for whatever its worth, this is this bumbling philosopher's \\"shooting at the hip\\" attempt to explain Miller's argument for God. Do I think that the argument is ultimately successful? I'm up in the air. I suspect that he is on to something (something true), but I'm unable to pin down exactly what that is, and I certainly do have reservations about certain aspects of the argument (e.g. premises 6 and 9). In any case, he goes further than a lot of contingency theorists in attempting to establish an argument that has probative force and is not as metaphysically committed. Whether he succeeds in this earnest endeavor is another question. Nevertheless, for those who enjoy reading arguments for God's existence, I can't imagine why Miller's work would be any exception."},{"Title":"J.K.

Lasser's New Tax Law Simplified","review":"I found this little book an incredible resource. I always get the Lasser tax guide when I file, but with all the changes in the tax laws I also wanted a simple, short, easy to understand explanation of everything and this is it--It tells you the new law, explains it in language you can understand, then gives examples of how it is applied, with tips on using it. I am not an accountant, and have always dreaded the thought of wading through tax books to find extra deductions but this was easy to do, and maybe because it was written by the same people, but I found this and the Lasser Your Income Tax complemented each other well--it made for easy reference back and forth."},{"Title":"Rivers of the Black Moon","review":"Although I was blasted out of the AOL book nook for likingthis book, I really did. It was very fast-paced andentertaining, another take on the old conspiracy theorywith regard to the development and proliferation of AIDSand HIV. Hints of a new strain. An unscrupulous drugcompany (is there any other kind in fiction) and amanical self-promoter conspire to present the world witha vaccine that DOES NOT WORK, and in fact, may be worsethan the disease. Of course a romance between the murdereddoctor's old girlfriend and the detective from ScotlandYard is thrown in for good measure. For someone off women,he is certainly fixated on sleeping with her. The editingis quite sloppy, the publisher could have put the bookon better paper and hired someone to tighten up the ramblings,but it was escapist medical thriller action all the wayto the surprises at the end."},{"Title":"Rivers of the Black Moon","review":"This book is virtually impossible to find. The publisher has been out of stock for years, yeah right. Why was this PULLED from the market? Think you can find this book somewhere? I bet you can't."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"This book is an outstanding review source for people who have studied Spanish in the past and haven't used the language for many years. The book is a five-star book, and it's condition (which was described as \\"good\\") is also five stars."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"I am currently 4 chapters into this review book, which has already helped to give me better clarity on some of the basic lessons that I have been taking for granted. I took all the Spanish classes available in high school (about 6 years ago), but after that I never had any structure for learning more Spanish, and my exposure came from Spanish-speaking co-workers who would teach me words and phrases to use at work.I wanted to ramp up my Spanish skills, so I bought this guide after reading the positive reviews about it. And while it did take some time before I was actually willing to sit down and begin my self-teaching lessons, I can already tell this review will be an indispensable tool for my goal of Spanish mastery.Each chapter begins with a review of the subject - present tense verbs, ser/estar, etc - and then presents a number of critical exercises which gradually become more difficult. The instructions for the exercises are in Spanish, which serves to get you in the mindset, but would not be appropriate for novice Spanish speakers. You can definitely see how the lessons build on each other and the exercise are varied enough to maintain engagement. One of the best exercises in my opinion is translating English sentences into Spanish - after just conjugating verbs and filling in blank spaces, these fully-formed sentences really drive home the point of mastering Spanish conversation. The overall tone of the book is mature, and I feel like I would actually use the phrases I'm picking up. Additionally, there are cultural notes (in Spanish, of course), paragraphs that give some insight into things like El Prado Museum in Spain or lunch/dinner customs in Latin America.I would recommend this guide to anyone who has taken Intermediate Spanish and would like to solidify their skills outside of a classroom."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"I agree with the positive reviews already posted here. This is precisely what I was looking for, as an intermediate Spanish speaker who got a minor in Spanish back in college (10+ years ago), and needed a systematic way to get back up to speed. What a great resource!"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"This is \\"the\\" book to get for learning Spanish. Difficult for the early learner, however perfect for pushing learning to the limit."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"This book is alright, but buyers take note...this is NOT a book for beginners. It's got some really tricky stuff in here with verbs etc. Good review for the 2nd year student maybe?"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"This is a very good review book. You can do the exercises andthen check your answers with the key in the back."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"I bought 10 of these books and they all fell apart within 1 month of gentle use. POS. The content is ok, but the quality is absent entirely."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"The book is very easy to use and is great for someone who has learned it and needs to review. I've used the CD-ROM to practice and it's helped my Spanish tremendously."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication helps make making the time to practice and improve my grammar skills easier."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"I'm very glad I purchased this book. Although I'm more than a beginner and the first several chapters are too simple for me, I find the book invaluable none the less. I especially like the answers to the practice questions in the back of the book! Seeing the answers prevents a lot of frustration. This book is for those who practice on their own, but also has a tremendous value to teachers, students and home-schoolers especially with 'Nota Cultural' (cultural notes) and vocabulary spread generously throughout the book. I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"As an adult learner of Spanish I am finding this book to be a challenge, with a variety of activities which require you to think beyond just the conjugation of the verb, for example. I recommend it for those who have several semesters of Spanish and/or a basic understanding of grammar but who are finding it hard to use the language creatively or with confidence."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"I needed something tht would prepare me for a Spanish exam and ordered several books just to play it safe. As it turns out, The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice by Ronni L Gordon proved to be the only book I needed. It contained everything I needed to brush up on my Spanish, reading, grammer, and even practice lessons to reinforce what was learned. The formatting was great because I also learned numerous facts that I would not have had the opportunity to discover otherwise."}]`),A={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],M={key:0},j={key:1};function L(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",H,[(e(!0),t(m,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,y)=>(e(),w(c,{key:y,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",j,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",M,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const D=d(A,[["render",L],["__scopeId","data-v-dca9bac7"]]),q=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/60.md","filePath":"people/60.md"}'),F={name:"people/60.md"},W=Object.assign(F,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(D)]))}});export{q as __pageData,W as default};
