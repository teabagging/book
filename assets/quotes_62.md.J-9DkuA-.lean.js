How do you think I felt reading VB&amp;B?It has felt like I've been transported into Isabella &amp; Luigi's life in this hilltop town.I feel like part of the family.She has written such a strong account of their Tuscan experience that I feel as if I've been there to share it all with them.Not only is it beautifully written but also wonderfully illustrated.Can't wait to return to Italy and to meet the &quot;family &quot; in Montalcino!"},{"Title":"Vanilla Beans & Brodo: Real Life in the Hills of Tuscany","review":"Wow ! What a terrific perception into the real life of the charming wine village of Montalcino. This book really spoke to me. Isabella Dusi has a style that makes you feel as if you are actually there meeting and interacting with the local villagers.Although I have traveled in Italy many times, including two visits to Montalcino, I never really understood the mindset of the typical Tuscan hill town native until I was enlightened thru the eyes of this transplanted Aussie who has lived among them for the past six years. If you love Italia, and especially Tuscany, you have to read this book.

Having been gripped by what I was reading I made my party of 7 travel to Montalcino for the day to experience it for themselves. Isabella made me want to be a part of the village &amp; to meet the characters who are the mainstays of the book. It is a combination of the day to day adventures of the many friends that Isabella &amp; her husband have made since moving to Montalcino, a history of the village itself and a handbook for anyone who wants to explore Montalcino. The book takes you through the different seasons in a year of village life, and includes wonderfully evocative descriptions of some of the annual events that take place. These are so well written that you actually feel as if you are experiencing them for yourself along with the author, and in fact that is exactly what my family hope to do as we intend to travel to Montalcino again. I highly recommend this book as not only is it one of the best books I have read in a long time, but it made me feel such a part of Montalcino that I have now taken up honorary membership of one of the quarters of the village."},{"Title":"Vanilla Beans & Brodo: Real Life in the Hills of Tuscany","review":"Having bought this book on a whim because it seemed to have something to do with Italy, I became utterly absorbed in it by the end of the first chapter.The book tells of a year in the life of an Italian hilltop village.By the end of the year the reader knows of many of the colourful characters who live in the town today, as well as the cultural traditions and festivals which are celebrated much as they were several centuries ago.The competitiveness between the four quarters of the town in the archery and the football competitions is riveting, but the most delightful part of the book for me was the descriptions of the food, and the pleasure with which the Montalcinese people prepare their food which really gave me the most pleasure.An unexpectedly wonderful read, and one which I would recommend to anyone who loves Italy, travelling, food, or all three."},{"Title":"Make Your Watercolors Look Professional","review":"Carole Katchen researched the advice of a handful of specific professional watercolor painters of varying styles and analyzed their similarities and differences in regards to subject choice, paint application, color choices, mood, preplanning, tricks of the trade or absence thereof...etc.The book is not for the absolute beginner, I think, because slightly more advanced terminology is used to describe their techniques...nothing more scary than \\"glazing,\\" \\"wet into wet,\\" \\"charging,\\" and so forth. It does assume knowledge of those types of things and does not explain them further than the term.This book clarified, in some instances, that there is no ONE way to do things. Each professional painter attacked their painting order completely differently.It was also shown clearly, however, that there are common threads and actions taken by professionals that set their work apart from the pack.Without giving away all, some are:First, simplifying into overall larger shapes and identifying focal point.using boldness, instead of weak, tentative strokes trademark of a beginnerestablising eye movement through the paintingunity and contrast in balance for best impactusing value, intensity and hue to enhance lightemphasizing focal point by giving it the greatest color or value contrastThis list just tells the summary, the book explains each of these and many, many more with great samples and specific techniques of how each artist accomplishes this.There are also multitudes of interesting tips and actual demos that are unique to each individual artist, too."},{"Title":"Make Your Watercolors Look Professional","review":"This is a Great Book ...filled with lots of Information to expand your Watercolor Journey!

I picked this volume off the shelves because the title sounded interesting. At the time, I did not realize that this book is a classic in the field of social science.When it was published in the 1940s, it was one of the very first attempts to apply the techniques of modern social research to an American subculture--in this case, to the inhabitants of a poor Italian neighborhood in a large, unspecified northeastern city (Boston). Up to that time, social scientists generally studied the U.S. society as a whole--while it was considered standard practice for Margaret Meade to journey to an island in the South Pacific to study the sexual mores of neolithic villagers, the prospect of Mr. Whyte going across town to concentrate his study on the social, educational, and vocational development of the sons and daughters of immigrants was revolutionary in the early 1940s. Whyte buried himself in the work, to the extent of moving in to an apartment in the neighborhood and learning to speak fluent Italian.This book is a blueprint for how social research on a subculture should be done. If it, at times, seems plodding and stilted to twenty first century readers, that is because it represents a prototype for a sort of study that has been replicated and perfected through these past sixty years.The book represents a look at a segment of American society, as it existed at a specific point in history (the tail end of the depression)--much of the society Whyte studied had already changed by the time the book saw print (by 1943, one must assume that most of the young men profiled in the study were in uniform), however that is true to some extent of all social research."},{"Title":"Street Corner Society; The Social Structure of an Italian Slum","review":"The book was a great price and in pretty good condition.

As with any new friends who have just met, the two begin to learn things about each other -- what they like to eat, and whether or not they like to be in water. Once they've compared a few differences, it's time for fun. Should they play hide-and-seek or find-and-eat? How about pin-the-tail-on-the-turtle? And just what is Fuzz hiding under the pointed leaf? Before the book is over, they discover that they have at least one common interest. That's all their friendship needs to keep it going.Lisa McCue's illustrations are wonderful and perfectly fit the playful mood of the storyline. Her depictions are reminiscent of the classics done by Garth Williams, as two-dimensional animal fur looks soft enough to touch. And author Dori Chaconas has thoughtfully chosen two main character critters that many people cannot tell apart. Therein lies the teachable moment.Here's hoping for much success as this episode launches a new series.

Disappointing."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"Unlike many who have \\"reviewed\\" this book, I've actually read it. Some have called it a right-wing screed and taken Flynn to task for not denouncing people like McVeigh. Understand that Flynn is explaining why some will grasp onto an idea, regardless of its factual integrity, and promote it. These are not ignorant folks, but well-educated professionals and educators. \\"Ideology trumps all\\" is his thesis.I'm sure someone else could take some right-wing ideological tenets and do the same thing, but they haven't.If you read this with an open mind, and disregard your own biases, it may allow you to take a fresh look at some of your own opinions. In the chapters dealing with Animal Rights and Environmentalism, Flynn makes a good argument that people blinded by ideology have actually caused more pernicious problems by \\"solving\\" a simpler one through their efforts. What he points out is how ideology becomes an overpowering force in some people's lives, and that is something we should all consider."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"Ideology is at odds with logic and consistency because logic and consistency require that, occasionally, a sacred cow must perish. Ideology and its adherents require that those loyal to the cause never stray; fundamentalist religion and followers of a particular ideology can be said to suffer from the same myopic affliction. Thus, what we have in Daniel Flynn's Intellectual Morons is an exploration of how otherwise intelligent people-mainly Howard Zinn, Noam Chomsky, and other intellectual luminaries of the left-have jettisoned the principles of logic and intellectual rigor in favor of chicanery, deceit, and manipulation to further their political agendas.The premise for the book is promising, and, in some of the chapters (each of which chapter is devoted to a particular \`intellectual moron' and his or her adherents) Flynn succeeds at this admittedly ambitious goal. For instance, the first chapter on Herbert Marcuse is generally excellent (though it too has its flaws); Lynn eviscerates the idea that Marcuse's obscurantist prose contained worthwhile ideas. Rather he compares Marcuse's often contradictory and perplexing phrases to that of Orwell's Newspeak in 1984 (\\"Ignorance is Strength,\\" etc.) Unfortunately, this effort is inconsistent throughout the book, and some of the claims Flynn makes are bizarre, unsubstantiated, or just plain vicious in their nature.Flynn believes that Marcuse's writing leads to the logical consequence of courts' upholding gay marriage, Clinton's lechery, Madonna, Christina Aguilera, and Britney Spears (page 21 of the hardcover edition). It is not clear how this follows; certainly, if we are to adduce causes for these pop culture phenomena we can point to many strains of thought over the past 100 years that have allowed vapidity to flourish. On the next page (page 22), Flynn, in a footnote, bizarrely refers to the movie The Hours as a \\"boring feminist film\\" when the film was neither, unless by \`boring' is meant it was not a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, and by \`feminist' is meant that most of its stars were women.Further examples abound, all of which are to the detriment of Flynn's overarching thesis that the intellectual left is bereft of cogency and a commitment to an objective standard of truth. To wit: on page 34, he cites as an inevitable consequence of Alfred Kinsey the playing of music videos on MTV that resemble \\"soft-core porn.\\" When was the last time MTV played music videos? The nineteen-eighties? So why does Flynn mention Aguilera and Spears as the soft-core porn stars?On page 39, he relates the story of Alfred Kinsey mutilating his genitals, and offers as the explanation for this act merely that Kinsey was perverse and repulsive; he refuses to explore the possibility that Kinsey's homosexuality caused him distress and that his genital mutilation was an attempt at a kind of self-flagellation. This is a path of inquiry that is at once obvious and worth pursuing. It certainly would not be the first time that someone shamed about their sexuality or sexual proclivities attempted self-mutilation.Page 102: \\"According to [Howard] Zinn, [Christopher Columbus] and those who followed him to the New World ventured for one reason: profit.\\" This isn't news; it's well established that Columbus convinced Ferdinand & Isabella to finance his voyage with the promise of jewels and gold and silver for Spain's empire. Indeed, the whole of the mercantilist economy that developed when the new world was discovered depended on the assumption that exploration was undertaken for purposes of earning a profit. Flynn argues that Zinn reduces everything to economics; if it happened in history, Flynn says, Zinn believes it has a profit motive. While this may be a stretch, and Flynn is correct to point out that Zinn has an unhealthy obsession with trying to point out the alleged evils of capitalism, it does not follow from this that Zinn is incorrect in claiming that Columbus had money on his mind when he proposed his voyage.These criticisms are a shame because his book attempts to highlight a very important fact that most other commentators conveniently ignore: much of what passes as intellectual conversation and inquiry among the political left these days (as well as the reactionary right) is ideological in nature and not really intellectual. Most of it is artifice, some of it is conjecture, and all of it ignores the inconvenient reality that, as Lynn notes at the end of his book, ideas have consequences. Lynn makes the point that Marx's publication of Das Kapital presaged the death of 100 million people in the twentieth century. He implies that we ought to ask what will the consequences of some of the more outlandish ideas proffered by today's intellectuals be?"},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"Unlike other \\"reviewers\\" I did read the book. Flynn, through several vignettes, tries to explain modern American culture through the prism of \\"intellectuals\\" whose ideas affected our society. The author makes 3 salient points that bear repeating: With the decline of religion, intellectuals increasingly turned to ideology for meaning, the core of ideology is political and, most importantly, ideology values ideas over people.The first chapter brilliantly summarizes Marcuse and \\"Cultural\\" Marxism wherein every facet of human existence is politicized. His ideas permeated our culture - from \\"diversity\\" wherein the Left was supported and the Right silenced, to identify politics (gay/ethnic/gender group rights) to victimization to anti-Western bias to a redefinition of education. He had particular disdain for old-fashioned liberals like Hubert Humphrey. He was astute, though, in recognizing that the common worker would never accept his ideas and therefore must be \\"forced\\" to be free.Elements of violence and authoritarianism are present in all these groups; the \\"truth\\" must prevail and violence is necessary for the greater good. This explains the perplexing notion of \\"liberals\\" praising despots whole first act would be silencing them or of commentators praising Arafat while condemning Israel. Each ideology seeks Utopia - from an (ir)rational Randian world to Strauss's American Empire to a primitive garden of Eden where humans live in peace with nature and its creatures and have sex without consequences or emotion.The article on Chomsky and his continual excuses/espousing of various events (to this day he denies the Kymer Rouge killed millions of Cambodians) was another tour de force. He emphasizes that the mjority of those in non-academic studies (identity politics) drift into three major areas: Academia, politics and the media."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"Flynn writes well and unlike many other polemicists, bases his arguments on stacks of verifiable facts. This hooked me early on and I read the whole book in one go.The introduction alone is worth the price of admission. To an alarming extent people do believe what they read in the papers, and, worse, they believe demagogues and gurus. People love to find heroes and to give up the effort of thinking for themselves.The chapters on Kinsey and Sanger were particularly powerful. In parts they were actually hard to read because of extent of the misdeeds of these people. It's really important that more of this stuff is in the public domain because of the glib treatment afforded many of these types.Two caveats.First, Flynn often moves from fact-based, reasonable argument to more fanciful hypotheses, but states these as fact without really backing them up. According to Flynn, Kinsey is responsible for initiating the largely damaging changes in sexual behavior following his reports and the remarkably fawning coverage by much of the press. That might be an idea worth exploring, but there isn't much to go on in the book itself.Second, it's a terrible pity that a writer with a mind as acute as Flynn's cannot turn his scrutiny on conservative ideologues. I wonder if he is a bit torn here. On pages 82-83 of the book he describes the recent civil war in Guatemala at some length. This began with a US-backed military coup which replaced a democratically-elected left winger with links to communism, with a brutal military dictator (\\"the man the Americans helped install\\"). Large-scale atrocities ensued, committed by the guerrillas but also by the US-backed government. Many other conservative writers would avoid covering this because some of the content conflicts with their own ideology about the nature of America and it's to Flynn's credit that US involvement is covered here. But the section is written with uncharacteristically euphemistic and passion-free prose. The moral comment present in most of the rest of the book is missing here. I just wish that some of the people who pointed this out, like Chomsky (who certainly does have a tedious 'reflexive anti-Americanism' among his flaws), could be a bit more of a balanced treatment.But to sum up, this is a book that stands above most of the polemics I've read recently and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"I'd never read this author until I saw this book and, intrigued by the title (honestly!), I decided to browse. Several hours later, I was on chapter 4 and cloud 9: this guy can write, and it makes sense! The style is approachable and the points are (almost) un-impeachable: ideology will lead you down the wrong path everytime and I daresay there's not much I can find wrong with his assertions.He describes ideologues as falling into several categories, with Joiners being the largest: those poor souls who heedlessly and unthinkingly swallow then regurgitate (usually in the form of bumper stickers and protest signs accompanied by the Banshee screams of the self-righteous) whatever their trend of choice is, from Abortion Rights to Hyper-environmentalism, take your pick.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"Flynn makes his points with a jackhammer, pounding away at the air-brushed life stories and reputations of sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, guru Herbert Marcuse, sex-crazed Margaret Sanger, femiminism's Betty Friedan, the environment's worst forecaster (Paul Ehrlich), 'ethicist' Peter Singer, historian Howard Zinn, libertarin Ayn Rand, black leader W.E.B. DuBois, activist Noam Chomsky, and others. Flynn is critical and uncompromising. He takes on ideologues from all walks of life, revealing lies, uncovering hidden facts, and putting a bright light on shady writings and biographies. His critique of Kinsey (Chapter 2: How a pervert launched a sexual revelution) is by itself worth the price of the book. Most troubling is how -- unexamined -- many of these lies and misleads have been institutionalized rather than examined. And some of these miscreants have been lionized or canonized rather than critiqued.Above all, Flynn is interested in the triumph of truth over ideology. He laments the concern of the joiner (\\"Will it serve my cause?\\") and says, \\"We would all be better off if we approached untested assertions by instead asking ourselves, 'Is it true?'\\" Flynn closes by citing one of Abraham Lincoln's favorite questions, \\"If you call a dog's tail a leg, how many legs does he have?\\" Lincoln's answer to those who answer 'five' provides Flynnn's critical conclusion: \\"Calling a tail a leg does not make it a leg. Calling lies truth doesn't make them truth.\\" And, watching the political campaigns, we must note that calling truth-speakers 'liars' does not make the speaker a liar or his words lies.For content and persistence, this merits five stars. But it is painful -- not joyful -- to read these revelations and this left me a bit mentally bruised in the end. This is a tough but important read."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"A number of years ago, I spent 1-1/2 years working as a volunteer on the McGovern campaign. Over the years, my life experience has slowly nudged me more and more to the right. It has been a long (and continuing) journey for me to gradually own my ignorance and misprogramming. This book deals with major nontruths which have shaped widely-held views of the world, much to the detriment of our culture, our educational institutions, our families, and our communities.This book really was a painful read for me, but it helps me to understand how it is that I and so many others got programmed to believe much of what we came to believe."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"Intellectual Morons finally exposes the rampaging insanity so often found among intellectuals, particularly in our nation's universities. Many other comments here itemize the topics that Flynn covers, so I'll limit myself to other issues.1. Yes, Flynn is conservative. This fact does not make any of his arguments intrinsically wrong or his research shoddy. Moreover, Flynn does devote a chapter to Ayn Rand -- objectivist mainstay of many libertarian conservatives, and Leo Strauss -- father of Neo-Conservatism. Some have pointed out that beyond these two individuals the remaining belong to the Left. This is true -- however, the sampling roughly reflects the proportion of Leftists to \\"Everyone Else\\" among academicians in the humanities and social sciences.2. Flynn's research appears sound. I have not seen many comments here dispute the facts he presents. Did Margaret Sanger advocate concentration camps for the retarded and disabled, or didn't she? Did Chomsky support Pol Pot after his genocidal crimes were made plain, or didn't he?3. While the research seems solid, Flynn errs significantly by pursuing ad hominem or irrelevant details that unnecessarily expose his thesis to criticism. For example, it is enough to describe Kinsey's fraudulent research on sexuality. Flynn goes further by describing Kinsey's perverted sexual practices. If Kinsey were not a sexual pervert, his research would still have been fraudulent. By pursuing this sort of ad hominem against Kinsey (however distasteful he may be), Flynn permits opponents to claim his arguments are personal attacks and to ignore the substantiative side of his thesis. Similarly, Flynn need only describe Straussian doctrine to show the pompous exclusivity apparent in it. Unfortunately, he needlessly inserts a bit of his own America First isolationism and flirts with the asinine contention that US foreign policy is rigged by \\"Neocons\\" (Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Congressional Democrats - all Neocons?).On the whole, Intellectual Morons is an important contribution to public discourse. It is particularly useful to parents who will soon see their children off to college. Too easily do we defer to intellectuals on social and ethical issues because we feel intimidated, or feel unqualified to assess often specious contentions couched in obscurantist language. At the same time, Flynn's self-defeating interjections and light (but omnipresent) flippancy mar this rare look at a serious subject."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"Remember all the obtuse longwinded authors you were required to read as an undergraduate - after which you quickly forgot about because they seemed not to make any sense?

The book is about the morons who inspired them - it's about Marcuse, Fromm and Rousseau - Kinsey, Chomsky and Strauss - Sanger, Rand and Friedan.

I believe there is a real argument to be made that ideology (on both sides) plays too great a role in the intellectual discourse among academics, who should know better. This is not the best place to find such an argument, however. The book's appeal will be limited to those few inclined to \\"fall for stupid ideas\\" themselves. The irony in the authors' lack of self-reflection does offer the reader some humor value, perhaps. But the thoughtful conservative reader looking for reasoned arguments to make among serious people might want to look elsewhere.

A nihilist, really. Not exactly a right-winger, but definitely not a commie either. He also opposed equal rights for women, which would seem to put him at odds with mainstream American liberalism. Trying to pin the blame for him on either side of the standard left-right spectrum is a useless exercise."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"One problem with this book is that so many of his arguments apply not only to the liberals he's attacking but equally well to conservatives such as Rush Limbaugh. Somebody posted a review titled \\"Liberals: Blind followers of sick people\\" yet millions of people blindly follow Rush Limbaugh and other right-wing leaders. Further, Flynn is attempting to discredit liberal and left ideas by discrediting individual, well-known people. However, even these people he mentions, such as the Princeton professor Peter Singer are not accepted by all liberals and their ideas are not embraced universally by liberals and leftists. For example, Peter Singer has been accused by many of having ideas that lead to eugenics, and many people (liberals and conservatives alike) disagree with his radical ideas. And although a few in PETA have agreed with some of his ideas, many mainstream liberals and leftists prefer to distance themselves from such radical groups as PETA and EarthFirst in the same way that many conservatives would prefer to distance themselves from the likes Timothy McVeigh, Eric Rudolph, and even at times Ann Coulter or Neal Boortz. Thus, just because this Princeton guy has some screwd up ideas doesn't mean all liberals agree with him. Unfortunately, you would not know that from this book. Thus, this book is just one more piece of propaganda filled with ideology that makes people fall for stupid ideas."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"This is an important book because it reveals two truths aboutliberalism.

Second, the strengthof liberalism is its power to keep its followers ignorant ofthe truth about its leaders and the orgins of liberal ideology.Flynn explains in this book:- That the people behind animal rights are nothing but killerswho put animals over human lives and whose agenda involveskilling humans and probably mass murder.- That environmentalism is a junk-science scam promoted bya bunch of people who were suffering from mental illness andwere probably on drugs.- That liberals gained control of our universities because ofthe false morality of weak bleeding heart intellectuals. Andhow the liberals only keep control through violence.- That the founder of the revolution in sexual immorality anddepravity was a demented insane pervert who made up resultsthat liberals used to tell americans that perversion was normaland that the majority of americans were perverts.- That the so-called leaders of the liberal intellectuals (Zinn,Chomsky, VIdal) hate the very idea of America and want nothingmore than to destroy it so they can replace it with a socialistpervert utopia. Their politics are about destroying America.Burning the white house, destroying the congress and turningour lives over to their control.- Flynn tells the truth about communist spy Alger Hiss. TheHiss case has always been important in understanding howthe liberal elite is trained in liberal universities ina program to destroy america through whatever means necessaryincluding treason.- Flynn explains the communist party roots of Feminism and howBetty Friedan, one of its founders, was actually a rich liberalwho converted to communism in college and then was given thetask of establishing the feminism \\"front\\" in their war onAmerica.- Flynn explains the secret history of the NAACP that takes usfrom Stalin, Hitler and Tojo to Jesse Jackson by way of W.E.B.Dubois.- Finally, Flynn explains clearly the line that goes from thesick and twisted godmother of aborition in america to theevils of the german camps in WWII. And how abortion is justone part of her greater ideology to destroy America bydestroying unborn americans.In case after case, Flynn shows liberal ideas coming out ofinsane, degenerate minds and then being sent as orders to theignorant bulk of the liberal movement. He also shows us stepby step how all of these so-called movements started out asideas hatched by those in the communist movement or otheranti-american political organizations like those of germanyand Japan in WWII.The decline of liberal control of American institutions canbe directly traced to the American victory over germany andJapan in WWII and Ronald Reagan's victory over communism inthe 1980s. Cut off from international support, the highup liberal masterminds can only keep control over institutionslike courts and universities where neither democracy or thefree market applies. But soon hopefully, the rot will bedriven out of them as well.As in Iraq today, there is a dangerous 5% of liberals thatis doing 95% of the damage to america. America needs to wakeup to the theat posed by the america-hating liberal leadersand drive them from their safe havens. For too long,univerties funded by regular americans have sheltered thesemonsters. They need to be exposed and driven out. After thathappens, the whole rotten structure of liberalism willcollapse. Like Saddam Hussein's baath party in Iraq, theonly cure is to ban these sick people from public life."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"No original research. Just takes the negative aspects and assumes they're true. If you are gonna write a book get both sides of the story. The chapter on Ayn Rand is just the same criticisms rehashed and not verified. Referencing for one an article by Murray Rothbard that mentions some of Ayn Rand's followers acting stupid with no reference or details about who saw what. In this book you will be scandalized by Ayn's main characters being smokers. OMG! Stories about her followers acting stupid. Are you kidding? Is she responsible for the people? As for her collective, they were all adults who did not want to give up being around her. They could have left anytime. Far from being mindless cultists they went on to promising careers: Alan Greenspan, Erica Holzer, Nathaniel Branden. Is it her fault they copied her accent? Maybe this is just deep admiration between student and teacher. Maybe they recognized what a profound philosopher she is. This author has no idea who she is. One gets the impression he heard she was an atheist and for selfishness so he had to attack her. If I were to write a book on say something like the flat earth society I would still go to them and hear their arguments. I would like to know their defense so I can counteract it if possible. But This would have been too much trouble for Flynn. So we get the same repetitions of sputnick, affairs and randroids. All traceable back to the Branden bibles which these books all cite."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"The Achilles' heal of this book is the author's refusal to address or acknowledge his own ideological bent. He comes into the game with his own ideological baggage, yet he tries to present himself as a pure rationalist who is only interested in the \\"truth\\", unvarnished by ideology. If that were the case, why doesn't he address religious ideology? In fact, the only mention he makes of it is that some people are so full of themselves and their ideology that there's no room in them for \\"God\\". This begs the question: if one is so concerned with logic, facts and reason, how does one justify the belief in an invisible, supernatural diety in the absence of empirical evidence? What is religious faith, but an aherence to an ideology? This, tellingly, the author doesn't discuss at all.He gives plenty of lip service to the \\"pro-choice\\" movement, much of it deserved, but has nothing to say about some of the more extreme examples of the \\"pro-life\\" movement. What about stem cell research? Silence. What about radical elements in the NRA, or right-wing militia groups? How about some of the extreme racist ideologies that still exist in this country today? Not a peep.He mentions in the opening how various minds have been held sway by \\"-isms\\" such as communism, postmodernism, feminism, etc., but he fails to include capitalism or fundamentalism in his list of \\"isms\\". Why the ommission? Simple--his book isn't an attack on ideology. It's an attack on ideologies he finds offensive.He makes many valid points about the excesses of ideology, mostly on the left, and with a few token examples on the right as well. But ultimately, the author is just pretending to be a rational objectivist, and the book itself is a self-serving attempt to rationalize the author's beliefs. He lacks the candor and courage to examine his own assumptions, sidestepping again and again anything that might require him to reveal his own ideological underpinnings or that might in some way challenge or offend the right-wing audience for which his book is intended."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"I was hoping this book would be abstract concepts with supporting examples. Rather this book is about the people who have views the author opposes (Al Gore, hippies from the 60's, etc.).

I myself know of extremely intellegent people who let ideology twist their thinking and make them utter stupid comments. I thought, this was THE book that I had been dying to get my hands on - until I read the excerpts and found out how extremely partisan Flynn really is.He honestly believes that only left-wingers are engaged in the shallow-thinking trap while ignoring the fact that right-wingers can be accused of the same thing. Letting ideology dictate your beliefs without engaging in critical thinking is bad no matter what side you're on. Flynn is an extreme hypocrit and should offer equal criticisim to his own party as well as those of liberal ideology.Flynn should be more frank and just title the book \\"How Left-Wing Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas\\"."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"I downloaded the sample ebook for this before purchasing. The first few pages contained a number of apolitical examples of hypocrisy, which gave me the impression that it would be a fair, academic analysis of how smart people end up subscribing to dumb ideas.It wasn't until I purchased the book and made it a little further in, that I realized it is not. This book is very politicized, and makes little effort to discuss the subject in an unbiased manner. I'm ashamed to say that I didn't realize where the author was going until his rant on W. E. DuBois, followed by his suggestion that atheists believe what they do because they're simply too arrogant to believe in anything more important than themselves. Of course this is absolutely absurd and intellectually lazy.This book is not what it pretends to be, and I should have done my homework on it before purchasing. That said, if you're a fan of Glenn Beck (et al), you'll probably enjoy it immensely."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"Some of the yo-yos described in this book, such as Strauss, Marcuse, Derrida and Foucault are bores who cultivate a writing style sufficiently opaque that they can only appeal to pseudo-intellectual professors looking for a stylish horse to ride. Others, such as Alfred Kinsey, are sensational frauds who became heroes to journalists, always in need of another dose of tawdry trash to sell. Still others, such as Rigoberta Menchu and Betty Friedan, are activists who have serious problems with their autobiographies.I enjoyed Flynn's rather amorphous collection of miscellany about these phonies, who have undoubtedly made some impact on the ruminations of the booboisee. They will inevitably sink into the oblivion they deserve, but probably not soon enough for most honest people. They will have plenty of company there. I remember being pulled into something of this sort as a young man. Who cares about existentialism these days? It is now sufficiently obscure that Flynn doesn't even include it. The time I wasted in reading this baloney in college is a real lesson for me. I could have been drinking beer or watching girls...People of the Enlightenment have always had to contend with the ignorance and superstition of the masses, and have developed some pretty good tools to oppose the irrational and the nihilistic, dark side of the human beast. The more elevated phonies, the bishops and the professors of nonsense, have been mostly quite puny in their effect compared to the efforts of the scientists and engineers, with their fondness for numbers and graphs, replication, clarity and ceaseless experimentation. They progressively revealed a reality the nihilists cannot even imagine. The engineers have given us electricity and the automobile, the transistor and the internet. What have the phonies given us, aside from a raft of references in the Social Sciences Citation Index?Flynn's debunking of these characters is fairly effective sometimes. Other chapters, such as the one on the Chambers-Hiss affair, should have been left out--it has already fallen into the abyss of irrelevance.And I had always thought that The Kinsey Report was on the up and up. Flynn shows that it had an utter disregard for statistical sampling methods and was only an ax grinding, made up by a pervert. I especially enjoyed Flynn's rather lascivious treatment of Kinsey eccentricities--the ultimate ad hominem attack. Worth reading."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"I was hoping for a structured, point-by-point analysis as to why ideology governs much of our judgment and cognition. What I got instead was a rather jumbled, internally contradictory, and emotionally driven set of declarative statements. From the outset it is pretty obvious where Flynn's biases lay, and evidently he is irritated by a lot of what he doesn't understand about American culture. However, instead of analyzing it intelligently (which is what I'd hoped for), he instead judges it. This book is thus an appeal to others who have likewise already judged it. Reading Flynn's analysis of the American left reminded me of someone walking into the Museum of Modern Art, looking around, and, without any reference to historical trajectory (that is, without considering \\"why *this* art?\\"), announcing, \\"This all sucks.\\" This book was an exercise in missing the point.Interestingly, Flynn makes the accusation that those on the left tend to go around mindlessly repeating what ideas their leaders have fed them, without exploring this same phenomenon on the right. With a more complete analysis, Flynn might conclude that the ideas of left gatekeepers (say, a Noam Chomsky or Michael Parenti) are maybe just a *little* more complex than those of, say, a Michael Savage or Ann Coulter, and thus any articulation of the former is probably coming from a well-reasoned, principled position. On the flip side, anyone -- even Flynn -- would be hard-pressed to make the same argument about pundits on the right. This is one of many overt problems with Flynn's analysis. Another is that he never really gets around to analyzing the ideas he's criticizing.At the time of its release this book represented a new, programmatic kind of conservative anti-intellectualism. When the tools of reason and social science highlight problems with conservativism (or capitalism or whatever), conservatives are faced with two primary options: grow and evolve, or launch an attack on reason and social science, branding them as \\"enemies\\" (even while, ironically, conservative newsrooms are readily using social scientific research to make a buck). Since conservativism is in many ways about resisting change, and since growing and evolving are ways of changing, conservatives like Flynn opt to strike out at reason and science in lieu of growing and evolving.If you're of a rational or scientific mindset, read it so you'll know what you're up against."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"\\"Intellectual Morons\\" is an intensely satisfying read for people who like to see Leftist intellectual icons given the hiding they deserve. From Alger Hiss to Gore Vidal, Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky to Betty Friedan and Margaret Sanger, Herbert Marcuse to Jacques Derrida, Daniel J. Flynn takes swings at most of the pillars of academic Leftism -- often through the practice of quoting those pillars' own ridiculous words. Along the way, he also fires on Leo Strauss (whom he accurately characterizes as \\"perhaps the most talked about but least read intellectual\\" these days [p. 131]) and Ayn Rand and their respective acolytes. But those chapters aside, this is overwhelmingly an attack on the Left. Fittingly so, since that's where so much of the \\"truth is relative\\" concept Flynn opposes resides today.The deconstruction, so to speak, of those \\"intellectual morons\\" certainly makes for entertaining, if sometimes often infuriating, reading. But I finished the book thinking, \\"And so...?\\" A better subtitle for this volume might have been \\"Stupid Ideas that Smart People have Fallen For,\\" since there's really less explanation of *How* these ideas were fallen-for than the flat statement that ideology explains why a charlatan like Rigoberta Menchu is given the attention she is. What's also missing, except in a few isolated cases, is evidence of whether, and if so how, these stupid ideas have had any influence outside academia or self-contained intellectual cults like the \\"Randroids.\\" It's those isolated cases -- the Straussians in the Bush administration, for example, or the social effects of the work of Kinsey and Sanger -- that make the most useful, as opposed to simply enlightening, reading. In other cases -- W.E.B. DuBois, for example, or again Ayn Rand -- I was more apt to respond, \\"Yeah, but who cares?\\"I would love to be able to find some way to stir this book together with Francis Wheen's \\"Idiot Proof: A Short History Of Modern Delusions\\". Although Flynn's is, on the whole, much the stronger book, taken together the two reveal the growing Endarkenment as America and the West retreat from rationalism and into a world of relativism, emotionalism, and \\"truth\\" in the service of political or cultural objectives. I'm afraid Flynn may largely be preaching to the choir here -- his book is filled with examples of how his targets attack or ignore critics -- but his work is still one that deserves to be read."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall For Stupid Ideas, does an excellent job of explaining the twisted ideology of the lunatic left, but Daniel Flynn could have done a great service for rational people on both sides of the political spectrum if he would have revealed his own ideology. If he would have titled his book \\"Intellectual Morons on the Left,\\" as another Amazon book reviewer suggested, then I would have very little criticism of Flynn's expose about how ideology makes smart people believe in stupid ideas.The one ideology that Flynn fails to mention is religion. On page 5, in the section called \\"The True Believer,\\" Flynn writes, \\"Why has ideology taken such a powerful hold over so many smart people? Humans desire meaning in their life. With the decline of religion among the well-educated, intellectuals increasingly look for meaning outside the church, temple, or mosque. Ideology can fill this void. It bestows an easy-to-understand explanation for the way the world works. It supplies a moral code, membership in a community, and a vocation. The new religions exalt secular saints, enforce dogmas, punish heretics, value self-sacrifice, and sanctify writings. In short, ideology serves as a proxy religion.\\" That's very well stated, but it overlooks the fact that religion is also ideological.Flynn goes on to say, \\"The ideologue believes he possesses the truth others have missed--for more audacious true believers, the key to earthly redemption.\\" Flynn suggests that ideologues carry out all kinds of sins in the name of \\"providing deliverance for humanity.\\" But he doesn't mention the sins that religious ideologues carry out in the name of God and otherworld redemption.Even though Flynn overlooks the fact that religious true-believers can be ideologues too, I still think his book is excellent. Radical left-wing ideology (which is largely a backlash to ultra-religious ideology) has been growing like a tumor on American society since at least the 1960s. Since left-wing dogma is currently dominant in the mainstream media and the majority of educational institutions, Intellectual Morons is a must-read book that helps to inoculate readers against the indoctrination of politically-correct ideologues."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"Intellectual Morons well become a CLASSIC! It is a must READ for all students, parents and open minded educators! This book will open eyes and minds to the TRUTH - pointing to the root cause of America's failing education system.

Denton - Belleville, MI"},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"I really enjoyed this book just as I got quite a bit of pleasure from Flynn's last offering (Why the Left Hates America). This is a tour of some amazingly famous people who, at their core, are ideologically unsound. The sections are concise but highly informative and will serve the reader well in many a future political argument.We now have a movie out about the reprehensible and repugnant, Dr. Alfred Kinzie. It will come as a shock to those who see the glossy work that he belonged more in a freak show than in the annals of science. Flynn does well to single out the politically engaged (read=lying) works of Howard Zinn, Gore Vidal, and Noam Chomsky. He does an admirable job in the handling of most of his subjects. The chapter on Betty Friedan was particularly strong. My only reservation is that, perhaps to make the book more marketable, he includes conservatives like Ayn Rand and Leo Strauss among his subjects. With Rand, the abrasiveness (and arguably nuttiness) of her personality is tough to question but he really doesn't deal much with her ideas, and, with Strauss, I don't think he makes his case in the least. He accuses many of those labeled neoconservatives of being his devotees but produces no proof that Mr. Strauss, or his philosophy, has anything to do with their current political stances. Also, unlike Rand, one comes away from the chapter on Strauss with little indication that he was a moron in any way. Other than these two reservations, I can honestly recommend this book as it entertains and educates which is about the most that one can ask from an author."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"Haven't read it yet - just reviews. I will pick it up and review it as soon as possible, because it sounds fascinating. I just couldn't resist responding to the first review (rant). Millie tries to portray Ted Kascinski as some kind of right winger. Come now, Millie. The man was a radical environmentalist. He had Al Gore's book, Earth in the Balance prominently displayed and marked up with favorable notes and scrawls. This man was a radical leftist and communist. For you to try to portray him otherwise is simply laughable.

There are also a couple places where the author seems to show a Christian bent, which seems out of place in a book about the dangers of ideology and the importance of objective truth.The books does target a couple conservative ideologies as well as the liberal ones most people seem to be expecting."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"Dan Flynn's \\"Intellectual Morons\\" is stunning corroboration of Psalm 14 which begins, \\"The fool says in his heart, \`There is no God.' They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good.\\" The corroboration is even more profound when you consider that the Hebrew word translated into the English word \\"fool\\" connotes not just bad judgment, but moral deficiency.In this easy-to-read, densely cited work, Flynn chronicles several intellectually vapid, morally destructive concepts and their purveyors who are still held in high esteem by the atheistic and the functionally atheistic intellectual and cultural elite (functionally atheistic being defined as those who may believe in God but never allow that belief to alter their worldview.) He decisively proves how deluded these people are by demonstrating how they reject facts that refute their beliefs. When an admirer of Alfred Kinsey is confronted with several recent studies suggesting that only two percent of the population is homosexual, as opposed to Kinsey's estimated ten percent, the admirer's response is that the other studies demonstrate \\"how they are equally wrong, not that Kinsey was.\\" Flynn astutely summarizes, \\"When fact and theory clash, the ideologue chooses theory. To the true believer, ideology is truth.\\"The ideologically deluded will not only ignore facts that refute them, but will fabricate \\"facts\\" to further the Cause. Flynn quotes Stanford professor Stephen Schneider talking about raising environmental consciousness: \\"Scientists should consider stretching the truth to get some broad based support, to capture the public's imagination... [W]e have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have.\\"Another characteristic of the ideologically deluded is their refusal to debate their ideas. To them, their view isn't merely a subjective preference but objective fact. Opponents are seen as disseminators of falsehoods motivated by malevolent intent. Therefore, instead of engaging in debate, they resort to character assassination and intellectual snobbery. Opposing ideas are not worth debating because they are intellectually inferior. So prevalent is this characteristic of false ideas, that an observer can determine the falsehood of any idea by whether its supporters exhibit it - such as proponents of evolution, man-made global warming and liberalism in general.Flynn may want to consider rewriting chapter 7 about the run-up to the Iraq invasion since many of the \\"facts\\" he uses to illustrate ideological blindness on the part of Straussians in the defense department have since been proven false. Joe Wilson has been proven to be a complete fraud, British intelligence to this day stands by it's assertion that Hussein tried to procure yellow-cake uranium (from evidence besides the forged letter,) WMDs WERE found in Iraq, and the connection between Iraq and al Qaeda has been conclusively proven (though probably not with respect to 9/11.) It is also clear that Iraq was a state sponsor of terrorism that allowed terrorists to train within its borders. According to the Bush Doctrine, we treat these countries the same as the terrorists themselves. That alone is reason enough to invade. I also find it a bit nave on Flynn's part to believe that U.S. intelligence gave the American people ALL the evidence it had about Iraq and WMDs before our forces invaded. Of course, all of this new information came out AFTER the book was published in 2004, so I don't hold Flynn accountable.In total, this is an extremely important work describing where many (if not all) of our current societal ills originated. For the uninitiated, this is a must-read, especially those about to enter college since most of the destructive ideas described in this book have their homes on university campuses across the country."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"The criticisms of the left and right intellectual morons (albeit more leftists have been mentioned) are masterfully done by Dan Flynn. The scholarship is straight-forward and solid. One of the problems Flynn faces though is his own preconceived notions. While reading this book, I was wondering if Flynn would dedicate a chapter defending his own intellectual mores. He doesn't. It's no secret that he's a right-wing conservative (he authored a book entitled WHY THE LEFT HATES AMERICA - available at Amazon and well worth the price) but what's to stop someone from thinking that he's just as much as a crackpot as the very people he's criticized? Granted one who reads this book wouldn't think he's just as deluded as Noam Chomsky, Ayn Rand, or Alfred Kinsey (and then some)... at least no one who follows these icons. But, to those who do, I'm afraid, Flynn won't win any new converts. You see, Flynn is only preaching to the choir. Aside from that those who read this book may find themselves refreshed to think on their own without submitting to ideologues. Flynn succeeds at that."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"When this book first came out, I thought it was another one of those Ann Coulter-type, \\"let's bash the Democrats\\" kind of thing. The thing that convinced me to buy it was all the intelligent people who had read it (Thomas Sowell, William F. Buckley, Jr.), people who I admire. I picked it up, and to my very pleasant surprise, it is a very smart, intelligent, hard-hitting book about the \\"looney left\\", and the whacky ideas the people believe in. Really excellent book that is at once intelligent and very funny at times. I highly recommend it. People will think it is exagerrated, but if you doubt that, go to any major U.S. university and spend some time, or look up PETA and see what they are about, or the insane theories of Noam Chomsky, which millions of people eat up as if it were a religion. I particularly liked the chapter on Kinsey, because that movie came out recently that basically \\"beatified\\" him. This book reminded me of being back in college in the 1980s. I hope that a lot of college students read this book, as a counterweight to the looney left theories that they will be force-fed on U.S. campuses."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"This book has an exciting premise--that ideology trumps reason. I have independently studied four of the people Danieal Flynn profiles in \\"Intellectual Morons:\\" Alfred Kinsey, Paul Ehrlich, Alger Hiss, and Ayn Rand.I read Alfred Kinsey's \\"Sexual Behavior in the Human Male\\" 20 years ago and I wanted to verify Kinsey's research. I thought that Kinsey's percentage of homosexual males in America was at least ten times too high. Easy enough to prove--look at sales of homosexual literature. Either the gay man doesn't read as much as the straight man, or using Kinsey's research as a marketing strategy is flawed because Kinsey's numbers don't match up. Kinsey's research may have increased the number of homosexual males who \\"come out of the closet.\\" Still, the large quantity of remandered books make me wonder.Paul Ehrlich's gloomy book, \\"The Population Bomb,\\" was a depressing read three decades ago. By 1990, Ehrlich's predictions had been proven wrong. For the faithful, contrary facts are just the devil playing tricks. So the environmentalist has become an anti-human activist, promoting a negative population growth agenda.Alger Hiss is one of the many spies I studied. I had some professional work because of the US Army's anti-subervsion and counter-espionage program (every American service member gets security briefings!) and I was astounded at how much this man got away with. My formal studies were conducted in the 1970's and 1980's. I found the case against Hiss as conclusive as the case against Adolf Hitler. Today, after the archives of the old Soviet Union have been made public, and after Project Verona (much like President Bush's current NSA \\"wire tapping\\" flap) has been mostly declassified, the only people who can't be convinced of Hiss's treason are those who thought spying for Stalin was a noble enterprise that was for the good of humanity.I read Ayn Rand's works--at least all of the major works--upon graduating from high school and entering the Marines. Several friends were Rand fans. A few were Libertarians. I rand into a problem--if I followed Rand's dictum of thinking for myself, I disagreed with some of Rand's opinions. One example was her opinion that gun control was a good thing--that personal safety was the responsibility of \\"society's fighting cohorts\\" and not something achieved by \\"having a gun in your pocket.\\" That was at odds with Rand's individualism and her anti-statist philosophy. Who watches the watchers? The Libertarian Party's foreign policy appears bankrupt to me--how do you achieve piracy suppression and patent/copyright protection if you won't \\"initiate force?\\" Sometimes, you either intervene on the world scene, or you wind up with a smoking crater where your proudest city once stood. How can you enforce ecological measures when your neighbor dumps raw sewage and industrial wastes into the ocean? Libertarianism has its roots in Ayn Rand's writings.There are several more issues raised by Flynn in \\"Intellectual Morons.\\" I'm sure that others will find that Flynn's arguments are not convincing--and that's good! General Patton was quoted as saying \\"if everyone is thinking alike, then nobody's thinking.\\" The eco-terrorists that torched a 1,500-unit housing project in Southern California may find sympathy among diverse groups--there is a housing shortage that negatively impacts Black and Hispanic families in that region. It is a fact--destroy a creature's habitat and the creature must live elsewhere, or perish.Read \\"Intellectual Morons\\" and do your own research. I don't know everything. I learn things all the time (forget things, too!) New information crops up often. Why let ideology ruin my life when I can have more fun doing it on my own?"},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"Daniel Flynn is a conservative campus speaker, author, and television guest commentator who relentlessly reminds Americans that the greatest threat to America comes from our own Left. In WHY THE LEFT HATES AMERICA, he outlines the historical background of the Frankfurt School that led to Marxism making its initial inroads into the American political and educational arena. And now in INTELLECTUAL MORONS, he picks up a thread that he left partially unraveled from his first book. Flynn sees the \\"big picture\\" of the entire spectrum of the Left Democratic Party as being variations of the gender, race, and class dichotomy of classic Marxist thought. Even though Marxism went out of business big time with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, its adherents were too deeply entrenched in its tenets to so easily surrender an adherence to a system that began as political, but soon enough morphed into non-political areas that Flynn labels as \\"Communism, environmentalism, animal rights, sexual anarchism, feminism, postmodernism, relativism, deconstructionism,\\" (Page 2) all of which he sees as being championed by those who still carry forth the banner of Marx even if under a slightly modified manner.Flynn notes a definite cross-linking among them all. Those who champion one are very likely to support any of the others. To these leaders-supporters, he suggests that intentions count far more than outcomes. It does not matter if any ideology proves disastrously wrong; what counts is the fervor that each brings to the cause. And the fervor, of course, is based on a selective manipulation of fact to fit an equally selective manipulation of reality. Flynn begins with Herbert Marcuse, a German immigrant who began modern Leftist thought by insisting that toleration from the Left was to be balanced by intolerance toward the right. It is no surprise that Flynn begins with Marcuse, the man who popularized the now all-pervasive notion that Western civilization was instrumental in leading toward the victim ideology that constitutes the core curriculums of our colleges. His following chapters deal with how sexuality became distorted with Kinsey; how environmentalism under Ehrlich morphed into the belief that global warming is the New Armageddon; how animal rights under Peter Singer now trump human rights; how the clear fraud of the third world claims of Rigoberta Menchu even now is hidden from those who do not wish to see it; and how history under Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky \\"proves\\" that the United States was born in racism and grows in racism. Flynn does not omit feminism or literary theory to escape his claims that deliberate intellectual blindness is but the first step on the slippery slope to an intellectual depravity of thought that he terms moronic. And what of the so-called \\"smart\\" people who follow such beliefs even against all evidence? Flynn suggests that there is hope for a massive turnaround for those who wish to turn the United States into a clone of France. The trick he notes is for conservatives to eternally drag the lies and distortions of the Left into the disinfectant of the sun and let the newest generation see that the emperor truly has no clothes. This will be a long struggle but the future of this country is worth it."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"I remember one time when a woman was lecturing me on health research. \\"Things like breast cancer would be solved if the Government just spent as much money on research into women's health as they do to men's.\\"I didn't have the knowledge then to counter the argument, but after a few minutes on the web I found: \\"85% of the research budget goes for non-gender based research (things like heart problems - and heart problems kill more women than breast cancer). Of the remaining 15%, 10% goes for female issues (breast/ovarian cancer, etc.), and 5% for male problems (testicular cancer, etc.). I told her this at a subsequent party. She refused to believe me, and later I heard her telling her same theory to someone else. Oh well, she liked her story.This book is filled with such stories. This author tends to concentrate on the beliefs of the liberals, with only a few stories listing the faults of the conservative side.Then again today I read that Michael Moore's bodyguard was arrested for carrying a gun in New York. If he is so against guns as 'Columbine' would have you believe, why aren't his bodyguards following the law and going unarmed."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"First, Millie, you are proving the point that Flynn forcefully makes, which is that leftist ideologues will conviently overlook the facts for the purpose of accomplishing their agenda. Hitler was a SOCIALIST; he trumpeted the socialist cause. He wasn't a right-winger, neither was Stalin, Mao, Mussolini or the rest of the mass murders of the twentieth century. But the left continues to make heroes out such despicable characters like Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, and Manuel Noriega by saying their are revolutionaries. Well there are good and bad revolutionaries. One being Saddam Hussein, which by the way, is another mass murderer that the left in this country is now insisting via Michael Moore wasn't all that bad. Ted Kacszynski was a full on leftist, and like ELF(earth liberation front)he was all about destroying goverment and techonology. The vacous philosophies of Derrida and the like have always led to intellectual anarchy, which will always lead to physcial anarchy and oppression of the innocent, which is Flynn's point.Second, read this book. Flynn has been shouted down, blocked from speaking, had his books burned before him, and threatened with arrest and physical harm by those whom he powerfully exposes. His message resonates true, and thus, the left being the hypocrites they are, want to silence him. The philosophies he exposes run rampant in today's American Universities. As a Literture and Language student I was exposed to all the \\"intellectuals\\" he addresses, and saw right through their meaningless drivvle. The modern American University is a propganda mill, churning out little Marxist robots, who haven't seen a law of non-contradiction they didn't break. Flynn represents a turning tide however, as truth and logic are starting to make a comeback- go figure. Read this book, I dare you."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"In his introduction to \\"Intellectual Morons\\", Flynn promises to argue against all \\"isms\\" that are part of an ideology. However, what he later does is argue against ideas that are part of the Left. Perhaps his title should have been: Leftist Intellectual Morons. On thirteen chapters, only two are dedicated to doctrines said to be from the Right (Conservatism and Objectivism).However, most of his chapters are rather well argued and with rigorous end of chapters notes and without the passionate fury that characterizes some right-wing speakers . Each chapter picks a spokesperson or two for a doctrine (for example, Paul Erhlich for environmentalism) and attempts to show how dishonest the person is intellectually.The tactic doesn't necessarily make the whole field of environmentalism or minority activism unworthy. It does however make for an interesting overview of the history of modern ideas and a few of their most outspoken representatives: the Frankfurt school, the beginnings of sexology as a discipline with Kinsey, the start of family planning in America with Margaret Stanger, Ayn Rand and Objectivism and the origin of Neo-Conservatism are all discussed. Also discussed are minority activist Rigoberta Menchu, activist and political commentator Noam Chomsky, historian Howard Zinn, Paul Erhlich and environmentalism, etc.An interesting read if you are interested in modern ideologies (also suspiciously similar to \\"Hoodwinked\\") but not a definite study."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"Flynn attacks the idiocy of many intellectuals, particularly the idea that lying is okay as long as it's for a good cause. He misses many opportunities, particularly in Roe v. Wade, to show just how much lying was involved. It's not surprising that he missed this though because the book focuses more on specific people, not just the causes themselves.As an example, he talks about the environmnetal movement and its lies. Environmentalists, he points out, seem oblivious to the fact that when their lies are discovered, legitimate environmental regulation is easier to dismiss as leftist shrieking. Abortion advocates hold up Margaret Sanger as a saint of her time, but completely ignore the fact that she fiercely believed in forced sterilization and concentration camps for inferior stock of humans.Flynn, also, takes swipes at Vidal Gore, Howard Zinn, and Naom Chomsky, but this is just too easy. Their foolishness has been exposed over and over.I thought the most interesting chapter in the book was on Ayn Rand. I've read most of Rand's stuff and think that the core of her ideas are right on, but have always thought the extreme position she took was a little off. Flynn shows that Rand herself was a little off and not at all consistent with her beliefs. Rather, she acted as many intellectuals act- she does what she wants and rationalizes it, while belittling and denouncing anyone who questions her as a heretic. Ironically, she denounces her clearest protoge because he scorns her for another woman. She rants to him about how selfish he is. That's hysterical because Objectivism states that selfishness is the only virtue, while altruism is a sin.Overall, the book is a fluff piece and only took me a couple of hours to read. The plus is that Flynn does a far superior job compared to others who write books like this. It's an interesting and entertaining read, but if you miss it, you haven't missed anything."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"The chapter on Leo Strauss really does not make sense. What happened to the critical analysis that the author applies to every other \\"intellectual\\" in the book?Two points: (1) I may be mistaken, but I do not believe that the term \\"neoconservative\\" was used... not a single time. (2) The author lumps the blame for the WMD fiasco on the followers of Strauss in the Bush administration. How can he also ignore that just about every prominent Democrat is on record stating that Saddam had WMD's and that numerous intelligence agencies from other countries backed it up? No mention of that at all. Including a few simple quotations would refute the entire argument. It makes no sense.Unless the author is playing his own \\"Straussian\\" literary trick in this chapter, I cannot see the point."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"I bought this book only because I had read Mr. Flynns other book \`Why the Left Hates America'. I was pleasantly surprised at the content of the first book, in spite of the terrible title. This book however was different. In this book Mr. Flynn tackles persons who have let the ideology take over all forms of reasoning. In other words, facts and empirical evidence no longer matters to how they view the world. These intellectual morons for all intensive purposes are outside of reality and outside any normative worldview.This book DOES NOT placate the right. Mr. Flynn blasts those who would be labeled conservative or right-wing as equally as he blasts those on the left. The unbalance, if you can call it that, is there are simply more targets to choose from on the left.In the end we have a book that desperately tries to understand why certain people follow these individuals, no matter how fallacious their theories are. The book fails because it cannot answer the question as to why people will follow these intellectual morons. This, btw, was the fault of his first book not being able to answer the core question but that book brought much more substance to the table.I guess if you are somewhat clueless as to what some of the radical intellectuals out there are lecturing on this book may be a eye opener otherwise if you are familiar with the names and ramblings of Singer, Chomsky, Du Bois, Rand, Sanger, Ehrlich, Straus, etc then you can essentially skip this book."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"Daniel Flynn in his book exposes many of the supposed \\"great intellectuals\\" of the 20th century as idiots and morons who despite reality and history continue to adhere to one size fits all ideologies. The book describes intellectuals who champion ideas that are anathema to the ideas of freedom developed in the Western world but have found a home in subcultures in the West, academia and entertainment, and icons of the left or right who because of their elevation to heroic status are continuously defended and lauded even when the truth about their darker sides was revealed. The controversy surrounding many in this book are probably well known to somebody who follows current events and politics but I did find the stories about the older intellectuals very informative and interesting. This book is a fast read and meant for a general audience so Flynn summarizes each person in a 10 -20 page chapter. Flynn targets heroes of the Left although he has two people associated with the Right. Flynn goes through the following people:1. Herbert Marcuse. Marcuse was a leading intellectual of social Marxism who altered Marx's original ideas from a struggle between worker and bourgeoisie to one between bourgeoisie and \\"outsiders\\", including homosexuals, women, and minorities. The ideas of Marcuse and his colleagues from the Frankfurt School have been labeled Critical Theory, finding something bad about all aspects of Western society without offering an alternative. Marcuse employs Orwellian double speak to call for \\"liberating tolerance\\", in the spirit of Orwell's 1984 in which there would be tolerance for viewpoints of the left but censorship for viewpoints on the right because the right advocates continuing \\"oppression\\". You see the impact of Marcuse's ideology in academia with speech codes, leftist students burning student run conservative newspapers with the approval of school administration. A letter to the editor for the San Francisco Chronicle summaries this idea nicely, \\"(We) will not tolerate intolerance in SF.\\" The letter was a response to a story about cars and property showing support for George W Bush's reelection in 2004 being vandalized.2. Arthur Kinsey: Flynn summarizes recent charges that Kinsey used biased sampling and faulty methodology in his \\"ground breaking\\" research during he 1940s/50s. Flynn describes Kinsey's proclivity for \\"deviant\\" sexual practices and argues Kinsey was trying to justify his own behavior by showing everybody is doing it. Kinsey continues to be lauded by the left including the recent film starring Liam Nesson.3. Paul Enrlich: Ehrlich, one of most prominent environmentalists of the past 30 years, predicted during the 1970s doom and gloom right out of the Apocalypse would strike the Earth. None of his predictions came true but he is still lauded by the environmental movement and Ehrlich still is crying wolf. Flynn describes the famous bet with his nemesis Julian Simon.4. Peter Singer: His appointment to Princeton University caused a great deal of controversy over his radical animal rights view and his advocating of infanticide. Singer is the intellectual godfather of PETA and Flynn goes over all the crazy ideas that PETA has advocated over the years. According to Singer a new born infant would enjoy less rights than a chicken.5. Rigoberta Menchu: Advocate for rights for native Guatemalan people \\"wrote\\" an autobiography that become part of the pantheon of the left and she was awarded a Noble Peace Price. Her \\"autobiography\\" turned out to be a complete fraud and she was not the poorly educated oppressed Mayan she claimed to be. But since she became an icon of the left she continues to be defended. When she visited Sacramento, CA she received a glowing article about her appearance in the Sacramento Bee in the Scene (Lifestyle) section. After describing her in gushing terms the author of the article does mention her book is a fraud but then she then defends Rigoberta as speaking with an authentic voice.6. Flynn devotes a chapter to Howard Zinn, Norm Chomsky and Gore Vidal. Virulent anti-Americanism unites all three.7. Leo Strauss: Some consider him one of the founders of neo-conservatism. Flynn describes his \\"interesting\\" methodology of reading philosophical and literary texts. Straussians approach a text as some evangelical Christians read the Book of Revelations trying to find hidden messages and symbols. Flynn tries to link Strauss to neo-conservatives pushing for the invasion of Iraq but I found the argument very weak.8. Margaret Sanger: Another icon of the Left whose advocating of eugenics, especially for minorities, virulent anti-Catholicism and advocating of Nazi style concentration camps for the US has been white washed.9. W.E.B. DuBois: One of the founders of the NAACP who became a lap dog for Stalin, Hitler and Imperial Japan, and racial segregationist. As with Sanger and Kinsey this aspect of DuBois is ignored or downplayed in the \\"official\\" history .10. Alger Hiss: Flynn summarizes the case against Hiss and how the left has continuously defended him despite all the evidence against Hiss.11. Ayn Rand: The chapter describes how a movement supposedly founded on radical individualism became a personality cult with Rand playing the role of a Stalin or Mao.12. Betty Friedan: A self proclaimed middle class homemaker who actually lived the life of luxury from birth who joined the Communist party during college.13. Jacques Derrida and Michael Foucault: Two of the leading proponents of deconstructionism and post modernism. If you sat through an English lit class in college and kept hearing about how this symbolized sex or other gibberish you can blame these two. Next time you hear a proposal to eliminate men's and women's bathrooms and replace them with unisex rest rooms you can blame Foucault since he advocated gender is a \\"social construct\\" with no basis in biology and nature."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"In 1937, after being a member of the Communist party for twelve years, Whitaker Chambers lost confidence, he said, and confiscated some 'important' government papers which he hid in a bathroom cubbyhole of his nephew's home in Brooklyn. These included seventy-one confidential reports and memos from the desk of Alger Hiss. The purloined documents had been typed at home by Priscilla from papers her husband has written; none dealt with vital secrets.Alger Hiss worked for the State Department and was secretary-general of the United Nations organizing conference in San Francisco. In 1948, he was brought to trial on the accusations of Chambers and charged with perjury. The first trial deadlocked, 8-4. In 1950, he was found guilty and was incarcerated for almost four years. Later, academics would look back on McCarthy's \\"Red Scare\\" with Alger as its chief martyr.He died in 1996, exonerated with front page headlines. This writer tries to prove Alger guilty of spying (after the facts). Why'd he wait almost ten years after the death to tarnish a good man's reputation? Sounds fishy to me!It is amazing how the media, politicians, and academics fall for bad ideas. Their lies become accepted as truth, and we all needlessly accept what they write as factual. Journalists and historians present the new history and turned a separatist into a civil rights icon. Some at UTK want to destroy everything Nathan Bedford Forrest achieved during the Civil War as they want to change history as it was.Daniel J. Flynn calls this book a wake-up call, a 'reality check.' It is just one man's opinion and I don't agree with him about Hiss or Al Gore.Flynn is a member of the Leadership Institute dedicated to training future conservative leaders. He is the author of WHY THE LEFT HATES AMERICA. He can't help but further their case with his views in this slanted book."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"I have not read the book either, but given MillitheCat's stellar review, I will be giving it in quantity for Christmas presents.

Her/its reviews of Flynn's other books have been found helpful by . . . no one."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"Daniel Flynn is to be commended for writing a great book. The colleges campuses have become exactly the opposite of what they are supposed to be.Instead of a free, open, space dedicated to learning, scholarship, knowledge and search for the Truth, the colleges have become a bastion of ultra-leftists, anti-society, hate-filled, Orwellian bastions of intellectual idiocy.Numerous ideas that would be laughed at in the general public are propagated at length in the colleges. It has been said the only place where Marxism survives is now at the universities.Flynn cites MIT Linguistic Professor Noam Chomsky. Chomsky ideas are so far out, even normal leftists dismiss this once great intellect gone berserk. Professor Paul Erhlich, Ivory Tower Pinhead made predictions that are all wrong. Flynn goes into detail about those who are wrong but loved by the coffee-house leftists.What is the cause for the decay of the once proud American academy? There are many reasons.#1. THOSE CANNOT DO WILL TEACH.People who cannot function in the real world of society where they will have to produce goods and services are attracted to a life of \\"theory\\" When was the last time you read an academic journal or discussed an academic \\"theory\\" with friends over a beer or football game.The old saying goes \\"if you are so smart, why don't you do it\\" If these pinhead academics are so smart, why don't they run for President, play NFL football or start the next Microsoft or Intel.#2. Natural Sciences versus Social Sciences, HumanitiesHuman knowledge in college can be broadly divideda. Natural Sciences (Math, Physics, Chemistry, Engineering)b. Social Studies (Economics, Politics, etc)c. Humanities (Art, Music, Literature)We learn in elementary school that there is a right answer to Math, Chemistry but however there will never be a right answer to politics or art. 2+2=4 is true. Who is the best president or who is the best artists. There are questions with no right answer. The humanities and social studies are basically studies. Hence, there is just a lot of \\"theory\\"Politics is just politics, there will never be true, correct answer to any of it. Art is in the eye of the beholder. The humanities and social sciences are basically non-science, non-technical courses that does not require any brain power. Hence, you get lots of dummies attracted to these areas of study.#3. Lifelong Tenure guarantees low quality.THOSE CANNOT DO WILL TEACH.THOSE CANNOT DO WILL WANT A LIFELONG JOB.Colleges are last few places on Earth where jobs are guaranteed for life. It's lunatics running the asylum, giving a \\"blank check\\" to academics.Daniel Flynn writes about the current state of college campuses. However, Peter Drucker has said the large university campuses will be obsolete in 30 years. What was Peter Drucker talking about.Computer now cost $200 and the world will soon have a billion computers. MIT is posting 2000 courses, free, open to all. The computer hooked up to the Internet will give every person universal access to knowledge. Google can find knowledge for you in a split second. Colleges, academics, libraries, scribes have always had a monopoly on knowledge. Now is knowledge is available to all on a universal basis. The world will never be the same again.The college days are numbered. Daniel Flynn book is a great expose on the fraud, sham, ignorance, perpetuated in the name of so-called \\"higher education\\" The U.S. Constitution guarantees free speech, free association. We should all exercise our constitutional right and learn about the sham going on at college campuses."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"In this winner, Daniel Flynn, who prides himself on having been kicked out of lecture halls for his views, tries to knock down a few folks who have committed the ultimate American crime: thinking.The problem with the book is obvious right away. If smart people fall for bad ideas because of ideology, then how does the author explain his own obvious and unconcealed bias? Is he smart? Is he falling for ideology?This is the sort of thing that happens when people disregard facts and can't actually answer arguments. Apparently, the environmental movement is not totally legit because of the people who helped advance it years ago. People are blinded by 'leftist' ideology, so they're to be discredited.The targets are familiar, the charges very old, and very tired, and very refuted. Noam Chomsky here is still a Holocaust denier, a supporter of the Khymer Rouge, a predicter of genocide (he didn't 'predict' genocide, but quoted common sources), etc, etc.I can't wait for the sequel to this log, where the author analyses himself, lauding his ejection from lecture halls for his amazing ideas."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"This is probably the most biased book I ever purchased. Shortly into the chapter on environmentalism, I began researching each of the author's points. I discovered he picks and chooses whatever pieces will get his own moronic ideology across, no matter how much of the truth he has to leave out.I threw this book in the trash. I consider my time too valuable to waste on a hyped-up barroom pundit's half-truths."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"Who better to write a book about morons than Flynn? An abyssmally miserable book with so little substance I was surprised it didn't float out of my hands. It's a great resource for those looking for a plethora of examples of pitifully poor logic; Two wrongs don't make a right, non-sequiturs galore, red herrings - they're all there.It seems apparent the goal was to scoop up the easy money from the thin thinkers in our world. It certainly wasn't to write a scholarly treatise where the reader came away enlightened in the slightest way.I guess I have fallen into the category of \\"moron\\" by spending money on it and worse yet, reading it to completion. I'm embarrassed. Flynn should be too."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"I have not read the book but I did watch Flynn's presentation of it at Colby, as broadcast this morning (Sunday, 31Oct2004) on C-SPAN 2, so I think I have a pretty good idea of what is in it.He picks out a number of targets on the political left and points out irrational statements. For balance, he throws in a couple of examples from the political right, including Bush's justification for invading Iraq. Make no mistake, however, Flynn intends his work as an attack on the left.As far as I understand his attacks on his targets, I agree with him. As a liberal Democrat, I have never felt that Chomsky represented me - I am quite open to the notions that some of his pronouncements are ideologically, rather than rationally, driven and that they are pure crap. Flynn may see this as a blow to his opposition, liberal Democrats, but I see it as a simple exposure of the obvious, that there is a lunatic fringe on the left (as well as the right).Flynn may be correct also in his assessment of some predictions made by Paul Ehrlich around 1970, that millions would soon die in unavoidable famines and that people would soon need to wear oxygen masks on the streets. It may be true that these predictions have proved to be incorrect in degree, but I don't see that as a body blow to the environmental movement, which Flynn ridicules. To the extent that he uses attacks on such marginal matters to justify his own anti-environmentalism, he is himself an example of that which he opposes in his book, a person who ignores the facts in favor of ideology.The Q&A; period this morning made it obvious that Flynn does not consider right-wing Christian fundamentalists and evangelicals to be ideologs, which to me is truly astonishing.I think Flynn is \\"right on\\" in his attacks on left-wing lunacy, but I don't think that has any bearing on centrist left positions. His token attacks on the right, however, seem to me to strike at centrist right positions, although his greatest sin here is to leave out so much from the centrist right that could have illustrated his thesis of ideology overriding logic."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"I first heard of this book and its author a few days ago while viewing C-Span2 as I indexed my Lawrence Welk videotapes. In an interview at a bookfair, the author posited that Noam Chomsky, among other things, has stated that the massacre initiated by Pol Pot was merely a creation of the Western Press. As an avid reader of Chomsky, I was nonplussed, so I had to investigate further.An earlier review (below) by J D Schockley quite comprehensively explores and refutes the book's observations about Professor Chomsky, and I would not attempt to improve upon this. To quote Chomsky in overall reference to this book, \\"comment would be superfluous.\\"I gave this book so many stars because it is a fine example of, and fits so well within, the canon of which it is a part. Its numerous flaws and use of logical fallacies to make its \\"points,\\" including ad hominem attacks on its \\"subjects,\\" places it firmly in the reprehensible pantheon of similar work so eagerly devoured and uncritically accepted by its wide audience.

Gordon Liddy on the back. That should give you a clue about how \\"right on\\" this book is."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"In the introduction, the author states that ideology deceives and leads to fanaticism; it's like putting your brain on autopilot. Experience, facts and logic are the only reliable pathways to truth. The book investigates dishonest intellectuals and their slavish followers who champion idiotic opinions, beliefs and theories. Academic degrees and high IQ are no antidotes to stupidity.The ideologies discussed here include communism, environmentalism, feminism, multiculturalism, relativism and deconstructionism. The gurus are the evil intellectuals that mislead so many people, whilst in my opinion those that Flynn call the \\"joiners\\" are the real morons. These are often empty-headed celebrities with no more than a superficial idea of the issues which they embrace.The first chapter looks at the Frankfurt School that produced inter alia Herbert Marcuse, the philosopher of the New Left that exerted such great influence in the 1960s. His followers are the intolerant leftists of today who claim to be liberals. Chapter 2 investigates the revolting Alfred Kinsey, the massive hoax of his \\"research\\" and his disgusting private life. With the help of the ignorant mass media, he managed to inflict his perversions on the world.The next chapter explores Paul Ehrlich, the false prophet of environmentalism who has been wrong in his every prediction. There is also the animal rights guru Peter Singer and the thoroughly discredited organization PETA. In the chapter Liars And The Intellectuals Who Enable Them, Flynn reveals the case of Rigoberta Menchu and her falsified history. This is an eloquent expose' of the folly of multiculturalism.Chapter 6: The 3 Stooges of Anti-Americanism, investigates Howard Zinn, Gore Vidal and Noam Chomsky, friend of the Khmer Rouge and lately Hezbollah. These three are prime examples of shameless liars notorious for their staggering hypocrisy. Other deceptive gurus and movements explored by Flynn include Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood, WEB du Bois, Alger Hiss and his defenders, Betty Friedan and the Feminist Movement. The chapter on Postmodernism looks at the Sokal Hoax, Jacques Derrida, Deconstruction and Michel Foucault.In the last chapter the author reiterates the motto that a mind is a terible thing to waste. He points out how much intellectual morons and paranormal believers have in common; he should have also mentioned conspiracy theorists. Anyway, the difference is that whereas society ridicules obvious cranks, intellectual deceivers often retain respectability and are showered with accolades, mostly because of the mass media morons. Flynn notes that the causes championed by the subjects of this book are often downright evil - stuff like infanticide, pedophilia and totalitarianism. Finally, he reminds us that ideas have consequences and that the lies of the ideologues must be exposed relentlessly.The book concludes with 34pp of bibliographic notes arranged by chapter, and an index. I also recommend Hoodwinked by Jack Cashill, The Burden Of Bad Ideas by Heather MacDonald,The Anti-Chomsky ReaderandThe Professors: The 101 Most Dangerous Academics in Americaby David Horowitz, Intellectuals by Paul Johnson, 110 People Who Are Screwing Up America by Bernard Goldberg andSinisterism: Secular Religion of the Lie (Revised and Updated Edition)by Bruce Walker. These works investigate numerous influential individuals and movements whilst brilliantly demonstrating how evil ideologies function like toxic religious cults. Their fruits are disease, death and suffering on a vast scale."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"Do you ever feel like you are Sunday School when talking to your leftist friends, only Christianity is replaced with some other whacky beliefs? Then this book is for you!Most of the ideologues portrayed in the book are on the left, with some notable exceptions from the right (e.g. Ayn Rand). Thus, some of the negative reviewers criticize the author just on the basis of being on the wrong side of the aisle. Pretty much the attitude the author describes in one of his chapters, whereby the left thinkers promote tolerance - but only towards leftist ideas. Funny how most of the 1-star reviewers here seem to exactly fit the mold of the intellectual morons and their blind followers.In any case, this book is for all of us true intellectuals who are irritated by the radical environmentalists, feminists, and other all the other \\"-ists.\\" They wouldn't be such an annoyance if they didn't have this aura of intellect around them. People like Ehrlich can be wrong time and time again, their ideas, however, live on in academic circles, not because they are good ideas but because they fit the party-line of anti-capitalism that's so prevalent among so-called intellectuals. By the way, to address the criticism of some other reviewers, contrast that to Rush Limbaugh, another good candidate for an ideologue. At least his books are not required readings at colleges around the country!The book is such a nice read because it very eloquently shows what I already knew: that the same people who ridicule the Christian right as backwards, themselves follow an anti-free-thinking cult that has abandoned reason in favor of ideology. A real page-turner, nicely written with a lot of wit and sarcasm."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"The premise is a great one. The exploration of how people are so committed to a mindset that anything which takes a contrary position to that ideology is immediately, blindly, discarded. What's unfortunate is that Daniel Flynn is crippled by this very same problem, he lets his staunch conservativism distort his methods.If this book did not have such a political axe to grind, in this case it is Flynn tailoring his structure and subjects to cast the left in as bad a light as possible, this could have been a truly great and important book. Flynn is at his best when he is not talking about his subjects but rather when he is discussing his conclusions and personal observations on how ideologies affect people and the dangers of submission to this mindset. His beginning and conclusion are first-rate because it captures the best of his offerings in a completely non-partial (or partisan), way. Although he is most certainly a strong right-wing conservative, Flynn is not a party-line regurgitating, hack Republican mouthpiece, like say, Sean Hannity. He is surprisingly scathing in his critique of the current situation in Iraq and extremist neo-conservative policy as a whole. In the chapter, \\"A Truth That Lesser Mortals Failed To Grasp,\\" he sounds like he's making the liberal case for opposing Bush and Iraq, and he really means it.Despite these positives, the overwhelming negatives showcase themselves again and again. His biggest sin in my opinion is that he has come to the conclusion that the trait of letting ideology blind people into buying stupid ideas has somehow become a partisan issue, namely that it is the trait of the left-wing liberals. The book takes certain people as case studies and basically tears them down, and 14 out of the 16 people profiled are leftists. If the book were called \\"Intellectual Morons of the Left\\", then this might not matter, but the author has put on an appearance of being objective, and I believe he fails miserably at that. Also, the two that are not stated leftists, are not really right-wing either, it just so happened that their PHILOSOPHIES could be and were interpreted in support of capitalism and the individual, though they themselves are not aligned with a conservative cause. So Flynn has not put his own side under the microscope at all (and there are volumes of conservatives who have committed this same sin of blind devotion, believe me), which sort of contradicts his whole premise. And by the way, he doesn't even label one of his targets, Noam Chomsky, correctly. He states repeatedly that Chomsky is a leftist, presumbly for his defense of communist regimes from time to time. But Chomsky is really a radical libertarian by his own admission, and that is actually an extreme faction of the RIGHT, not left. He's the closest thing that we have to a mainstream anarchist. So I guess that means that we now have only 13 of 16 profiled being leftists.Examples abound. He tears into Alfred Kinsey for profiling a highly selective group of people to compile his data on sex in America, to, as Flynn believes, slant the evidence to support his opinions, rather than be objective and select random people to make the experiments more believeable. Sort of like writing a book where nearly 90% of your subjects are of the same political standing (which, by the way, opposes yours) and then announcing that in your \\"balanced\\" study, you've come to the conclusion that political standing (leftists) are the biggest purportrators of this crime. Consistency is not his strong point. He has some good points about Kinsey, but he attacks him mainly for the crime that he himself commits repeatedly, so he is fair game as well. When he discusses environmentalist Paul Ehrlich, he basically concludes that he is a moron because most of his predictions were wrong. Problem is, most sceintific theories in the history of mankind were wrong as well. New technology and breakthroughs at many points in history have discredited way more theories than they have upheld. Just because we now know that most early formal studies of physics were incorrect and have been discredited, does that mean that the scientists who once developed those theories without everything we have now are totally useless? That they made no contributions at all and are by Flynn's definition, morons? Flynn does not acknowledge the possiblity that Ehrlich's research, any experiments he performed, his dedication, and his championing of certain causes could have any merit. Nope, it's all about the bottom line, Ehrlich was proven wrong and therefore, nothing else matters about him. He's just a statistic on the wrong side.One last major sin that he commits is that Flynn does not go after mainstream people at all. Some of their ideas may have gotten into the mainstream, but he attacks the fringe only. That seems like a heck of a crutch to me, it is pretty easy to attack the fringe. It's no wonder that his least effective attack is on Howard Zinn, who in my opinion is probably the least \\"radical\\" or \\"fringe\\" of those leftists profiled. Flynn says that Zinn is a communist who sees history as one big class struggle over money and power. Hmmmmm, that doesn't seem so far-fetched to me, but beyond that, his arguements are just dead wrong. Flynn contends the reason that Zinn says Columbus voyaged was to obtain wealth and riches. Well, yeah. Historically, that was the reason. Bring back gold and any information on new trade routes to get exotic goods from Asia. Likewise, he says Zinn is being a moron for thinking that during WWII, Roosevelt held meetings with business leaders to get the economy of the US \\"second to none\\" with war being the catalyst. Again, this is totally true. Business leaders like Forbes and Mellon were actively seeking to make money using wartime economic stimulation and held meetings with FDR's administration to try and serve this goal more effecively.Flynn also subtley reinforces his conservative beliefs by slipping slights to leftists in many of the profiles. When he takes on Alger Hiss, for example, he mounts the evidence of communism against him. But he also refers to Hiss repeatedly as a \\"New Dealer,\\" even when there is no connotation within the context to FDR's administration thereby subtley equating the New Deal with horrible communism. He also uses the proverbial, \\"some say\\" or \\"critics of this man have said\\" instead of just saying that these crticisms are his. Also in this book, logical fallacies abound, with even the title being an ad hominiem. Flynn rarely critiques the people's ideas at all, but rather attacks the person, dismissing their ideas as stupid without explanation, and I guess just assumes that the stuidity is obvious. In some cases it is, but to not ever provide analysis of the actual ideology, but rather just saying ideology is bad, is not the best way to prove your point.I could go on, but I've done way more than enough to get the point across. Worth reading, but watch for the many ways that Flynn contradicts himself and becomes what he preaches against."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"This book cuts to the chase, unimpeded by any PC bilge.

I agree with Millie's assessment of Dan (offered in her reviews of his books) that Dan is a \\"right wing loonie\\". I know this to be true, because I've heard him speak and have met him personally. You see, I'm a right wing loonie too. That's why I like his ideas, despite their lack of coherence and veracity. Millie has, of course, debunked his theses effectively--by calling Dan names like \\"loonie\\". This is liberal argument at its finest. Added to this persuasive argument is her claim that the \\"left enjoys the advantage over the right of being able to think\\". This advantage in cognition is evidenced by the obvious errors in spelling that permeate her reviews."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"Well written, but I thought this was going to be a critique of all ideologies, instead its just an extreme right winger complaining about left wing ideologies without being able to turn his gaze upon himself.

Very enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"This book is useful for those who already \\"get it\\" that ideology is always a mixture of truth and nonsense, especially those who are onto the idea, but haven't yet articulated it well. Mr. Flynn provides in this book the tools and language to more fully develop this understanding.The author explores a valuable concept: We can avoid believing the lies ideology mixes with its truths by using our intellectual curiosity to question and examine all claims. Flynn teaches the method fairly well, but uses this platform to promote his own ideological agenda: bashing \\"liberal\\" thinking. Nearly all his illustrations target liberal causes. His only reference to a conservative ideological error is so obscure it's irrelevant. He ignores a treasure trove of conservative and neo-conservative ideological errors publicly paraded from the current White House administration. Adding this material for balance this could have made it a great book."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"This book talked about some influential leftist college professors as well as people such as Alfred Kinsey and Ingrid Newkirk who started [according to the author] misguided movements. The point of the book is how the true believer in a cause will do and say almost anything to support that cause, even obvious [to everyone else] blatantly stupid things, hence the name of the book. An example of this is the animal rights activists who broke into a mink farm and released the minks. What the group didn't consider is what would happen after that. The minks went wild in the surrounding farmland killing a bunch of chickens and other farm animals. One of the local farmers said while looking over their dead chicken littered yard the next morning \\"the people who do this don't think about the consequences of their actions\\".The book is well written, humorous, and entertaining. It focuses on intellectual morons in the U.S. in the last 70 or so years and stays away from a general examination of idealogy the world over, for example how Hitler used ideology to get the Nazis to follow him."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"This book is a great primer for a historical account of the Left's systemmatic destruction of our societal \\"norms\\" over the last few decades. This book is well-researched and gives little-known facts to expose the true nature and motives of persons the Left upholds as great champions of history and culture.It shows how truly distainful these Leftist \\"Greats\\" are and how destructive they have been to American history and culture. It confirms what educated people already know, the Leftists prey on the uneducated and uninformed to create their own version of the truth; the ends justify the means. What are their \\"ends\\"? For decades, the political Left has earnestly endeavored to destroy American society's normalcy, sense of common-decency, and historical truth in a way that is subtle, yet so insidious, so as to catch most unsuspecting people unaware that they have fallen victim to the Left's manipulation.The truth and decency bar has been intentionally and systemmatically lowered over time by the Left and this book does a really good job of chronicling of how many of the Left's champions have lied and manipulated their way to \\"greatness\\" and exposes how they've preyed on the weak and uninformed. I really enjoyed this book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"I have not read this book, so my score is neutral. This is to a previous reviewer:While it is true that politics, economics, literature, and art have none of the abosolute values one would find in math or science, it astounds me that some people would still find no value in the study of these subjects. If you can't see the intrinsic necessity of understanding the history of economic and political situations and the effects they have had on different populations or the value of understanding the mechanics and nuance of your own language, then you, sir, are the fool."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"It was his chapter on Ayn Rand that actually made me want to check the book out. Sadly, the author seems to not have found many of prominent rightist 'gurus', like Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, or President G. W. Bush and his closest advisors and their Center for American Progress whose members going back to before his election had a new world order mindset?Peter Singer isn't a leftist guru that is taken seriously by many people. He is an eccentric college professor who doesn't have many followers at all. Sure he has written etc about animal rights and allowing newborn humans with medical problems to die, but his books aren't best sellers.Margaret Sanger actually did more good than harm since in the beginning she didn't support abortion on demand, but simply wanted safe reliable birth control so that women wouldn't bear children then neither wanted or couldn't afford to care for. Yes, for a brief period she spoke about eugenics, but to be fair many mainstream Republicans, Democrats, Protestants and others also were discussing the pros of eugenics. It was a phase like many new ideas.Fact is there have been and always will be provocative thinkers on all sides of a given issue. Most will be a phase society goes thru, and their thoughts and actions will barely make a blip on society or the world. The only true evil guru I can think of was Hitler and many of his views are more conservative or radical Republican than liberal Democrat or Socialist.Inside the book we are asked 'Why do well-educated antiwar activists call the president of the United States 'the new Hitler' and argue that the U.S. government orchestrated the September 11 attacks'? Maybe because of the Machiavellian mindset of President G W Bush? Because the United States has a history of running rough shod over other people, other countries and taking what they want? Our government encourages American corporations to rape other peoples lands, to take their oil, and rarely does it ever denounce human rights violations in these same countries as long as American companies/citizens can make a buck.It was one of the flaws of Ayn Rands thinking. I am pleased she was included since she has always appeared to be very hypocritical. Her philosophy as noted on the Ayn Rand Institute website was 'in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.' She felt that she should have anything she wanted yet heaven help the wife who disagreed with Rand on the subject of having an affair with the woman's husband."},{"Title":"Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas","review":"I sent this book back after reading the chapter on Leo Strauss, which repeats the left-wing canard that America's policy in Iraq is the result of \\"neocons\\" \\"hijacking\\" the Bush adminstration to pursue the \\"noble lie\\" that deposing Saddam was necessary for U.S. security, when they really wanted to create some sort of Platonic empire. This chapter could have come right out of a hit piece by Pat Buchanan or Michael Moore. This is what Flynn thinks is debunking misguided ideologies? Vilifying the men trying to defend our country?

He did not say flat out that it was completely wrong. His explanation was that it saved more people as a side effect. Yet numerous times he attacked people whose unethical means were self-justified due to some utopian end. Flynn thus attacked himself, go figure.When asked about the current Iraq war, he said \\"im against it\\", clarifying his position to a student. However, one reason given to invade by the U.S. was that Saddam was a dictator who killed his own people, and taking him out would naturally mean Iraqis would no longer be subject to his murderous ways, meaning lives would be saved. Therefore, to stay consistent with his own logic, why did he not say, \\"im conflicted about Iraq\\".I hate to be nit picking here, but Flynn is Fake."},{"Title":"The RETURN: THE RETURN","review":"The story starts as what would seem to be your typical romance where two people who meet and it is love at first sight.....Well it may start this way but stick with it. What you get is a book that had me in tears for most of the book. As with most of Ms. Heager's stories she doesn't write your typical ever after love story. For those of you who have read the Courtesan you will understand this. Once again she has created a character with class and morals who dispite her adversities has unwavering strength. The story centers on a newlywed couple who are seperated by a civil uprising in exotic country. After finding great love each are lead to believe that the other has died. Ten years pass before &quot;Charolette&quot; finds out that there was a horrible mistake and that her husband lives and has traveled back to England. Packed with only her heart and hope she travels only to find that he has again married....I'll let you finish the book. My only compliant is that in reading two of three books pinned by Ms.Heager the hero was somewhat weak and during the more trying of events we see it is the herione with the real strength. Not that this is news but in creating such great love stories it seems the hero's fall short of deserving such a great woman-wait maybe this is a biography and not fiction! Despite this small flaw the story is great and once you have gotten past the first few chapters your trapped-save a weekend or at least some down time as to not be interuppted.

There is nothing lifeless about Haeger's prose or her characters, especially in the bedroom scene early in the novel after Charlotte and Edward are married. But if that were all, the book would just be \\"another romance novel.\\" Instead I found this to be a complex and compelling novel with shades of Thomas Hardy in the latter half of the book, which is set in England.When Charlotte Langston discovers that the husband she thought was killed ten year earlier in the Indian mutiny is alive and living in England, she must go to him. Physically scarred, attractive but obviously no longer the great beauty she was at age 16, she has raised their son alone in India. Arriving in England, she discovers that Edward has remarried but she must be near him. She takes employment in his household and he does not recognize her. This is the weakest part of the book, as the wounds and their resulting faint scars do not sound as though they are so disfiguring that a husband would not recognize a beloved wife, even after ten years. However, if you can suspend your disbelief, this book is very worthwhile. The character of Anne, Edward's second wife, reminds me of the tragic Sue Brideshead in Hardy's \\"Jude the Obscure.\\" I am surprised that this book has not been reissued, as Haeger continues to publish and has a devoted following -- although not as large a one as she deserves."},{"Title":"The RETURN: THE RETURN","review":"\\"The Return\\" is a romance novel written by one of the queens of historical romance, Diane Haeger. The return of the title is the two main characters finding out that their supposedly dead spouse is not dead. Sounds like a plot of a stupid lifetime movie right? Well, it is. Completly.I could go on about how a 16 year old sheltered girl meeting a 34 year old British soldier is not love at first sight but really something like pedophilia-or complain about the unlikelihood of a man not recognizing his beloved (and supposedly dead) wife because she had cheekbone fractures, or talk about why a man whould stay with his unlawful second wife after finding out his first (and not dead, thus still his real wife) love is alive and well with a son, or any of the other weird things going on in this book- but I won't. It's not worth it.This book is written in a very boring style, with a stupid storyline that makes no sense, and an ending pulled strait out of extreme cheesy land. I can't say I'd recommend it, but I have read worse books, so two stars. This author can do better.

Quite an achievement."},{"Title":"Entrepreneur America: Lessons from Inside Rob Ryan's High-Tech Start-Up Boot Camp","review":"This is a well delayed review. I bought this book almost 10 years ago and I am reading some chapters again after becoming an entrepreneur myself.Let me start by quoting the advance praise for the book \\"Rob Ryan has a passion for business and a love for entrepreneurs\\". This is exactly the impression I got when I saw him at an event where he talked about entreprensurship, and had the luck to chat with him briefly. He impressed me as a brilliant, pragmatic and genuinely nice person. He is an extraordinarily successful entrepreneur, has the passion for entrepreneurship, know many entrepreneurs and has been helping many. Few have better credentials than him for writing about entrepreneurship.The book is essentially a complete guide for starting a tech firm and making it successful. Not only does it explain the principles, rules backed by solid examples from the author's own experience, but also provides detailed instructions including lists, tables, charts to drive a startup at different stages. One can start benefiting from the book before the inception of a firm, and continue it all the way till it reaches the top - a major player in a field.The book is geared toward startups seeking external funding, but the principles described in the book are equally applicable to bootstrapped startups and organically grown firms. For example, the required traits of an entrepreneur depicted by the book - intelligence, initiative, integrity, heart and willpower - are applicable to all startups. The sunflower model is a an enlightening way of planning products and services based on a firm's core competence.The book provides quite a few practical checklists such as Rob's Quality Dog Food Test for evaluating product ideas. I find the diagnosis of all kinds of wannabes such as quickie, dreamers, wonderful wacky MBA very interesting. If one observes with the list in mind, he can find plenty belonging to the list though not as many nowadays as during the dot-com bubble years.The 10X rule advocated by the book shows how realistic and experienced the author is. One may naively think if a new product from a startup is 2X better than those of a dominant vendor, the efficient free market would help sell them. The real fight for market share against established vendors is a tough one. Striving for 10X is a good way to start the battle.I have to mention that the book is also an easy and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Entrepreneur America: Lessons from Inside Rob Ryan's High-Tech Start-Up Boot Camp","review":"Very Clear, direct and practical KNOWLEDGE.

Buy one for each of the members on your entire team!"},{"Title":"Entrepreneur America: Lessons from Inside Rob Ryan's High-Tech Start-Up Boot Camp","review":"Several years ago, an article in Inc. magazine generated so much interest that it led to the publication of a book, Semper Fi, in which Dan Carrison and Rod Walsh advocate a \\"business boot camp\\" based on a model provided by the U.S. Marine Corps. In his own book, Ryan provides a number of invaluable \\"lessons\\" which can be learned by those who attend his High-Tech Start-up Book Camp in Montana. (Actually, these same \\"lessons\\" can be of great value to anyone else who is also involved with launching or developing a start-up company.) Ryan organizes his material within seven chapters, following an approach \\"built on my years of negotiating the peaks and valleys of running (and financing) a successful company. [He founded Ascend Communications in 1989. Under his leadership, its revenue climbed from $16-million to $1.3-billion in five years and was eventually purchased by Lucent Technologies for $22-billion in 1999.] It's a carefully staged process that beings with building the proper team and ends with managing your board of investors.\\" In Chapter 1, Ryan discusses several types of Entrepreneurial Wannabes. In subsequent chapters he guides his reader through the \\"carefully staged process\\" and concludes with an Epilogue in which he explains why only a few start-up companies make it and why most others don't.With all due respect to Ryan's insightful comments and recommendations, one of this book's greatest benefits is derived from the series of questions which he poses. For example, after a 3,000-mile journey from Boston to meet with Ryan at his Roaring Lion, one entrepreneur set up to present a slide presentation. Before it began, Ryan asked \\"Why would anyone want your product? What is the application? What is the value proposition to the customer? Who is the customer? Is anyone else doing this stuff, and are they successful?\\" You get the idea. Ryan seems to have too much respect for others' time and energy (as well as for his own) to beat around the proverbial bush. Throughout the book, he gets right to the point. Actually, to a number of separate but interrelated key points.This book reminds me of O'Toole's The Executive's Compass in the sense that reading that book is no substitute for partcipating in an Executive Seminar sponsored by the Aspen Institute. Similarly, reading Ryan's book is no substitute for participating in his boot camp in Montana. (I hasten to add, neither he nor O'Toole makes such a claim.) My own rather extensive prior experience with start-ups and already-ups suggests that it is extremely difficult to get honest (preferably frank) feedback from family members and friends. (Perhaps they do not want to hurt feelings. Perhaps they feel unqualified to express an opinion. Whatever.) As a result, the most important questions are often not asked...and therefore not answered. Ryan asks all manner of such \\"tough\\" questions, as previously indicated, and then (when he deems it appropriate) suggests some possible answers. If the unexamined life is not work living, the unexamined business idea is not worth developing.Although Ryan may not have had this objective in mind when writing this book with Phaedra Hise, it can also be of substantial value as a \\"reality check\\" for decision-makers in well-established businesses. Their answers to the cluster of questions may once have been correct when formulated but that is not necessarily true now.Whoever you are, whatever the size and nature of your organization, regardless of its location amidst what Adizes calls \\"corporate lifecycles\\", this book offers an \\"intellectual boot camp\\" in which I urge you to engage your mind ASAP."},{"Title":"Entrepreneur America: Lessons from Inside Rob Ryan's High-Tech Start-Up Boot Camp","review":"I must admit that I hadn't heard of this book or Rob when I started looking for advice on VC funding.

I get the impression that it was written more to promote the friends of the authors than to give an objective view of Feminist art. The Phaidon Press book,Art and Feminism (Themes & Movements), is MUCH better to the point that I am almost embarrassed to compare the two books.There is a school of Feminist research that seems to equate technical accomplishment with patriarchy which conveniently allows mediocre art to seem quite important. Overall, the art in this book lacks guts, although some of it is good. Since it is no longer the only book of its type, get it only if you want to round off your collection. Otherwise, stick with the Phaidon Press book to which this one merely pales in comparrison."},{"Title":"Power of Feminist Art: The American Movement of the 1970s History and Impact","review":"This is currently my favorite art book.

This book also chronicles this art movement and it effect on the 80's and very early 90's. Including many articles and thorough documentation of artwork this book is a smart look the amazing art that women created.This book is essential to truly understand modern art history."},{"Title":"Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game","review":"I ordered this book with high hopes, but at the same time, I had a nagging feeling that it might not be all it could. However, when I recieved it, I was most pleasantly surprisedLets start with the classes. This is not your traditional D20 D&amp;D game, I could tell that from the getgo when it did away completely with Bards, Clerics, Druids, Paladins, Monks, and Rangers. The Core classes available to players are the standard Fighter, Barbarian, Wizard, Sorceror, and Rogue...with an additional Three new classes added. These are the Healer - A new version of the cleric with more sphere restrictions - The Scout - Personally I feel this class is what rangers should have been - and the Tinker - An inventor skilled at using a variety of odd gadgets. Why are these class changes a big deal? Because WarCraft D20 puts emphasis on Prestige classes like no other D20 D&amp;D game I've ever seen.This is a game where Prestige classes are used properly, there's more reason to work at a prestige class, in many cases it's essential to do so. For Example, Wizards and Sorcerors don't have access to the Necromancy and Conjuration spheres, to get these spells, they need to take the corresponding magic-user prestige class that'd give them access. Paladins are now a prestige class as well, which is something many of us have always felt it should be - afterall, that's the sort of thing that you grow into, you shouldn't start as a Paladin. Some of the prestige classes included in this book are the Druid of the Wild, Shaman, Mounted Warrior, Paladin, and a slew of others. Each prestige class is nicely built and one can tell they didn't simply throw these together, a fault that many D&amp;D suppliments have suffered from.The races in the book are quite colorful, and have much more flavor than your traditional D&amp;D races - at least that's how I felt. Orcs, Goblins, Tauren, Night Elves, High Elves, Humans, Half-Orcs, and Half-Elves are all included, each of them appearing genuinely interesting and fun to play.As for the setting, it's quite nice, and has all of the flair of the WarCraft world. The only major downfall of the book that I've been able to find is that the maps aren't all that great - This is why I gave it a 4 star rating. I'm hoping one of the upcoming releases for this campaign gives us better maps of Azeroth. The artwork however is splendid, and some of it will be familiar to those veterans of the RTS games.Overall I'd say this book is worth a buy if you're a fan of WarCraft or if you'd like a new - and unique - D&amp;D setting to play in. There's an abundance of new material in here that makes the purchase worthwhile - the invention rules alone are worth it. Lets put it this way. After I bought the book I had a desire to immediatly begin working on a campaign to run, but I was worried I wouldn't be able to find anyone who'd want to play in the setting of a video game series. However, once I gave my gaming group a chance to flip through the pages, several of them were demanding that I run a game sometime soon. This isn't a shoddy tossed together joke of a campaign like the Diablo books, this is a solid, well thought out, colorful world, that is quite easily one of the best D&amp;D settings out there right now."},{"Title":"Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game","review":"At first I was uncertain about this book, but I was pleasantly surprisd. Unlike the diablo rpg conversions which tried too hard to force the computer game into an rpg form and ended up with a barely playable copy of the computer game, Warcraft takes the Warcraft setting and adapts it for d20 wonderfully.Instead of seeming forced, this book provides an excellent system that fans of either d20 or Warcraft should appreciate, without detracting from the quality of either game."},{"Title":"Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game","review":"Admittedly when I heard about a Warcraft setting being made I was skeptical.

A wealth of information is given on the basic aspects needed to start and understand a Warcraft campaign, short of monsters of course.The modified classes are simply changed but in a manner that makes for a fairly different experience, and the prestiges are for once actually worth aiming for.The influence of Blizzard on the setting is very apparent and something to be thankful for, though some changes are given for the most part it truly carries the feel of the Warcraft world game players have come to enjoy.Definately a good addition to anyones dnd Library."},{"Title":"Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game","review":"I ordered this book with high hopes, but at the same time, I had a nagging feeling that it might not be all it could.

So we ordered this book, with an uneasiness about it being based on a game. After recieving it we carefully removed it and began to play. It was much better than our expectations, and seemed like everything 3.5 should have been in a warcraft universe. Many classes are made prestige, and there are interesting starting classes. The setting is interesting and entertaining and is a nice breath of fresh air compared to others. The supplements for this series also add new and interesting features. I would recomend going for the newer book, World Of Warcraft RPG. It may have returned some prestige classes to core classes, but they still play the way they should. This almost justifies the 3.5 update, as it is required to play."},{"Title":"Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game","review":"This RPG setting is sure to be a favorite of every Warcraft fan.It provides a lot of lore information, and it was made with Blizzard's input so it is &quot;cannon&quot;.

I previously played Forgotten Realms, but got tired of the setting because it lacked &quot;color.&quot; I'd definitely say the Warcraft RPG has &quot;color,&quot; and that's what counts.My two complaints: The tinker's technology creation abilities are way way too open to exploitation as they currently stand. I'd advise a DM to carefully lay out for his players what they can and can't create to avoid unbalancing a campaign.Also, I wish this book had more information. For example, the necromancer prestige class, the blood elf race, and the gnome race are three very important parts of the Warcraft universe but they were not included in this book. Instead they can be found in the Alliance and Horde Compendium. You pretty much need this book, the A&amp;HC, and the Warcraft Monster Manual to run a campaign."},{"Title":"Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game","review":"I am not a person who enjoys Tabletop Roleplaying.

It concerns one of the stranger human sagas of the last century, that of the discovery and destruction of a remote Inuit society, the Ihalmiut, in Canada's north. The setting of the book is far enough away in time for us to marvel at how little things have changed since. The contemptuous attitude of European man for the aborigine seems hardly to have altered over the years. We are still hard put to understand the needs of the first peoples and how to answer them.Farley Mowat has combined a fine sensitivity for the natural environment with a sharp eye for the details of man's place within it. It must be exceedingly rare in the history of anthropology that such an inexperienced investigator has taken such pains to get to the source of his information. Mowat lived among the Ihalmiut for over a year to write the book. During that time he witnessed the rapid deterioration of the small group which remained, and tried to examine the causes of their decline. With very deft prose for such a young writer, he points out the difference between the intentions and the actions of the European discoverers of The People (as they refer to themselves) and the consequences of such disparity. The Ihalmiut were exploited in much the same way as any other tribal band found wandering by the early explorers. However, as Mowat points out, this was an exceptional group which had survived the extreme rigours of a barren land (known to us simply as The Barrens) for so many generations, only to be felled by contact with the very race which might have provided them with so much assistance.The Ihalmiut are long gone from their homeland but their story serves to remind us of our often difficult relationship with the land and the people on it. Perhaps, as a race of city-dwellers, we need to consider our place in the natural environment more than ever. Mowat's work is a just accounting of where we stand in relationship to nature. Nor does he suggest that we should all go and live in the tundra. Yet People of the Deer is a source of considerable inspiration for those now ready to reflect on the unbalancing effect of contemporary values."},{"Title":"People of the Deer","review":"This book is magic. You will never think about a small band of Indians as statistics again. This book does volumes to make people of our society really feel what goes on in traditional societies. To feel jealous of their solidarity. To feel unloved by our own. It's great! READ IT."},{"Title":"People of the Deer","review":"Farley Mowat tells how the Ihalmiut people of the Arctic have struggled since their first contact with the white man. This is an enduring reminder to us all of how western civilization remains aloof to the plight of races it has exploited. Poignant and powerful, it should be mandatory reading in all schools and colleges."},{"Title":"People of the Deer","review":"A truly insightful story of the inland eskimo people of the Canadian Arctic. It details not only their day to day survival in a harsh land, but also tells of their myths, legends, and history. It also tells of the whiteman's interference with their culture and how that affect may ultimately lead to their extinction. The book sincerely takes the reader into the lives of the People of the Deer."},{"Title":"People of the Deer","review":"In many ways, this is Farley Mowat's most enduring book. It tells the true story of a Native American people killed by modernization--a brutal story that should make us think when we preach human rights and respect for others' cultures--not that our failings preempt us from speaking out, but as an injection of humility. I first read this book 20 years ago and it has stuck with me since them. I'm really sorry that it's out of print because it makes a great gift."},{"Title":"People of the Deer","review":"One of the best and most realistic stories of the artic I've ever sunk my teeth into. If you like Jack London you'll love this one"},{"Title":"People of the Deer","review":"When published in 1951 this book was a cry for help - not just to help the Ihalmiut but to help ourselves. A well crafted book of one man's understanding, in a limited way, of the hard, harsh life of the Eskimos who live along side the deer, the lakes, and the spirits of the Barrens. The book is full of his memories, some sad, some wonderful. We get images of summer, with its life, the birds, eggs, and kids going out with toy slings to help gather food. We learn about the way the People lived, worked, and loved inside their families and society. We hear their tales of where they came from, how the animals were brought into the world by a woman, and how dangerous it is for men, both to their body and their soul, when they are all alone. Once there were thousands of them - sharing their tools, enjoying the raw meat of the kill, enjoying the happiness of never needing anything.Wonderful. Depressing. Sad. Lovely. Is there anything we can still do about this? Is there anything we can do for ourselves?"},{"Title":"People of the Deer","review":"Before reading this book, I would never have believed it would receive all 5 stars. However, it is truly beautifully written about the death of a people. The author - who lived with the tribe for 2 years to attempt to understand the people from their point of view - did an expert job of recanting what happened, how it happened. He makes a very determined attempt to see things differently than his point of view. My opinion is that he succeeds in doing so.Though a sociologist, the book is luridly written. It is easy for one to visualize what the writer is experiencing. In modern times, you'd expect such good writing from travel journalist/book writers. Here it is holey unexpected and appreciated.A wonderful book about the encroachment of modernization and it's mal-effects on an unsuspecting people.Finally, I always attempt to address the low star ratings in my own reviews. I'm not quite sure why someone would completely hate this book. The middle ratings appear to question the validity of the author's experience. While I am no expert on this topic, I would say that it might not matter if it's true. The message, particularly given it was written in 1947, is well conveyed. If you are an academic and hard-core sociologist, you might have an issue if there is some controversy surrounding the author's sincerity in methodology."},{"Title":"People of the Deer","review":"If you've read any of Farley Mowat's books, this one will excite you as much as any of the others.

It move within the people of the inuit. These inland eskimos are an indigeounous people whose population has been diminishing. The influence on the environment as well as the impact on the caribou herds has been putting these people at risk to where they now near extinction and a loss of their way of life.Beautifully written, the tundra and the barrens comes to life.A wonderful read!"},{"Title":"People of the Deer","review":"\\"People of the Deer\\" is apparently Farley Mowat's first book and one of his best. He lived for a year amongst the Ihalmiut, an Inuit people Mowat refers to as \\"People of the Deer\\" although they regarded themselves, as have many aborigonal people, as simple \\"The People.\\"They are people of the deer--caribou--because, unlike other Inuit groups they are not sea hunters but, instead predators of the migratory caribou herds. The herds have declined in numbers but not as much as the Ihalmiut. From a population high of around 7,000 they had, by Mowat's time, declined to only 40. Why? The impact of European Civilization is too simple of a generalization but, in the Ihalmiut, a people almost extinct, we see the fate of millions.Native Americans have little or no immunity to Old World diseases. You probably don't have to go much deeper than this. Sure there was alcohol and cultural deterioration but, first and foremost, there is disease. It wasn't deliberate but it came when the first white man and/or African stepped shore in the Americas. Probably the Inhalmiut were slightly luckier than many. Many tribes died out without a trace. Estimates [read '1491'] that as many as 90% of native americans died as the result of unintentionally introduced European diseases.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico"},{"Title":"People of the Deer","review":"The concept is correct anyway. These people were led to their demise by three factors: the church, commercialization (HBC), and the Canadian government. Mowat claims he spent two years living among these people. This is doubted by some. I've traveled in some of the areas that this book takes place. Not everyone has great things to say about this author. One person I talked to called him a historical novelist. He has other nicknames.But while it is questionable that all the events described in this book and its' successor (The Desperate People) actually took place, at least he got the main theme correct."},{"Title":"People of the Deer","review":"What ever you do, do not waste your precious life reading this book..."},{"Title":"New View of Society: Or, Essays on the Formation of the Human Character Preparatory to the Development of a plan for gradually ameliorating the Condition of Mankind","review":"Robert Owen, born in Wales, was the first one to think about socialism as a social order to obtain excellence in the work place. He wrote his book in 1816 and it changed the climate in manufacturing. No child labor under 10 years of age! A day off of work once a week! Study and be all you can be...a better educated work force gives better results. He saw these ideas working in a closed community around a manufacturing plant. He tried his ideas in Scotland and the community failed. He then tried it in Indiana (USA) and that failed. Apparently people in the workforce wanted to have the luxury of owning their own house, and reaping the profits of their labor. These ideas did have a field to sprout in...slavery in Mississippi. The closed society of slavery was perfect for socialism. Your work force improves themselves and they work for the betterment of all. These ideas were exposed in the book\\"In Pursuit Of A Dream\\" by J Herman. Joseph Davis, older brother of Jefferson Davis, met Owens in Indiana and read his books. Joseph Davis became a convert and used these ideas on his plantation, Hurricane Plantation, south of Vicksburg, MS. When the war ended...the closed community of slavery ended and Owens ideas failed and were replaced with Capitalism. The Owen trained slaves moved to Mound Bayou, MS and continued to try to better themselves as members of this community, but the residents owned their own land, homes, and profits...and Owens socialism ideas failed again and replaced by capitalism. Owen is important as the Father of Socialism and improvements in the work place.

It goes deep into the impressions of his own family that he formed as a child and refined as he grew up.He shares with us his many mistakes, as well as the background to some of his greatest successes - which nominally, are his many great films.But somehow more important than this is the way he approaches his life and how he tells his own story. At one point he is discussing what actually constitutes the 'style' of a writer and what makes it distinctive. He concludes that what is called a writer's style is straightforwardly a unique artefact of how that person thinks and feels about their life and experience.This book is full of a polished but intimate candour that illuminates and compliments his long and successful career in film"},{"Title":"An Open Book","review":"Not only has he been one of my favorite directors over the years, he did some great acting spots, particularly in Chinatown. Then to have this book to read is truely a window into his life. He gives one bit of advice. Has to do with smoking, I won't spoil it for you. Witty guy. I think we tend to forget that films are visual/written/audio stories that several people have put together. A piece of art, typically. And the director is the eye of the hurricane, piecing it all together, in his (her) vision. This book gives us a look into both his private life, one which the citizen today likely has little idea about, as well as numerous stories about various Hollywood people he worked with over the decades. I could barely put this book down. He's got a writing style that's so comfortable, so enjoyable to read, well, maybe it was more fun for me because, in my mind I heard his resonate speaking voice reading the whole book like one on tape by the author. There's never been a director like him that I'm aware of, someone who did not have his own style so much as cull the story right out of the block of stone so to speak. Each of the great films he did has their own vision, their own look. A great accomplishment for a real director who mastered his craft. I think of him as a man's man and this book keeps that sense alive. Sure am glad he took the time to write it because it's a lot of fun to explore his life with him. Unique places, people and times in American cinematic history, and he was there, right in the midst of it all. chrisbct@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"An Open Book","review":"I bought this book originally in the early 1980s right after it was printed and I have re-read it every year and a half or so since and find new things every time. The writing is just fantastic; each episode in his life is constructed like a story. I have read where people think it is a whitewash, but actually he touches on everything discreetly and without rancor or salaciousness. When I first read it as a young film student he cataloged a string of movies I had barely heard of, mostly because they weren't easily available until now. A conscientious watching of the films he mentions makes for great companions to the book. From our vantage point in time, this book is also a window into a vanished world where the late 19th century was reluctantly becoming the 20th century, and Huston always was searching to find his place in it. Few people live lives now similar to his life then because we don't have the times from which great lives spring like they did back then. Those decades gave rise to Bogart and Hemingway and Picasso and Roosevelt and the countless others because there were no other choices. Dynamic times make dynamic people! Huston constantly improvised, both in life and art, using his unique background and fine literary sensibilities to surf the constantly changing tides of war and economic depression and modernism, and at the same time constantly indulging himself in every way he could possibly conceive. His movies emerged from this mix, at times wise, at others mischievous; some daring, others fantastic. They were always a little ahead of their time or form, and they never consciously talked down nor pandered to their audience. His innovations developed organically. His breakthrough preference for remote location shooting stemmed from his experiences making documentaries in the battlefield during WWII. His arrangements of characters and objects in the frame came from his love of painting and still composition. His unusual choices for stories grew from his voluminous reading habits. Huston's natural curiosity and striving for perfection filled-in the spaces left between.Some of Huston's films, like \\"The Maltese Falcon\\", are models of perfection, while others are like Michelangelo's scores of unfinished sculptures, almost as if he were saying, \\"Well, you get the idea!\\" before moving on to the next object of his fascination. \\"We Were Strangers\\" is a good example of this, rendering almost hypnotically the feelings of oppressive paranoia living in a fascist state, while at the same time servicing a story that is a B+ at best.The real story of Huston's life and films has yet to be written though. There is just too much!"},{"Title":"An Open Book","review":"I can't remember when I enjoyed reading a book so much. I wished that I could read it anew all over again. I've read half dozen Hollywood bios and autos the last 6 months or so and this was hands down the most enjoyable!I'm really quite surprised to see only two reviews before this one. Afterall, in my mind Huston ranks up there with the very best of American directors and screen writers. His history in the film business dates back to the ''golden era'' of Hollywood. And he knew all the top heads of the studios as well as many of the most talented people in the their related fields.He is of course my overall favorite director, based on the quality and sheer number of films on his side of the scale. High Sierra [Scrnply], Maltese Falcon, the Big Sleep, Treasure of Sierra Madre, Key Largo just to mention a few of the early ones. And of course his writing of screenplays of the late thirties that anyone will recognize as some of the best of the classics. And his continued writing of movies; with and without directing, far to many to start listing here!His relating of his life stories as told here is so captivating and so 'dog gone' interesting and funny, that I felt I was listening to a grandfather tell his life story from the front porch of a family home on a Sunday afternoon!Anyone that likes to read of a Hollywood long gone and about the people in the industry in those days would do just fine in getting a copy of this wonderfully entertaining book, told by one of Hollywoods finest raconteurs! If not the finest!"},{"Title":"An Open Book","review":"Here are some great annecdotes (Bogart, Hepburn, Lorrie, Connery, et al.) by one of Hollywood's greatest directors. Huston's private life rivals any script that he ever shot, and his skill and training as a scriptwriter makes this an interesting, articulate volume."},{"Title":"An Open Book","review":"The other reviewers are on the money, this is a fabulous & highly readable memoir from a great director who lived an amazing life.But for me there is a shortcoming, and it is that short shrift is given to his later films. While his earlier films are given a fair amount of coverage, I got the feeling that towards the end of the book the writer simply ran out of steam (he was of an advanced age when he wrote it) & so there aren't many stories forthcoming about his later works, in particular the early seventies works like Fat City, Mackintosh Man, The Man Who Would Be King etc.Still, it is an essential book for any film fan."},{"Title":"An Open Book","review":"He started out in his father's footsteps as an actor at age 4. He got into writing from one of his mentors. He came to Hollywood as a writer, then branched out into acting and directing. His artistic talent enabled him to schetch out how seans were to be play and cut down the shooting time considerablely. One of his first pictures was directing the \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" Bogie got the part when the original actor didn't want to take a chance with a new director. He and Bogie (and Betty) were close friends until Bogarte died.In his book he is frank to admit he did some dumb things. He rationalized that everyone has his bad moments, and didn't let those things (like 5 marriages, etc)drag him down.His profesional writing skills make his autobiography good reading."},{"Title":"An Open Book","review":"Clearly the most interesting memoir written by an entertainer I've had the pleasure to read.

Nothing conventional here."},{"Title":"Adultery: The Forgivable Sin","review":"Here's a look at reality. This book delves into family history, and psychology. This is more often than not the root cause of adultery so it's important to look at this and understand it.I appreciated the line in the forward by Thomas F. Fogarty M.D. &quot;Indeed, the legacy of adultery may affect those not even born at the time of the affair.&quot;The authors examine the degree of work and commitment necessary to achieve a happy long lasting union. Self-examination is at the core.Chapter six helps to take away the blind naive notions of romantic love. What can happen when a person does not deal with their own emptiness? They never find real life love and may turn to an affair to relive temporary passion and escape conflict.I found this book to be quite valuable. It states that adultery is never ok. It covers much of the hard cold truths of betrayal. I think most people wouldn't venture into this if they were informed as to the magnitude of damage it can cause. It's not about two people. It's often about many, many people including children. You can't get happiness at the expense of others, and you can't get it by running from yourself.Through my own personal experience,(the betrayed spouse), I found this book to be accurate, helpful, and grounded in reality."},{"Title":"Adultery: The Forgivable Sin","review":"After being with my husband for a total of 5 years and having our first child, i found out he was having an affair with a girl from work. He eventually realized his mistake and came home, but we still struggled with this. we went to counseling, and this was the book our counselor suggested. it really helps you deal with what happened and why. If you are in love with your spouse who has been unfaithful, it gives perspective into both sides and makes you look deep into yourself to decide whether you can forgive or not. we have since had our second daughter and are looking forward to many happy years together with our family and without the &quot;affair&quot; hanging over our marriage. this book is a great one for anyone going through the feelings of mistrust, hurt, anger or anything with infidelity!"},{"Title":"Adultery: The Forgivable Sin","review":"Pro's - I think this book attempts to show a betrayed spouse that an affair really has nothing to do with the betrayed -I commend the author for that. An affair is not a symptom of a marriage, but a recreation of childhood struggles, hurts, behaviors and dysfunction. Compassion seems to be the overriding theme of the book.Con's -Though the author puts the roots of infidelity in childhood hurts, there is the contradiction that the betrayed spouse should take responsibility for their part in the affair. I think this is an ill attempt at simply stating that there is dysfunction in the relationship, and the dynamics of the dysfunctional dance need to be looked at. Stating that dysfunction in a relationship makes the betrayed partly responsible for the affair is blame shifting There are plenty of people in dysfunctional relationships who CHOOSE not to cheat. I feel as if the authors thoughts on compassion could be confused with putting the betraying spouses well being before your own and encouraging codependency, especially for those who are in an abusive relationship and accustomed to gas-lighting and blame shifting.Personal Thoughts-The idea that the betrayed partner has any responsibility in an affair is ludicrous. We can no more control someone else's actions or behaviors than we can control if we are the victim of a crime. We can live in safe neighborhoods, be on the lookout for suspicious characters, park in well lit parking lots, and take all the precautions necessary to keep ourselves safe. Yet, if a perpetrator has chosen to rob us, no precautions we take, can stop them from making that choice. To blame ourselves for someone else's selfish, self serving choice is destructive to our well being.On compassion: Compassion helps us understand why people make the choices they do, but problems can not be solved with compassion alone. We can have all the compassion in the world for a straying partner, but if they are not willing to change, we are still in the same situation. At some point, compassion can become the catalyst for continued betrayal and abuse.If we strip away all the reasons, justifications and rationalizations from an affair, what we are left with is a person who is afraid of conflict / emotions and have a sense that they are entitled no matter what the cost to others. This egocentric view is the major contributor to the relationship dysfunction. No amount of compassion can make them change and face those fears and dysfunction. If cheaters were healthy in this area, any perceived problem in the relationship (which they say led them to an affair) would have been on the table - actively being worked through. Instead the cheater chose to run from their feelings/problems into a fantasy where they were perceived as wonderful and validated for doing nothing other than lying about who they are (contrary to popular opinion, great, wonderful people of integrity don't cheat.) Cheaters don't want to have to do the hard work it would take (in their primary relationships) to be perceived as fantastic, fascinating and wonderful. They think it should just be handed to them with no effort on their part. This isn't to say that a cheater can't change this, THEY can (but you can't CHANGE THEM)Bottom line - All affairs are different, but all are because of some pain in the cheaters life. Often after much soul searching a cheater will see they have taken the lead in the dysfunctional relationship dance. Attributing the self induced pain of a cheater as the betrayed's fault is destructive, unethical and blaming the victim.If the pain is because the cheater is not in love with their spouse, but is afraid to leave - it's time to grow up and face the problem. Instead of inflicting a painful, destructive and abuse wound in hopes you'll avoid being the \\"bad guy or gal\\" ending the relationship.If it is because they feel unappreciated - it is their job to communicate their feeling to their spouse.If it is because of ************* (fill in the blank), it is their job to address it.Your spouse is not a mind reader, and assuming that they know you are not happy, have low-self esteem, aren't happy in the marriage, or whatever your \\"issue\\" is, the bottom line is you are an adult and responsible for communicating your wants and needs. Having an affair to escape your problems is a cowards way out. It is not your spouses fault you can't communicate your needs/feelings/desires in an honest and forthright manner."},{"Title":"Adultery: The Forgivable Sin","review":"Trying to understand a parent's infidelity, I bought this book and it WOWED me.

Why not start at the source? It's a sad, sad day indeed when it takes Hollywood to get people to sit down with a good, classic book. Etcetera etcetera. Well, here I am, guilty of much the same, the karmic consequences of my snobbery having come back around to bite me. Years ago I saw the film \\"Kwaidan\\" (based on Lafcadio Hearn's retellings of traditional Japanese ghost tales) and loved it, and that's basically what inspired me to read \\"In Ghostly Japan\\" here. Which means that I was misled by the title just a bit, for this book is a mixed bag of short pieces, some of which are ghost tales but many of which are not, or not exactly anyway. This was a pleasant surprise, however. Hearn writes of Buddhism in real, down-to-earth Japanese culture (for this, if anything, is the overarching theme of the miscellany, the ghost stories being folkloric examples of Buddhist causality and karma) in an eloquent, personal style redolent of the Romantic flowing rhythms of late 19th-century prose but undergirded by a very solid but understated, unpretentious erudition. The guy knows what he's talking about. His keenly observant and sympathetic eye catches how Buddhism really operates in the Japanese imagination and how it manifests in proverbs and customs and such, but he then goes on to shed much light on these phenomena by analyzing and interpreting them in terms of formal Buddhist scriptures and doctrines--all of which sounds like pretty dry stuff, but it's actually enjoyable and fascinating, even entertaining, due to Hearn's wonderful presentation. Somehow he transcended the tired, misleading \\"great tradition\\"/\\"little tradition\\" dichotomy (a.k.a. the elite/folk religion dichotomy) before it even started and deftly avoided the twin pitfalls of Anthropology and Buddhist Studies early in the game--all without a bunch of tedious methodological navel-meditating. And what's more, he did so in style! The spooky tales of the karmically unquiet are cool too, of course. Once you start reading, there's not a ghost of a chance you'll be able to put this book down."},{"Title":"In ghostly Japan, (Selected works of Lafcadio Hearn's first edition)","review":"The title is somewhat misleading.

What I totally love about his work is that he is so skilled at bringing detail and authenticity to a story that it's a surprise upon realizing that the stories are fiction. He's a master!"},{"Title":"Winter Count","review":"This collection of ten early short stories by Barry Lopez seems written more than a little under the influence of Borges. Elegantly told, they are designed to evoke a deep sense of wonder in the reader. The settings are often remote - the open prairie, the desert - and touch on what feel like the remote worlds of other cultures and other times, especially Native American.The title story refers to the Indian practice of keeping a record of tribal history by representing the one most significant event of each year as a picture on a buffalo robe. In this story, a modern-day scholar immersed in the subject of this lost tradition is himself lost and out of place at a conference of academics.One man becomes fascinated by a French mansion built on the Montana-North Dakota border in the 1860s. Another, an early explorer of the West, attempts to uncover the mystery of a disappearing river in 1840s Nebraska. Still another, in the 1960s - like a chapter out of Castaneda - finds an Indian in the Arizona desert, who conjures a vision of the universe from an arrangement of stones lying in the sand. In the small-scale domesticities of modern fiction, it's hard to find imaginative writing of this kind. I highly recommend these stories as an escape from the everyday and the ordinary."},{"Title":"Winter Count","review":"Winter Count, like other works by Barry Lopez, presents crisp, tight writing. No word wasted. And, like other pieces, Lopez has an eye for the subtle-mystical, and the material interface between person and environment, whatever each may be. He provides us glimpses of the sparks, or mystery, or wonder, or tragedies that are present at those instances of contact that happen as human beings move through time and space. Finding a book binder out among the antelope; wild birds who visit both city and the most remote corners of the earth; rivers that disappear; peoples who do not comprehend one another in the midst of the same environment, all of these are real tensions and contrasts that are all around us, and taking time to live in the instances of contact may illuminate many eternal as well as idiosyncratic truths as yet undiscovered."},{"Title":"Winter Count","review":"The mood in Lopez's collection of short stories leaves one with this lingering feeling...one which I cant quite put my finger on. The mood set in his writing is calm, but the vivid descriptions of his words force vibrant, elaborate pictures to be sketched into the mind...so much so, that, although my body fell into a cozy, drowsy, PEACEFUL serenity as I read, my brain was still trying to cope with the force of colorful images invading it. A truly magnificent writer, one who incorporates the views of those from all around the globe, those of different backgrounds and lifestyles, and snugly wraps their individual stories together to form one great one through nature."},{"Title":"Collections two","review":"This is the second time I have purchased this book.

She claimed its origin was on ribs 2-4. Hertling &amp; Kessler, McGee, Snell, Grays, Netter, Trevel, Beil, Tortora, 2 different muscle testing books, two different kinesiology books, and personal experience with cadavers say that pectoralis minor originates on ribs 3-5!This would have been inconsequential except that her reason for treating pec minor was to SPECIFICALLY MOBILIZE THE SECOND RIB. This means she was using pec minor's erroneous attachment as a BASIS for treatment. Upon further review of this book, I have found it is littered with simular errors. With all of the author's training, she doesn't seem to have a grasp on rudementary aspects of knowledge. With that being said, I cannot trust the knowledge contained in this book or any of her volumes.One other point: Throughout the book she constantly &quot;buffs-up&quot; her form of treatment; as if to try to convince me on how revolutionary this method is. She has many many trademarked names for new things (all of which have been found in other disciplines; specifically craniosacral therapy/myofacial release and any routine positional release book), and many instances where she reiterates how new and involved IMT is.

'Basil' is an earlier yet surprisingly mature work, and it is not a suspense novel. 'Basil' chronicles the life of a young, foolish man who falls in love (literally) at first sight with a young woman. He then discovers, too late, that this 'sweet young thing' is not as she first appeared. The author captures Basil's anguish perfectly. While some people might find the entire story to be a bit contrived, I found the emotional element of writing to greatly outweigh this 'love at first' kitsch.So in conclusion, 'Basil' should have a wider appeal beyond the Wilkie Collins fan club.

Basil was so stricken by her beauty that he followed the beautiful stranger home and with the help of a family servant managed to coax his way into Margaret's life.The Sherwin family were simple shop keepers. Mr Sherwin owned a linen draper's shop. When he learned that the son of a gentlemen with a family name dating back to Norman times expressed interest in his daughter, he was more than happy to encourage the union.Basil's father, however, was extremely proud of his family lineage and expected his sons to follow and respect their family history. Margaret's beauty won over Basil's family obligations. Without the consent of his father he marries Margaret in secret.After marrying Margaret, Basil realizes that something is not quite right in the Sherwin household. Margaret's moods change with the wind. Each and every person in the home seem to be keeping a secret.I found the novel extraordinary! The readers are immediately aware that Basil's marriage to Margaret was his undoing, but the events unfold slowly and tragically.I don't think I will ever hear the names Basil and Margaret and not think of his novel. It was absolutely haunting!"},{"Title":"Basil: A novel (Wilkie Collin's novels)","review":"The words leapt off the pages with such simplicity and exquisite writing style that I absorbed the story effortlessly and with the utmost of interest, suspense and enjoyment. The story line was typical in some ways, love, betrayal, the bad guys die and the good guys learn a lifelong lesson but the intricacies and descriptions flowed and mesmerized me. I'm getting carried away but that's how I felt, I was carried away into the world of the characters and the realistic portrayal of their minds and motivations."},{"Title":"Basil: A novel (Wilkie Collin's novels)","review":"This is the fourth novel I've read by Wilkie Collins, and each time I read one I find myself wondering just why he's become such an unknown. Basil is such a tragic hero that I found myself commiserating with him way too many times - his misfortune to fall in love at first sight, and the deal he makes with the woman's father, lead to disastrous consequences, and I found the writing incredibly believable from start to finish. I wish some brave publisher would take the plunge and re-publish his lesser-known novels at a decent price."},{"Title":"Basil: A novel (Wilkie Collin's novels)","review":"This book is very odd.

It's a little more strange than his others in his characterizations, but, like the others, I couldn't put it down until I finished it. The air of mystery in all his books keeps you reading - because you just have to know!! But, the movie?! Forget about it. No resemblance to the book, and I thought poorly done.

If anything, its probably showing its age -- it was published in 1852. Today, we don't expect our men -- or women for that matter -- to fall into a swoon at the drop of the hat. I think the subject matter is still very current -- I think too many people fall in love with love, or lust, and marry people that they haven't really gotten to know and all too soon they feel trapped in a marriage that is not what they envisioned it would it (and which rarely is achievable).

However, it is dated and smacks with too much of a religous polemic to really only evangelize, instead of celebrate a person's life. Funeral Services are not to used to take a vulnerable and captive audience to try to evangelize the survivors, friends, and visitors as directly and squarely as most ministers do. Funeral Services are the time to try to scare people into heaven, and it is not the time to give a full length \\"preaching and invitation.\\" It is simply the time to celebrate a person's life and their passing from this life into heaven. Too many of these books are too religious and Jesus Christ would not allow and does not tell ministers to hold the types of services that only evangelize, preach, and make themselves look good at another's expense. Jesus would celebrate the person's life and their entrance into heaven and that is the type of sermons that need to be in these types of books."},{"Title":"Shaarei Teshuva: = The Gates of repentance (The Torah classics library)","review":"This is a major work of medieval Jewish moral philosophy.

As I type this, I'm listening to Fred Wilpon talk about how Art Howe is going to turn the Mets around. This after the 2002 Mets, the team with the third highest payroll in baseball, finished last in the National League East.My thoughts, naturally, turn to this book.At the end of the abyssmal 1992 season for the New York Mets, Bob Klapisch and John Harper--beat writers for the NY Post and NY Daily News--felt the need to rant, to give the fans the necessary information to answer the question \\"how could this have happened?\\" The highest payrolled team in the history of baseball, the team that made Bobby Bonilla the highest paid player ever, finished with the third lowest record in the National League. I mean, we had David Cone, Dwight Gooden and Sid Fernandez in our starting rotation! We got Bobby Bonilla to replace Darryl Strawberry! That ring should have been ours!Any Met fan reading the above knows what happened on the surface (and what continued to happen in 1993 and --UCK-- 1994), but the deeper story is nastier still.This book lifts the rock on the Mets and what is crawling underneath is not pretty. The egos alone are ridiculous, but throw in the infighting, the firecrackers, the rape accusations, the press lockouts, and the non-stop party attitude that looks from here like Animal House without the humor.You've got to feel sorry for Jeff Torborg and Buddy Harrelson, who didn't have a chance with this pack. As you'll see, though, the owner and General Managers also get their due.NOW I want to see the 2002 edition of this book. This book proved to me that there is tons of stuff that go on behind the scenes. What happened in 2002?It's also nice to reminisce about a time when sports writers didn't pull as many punches with their writing. Nobody is spared; the GM, the owners, past managers, players, etc.Not to knock ESPN which is not local enough, or radio commentary like \\"Mike & The Maddog\\" which I believe to be too much a mouthpiece of the team, but this book also stands up as a testament to newspaper coverage which goes into more and better detail than cable can offer.These guys bled Blue and Orange every day from spring training to the end of the year because it was their job. When that blood went bad, they wrote this book. As a Met fan, let me say \\"Thank You\\". This book takes that coverage to the next power. It is something you do not see enough of.The only real flaw in this book is that it could have been a little better organized. The chronology is a bit vague; background-setting flashbacks show up and go on for pages until you've forgotten what you're getting background on. It is a minor quip, though, and I didn't even notice it until subsequent readings.This book will probably shock you, but you should still pick it up."},{"Title":"The Worst Team Money Could Buy","review":"Bobby Valentine once said something like, \\"They play 162 seasons a year in New York,\\" and that statement pretty much sums up a baseball man's attitude toward the press. One morning--in April, yet--the season's blown and the reporters are offering up postmortems. The next day, after a victory, the team's back on the right track. Having read New York sportswriting for the past thirty years I can pretty much understand why a ballplayer might want to strangle reporters. They frustrate _me_ with their insistence on answers to questions like, \\"Why'd you groove that fastball?\\" or \\"What made you drop that ball?\\" Who knows. Who cares. It's that sort of \\"hard-nosed\\" reporting that's bred the current generation of colorless and introspective ballplayers who talk in platitudes about \\"getting the job done.\\" And as authors Klapisch and Harper inadvertantly show, much of the reporters' antagonistic attitude stems from the huge salaries players earn. You can fall on one side of this issue or the other. I've always thought the players should earn whatever the market will bear, whether they're schmucks or not. I've met a lot of people in my life, and many of them have turned out to be successful and even famous and have excelled in many various occupations, but I've never met a single soul who could play baseball at the major league level. It's that rare. Only 750 men can do it. In writing about, shall we say, underachieving ballplayers at the dawn of this big-money era (Bobby Bonilla [here all Mets fans groan] had just signed with the team for a then-insane salary of $29 million over five years) Klapisch and Harper reveal hard hearts and a lot of hostility toward established stars.Generally, the book's mainly a litany of complaints about the difficulty of the job: the travel, the deadlines, the demands of the editors, the refusal of players, management, and the front office to speak openly to the press, etc. The fourth or fifth iteration of this--the two authors take turns writing \\"sidebars\\" that appear adjacent to the main text in which they bitch about how hard it is to navigate the rocky shoals of a clubhouse occupied by \\"spoiled millionaires\\" (BOY these guys have a problem with that)--makes the reader want to toss the book across the room. Klapisch and Harper actually try to make the case that not delivering a juicy headline-worthy story drives their respective tabloids \\"one day closer to extinction.\\" Reminds me of the old Abbott and Costello routine where Abbott berates Costello for not eating mustard. \\"The man who makes that mustard--he'll be out of a job! How about his family, Costello? How're they gonna pay the rent if you won't eat mustard on your frankfurter?\\" The ballplayers should have eaten the mustard, I guess, and spilled their guts.If you're a Mets fan, this is a depressing book, because it simply highlights a cyclical aspect of Metsdom: years of promise the mostly remain unfulfilled interspersed with dismal, last-place years in which the ownership first runs the team off the rails and then makes a series of ill-considered moves to restore it. Mo Vaughn, meet Bobby Bonilla. Guys, here's George Foster. Somehow, just a few years after winning, the Mets always seem to be fielding a triple A team, and in capturing that--by the end of the '92 season, which this book focuses on, most of the starting lineup was on the DL--the writers do a good job. They also succeed in capturing the malaise of a losing team's clubhouse, and in analyzing some of the piss-poor decisions of front office management, such as in hiring Jeff Torborg to take over the team. Art Howe, anyone? George Bamberger? Wes Westrum?I can imagine that this book would appeal to a broader audience than merely Mets fans. It's a good study of pathology, of sports psychology, and of the peculiar symbiosis between the media and their subjects--because, as this book demonstrates, the actual reporting of the events of the game are secondary to the reporting the intrigue backstage."},{"Title":"The Worst Team Money Could Buy","review":"The competition between newspapers in the New York market of the late '80s and early '90s was a precursor to 24-hour sports networks and the Internet in terms of bringing the personal and the issues of the locker room to the fore. Every paper was printing a game story, so the way to distinguish your coverage was to get the office politics, the behind-the-scenes stuff -- Vince Coleman and the golf club. David Cone and the allegations. Sid Fernandez in the doghouse. Buddy Harrelson, the manager who lost control. Bobby Bonilla and everybody. While the player stuff was interesting, I found this much more intriguing as a study of mass media and competition, and just as valid now as ever. A must-read for anyone interested in sports journalism."},{"Title":"The Worst Team Money Could Buy","review":"Money isn't everything - and the money paid to the star talent the Mets had in Bobby Bonilla, Eddie Murray, Vince Coleman, etc., proves it. Especially when the money certain players earn is being spent on partying - one way to help your team finish last.

I went in expecting a decent read but surprisingly, my expectations were exceeded. It's one of the best baseball books I've ever read, a much more engaging read than Bouton's highly acclaimed 'Ball Four'.We get inside an ugly Mets clubhouse in the early 90s. Warts get peeled off and there are many. Rape accusations, uptight managers (Torborg's no drinking on flights rule comes to mind) and inadequate upper management decisions are just some of the higlights.From Gregg Jefferies prima-donna, wunderkind status (and ultimate bust) to Vince Coleman's proclamation that the turf at Shea Stadium will ultimately be the reason that he is kept out of the Hall of Fame, this book is a great page turner.The only guy you end up taking a liking to is David Cone, and he was hardly a saint.Highly recommended, and I'm not even a Mets fan."},{"Title":"The Worst Team Money Could Buy","review":"The book talks about the 1992 New York Mets which was full of overpaid underachievers who were expected to get into the World Series after finishing below .500 in 1991 for the first time since 1983. It shows the apparent rape and other sexual charges to players like Vince Coleman, Daryl Boston, David Cone and Doc Gooden. It showed the Mets of '92 did more off the field then on the field and you can tell by there record and the fans of New York were outraged that a proud franchise would sink to this level and not succedd. Its a very good book, every Mets fan should have it."},{"Title":"The Worst Team Money Could Buy","review":"I've been a Mets fan since 1976. I've read many Mets books written by players on how great things are when they win and I wanted another perspective on what happens when things go drastically wrong. This book was a real eye opener written by people with inside access to the team. Sure miss 1986."},{"Title":"The Worst Team Money Could Buy","review":"While this book covered the era of the early 1990s and the destruction of what it took to win the 1986 World Series and the 1988 National League East championship, every single man who contributed to the heart and soul of those teams were gone, by either trade or otherwise (Ray Knight, Lenny Dykstra, etc). And what is glaringly obvious is that Mets management were surrounded by a bunch of front office guys who knew little about baseball, the ability to recognize talent, and through free-agent signings and player development weren't able to put a respectable, winning team on the field. The saddest statement of all is here we are in 2013, and in 20+ years' time the Wilpons still haven't managed to surround themselves with knowledgeable people who have any sense of the game or the guys who play it. Their refusal to sell the team is to the detriment of their fans. What I've come to believe is that as long as the Wilpons are the owners of the New York Mets, they will never win another championship. And to have a brand new ball park with the seats half full, game after game, is a pitiful sight to behold."},{"Title":"The Worst Team Money Could Buy","review":"Another book portraying Gregg Jefferies as a prima donna. Jefferies was such a pain in the butt that he'd have his bats shipped separately from the other players bats. Roger McDowell got even with him by sawing all his bats in half and then tapping them together. Jefferies had no idea until one day he went to grab an extra bat during a game and the bat broke in his hands. It's interesting to read about the players from my time period 1988-93. Those were my peak years of viewing MLB baseball. My favorite quote of the book was from David Cone in reaction to alcohol being banned from Mets' charter flights. \\"You have a rule that makes us look like screw-ups...You haven't given us a chance to prove we can handle alcohol like adults. Right off the bat you put us in a negative light.\\"I guess Steve Carlton made enemies as well with the press. He would routinely say \\"No comment\\" when asked about a game he pitched in. However when he was at the tail end of his career, he fell back into the good relations with the press in an effort to prolong his career."},{"Title":"The Worst Team Money Could Buy","review":"It's nice to read a book by two people who were right there, up close to the team.

Northrop Frye said that Blake is of the great English poets the one for whom the largest share of his work remains largely unread and unknown. An explanation for that is that Blake's longer poems, his prophetic works are extremely difficult to understand. Thus any presentation of his work should have copious notes, even if that presentation centers on that smaller lyric poetry for which Blake is best known to the world. This present edition contains an introduction to Blake's work which is far too short to really give an overall sense of his life and development.Nonetheless this edition contains much of the anthologized Blake, as well as selections from longer works like 'Milton' and 'Jerusalem'.A reader can thus find here the best of Blake.

For reasons that the author explains in the first volume, they constitute one book that was split into two due to pressures in the publishing issue. This novel does not stand alone, and will make no sense without reading the previous volume. Furthermore, there are two other volumes in the series \\"Starfish\\" and \\"Maelstrom\\" and while each entry stands on its own fairly well, reading the books in order would definitely be the approach I would recommend.For those of you who are new to the series, here is a brief synopsis that should tell you whether or not these books are for you. Essentially, the story arc is about evolution: human, animal and electronic. By mixing a blend of biology, computer science and chaos theory, author Peter Watts has created a near future Earth where man is simultaneously at the height of his powers and walking the knife's edge of total ecological failure. In an effort to maintain the high standard of Western living mankind has turned to deep sea geothermal power to meet their energy needs. Miles below the ocean, specially engineered humans culled from the dregs of society maintain these power plants. However, what no one could have expected was that they would encounter an organism that would unleash an apocalypse. Part hard science-fiction, part post-apocalyptic, the first two books represent a genuinely original voice in the genre.For those of you who have been eagerly awaiting \\"Seppuku\\" rest assured the ending is eminently satisfying. Given the two volume approach, it is difficult to offer much in the way of plot details without providing spoilers, but I can say that after the somewhat broader focus of \\"Maelstrom\\" and \\"B-Max\\" the story has gone full circle and boiled back down to the most perverse trinity of characters one is likely to find: Lenie Clarke, Ken Lubin and Achilles Desjardins. As the three engage in a power-play in which no one's motivations are clear and the fate of the world hangs in the balance, action takes precedence over thought, to sometimes disastrous effect. Nonetheless, the science and technology which has so defined this series is on ample display and is as prescient as ever.Of particular note, I found the conclusion to be perfectly enigmatic. This is post-apocalyptic fiction, and a happy ending would have been wildly out of place, but Watts' conclusion recognizes this without being entirely bleak. In this regard, his novel owes more to \\"Alas, Babylon\\" with it's open ended conclusion, than the superb, but utterly fatalistic \\"On the Beach\\".To say more would risk huge spoilers, so suffice it to say \\"Sepukku\\" is every bit the conclusion I was hoping for. Watts has combined hard science fiction and post-apocalyptic fiction and taken both in new and exciting directions. If you're a fan of the series, you'll be glad at the way it ends; if you're intrigued by this review, grab \\"Starfish\\" and start from the beginning.Jake Mohlman"},{"Title":"Behemoth: Seppuku (Bk. 2)","review":"Unlike his excellent debut, Starfish and its first sequel, Maelstrom, this conclusion is a disappointing creative misstep on the part of its author. The chief problem with BEHEMOTH: SEPPUKU is that in spite of setting up Lenie Clarke as the heroine of the story, Clarke herself is entirely passive throughout the book, making no real decisions or actions on her own, being led by her sociopathic-but-honourable comrade Ken Lubin. She never achieves any great insight and becomes a bit player in the story.This book feels as if the author had become so preoccupied with his Hard Science Fiction ruminations that he had forgotten that his characters had been complex, dimensional characters in the previous books, and were now merely cartoonish chess pieces wandering through a thin narrative. There are also the deeply disturbing scenes in which the villain rapes and mutilates a sympathetic supporting character that eventually feel like a gratuitous exercise in writing snuff porn with a Science discussion interweaved in them, especially when that subplot no longer links up with the main story and never reaches any real resolution.The first two books in this series brilliantly married the Science with the complexity and pain of its damaged characters, but this book has degenerated into a dystopian cartoon that feels too much like a wallow in the [...] of sexual sadism and social pessimism. There have been brilliant dystopian Science Fiction novels in that past that earned their pessimism, like John Brunner's THE SHEEP LOOK UP. Alas, BEHEMOTH: SEPPUKU does not belong in that league."},{"Title":"Behemoth: Seppuku (Bk. 2)","review":"An anaerobic microbe from the deep sea may have delivered the coup de grace to an already struggling mid-21st century world.It makes more sense to me to review the whole series when it's one story -- so here goes.I was very surprised to find that the mass market editions of these books are out of print -- even as the final hardcover has only just been released. I can't understand why this series wouldn't get more support, because in my opinion it has everything that successful science fiction needs. Watts incorporates big, shiny ideas -- and the deep-sea biology is a wonderful original touch. The books include a high level of action and tension and, pleasantly unusually for \\"idea\\" SF, are strongly character-driven. And the characters are tormented enough for anyone.There are flaws. At times, the plot is unclear, and while I like the pivotal role played by ignorance and misunderstanding, at times an irritating back-and-forth plot dynamic (Seppuku is a cure, no it isn't, yes it is) appears. Characterization, while overall excellent, at times seems over the top -- it's not entirely clear why *everyone* is so messed up, and the stupid bickering between the Rifters and the corporates in Atlantis left me with sympathy for neither side. I was put off by the apparent indifference of the characters to the impending destruction of Earth's whole ecosystem -- but then, they're selfish and profoundly damaged people, and creating sympathy for them in the reader's mind does not seem to have been Watts' priority. I would have found the aforesaid destruction more effective had it been shown more clearly.But, despite all these quibbles, I think this series is really good SF, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Behemoth: Seppuku (Bk. 2)","review":"I am reviewing the last 2 books as one here, which is how the author intended them to be published. First, you will have a hard time with the content if you haven't read the series starting with Starfish. The story is compelling and fascinating and a more than a little horrible. The writing is excellent and the plot unfolds briskly. The science is well researched and accessible to most intelligent readers. The proposed what-ifs of a near-apocalypitcal future are totally plausable.But sheesh Watts is hard on his characters. I give 4 stars for a great book, because it is, but I admit I'm left cold by the violence: some sexually graphic and sadistic, up close and personal, some happening far away from the characters at hand but with devestating consequence. All in the name of saving the world. The ending is enigmatic: I would have loved a neat wrap up of the surviving characters and and exposition of the future, but it's not that kind of book. So be it: that is Watts' choice and I have no bones with it aside from personal preference. But what I do have bones with is the dilution of Lenie's character from a force to be reckoned with to a a whiny nay-sayer. Even if Lenie more or less killed the whole world in the previous books, at least she did it with style (ya know, in a really twisted way). Now she sets off to save the world with a whimper and a moan. Boo. So that's my beef.Conclusion: if you love terse, unshirking, compelling and serious sci-fi, Watts is your man. Read in good health."},{"Title":"Behemoth: Seppuku (Bk. 2)","review":"Peter Watts concludes his _Rifters_ saga in the fourth and final volume, _Behemoth: Book Two: Seppuku_. Watts had written that he originally planned a trilogy but that changes in the publishing industry had forced him to divide his rather large final volume into two novels, but that he was fortunate to have a good breaking point between the two books and two resulting novels that were different in scope. It seems to have been a good choice, as while _Behemoth_Book One_ focused nearly entirely on the undersea refuge of the corpses and rifters (along with our old friend Achilles Desjardins), _Book Two_ spent no time there at all but instead allowed the reader a tour of a post-Behemoth North America, a taste of international politics, and of course the end game between Lenie Clarke, Ken Lubin, and Achilles (and a new character that the book introduces, a physician by the name of Taka Ouellette).Overall I found it satisfying. The post-apocalyptic world we got to see was believable and interesting though wasn't perhaps as well-explored as what we got to see in _Maelstrom_. We were shown much more of the sick and sadistic pleasures of Achilles. While never really entering \\"torture porn\\" territory, the reader is left with a sense of disquiet (at least this one was) about how far the author would go in that regard. I didn't think it gratuitous, as this was a fundamental aspect of Achilles' character and of what had happened to him regarding his conscience, but it still nonetheless made me a bit uncomfortable at times (and makes me wonder just what the future holds for some forms of entertainment, given the evolution of horror films and the continual apparent need for succeeding films to outdo one another, a point I think the author was trying to make).I liked the ending, it had two interesting twists I really enjoyed and didn't devolve into what it could have been (one character simply killing another, story over). The world at the end of the novel is fundamentally different and not necessarily a world without hope. It is also a world that would be interesting to see explored in a later novel.I would like to express my displeasure at this series being out of print despite its recent age (_Seppuku_ came out in 2004). That is a real shame, as it is a worthwhile and interesting series, an excellent addition to the end of the world sub-genre of science fiction as well as probably the finest novel to ever handle the deep sea and ocean themes. The series overall was well researched (the author himself was a marine biologist) and had well-developed characters, a fascinating setting, and was an intriguing exploration of developing trends in our world."},{"Title":"Behemoth: Seppuku (Bk. 2)","review":"The first book, \\"Starfish\\" was amazing, just a great read. This last book is horrible! Confusing, pointless, and extremely degrading, I wish I had never read it. I agree whole heartedly with \\"aisian film c\\" above! The rape and torture of one of the more sympathetic characters is what really pushed this book into the crapper for me."},{"Title":"Behemoth: Seppuku (Bk. 2)","review":"I loved Starfish. I appreciated the smart science (hey, gotta love SF with bibliographies!); I found the world riveting and the characters well-drawn. But I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this book. The sequence of sexual sadism, which stretches on for chapter after excruciating chapter, is simply too visually explicit to be worth experiencing. It's an image I just didn't need, and one I can't get out of my head. It includes an eroticized clitoridectomy, for goodness sake. For me, that sequence overshadows everything else in the book, and however much you may want to see the resolution of issues raised in the other books, be sure you're willing to have that image stuck to your eyeballs before you buy or read this volume."},{"Title":"Behemoth: Seppuku (Bk. 2)","review":"When I was sixteen I worked at a grocery store with a girl named Marianne whom I thought was pretty attractive. I wanted to ask her out for months but could never build up enough courage. After all, I didn't want to have to work with her if things went terribly wrong on the date. Eventually she quit and on her last day working, I asked her out. She said yes and we made plans for that weekend.A short time into the date I realized that her breath was horrible. I don't know if it was an anomaly or if I had just never been that close to her before. Either way, the date couldn't end fast enough for me. When I took her home I stopped walking halfway to her front door and let her walk the rest of the way alone-where I told her goodbye from a safe distance of about 20 yards.What does that have to do with Behemoth: Seppuku? Very little actually. But it does have something to do with the Rifters series, of which this book is the the fourth and final volume. Several years ago when I came across the first book in the series; Starfish, I was attracted to its eye-catching cover and intriguing description on the inside flap. I read it and enjoyed it. When the next book Maelstrom came out, I started to notice the bad breath. Unfortunately, as I've mentioned before, I have a mental disorder that does not allow me to quit reading a book I'm not enjoying, and apparently the condition makes it hard for me to stop reading a series of books once started.The series takes place in the not-too-distant future. In need of a new source of energy, mankind begins to tap into geothermal vents in the deepest parts of the ocean. It's discovered that hardened criminals possess the type of temperament best conducive to surviving under the extreme conditions at the bottom of the ocean and given the choice between imprisonment and a relatively free lifestyle segregated from the rest of humanity, many choose the latter. These workers are then surgically altered into amphibian-like creatures (rifters) in order to allow them to survive at such depths. Unfortunately, for the rest of mankind, there are bacteria that thrive at the bottom of the ocean. Bacteria that the human race is not prepared to defend itself against. Using the rifters as vehicles to the surface, the bacteria quickly spread with apocalyptic results.As the series progresses, halitosis sets in. There's not a likeable character anywhere in the series and the great idea behind the story gets overshadowed by the author's overwhelming angst and pessimism. Even in the acknowledgement section at the back of the book - yeah, my condition made me read that too, Watts writes that even if the book and the series \\"sucks\\" it would \\"suck even worse\\" if it wasn't for the help of the acknowledged individuals. If you're interested in owning the complete series, there's going to be a very cheap set on eBay in a few minutes."},{"Title":"Behemoth: Seppuku (Bk. 2)","review":"Five years ago amphibious cyborg Lenie Clarke unleashed the microbe Behemoth on an unsuspecting world, killing ten million in North America. Lenni and her fellow cyborgs escape the devastation in the ocean depths and are at war with the VIP's who fled to the underwater city of Atlantis. The people of Atlantis and cyborgs make peace when Behemoth finds its way into the underwater city. For the first time in five years Lenie journeys to land accompanied by Ken Lubin to find a way to keep Behemoth out of Atlantis.Although a vaccine for Behemoth exists, it is in scarce supply so more people die from the microbe and the plagues that follow in its wake. Watchers guard against anyone breaking out of quarantine and many countries want to eradicate North America and thus destroy Behemoth. A new deadly microbe Seppuku is launched as a cure for Behemoth but when it kills the microbe it also infects the host. A watcher, Achilles Desjarding know that Seppuku will eventually die out before killing the host but he doesn't tell anyone because he wants to keep all the power he gained. Lenie and Ken can stop him but it might mean their deaths.BEHEMOTH: SEPPUKU is the last of the Lenni Clark books and it is just as action-packed and exciting as STARFISH: MAELSTROM and BEHEMOTH: B-MAX. This is a dark gritty speculative fiction novel with the survivors grimly determined to rebuild civilization if Behemoth is eradicated. Lenie knows she can never find redemption but she does her best to save what is left of the North American population. Desjarding is the archetype villain who everyone will love to hate. Peter Watts is writing excellent cutting edge science fiction.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dancing to the Concertina's Tune: A Prison Teacher's Memoir","review":"Jan Walker expertly articulates her experiences providing vital education in two of Washington State's prisons, but the worth of her writing goes much deeper. She is a candid guide through the current cultural minefield of crime and corrections. Our society is vocally tough on crime, locking up more people for longer sentences than ever. But without an opportunity for education, character development, spiritual maturing, employable skills and family healing, prisons are underfunded warehouses reinforcing the very values nobody wants released to their neighborhoods. Walker's work at McNeil Island Correctional Center left footprints on men's hearts and their children's lives. My husband and I know this, although we have never met her and were unfamiliar with the entire scope of her work until reading this book. Nonetheless we currently strive to continue what she started at McNeil. Are we, and Walker, &quot;soft on crime and criminals'? No. Like her, and countless dedicated educators across the nation, we believe that families, and especially children, do time with each convicted felon. Anything we can do to ignite understanding, change destructive family patterns and promote generational healing is of benefit to our society as a whole. Jan Walker's memoir is authentic and insightful. I wish every legislator in our country was required to read it... and take a test."},{"Title":"The Four Gifts of Love: Preparing for Marriage That Will Last a Lifetime","review":"I have used this resource as a pastoral counselor.

It paints a picture, through the eyes of literate travelers, of the wonderful wilderness that was the American south as it gave way to settlement and the plow. This vivid picture cannot be told as well by any historian as it was by those who lived it and told it in their own words as they traveled through this primitive and sometimes dangerous land."},{"Title":"The Very Worst Road: Travellers' Accounts of Crossing Alabama's Old Creek Indian Territory, 1820-1847","review":"This book actually had more than I expected.

The list of medications found to alleviate symptoms was helpful (and occasionally cautionary--a good heads-up for when doctors get goofy perscribing). The list of resources, including newsgroups, web sites, meetings, is great--there are others out there...lots! The section that deals with co-morbid conditions was helpful, too.

He won numerous prizes and awards during the last decade of his life, including the 1975 Fellowship from the Academy of American Poets for \\"distinguished poetic achievement.\\" Hayden stands out among Twentieth Century American, poets not just for his many literary accomplishments, but for the strong vision of faith that illuminates so much of his work.In addition to well known poems such as \\"Those Winter Sundays\\" and \\"The Whipping,\\" this anthology contains other equally stirring poems including \\"Aunt Jemima Of The Ocean Waves\\" which depicts a conversation with the fat woman from a Coney Island side-show and \\"Belsen, Day Of Liberation\\" dedicated to Rosey Pool, the Dutch teacher of Anne Frank and first translator of her famous diary.While Hayden writes much about African-American history and culture, his poems do not tell the reader what to think or feel. Instead, his carefully crafted verse weaves images that allow the careful reader to move around in some very unusual territory, some beautiful, some uncomfortable. Hayden puts us in the mind of the oppressor in poems like \\"Middle Passage\\" about the famous Amistad incident, and \\"Night, Death, Mississippi\\" where we eavesdrop on an old Klan member too frail to attend a lynching with his son, of whom he is proud. \\"Be there with Boy and the rest / if I was well again. / Time was. Time was. / White robes like moonlight / In the sweetgum dark.\\"Hayden can also be wickedly funny. In \\"American Journal\\" written a few years before his death, his narrator is a spy from a distant planet in the galaxy who reports back to his fellow superiors about \\"this baffling multi people extremes and variegations their noise restlessness their almost frightening energy.\\"In addition to poems about childhood, society, and race, Hayden also writes about the history and central figures of his religion, the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith. In \\"Baha' u'llah In The Garden Of Ridwan\\" he compares the founder of Bah&aacute;'&iacute; at an important juncture to Christ the night before being crucified w ho prayed to be relieved of his great destiny. In \\"Dawnbreaker\\" Hayden describes the torture of one early Bah&aacute;'&iacute; put to death by having candles of oil and wick lit within his skin. \\"Ablaze / with candles sconced / in weeping eyes / of wounds.\\"Despite his numerous awards, Hayden was not well known to many poetry readers until the end of his life. Fortunately, his reputation has increased since Collected Poems was published posthumously. If you are interested in rich, well crafted poetry which explores what it means to be human, try Hayden. As Aunt Jemima says in the above mentioned poem, \\"And that's the beauty part, I mean, ain't that the beauty part.\\""},{"Title":"Collected Poems","review":"Robert Hayden was my teacher many years ago, a very gentle, talented man. He is an important Black poet and an important, essential American poet whose work will last."},{"Title":"Collected Poems","review":"This collection contains all the work of the fine American poet Robert Hayden. An African-American raised in Detroit, Hayden's work includes, but is hardly restricted to, a number of fine to outstanding poems inspired by African-American history. His superb memorial poem for Frederick Douglass is a good example of work in this vein. There are also a number of fine poems drawn from his life experience and his Bahai faith. Overall, I prefer his earlier work, but Hayden was a consistently powerful and interesting poet throughout his career. Like many excellent American poets, his work deserves to be read more widely."},{"Title":"Collected Poems","review":"Is there a resurgence of Hayden's poetry or am I finally hearing more about this sensitive poet who wrote about a glorious future at a time when there was little hope for equity.

This darn book should have been done completely in Color Plates but it was not. In fact, there are only a couple dozen full color plates which almost makes it worse because the reader gets to see what might have been. Still if you love Inro, Netsuke & Ojime you MUST OWN THIS BOOK because, believe it or not, it encompasses the Complete Collection of such in the Tokyo National Museum. Yes, that's correct, the TNM, bowing to complaints from visitors and academics that its public display case is disappointingly unable to show the entire collection, saw fit to catalogue the entire collection of 108 Inro and 565 netsuke for us to have and to hold in one dem fine book. My book is the hardbound, original publication in which there is not a lot of text in English --also not a lot in the Japanese for that matter--just an introduction and then a complete list of articles including material, approximate date, subject and whether it is from the 'Goh' Collection. The book is photographed beautifully, with the Inro photographed front and back where there is a difference between the two, and there is often a miniature photo of the artist's mark dependent, I suppose, upon whether there is one. The beauty of this collection is that many of these Inro are quite old, made before the objects were commonplace, and also that Mr. Goh was able to obtain many of his objects whole. That is to say that his Inro come complete with accompanying Netsuke & Ojime. Thus the original intent of the artist is there for us to see. This is a really great book, I just wish that it was entirely in Color, thus just four stars for this five star book!"},{"Title":"Hell on Earth","review":"Hell on Earth is an occult detective story written by the author of the Shattered World novels. While Reaves has several other such stories to his credit -- including one featuring the reporter Liz Russell -- I believe this is his first based on traditional Judeo-Christian mythology.Colin is an orphan trained at the Scholomance in Transylvania, a school of dark magic. He has a Door that can apport him to any place on earth, but won't retrieve him. He did have the Trine, a mystical token of great power, but something Fallen has stolen it and left a smell of brimstone behind. Moreover, he has Zoel, an Unfallen Angel, who has come to ask him to help with a little problem. It seems that a demon has been born, the undead are walking, and the apocalypse may be near. No big deal for a magic wielding detective with an Angel sidekick, right?The remainder of the story is a matter of searching for the Trine, questioning the suspects -- demons and such -- and checking out the various locales -- Vlad Dracula's castle, for one -- and putting the clues together. Along the way he picks up a few more assistants: the demon Asdeon, reporter Liz Russell, and ex-ranger Terry Dane.This novel is bloody and violent, but more like suspenseful mystery that a horror story. Recommended for Reaves fans and anyone who likes magical detectives and occult mysteries.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Hell on Earth","review":"&quot;Babylon is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit.&quot; (Revelations)Perhaps it was the advent of the new Millennium that inspired so many fantasies with Babylonian demons, but I've read three in the past year including &quot;Hell on Earth.&quot; I think Michael Reaves originally wrote this book with Millennarians as a target audience, since it makes isolated references to Armageddon. However, if that was the original theme, it has been transformed into a generic (or perhaps I should say gnostic) battle of sublime Light versus demonic Darkness.&quot;Hell on Earth&quot; is the type of professionally crafted fantasy that we've come to expect from Del Rey. The reader is subjected to more cliff-hangers than Pauline in all of her perils, and Pauline's exclamations of horror and disgust have been thoroughly modernized. The action never stops from the birth of a demon and the loss of a magical talisman, to the epilogue when a famous ball descends in Times Square.Even though the author makes several biblical references, &quot;Hell on Earth&quot; is not at all preachy. Humorous and inventive touches abound, including a demon that likes to masquerade as Humphrey Bogart. The three major human characters are Colin the magician, Liz the author of a best-seller about a serial killer called 'The Maneater,' and Terry, ex-Army Ranger and current bodyguard. They are all likeable, vulnerable, feisty, and willing to fight for the Right Side in the battle against evil. Although all three are battling current dilemmas, the reader is also treated to lengthy flashbacks---so lengthy that I began to wonder if there was a prequel to &quot;Hell on Earth&quot; that I had somehow missed. The book drops definite hints about a sequel:&quot;He [Colin] had to find out. If there was even the faintest chance of Lilith [a character seen only in Colin's flashbacks] still being alive, he would do whatever it took to find out. Even if it meant going back to the one place on Earth he had sworn never to set foot in again.&quot;Michael Reeves has also written &quot;Darth Maul Shadow Hunter,&quot; which was spun off from a movie. His &quot;Hell on Earth&quot; is a book that could head in the opposite direction and end up on film. It's got snappy dialogue (especially between Zoel the angel and the Humphrey Bogart demon), strong visuals, likeable characters, lots of action, and a plot that easy to follow. The flashbacks that slow down the book's momentum would probably be shortened, eliminated, or treated as part of the current action if &quot;Hell&quot; goes to the movies.Suggestion: if this book gives you an appetite for Babylonian demons, try Jonathan Aycliffe's &quot;The Talisman.&quot; His demon, Shabbatil (Lord of the Flies) is totally horrific and has no sense of humor at all."},{"Title":"Hell on Earth","review":"For some reason I bought this book well after it came out and then let it sit on the shelf for a time before reading it. Perhaps it was because of the millennial associations the book had in my mind. It certainly wasn't any doubt of Michael Reaves as an author. He has been writing for some time, and has always done a solid, workmanlike job. Having finally read it, I can honestly say that, whatever my reasons were, I was much mistaken. Certainly, any book that deals with demons and cataclysms will have a touch of the millennial about them, but this book would have worked just as well in 1986 or 2021.The book start's out with a horrific beginning when, in a fashion reminiscent of &quot;Alien,&quot; a demonic child is born to a 15 year old victim of incest. The demon promptly slaughters all attending the event and disappears. Quickly, the scene shifts to the Greenwich Village home of Colin, a young and potent mage who discovers he has been robbed. Three enchanted objects, which together make up the Trine, have been taken. Without the Trine, Colin's powers are significantly weakened. While planning his next steps a pounding on the door reveals the angel Zoel, sent from divine dispatching to help Colin along.Across the continent, Terry Dane, a bodyguard, finds himself confronted with an attacker who doesn't register pain, and who likes to shred his victims. And, in Oregon, Liz Russell witnesses the execution of a serial killer she had written a book about and suddenly realizes that there may be life after death, and it might not like her. All of these threads come together in a wild sleigh ride through purgatory, hell and beyond. Colin's 'simple' quest quickly goes sour despite the help the angel Zoel and a friendly demon, Asdeon. The book is barely started before the reader is creeping through the catacombs of Paris and exploring the site of Dracula's burial.Reaves proves himself quite adept in creating a magical world. Colin's travels, and his memories of his school days produce many striking images of the occult. I particularly liked the images of the Scholomance and the scenes at Lake Snagov in Transylvania. He also draws on a surprising amount of both classical and Babylonian demonology. For some reason the latter seems unusually popular this year, I believe this is the third book that I've read with some sort of Babylonian bad guy in it. The plot moves too quickly for there to be much character development, but there is enough to keep character from going flat.Reaves moves between suspense, horror, and sarcastic humor in his writing, which can be jarring at times. This is the kind of book that is quite easily read in a couple of sittings. I was expecting something a bit more ponderous or horrible, instead I found I had a high speed tale of occult suspense told with a light entertaining touch. I am not normally a fan of books which are mostly plot, but &quot;Hell on Earth&quot; is one of the better examples of that writing style. I enjoyed it right through to it's rather splashy and overdone ending. I'm even hoping that there might be a sequel some day."},{"Title":"Hell on Earth","review":"The book started out great -- it didn't even lag through the middle! I eagerly flipped the pages until I got to the ending, and when I was done reading that... I threw the book against a wall. This isn't a spoiler, but man! That ending was weak and amateurish. I just hope he uh... comes up with a sequel... because there needs to be some closure to this whole thing..."},{"Title":"Hell on Earth","review":"This is a good, solid read about the supernatural. It won't set the world on fire (Bad pun! Bad!), but it's a very enjoyable book. The author weaves together serial killers, angels who lie, coffee-scoffing demons, nuns with machine guns and much, much more. I picked up this book despite the author's credit for a Star Wars book on the cover (I am not a sci fi fan), but after finishing this book I'll be looking for some of his other supernatural thrillers."},{"Title":"Hell on Earth","review":"This is the best fantasy thriller I've read in a long time. It's horror with a touch of fantasy--or fantasy with a touch of horror...but whatever you call it, it's a thrilling, page-a-minute adventure in a world where magic and angels and demons are real, though most of us don't know it. The main character, Colin, is cool and sexy and mysterious; the supporting players come completely alive, so you share their fears and their victories. The angels and demons are particularly interesting, making me want to know a whole lot more about the supernatural world hidden behind our world in this book. Reaves writes with a natural flow and smooth style. I couldn't put this down. I hope there are more books to come about Colin and his mysterious calling. Michael Reaves is definitely an author to watch."},{"Title":"Hell on Earth","review":"I had great hopes for this book. I usually really enjoy anything dealing with a new twist on the battle between good and evil, angels and demons. I thought this book was terribly unoriginal (demons with horns, bat wings, hooves and \\"brick red\\" skin? ....) with moments of inspiration. The shadowdance was interesting in that the author compares it to martial arts kata ....The angel Zoel and demon Asdeon, creatures who should be capable of vast unimaginable powers, are reduced to a bickering sidenote to the story. Asdeon, especially, was disappointing, a second-rate dandy spouting unfunny quips at the stoic and beautiful Zoel. ....

All of them will have to confront two battling demons where the winner takes all. Before it's all over there will be help from above and below. But will they be too late?... Michael Reaves gives us a wild modern-horror-fantasy that is epic in scope, but delivered in a meager 280 pages. Things move in a kind of staccato fashion and with some tongue-in-cheek humor that sometimes hurts the story's credibility. (Even though I laughed out loud a few times.) But the imagination of the author and a rich background that we're only given a glimpse of, makes it worthwhile and hints at more to come. Overall, an engaging and inventive book that I recommend for horror-fantasy fans."},{"Title":"Hell on Earth","review":"When I read the title and jacket I was very interested. After the shocking first chapter which was pretty gross I was very disappointed. The book was filled with \\"demonology\\" terms and was very fustrating. I keep flipping back pages looking for the explainations to terms that were constantly thrown out as if the readers had a B.S in the history of spells and magic. With the exception of the opening chapter and a suprise near the end, the book was very disappointing. To sum it all up. This was the first book about Colin( the main character) but I felt like I was reading a sequel and was totally out of the loop. Too many questions and not enough answers is how I felt when I finished. The door was left open for a sequel but I won't be reading it."},{"Title":"Hell on Earth","review":"Michael Reaves just tries too hard. The premise of the book and the first chapter certainly intrigued me, but the rest of the book is just poorly executed. The plot's okay, but always left me with a sense of &quot;Why?&quot;. Although multi-character story lines can be very rewarding, here they are just convoluted and muddy the waters. The (merciful) ending of the book was such a amaturish let-down I, truly, drove straight to Good-Will and dropped my copy of the book into the donation bin. If you want books on a very similar theme (I'm sure Reaves was attempting a knock-off), please try the novels of Neil Gaiman. Gaiman is a brilliant writter who pulls off multi-arc biblically-obsessed stories without effort. Do yourself a favor and stay as far away from Hell on Earth as humanly possible."},{"Title":"Hell on Earth","review":"Reaves has created an outstanding character in Colin, a modern day sorcerer with a mysterious purpose and an interesting past. The author weaves the fantasy story quite well into our current time period. I'll leave the story synopsis to others, but if you like fantasy or demonology or sorcery, you'll enjoy this book! It moves right along, after a bang up beginning, and comes to a somewhat satisfying conclusion. Leaves you wondering about the circumstances, past and future, of some of the characters, particularly Colin and his interesting past, but that's a good thing.

It's got snappy dialogue (especially between Zoel the angel and the Humphrey Bogart demon), strong visuals, likeable characters, lots of action, and a plot that easy to follow. The flashbacks that slow down the book's momentum would probably be shortened, eliminated, or treated as part of the current action if \\"Hell\\" goes to the movies.Suggestion: if this book gives you an appetite for Babylonian demons, try Jonathan Aycliffe's \\"The Talisman.\\" His demon, Shabbatil (Lord of the Flies) is totally horrific and has no sense of humor at all."},{"Title":"Hell on Earth","review":"I almost didn't buy this because of some of the reviews posted on here but I am so glad I did!

The amount of quasi-ceremonial magick references in this book was staggering. It wasn't entirely necessary neither were some of over used mentioning of GREAT COSMIC POWER. This book would have profited from it's writer taking a tip from the content in the book and making more Lovecraftian and less like something Neil Gaiman would have written in High School. It was a good book, don't get me wrong. I just would have hoped the author could have taken some time and made it a GREAT BOOK!"},{"Title":"Hell on Earth","review":"With the dawning of a new millennium, certain events have occurred that might be construed as the beginning of the Apocalypse. In a backwater town, a fifteen-year-old girl dies while giving birth to a demon. After being pursued by a serial killer, Liz Russell watches the state give him a lethal injection only to see him wink at her after he died. Bodyguard Terry Dane tries to protect his client from a demon disguised as a human.While these incidents happen, Colon a master of magic awakens to discover that the Trine, a powerful talisman consisting of three segments is missing. The angel Zoel visits Colon and though they may have different agendas team up to recover the Trine. They regain two of the segments, but Colon soon finds himself in Las Vegas where he meets Liz and Terry, who were mystically guided to the city. Here Armageddon seems imminent unless Colon and company can find a way to defer the beginning of the end.Michael Reaves has written a serio-comic tale about the cosmic forces of heaven and hell on earth. The author's skills show up throughout the tale, but especially when he makes the verbal exchanges between the mage, an angel, and a demon humorous yet solemn, a clear testimony to a wonderful author. Though the ending is fulfilling, loose strings exist so one can conclude that a sequel is forthcoming.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Hell on Earth","review":"The title and synopsis was enough to make me pick this book up on a slow day, but I quickly discovered that they had little to do with the actual story within. To begin with, the writing style itself is very amateurish, written by someone more focused on the visual medium of TV or film than the more subtle nuances of the page. The moment I read about Colin's black leather motorcycle jacket and ray-ban sunglasses, I knew that literary talent would be in short supply.One could almost see that Reaves had an entire back story in his head about this character and literary universe of the Shadowdance and black school, but he failed to inform the rest of us what it might be. It was like picking up a novel from the middle of a series and not knowing what is going on.If anything, this is just a slasher movie on page rather than film, with the same level of character development, dialogue, plot development and, ultimately, originality. Normally I would encourage a writer to continue to improve, but after having written, and shockingly having had published, the number of books Reaves has, I do not see that happening. I would keep away from his work and, if horror is your interest, stick with authors like F. Paul Wilson and H.P. Lovecraft."},{"Title":"50 Ways to Let Go of Painful Relationships","review":"Easy to read.I ordered this book because my 20 something daughters and I enjoy self-help reading.

The Carrier series has been action packed and militarily intense up until &quot;Alpha Strike.&quot; Most of the book is about diplomacy between the U.S., China, and Vietnam with not a lot of air or sea battles taking place.

This book is useful in the sense that there is not an abundance of books available on this specific topic."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"Society has changed much since Penrod was written, but it is still a humorous and whimsical tale of the adventures of a young boy. Some parts of the story reflect the different culture of the day, but not in an offensive way.

It is a good book, which I obtained from my local library in Maryland.I cringed when Penrod acted so violently because he was called a gentlemen. I wonder whether Penrod was emotionally disturbed or was he merely troubled by the tribulations of youth.I also cringed because the author made derogatory remarks, not just terms, about American Negroes. Booth Tarkington explicitly stated that coloured people were lazy. That bothered me the most."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"Purchased this book at the request of my mother-in-law for my grandson. Great read, I think we are all going to read and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"Penrod Schofield is a very bad little boy. Well it is not even that he is a bad child it is just that he gets blamed for every thing that happens; for instance when his sisters dress disappears and ends up in dukes dog house and Penrod got blamed for it even though duke took it. He enjoys writing, and playing with his dog Duke who is almost always with him. Penrod thinks of himself as the class clown and tends not to be very truthful. Penrod has an unimportant role in the school production of The Round Table, but do not tell him that because he thinks if he dose not go the show will not go on with out him. Through out the book Penrod grows up a lot in my opinion for example he tell his father the truth at the end of the book which I did not think would happen. He does get in a lot of trouble whether it's eating too much candy or squealing on his sister.I did not like Penrod because it was in my opinion aimed more for boys and not as much towards girls or maybe it was just me but I was not entertained through out the whole book. There were most definitely parts I liked for example parts were Penrod is in conversation; one part I did not like was the excerpts from Penrod's book about how Mr. Wilson is killed. I liked the conversational parts because through out the book you are kind of in Penrod's head, and I did not like that. But in conversation you sort of get both views from both people not just what Penrod thinks. Don't lie because no one will believe you even if you are right, that is the moral of this story. I hope my review helped."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"I was reminded of the Penrod books by a review exalting them at the white supremacist site American Renaissance. The person who wrote the piece was under the impression that Tarkington was approving of racism. (Such people tend to make the same mistake regarding Mark Twain.) Actually, Tarkington considered himself progressive regarding race relations, despite the racist stereotypes that are so glaring in the Penrod novels to contemporary eyes. There are quite a few wink and nod approvals of the books for the same mistaken reason as at AR here, so I've decided to debunk it.Beyond the racist aspect, are the Penrod novels good children's literature? Not really. They're rather formulaic. Tarkington was neither a Carroll nor a Dickens. There are better books from the past and the present. Unless you are a white supremacist or Far Right sort, I doubt that you will want your child to be exposed to material that is, despite the intent of the author, indoctrination into both sexism and racism. The Penrod books are suitable for adults as historical artifacts, but that is about all."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"The Penrod series of novels is one of the most effective evocations of the experience of being a child ever written. They deal with the daily life and trials of a boy of eleven and twelve in turn of the century (1900) Indiana. The humor is found in the petty hypocrisies of the adults and the naivete of the children and how those two things intertwine. If you have ever day-dreamed in school or yearned for the favor of the prettiest girl in your class, you will appreciate these stories. NB. They are period pieces of the purest kind, so you should expect terms and attitudes to reflect the age from which they come."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"&quot;Penrod&quot; is the humorous story of a twelve-year-old boy, Penrod Schofield, growing up in pre-World War I mid-west. He, with his dog Duke and his friends Sam Williams and the black brothers Herman and Vernon, are constantly getting into scrapes with adults. This is a celebration of the joys of boyhood. But, one wonders what counselors and behavioral psychologists and certain physicians would do today if Penrod Schofield got into their clutches! They might even put him on medication. For just being a boy!!.....&quot;They were upon their great theme: 'When I get to be a man!' Being human, though boys, they consider their present estate too commonplace to be dwelt upon. So, when the old men gather, they say: \\"When I was a boy!\\" It really is the land of nowadays that we never discover.&quot;"},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"Eleven-year-old Penrod Schofield isn't really a bad kid. But circumstances and timing conspire in such a way that he manages to leave a trail of destruction everywhere he goes. This book chronicles Penrod's adventures with his buddy, Sam, his dog, Duke, and his new neighbors, brothers Herman and Verman. It's a hilarious, madcap romp that quickly covers a lot of ground and frequently leaves Penrod's backside smarting at the hand of his exasperated father.If you enjoyed Tom Sawyer or Huck Finn, then do yourself a favor and read Penrod. It's a page-turner, laugh-out-loud funny, and a classic in its own right. For decades, Penrod was very popular novel. But it fails today's litmus test of political correctness, so it is probably doomed to be forgotten. And that's a real tragedy. Penrod is beautifully written. It is filled with love, wit, and charm. And ninety years after it was written, most of what it has to say about people still rings true. Whenever I need a dose of innocence, humor, and insightful commentary on the human condition, I know I can rely on Tarkington to deliver the goods. It's a cliche, but they don't write them like this anymore. Too bad for us."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"&quot;Penrod&quot; is a great novel -- interesting, enlightening, profound, grandiloquent and one of the most hilarious books ever written.Aspects of the subject matter, however, while generally accepted in the early 1900s and treated kindly herein by the author, would simply not fly under today's political-correctness coercion. As far as popular literature is concerned, it is effectively a banned book. Consequently, &quot;Penrod&quot; eventually will fade from general literary consciousness, and linger only in the memories of those who truly appreciate a fine novel."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"In Penrod, Booth Tarkington tells the story of 11-year-old Penrod Scofield in early 20th Century America. Some things about the book are certainly dated, such as stereotypes about and the language used to refer African Americans, but others are timeless.Penrod tries to spend his entire life having what he thinks is harmless fun with his friends and neighbors and learning about the amazing world in which he is living. Unfortunately, everything he does gets him in trouble with the adults around him--teachers, parents, parents of neighbors. And Penrod is always bewildered about the fact that he is in trouble, bewildered by the fact that he takes a beating at punishment, and equally bewildered by the times he escapes punishment.Of course, as a preteen, he is also bewildered by girls. He has a crush on a girl living in his neighborhood, but is completely unaware of how to get him to like her. She refers to him as the worst boy in town, and demands that he never speak to her. Interestingly she angers him even more by calling him a \\"little gentleman\\" than she does by ignoring him and calling him the worst boy in town. Of course, all this leads to Penrod falling deeper in love.You will certainly enjoy this gentle book about the life of a charming and smart boy."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"Penrod is a warm and humorous depiction of a young boy (around 12) and his life with his friends and family.

He was a wise observer of human nature who mastered the psychology of human interactions, especially those pertaining to pre-adolescent boys.Yes, Tarkington knew boys. He knew how they acted, why they acted, what they wanted, what they feared, and he wrote a series of books using this knowledge--\\"Penrod,\\" \\"Penrod and Sam,\\" and \\"Penrod Jashber,\\" all centering around the misadventures of an exuberant, character-filled, eleven-year old named, you guessed it, Penrod Schofield.With the lyricism and observational skills of a poet, Booth Tarkington chronicles carefree days in the young life of Penrod with innocent beauty. He takes us on a joyful romp through a boy's life in a time when boys were much freer to be just that--boys. Akin to Mark Twain's (in)famous Tom Sawyer, Penrod is a rascal, a rapscallion, getting into constant trouble at school, with his family, and with neighborhood boys, yet he is also a clever and creative young lad whom the confines of school and family and boring routine just cannot keep dormant. He is constantly coming up with new ideas that adults just shake their heads at but his fellow exuberant boys understand. And he's a romantic; he is unabashedly in love with the beautiful Marjorie Jones, and their turbulent attraction is a witty embodiment of the immortal bad boy-good girl romance. Penrod is the essence of boyhood.Booth Tarkington's \\"Penrod\\" is absolutely alive with nothing but pure spirit, almost as much as the boy himself. Today spirit like that would be misunderstood in young males and stifled by the world at large, but as for this beautiful work by Booth Tarkington, it will always be just Penrod, his dog, and his friend Sam, living life day by day in a simpler America."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"Penrod Schofield has enough good intentions to pave a Super Highway straight to Hell, but his ways and works are encompassed all about with temptations too powerful to ignore. The hapless Penrod is one of the funniest characters American literature produced, and it's a damn shame that he has been allowed to languish for so long in darkness.It is unfortunate, but America has been muzzled by the forces of Political Correctness, which may be why this book has been swept under the carpet for so long. For Boothe Tarkington wasn't at all acceptable by the standards of our modern self appointed High Priests of PC. But hey, that's all the more reason you should read this hilarious story! Go on, buy this book and defy the Thought Police to tell you what you are and are not allowed to laugh about anymore! We used to have Free Speech, you know, before we were Balkanized by people determined to find something to be offended over at any (ahem!) niggling cost.

But when stumbling across \\"Penrod, His Complete Story\\" at around the age of 30, my first thought was, \\"Where has this book been all my life?\\" During my initial reading, I digested dozens of passages two and three times in order to wring out of them every last hoot and holler of laughter, a fact which caused my family often to wonder if I had lost it. It is the only book I have ever read eight times. Writing with remarkable prose, Booth Tarkington weaves the kind of tale that would cause any middle-age spread to jiggle with the laughter it evokes. A caveat, however; no, make that two: (1) One must be literate in order to understand this book, preferably with a mid-twentieth century or earlier education; and (2) Check any politically correct baggage and all tender sensibilities at the door. It has now been ten years since my last reading. Time to pull \\"Penrod\\" from the shelf once again."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"This printing is an outrage!

These three novels span a 44-year period of time in publication, yet it's interesting how similar they are in incident (the children having to submit to \\"adult\\" forms of entertainment [performing in plays, putting on recitations, taking dancing lessons], boyhood fights against bullies, resorting to mild forms of blackmail to get unwelcomed things done, perplexing adults with all forms of mischievous [but relatively harmless] behavior); I doubt that would be the case over these last 44 years. Penrod's list of misadventures includes being embarrassed before everyone at the school play, daydreaming at school and making a fool of himself, getting sick on too much candy, dipping Victorine's pigtails in the inkwell, fighting over the attention of Marjorie Jones, and embarrassing Mrs. Bassett in front of the minister. As Tom Sawyer once dreamed of dying to \\"teach his ungrateful aunt a lesson,\\" Penrod has his fantastical adventure novel he's writing in which he recasts all his disappointments in a much more daring and heroic light. Tarkington has a good ear for the talk of children, and the style in which he writes is sharply comical and appealing to adults. Still a funny book today."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"I just wanted to note that the Doris Day movies &quot;On Moonlight Bay&quot; and &quot;By the Light of the Silvery Moon&quot; were based on the Penrod stories."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"I am an eleven year old boy and an avid reader. I fully understand Penrod's unique qualities being his age and love the book. I read the book in about two days the first time and spent almost a year reading and reading this timeless classic. You will get years of amusement from this great book. I can fully relate to Penrod being somewhat like him. Two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"Booth Tarkington's humorous tales of 12-year old Penrod Schofield compare favorably with Mark Twain's novels Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn and Rudyard Kipling's Starky and Friends. The immensely popular Penrod (1914) was followed by Penrod and Sam (1916) and Penrod Jashber (1929).Unfortunately, some of Tarkington's tales of young Penrod reflect the commonplace racial prejudice of early twentieth century America. This prejudice is not mean-spirited nor vicious, but nonetheless some stories may be unsettling to today's readers. Racial prejudice is not front and center, but is simply part of the background. Racial comments are made in a casual, off-handed, unconscious fashion.Penrod Schofield is a typical boy. He has little interest in being a perfect young gentleman (and in fact considers the term somewhat pejorative). He is not bad boy by any means, but he does seem to be continually in trouble. He is embarrassed by his forced participation in school plays and dance classes, and always seems to offend the only girl for whom he has some liking.At one point Penrod quickly makes friends with two young black boys, Herman and Verman, and persuades them to participate in an exhibition as Herman the one-fingered tatood wild man and Verman the savage tatood wild boy who talks only in his native languages. Their small earnings from their amateur carnival are shared fairly. Penrod is particularly impressed that their father was in jail: \\"Pappy cut a man, an' de police done kep' him in jail sense Chris'mus-time; but dey goin' tuhn him loose ag'in nex' week.\\"A later chapter in which Herman and Verman save Penrod from a white bully is titled Coloured Troops in Action. The reader recognizes that Penrod's occasional expressions like darky boy (and other more objectionable terms) are never intentionally offensive, but are simply common speech (and hence reflections of a pervasive, socially acceptable prejudice, not a personal prejudice on Penrod's part.)Nonetheless, Tarkington's Penrod tales are not likely to be found in classrooms today. Rightly or wrongly, later generations (and certainly recent generations) hold earlier generations to new standards. There is much to be said for and against political correctness, but it is a shame when earlier literature is ignored (a prejudicial censorship?) for modern sins.Penrod provides a fascinating insight into how completely racial prejudice permeated American society in the early twentieth century. A creative high school history teacher might use Penrod as an illustration that societal norms do change in relatively short periods. In any event I recommend Penrod to any reader with a little tolerance for past prejudices and past intolerances.Booth Tarkington is a lesser known author today, although other than William Faulkner, he is the only author to have been awarded the Pulitzer Prize in fiction twice - The Magnificent Ambersons (1918) and Alice Adams (1921)."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"After all these years, it was a treat to read a chapter or two of \\"Penrod\\" taking me back to a much simpler time.

It was a great story about a 12 year old boy named penrod along with his faithful companion duke and his friends Sam,Verman, and Herman. The gang was always clashing with adults and teacherS making it a humurous story about young boys getting into mischief. Its an amazing story that yound adults can relate to as well as adults in their past experiences in their school days.

Read this book and go back to an innocent time where you dip girls' pigtails into ink pots, put on a show in the barn out back, and scandalize society by doing the Turkey Trot.I would like to recommend the book to younger readers, but as other reviewers have mentioned, what was perfectly normal back at the turn of the 20th century is considered politically incorrect concerning non-Caucasian characters.

Over the years I've become more accepting of the views and positions of the characters other than Penrod and Sam (e.g. Penrod's parents and older sister, Sam's older brother, Marjorie Jones, Maurice Levy, and even Penrod's little dog Duke) but this maturity of viewpoint adds to the overall pleasure of the books and does not detract at all from the sidesplitting comic effects evoked by the combination of Penrod's scrapes and Booth Tarkington's deadpan (and sometimes mock-heroic) narrative descibing these scrapes. The story of \\"The Great Tar Fight\\" rivals the chapter on the last day of school in \\"Tom Sawyer\\" for sheer sustained humor.I would like to mention in passing that in three of the four best American books about boyhood (\\"Tom Sawyer\\", \\"Penrod\\", \\"The City Boy\\" (by Herman Wouk) and \\"Huckleberry Finn\\") the protagonists of the first three each have a strong crush on a particular girl.

And he's a romantic; he is unabashedly in love with the beautiful Marjorie Jones, and their turbulent attraction is a witty embodiment of the immortal bad boy-good girl romance. Penrod is the essence of boyhood.Booth Tarkington's \\"Penrod\\" is absolutely alive with nothing but pure spirit, almost as much as the boy himself. Today spirit like that would be misunderstood in young males and stifled by the world at large, but as for this beautiful work by Booth Tarkington, it will always be just Penrod, his dog, and his friend Sam, living life day by day in a simpler America."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"As good as when I read it more than 30 years ago.

Keep in mind, this book was written by a thirteen year old violinist and was written for other pre-teens and young teenagers. The thought of so many adults picking up this book, reading it, and writing horrid reviews is astounding to me. This book was written for the 10-14 year old age group and for that age group it is very suitable. It was written by a child and should not be judge as if it had been written by an adult for adults. This book was not meant for adults. Before you toss aside the idea of getting this as a gift for someone due to the reviews by so many being bad, keep in mind those were adults reading a children's book. Would you expect a 18 year old to be amused by Dr. Sues? No, because it is not in the appropriate age range.It is a good book for the age group it was written and intended for.

I think we believe it's all glamour and excitement, but few of us realize all the anxiety, competition and hours of work it takes to make it - that's all behind the scenes; but it's brought out in this really thoughtful novel. These are kids dealing with all the heavy emotional issues and day to day stress that all of us do, but on top of it they have this whole subculture - a world with intense and interesting conductors and teachers, hours of practice, competitions, exciting performances all over the world, and dark secrets. The mysterious spin toward the end of the novel is really unexpected and keeps you glued to the edge of your seat. Everyone I know who has read it already says it's one of the best novels they ever read. I got really involved in trying to figure out the mystery as I got the clues."},{"Title":"Woman That Never Evolved","review":"This book deals mostly with primates. Despite the layperson style title, the book itself is quite scientific and detailed. This can be great for those educated in anthropology and sociobiology as it is very thorough, giving exact names and evolutionary history on the primates discussed, yet can seem a little dry to the layperson, especially if read for long stretches. However, layperson, do not despair. Hrdy will often use humour to lighten or better explain an idea and when she occasionally uses jargon it is usually tongue-in-cheek and always explained. Many of you will be attracted by the feminist-sounding title, but do not be fooled. Only rarely does the author tie in her observations with human behaviour. In fact, any feminism does not appear until the final 2% of the book and seems to simply be angry raving against the oppression of women, and is not linked as well as it could be to the previous 150 or so pages. Generally, however, I enjoyed the book, even though it contained more detail than I, as a layperson, actually needed. To anyone unhappy with the stereotype of the strong male in charge of his passive harem of females or with the aggressive male just using the females as a vessel for his genes, then this can shed new light on the way primates behave and are shaped by their biology. Tying in the information with the woman in the title is left up to the reader."},{"Title":"Woman That Never Evolved","review":"Found this book to be an excellent read. I am a biologist and physical anthropologist by training...with specific interest in human evolution. The links between behavior in our closest primate relatives and ourselves...are very relevant. I found Hrdy's scientific discussion of these issues...appropriate and as insightful as science allows us to be. I would recommend this book and other books by this author...she is a scientist with the background to draw connections AND and excellent science writier. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Woman That Never Evolved","review":"Sarah Blaffer Hrdy (born 1946) is an American anthropologist and primatologist, and is Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at the University of California at Davis, where she remains involved with the Animal Behavior Graduate Group. She has also written books such asMother Nature: Maternal Instincts and How They Shape the Human SpeciesandMothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding. (NOTE: Page references below refer to the 256-page 1981 paperback edition.)She states early on, \\"Myths about women ruling the world usually come linked with a theory about the true nature of women. The prototypical matriarchs, the Amazons, were believed to be on the whole aggressive and warlike---masculine spirits in drag... Valerie Solanis revived the Amazonian ethos in her 1967Scum Manifesto... while Elizabeth Gould Davis [inThe First Sex The Book That Proves That Woman's Contribution to Civilization Has Been Greater Then Man's]... averred that there once was a 'golden age of queendoms, when peace and justice prevailed on earth and the gods of war had not been born.'\\" (Pg. 11)She notes, \\"by and large the reproductive strategy of the female is what determines how much the father must provide... we should not ignore those ways in which monogamy is imposed on males by females.\\" (Pg. 55) She observes, \\"The basic dynamics of the mating system depend not so much on male predilections as on the degree to which one female tolerates another... if male breeding strategies are determined by how females space themselves, and if that, in turn, is determined by the availability and utilization of resources, food becomes, quite literally, the consuming question.\\" (Pg. 95) She adds, \\"competition among females is central to primate social organization.\\" (Pg. 96)She suggests, \\"The vision of assertive, dominance-oriented females differs radically from existing stereotypes of female primates as nonstop mothers whose perennial preoccupation with nurturing offspring keeps them out of politics.\\" (Pg. 127) She argues, \\"Yet the problems are more than scientific ones, because whether or not we can document the natural competitiveness of women, we are still going to have to deal with the fairly well documented problem that unrelated women have working together over a long period of time---even when they share a common goal.\\" (Pg. 130)She asserts, \\"Whole chapters of human history could be read as an effort to contain the promiscuity of women and thus to establish, from circumstantial evidence, the paternity that could never be proved directly... Whatever the biological component may be, the behavioral component is readily demonstrated.\\" (Pg. 179)This an interesting and challenging book, that (along with her other, more recent books) provides another perspective on human social origins."},{"Title":"Woman That Never Evolved","review":"Sarah Blaffer Hrdy is supposedly a feminist sociobiologist. In reality, she is more sociobiological than feminist. Reading her book was a real disappointment.Despite its feminist veneer, \\"The Woman That Never Evolved\\" is essentially just another sociobiological book preaching that biology is destiny, patriarchy is natural and women complicit in their own oppression (no less!).The only difference with the regular androcentric literature is that Hrdy wants to believe that equality between the sexes is at least a possibility. However, her belief in sociobiology is so strong that this possibility seems very remote indeed. She clearly thinks that only the contemporary Western world has achieved something close to equality, and that this is a unique situation that might never be repeated again. The reason? Our evolutionary heritage, which apparently favours the males, after all.Naturally, Hrdy attacks the idea that there ever was equality between the sexes: \\"The female with \`equal rights' never evolved; she was invented, and fought for consciously with intelligence, stuborness, and courage. (...) To assume that women today are regaining a natural pre-eminence, or reinstating some original social equality, belittles the real accomplishments and underestimates its fragility. However well-intentioned, these myths pose grave dangers to the actual progress of women's rights. They devalue the unique advances made by women in the last few hundred years and tempt us to a false security\\".This, of course, simply isn't true. There is ample anthropological evidence that non-patriarchal societies have existed: the Iroquis are a classical example, another are the Montagnais-Naskapi. Other examples could be mentioned, too. Women have wielded considerable power even in hierarchic societies, for instance in Africa. Nor is it true that patriarchy was the norm in prehistoric times. How does Hrdy explain the Neolithic cultures, which were often peaceful, egalitarian and were centred on worship of female deities? Pointing out the enormous variation between human cultures is hardly a \\"grave danger\\" to the fight for women's rights. Quite the contrary, it bolsters it. Besides, the activists who believe in these supposed \\"myths\\" hardly \\"underestimate\\" remaining patriarchal structures. Chances are, it's exactly these people who most sharply criticize, say, androcentric sociobiology...Another problem with this book is that it mentions the bonobo only in passing. This may have been understandable in 1981, when the book was first published. It's less understandable in a new (almost unrevised) edition from 1999. Bonobos are \\"matriarchal\\", since the females dominate the males. Leaving this out in a book about our evolutionary history smacks of an ideological blind spot. Bonobos, after all, are just as closely related to humans as are chimpanzees. Interestingly, bonobos are peaceful and bisexual, in marked contrast to the murderous chimps, infanticidal langurs and harem-herding Hamadryas baboons so beloved by sociobiologists (all dutifully included in this book). The bonobo also undermine Hrdy's idea that australopithecines must have been polygynous and (presumably) patriarchal since they had sexual dimorphism, with the males being larger. Bonobo males are larger than the females and have canines. Despite this, the females are dominant!True, humans aren't bonobos. But then, we aren't chimpanzees, langurs or baboons either. If comparisons should be made between humans and other primates, great care should be exercised, otherwise we might simply project a behaviour typical of our own culture onto a suitable animal, and then use this projection as \\"proof\\" that our own culture is \\"natural\\". Since human cultures are variable, and primate species differ in their behaviour, anything can be proven with such a method.Supporters of women's emancipation will find little of use in this book. It's a pity that Sarah Blaffer Hrdy haven't transcended her role as the house feminist of sociobiology."},{"Title":"Stampede to timberline: The ghost towns and mining camps of Colorado","review":"I have been researching the area of Colorado where my great grandparents were pioneer settlers in the 1870s. Their town, Rosita, in Custer County, is listed in many \\"ghost town\\" books, with a paragraph or two about its history. That's what I was expecting with Stampede to Timberline, but this book provided much more in-depth information.In the 1940s, Muriel Sibell Wolle traveled to Rosita, and to dozens of other old mining areas. In each community, Wolle interviewed the oldest residents she could find. She asked them to recall details of the earliest days of the area and she recorded their stories in this book. Wolle also sketched a scene from each community, which she used to illustrate her stories.In this book, I was delighted to find historical details about the area I have researched, that I have not found anywhere else! This is a large book, and every locale included in it has first-hand reports of historical information. This book was a huge undertaking and accomplishment for Muriel Sibell Wolle.I would very much recommend Stampede to Timberline for students of Colorado history and for tourists, as well."},{"Title":"Stampede to timberline: The ghost towns and mining camps of Colorado","review":"Having had an interest in ghost towns since the 1960s, I have accumulated a large collection of books on the subject. I can say without any reservation that the books by the late Muriel Sibell Wolle and also books by Lambert Florin are in a class all their own. I have not seen this particular edition because mine was printed in 1974. The first printing was in 1949. This latest version should be the best of all.Muriel's books are what ghost town books should be. They are filled with stories about the towns and the people who lived in them and that brings the towns to life. I also have many newer books on ghost towns but none come close to those by Wolle or Florin. For example, newer books by Philip Varney have nice color pictures but they lack the real heart of ghost town books... the stories. Varney and later authors tend to simply present dry facts and statistics about the towns (and not many of them!) accompanied by color pictures. They treat the towns more as scenery while largely ignoring the history that makes the towns so interesting. Wolle and Florin's books are mostly text and the are illustrated by charming b&w; drawings. Wolle, an artist, did her own sketches. I have no problem with color photographs of ghost towns since I am a professional photographer myself and ghost towns are one of my specialties but there is just a timeless quality and moodiness to sketches and b&w; photographs that link them to the past.It's hard to put Stampede to Timberline down once one begins to read it. In fact, reading it has rekindled a dream I have had about moving to Colorado (I am retired), getting an old but rugged 4WD vehicle with good ground clearance and searching for more of these towns and mining camps. Be warned that if you are not from Colorado or are otherwise not used to driving on mountain passes, you will be in for a shock when you try to get to some of these towns. Some of the \\"roads\\" are so narrow that one car barely fits on it with it's wheels hanging over cliffs that may be thousands of feet high. Some of them couldn't even be called trails! They're more like incredibly steep boulder strewn riverbeds that cling to cliff faces. You will read about some of Muriel's adventures on those roads in this book.The only negative about Wolle's books and those by Florin is that they are dated and many of the towns described in them are greatly changed since the books were first written. Some towns have vanished; some have crumbled to near oblivion; some have been re-born and are thriving. But no other books about ghost towns give you greater background information on these old towns and mining camps or treat you with such fascinating reading.Wolle and Florin made a tremendous contribution in preserving the memory of these towns. Their books should be the foundation of any library about ghost towns. I cannot recommend this book or Florin's books more highly."},{"Title":"Stampede to timberline: The ghost towns and mining camps of Colorado","review":"I ENJOYED THE BOOK AS IT TELLS IT LIKE IT WAS.REAL GOOD STUFF ON BLOODY BRIDLES WAITE, ONE OF MY UNSUNG HEROES OF THE WEST.

I picked this book up in a log cabin in the Adirondacks, it having thoughtfully being left there by a previous vacationer, and couldn't put it down! While at some points in the novel you feel Du Maurier is being an upper-class patrician, there's an ironic twist to the tale that proves a thought-provoking dessert. Following the travails of a wealthy, landed Irish family, the Brodericks, the book is a critique of how the energetic, entrepreneurial founder of the family fortune left a mixed legacy to his descendants. The family's wealth does not leave it immune to the less attractive traits created by nature and nurture nor to the changing times. The story of this compelling clan (and their rivals) is a reminder that, no matter how fortunate, there is a very great limit to the control we have over our destinies."},{"Title":"Hungry Hill","review":"Far from Du Maurier's best, this multi-generational tale follows the rise and fall of the Brodricks, an Anglo-Irish clan based in the vicinity of Cork (which here masquerades as 'Slane,' not to be confused with the actual Slane situated north of Dublin). 'Copper John,' on the verge of reaping untold wealth from his copper mine on Hungry Hill, is cursed by Morty Donovan, an Irishman whose family was displaced by John Brodrick's English antecedents and who has deeply resented the family ever since. The old curse plays out in a reasonably entertaining chronicle of untimely death, familial misunderstanding, and ultimate destruction in the space of a century, ending in the 1920s at the time of the Irish Civil War. Du Maurier's depiction of the Irish population (\\"irresponsible . . . their heads full of nothing but dogs and horses,\\" according to Copper John) displays uncomfortable prejudice, and although the Irish are the survivors at the end of her tale, her portrayal of the proud Brodricks as progressives contrasted with the shiftless local folk demonstrates a lack of sympathy for the Irish perspective which strikes the contemporary reader as narrow and dated."},{"Title":"Hungry Hill","review":"Exquisite period view of our living experience. From the &quot;arranged&quot; to the destined, by choice or by consequence maybe we can never be certain. You can feel the wind in your hair standing overlooking the moor with the smell of the damp earth beneath your soul ... the manor faintly lit by the evening light as you return with the dogs at your feet... the taker or the giver. Fate awaits you... a remarkable story of a generation etched in a time gone by.

The Doonovans were the original owners of Clonmere Castle and they resent and curse the Brodricks success. For generations the feud between the two families has been going on and on until it reaches it startling eruption.This novel is a bit different from other works by Daphne du Maurier, it deals with a large span of time from 1820-1920, and has a large cast of characters none of which are more important than others as they all build on each other and become important as the novel progresses. Romance scenes in this novel are not as huge foundations as they are in her other books like Rebecca, Jamaica Inn, or My Cousin Rachel. The romance that goes on in this book more builds up on other elements of the novel. Even though I found this book to be a little different from some of the other books that I have read by Daphne Du Maurier I still really enjoyed Du Maurier's ability to create a unique cast of characters all of whom has faults but readers can still fall in love with these characters, despite their faults. The only thing I would have liked better in this book would have been more descriptions of the mines or mining lives, to me this was the only part of the novel that I had a hard time imagining or becoming real. I don't think this was the best of Daphne Du Maurier's novels that I have read thus far I still really enjoyed the style because it was different and I thought it showed how versatile she is as an author."},{"Title":"Hungry Hill","review":"Du Maurier recounts the lives of several generations of the Brodrick family, landholders in Dunhaven Ireland starting in 1820 when \\"Copper John\\" Brodrick cements a deal to start a copper mine at the base of Hungry Hill. John's main priorities are the business and its profits, with little concern for the day to day welfare of the miners and their families - enflaming a long-standing family grudge that leads to a curse on the Brodrick family. The story of the family continues with subsequent generations as Copper John's sons and his grandsons battle to maintain the mines and the family fortune with the fluctuating price of copper and tin, along with their own personal and mental battles. The story finally culminates in 1920 as the last of the line John-Henry returns from the Great War in 1920 to reclaim the family estate and finds himself unwittingly involved in the Irish rebellion with unexpected consequences to him and the family home Clonmere.Overall, this was quite a good read despite a stereotyped character or two (it was written in the 1940's) and a storyline a bit on the predictable side. While it might not appeal as much to those readers used to Du Maurier's usual fare, i.e. Rebecca and My Cousin Rachel, her writing is superb and understated as always and IMO raises this from a three to a four star read as the reader sees the viewpoint of both the Landholder and the difficulties of the Irish tenants. Still tops with me in multi-generational family sagas is Susan Howatch'sCashelmara- don't miss it."},{"Title":"Hungry Hill","review":"This was a great family saga!

(I think du Maurier had a reason for that.) The first half of the book is better than the second half. At least, I enjoyed those characters more. It's a great book but if I didn't know I never would have guessed du Maurier wrote it.

So along comes this handsome edition of the sketches and narratives about the Encantadas (Darwin's Galapagos)- and not an early work, but written after Moby Dick - which in less than a hundred pages shows once again what an astounding writer Melville is. The four pages devoted to the island's tortoises are as good as any he wrote about whales. A sample: \\"That these tortoises are the victims of a penal, or malignant, or perhaps a downright diabolical enchanter, seems in nothing more likely than in that strange infatuation of hopeless toil which so often possesses them. I have known them in their journeyings ram themselves heroically against rocks, and long abide there, nudging, wriggling, wedging, in order to displace them, and so hold on their inflexible path. Their crowning curse is their drudging impulse to straightforwardness in a belittered world.\\" Of the actual narratives, the most anthologized is the story about the Chola Widow, which is heartbreaking, but even more so when read in the context of the whole suite of pieces.

Perhaps, though, you know a little about the man, and want to learn a little more about what he thinks of things. This is the book that you're looking for, then. It's an incredibly lovingly written study of mythological / religious symbology through most places & times in the history of our little blue rock. With about 500 illustrations, I believe, it makes just as proper a coffee table book as it does a reference source. What's wonderful is that it doesn't take a look at cultures one by one, and examine their belief systems, each in turn--it examines the symbols themselves, instead, and then focuses on the commonalities in the world's living and lost theological systems that have grown out of these archetypal symbols. And like I said, maybe you don't want to read 5 or 6 volumes of scholarly literature just to get at the parts that speak to you.

Campbell may wander off sometimes but he never loses what he is talking about out of sight."},{"Title":"The mythic image (Bollingen series C)","review":"Professor Campbell is perhaps the single greatest expert on world mythology and comparative mythology. His first book for public consumption was based on his lectures, originally called \\"How to Read a Myth,\\" and better known by its eventual title, \\"The Hero with a Thousand Faces.\\" This book came out in 1949 and popularized the ideas that myths from many lands have common themes, and that the journey of the hero to redefine himself (and often society as well) is culturally universal. George Lucas claimed that Campbell's ideas were highly influential to him and the development of the Star Wars movies in general and the Luke Skywalker character in particular.The Mythic Image came out decades after \\"Hero WATF\\", beyond the point where Campbell needed to prove his points. By the 1970s he was already the expert in his field, with broad influence extending into literature and movies. The Mythic Image is more heart-felt and much less academic. It is also not broken down in typical categories by nation and culture. Instead the organization is based on universal symbols and themes, like virgin births, Death and Resurrection, and the world mountain or world axis. Such themes generally validate the social order. A hero, god, or king worthy of respect and worship will of course have a miraculous birth, often of a virgin mother. Returning from the realm of death shows his great power. And his throne and capital city are, of course, at the center of the world. Campbell also points out that myths tend to create a sense of awe and mystery while explaining the nature of the universe and the stages of life.These are broad ideas which Campbell has explained thoroughly in several of his more scholarly books. Because I am an author of books about prophecy, I was also scouring Campbell's thoughts on myth and religion for specific comments useful to my own research. Specific things I found interesting in the Mythic Image (aside from the hundreds of B&W; photographs) include many new topics or interpretations which Campbell introduced me to. Some were more academic, including aspects of Horus' sacrifice for the resuurection of Osiris, Vishnu's role as a cosmic center and energizer of our sun, and the fact that certain mathematical mistakes and miscalculations from a Han Chinese eclipse table somehow made their way into an ancient Mayan eclipse table in Mexico... I was also very interested in the Earth as Vishnu's bride, given my own focus on Christ's wedding and his \\"bride\\" in End Times Bible prophecy. Other comments Campbell made were just simple observations I had never considered - such as the Christmas tree with a star on top being a *typical* representation of the world axis pointing to the pole star.Campbell did occasionally seem a little naive, specifically about the Beth Alpha Synagogue Zodiac, commenting that he didn't understand why their zodiac would be misaligned. He felt is was not properly showing the sky as it was in the sixth century, but was oriented to a time thousands of years earlier - and Campbell attributed this to a lack of understanding or concern on the part of the builders. But no one makes stone monuments indiscriminately; the details have to be carved and they are always thought out and chosen for a reason. This zodiac is aligned to a sky from thousands of years earlier for the same reason others like the zodiac from Hathor's Temple at Dendara, Egypt is - the builders were intentionally pointing out the ancient moment in time which could most accurately be described by showing us how the night sky looked at that time. But archeoastronomy is a relatively new field and we should not discredit Campbell much over this misunderstanding. It is harder to understand why he was confused by the sun-god Helios at the center of the zodiac where he would have expected to see Christ - because the analogies between Jesus and the Sun are numerous and ancient, and Campbell must have been aware of them.Overall, this is a great introductory book for anyone interested in comparative or universal mythology, and is also a great way to gain an understanding of Campbell's take on myth without reading his earlier and more scholarly books."},{"Title":"The mythic image (Bollingen series C)","review":"The seller was prompt and the book was in great condition.

The book opens with an introduction to optical networking, discusses SONET/SDH architectures, and briefly presents all the concepts and technologies, which are covered in detailed later chapters.The second chapter delves immediately into the details of Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and analog signal processing. T-carrier and E-carrier hierarchies and their signaling and framing formats are examined, followed-up by a review of the ISDN BRI/PRI standard and ISDN frame formats.The next section of the book looks at the physical characteristics of fiber optics including the materials used, physical construction of the cable, and behavioral and performance characteristics of different optical materials under differing conditions. For those interested in calculating their own measurements, refraction, power measurement, and span loss formulas are presented along with a few case studies as examples. Splicing techniques and optical connectors are also covered here. Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM) (both coarse and dense) and various dispersion compensation techniques finish up this section.Chapters 5 and 6 cover SONET and SDH architectures respectively. This is a fairly thorough examination of the two standards and includes a detailed look at the electrical and optical signals, SONET/SDH technology layers, framing, transmission overhead, multiplexing, error reporting, topologies and topology protection strategies, to name just a few! Packet ring technologies such as gigabyte Ethernet and Multi-service Provisioning Platform (MSPP) are also presented in this section for those applications where end-to-end Ethernet framing is desirable.The Cisco product lines for SONET and SDH platforms are presented next, with a fairly in-depth look at the Cisco ONS 15454 which is positioned as Cisco's most versatile and widely used multi-service add/drop multiplexer (ADM). Configuration options for control, alarm, electrical, optical, and Ethernet modules are examined along with an introduction to Cisco's Transport Controller (CTC), a graphical application for provisioning and managing optical networks.Chapters 9-11 provide detailed, over 300 pages worth, of explanations and examples for configuring the ONS 15454 for SONET MSSP, SDH MSPP, and Ethernet over SONET &amp; SDH. Step by step directions for different configurations utilizing CTC, and accompanying screen shots, make for an easily understandable provisioning and configuration process.Overall, this book serves as a welcome addition to any technical bookshelf. Whether a seasoned technical expert looking for a good reference book, or a beginner looking to learn about optical networking technologies, this book is well written for both audiences. This book earns a place as one of my personal favorites. For those looking to test their knowledge on the material covered in this book, chapter 12 provides a selection of insightful and challenging case studies."},{"Title":"Optical Network Design and Implementation","review":"Where do I start with such a superb book? I recently read the book titled \\"Optical Network Design and Implementation\\" by Vivek Alwayn. ISBN: 1587051052. I had looked at several sources for a good book on optical networks. After searching technical bookstores and on-line searches, I became discouraged. I usually have high expectations when it comes to books. Then I finally found this one, which blew my expectations out of the water. This book is a great resource of information regarding optical networking.This book goes into significant detail about the different technologies that make up optical networking. The book covers everything from the refraction of light to different multiplexing methods.I would recommend this book to any Network Engineer that is interested in optical networks. The content relates mostly to work in the services provider space, but for people like me that can't stand not knowing, this is it.There is literally at least one figure per page if not more. The author and contributors have done a superb job of making sure the appropriate illustrations; tables and figures are in the detail of the book. These figures assist a great deal when attempting to accurately comprehend a certain topic or technology.The first half of the book is strictly standards technology. The author wastes no time at all diving into technology. This book is strictly for the engineer. Lightweights need not apply.The second half of the book provides detailed information on Cisco's arsenal of equipment that provide Multiservice SONET and SDH functions. The author includes screen shots of the configuration examples along the way. Having screen shots included in the text has definite advantages, especially when it comes to teaching the reader what to look for and turning text into actual application. Often times saving the reader time when it comes to implementing. The disadvantage to including the screen shots is that it's very possible as the product matures, that the screen may change slightly or perhaps significantly. This might confuse a reader in the future.There is an outstanding section that lists the cards and components for the Cisco ONS 15454. Another nice addition is the inclusion of information regarding the Cisco Transport Controller (CTC) and the Cisco Transport Manager (CTM). There are several screen shots along with great information about these applications.The remaining chapters cover just about every detail that's needed to configure the ONS 15454. This device seems to have everything you need to scale the Metro Area Network. The authors also includes in a few foundational chapters, a kind of, where we came from and where we are going in the Metro Area space. This section is a very nice read for someone who doesn't live and breathe MAN technologies.The company I work for is getting ready to start the process of searching for alternate solutions and ways to scale the Metro Area Network for our companies use. This book has provided me with a great perspective as to what is available today and the pro's and con's of several optical technologies.Thanks again Cisco Press for publishing a vital resource."},{"Title":"Optical Network Design and Implementation","review":"I work for a switch fabric semiconductor company. I wanted to gain a better understanding of the types of systems that our components would be used in, specifically relating to IP-over-SONET traffic, MSPPs and ring protection mechanisms. This book fit the bill quite nicely. It covers the basics of fiber optic technology, including DWDM. The treatment of SONET and SDH is very thorough, with good illustrations included. The last part of the book deals specifically with the provisioning and applications of various Cisco ONSs. I found the Network Case Studies in the last chapter to be very informative, as it helps reinforce the material and demonstrate how it can be applied to a real-world network.I give the review 4 stars, for a couple reasons. First, having experience as a designer of fiber optic transponder modules, I felt that the treatment of fiber optic technologies and DWDM in chapters 3 and 4 was a little on the light side. Some of the important concepts, such as chromatic dispersion, are treated in somewhat vague terms and could be explained more fully, without getting too technical. For a better understanding of such concepts, I recommend \\"Understanding Fiber Optics\\" by Hecht.Also, there are numerous small errors in the book that may lead to misunderstanding of the material. Some errors look like simple typos, and others are technical errors. They are too numerous to list here, but hopefully an errata or second revision will be published to correct these. For example, in the unidirectional and bidirectional rings shown in figures 5-36 through 5-38, the east and west traffic directions are swapped. This may cause confusion when attempting to trace the traffic flow in the diagrams, as described in the text (which is correct).Figure 5-22 shows a diagram of an Add/Drop Mux, but the text describes it as a Terminal Mux. granted, these are small problems, but may cause confusion for some, nonetheless.All in all, this is a very good book and I highly recommend it.Roger MillerEnigma Semiconductor"},{"Title":"Optical Network Design and Implementation","review":"Optical Network Design and Implementation is the most technically informative Cisco book I have ever written. So much so, that it should be required reading for any WAN engineer/architect.Most standard Cisco training (CCNA, CCNP, CCDP, CCIE R&S;) will not provide the information in this book. However, all WAN engineers need a solid understanding of optical networking, particularly SONET/SDH rings for large circuit delivery and protection at important locations. Many outages are caused by lack of or improper configuration and provisioning of SONET rings. Redundant routers, good IGP design, and backup links can be rendered useless when all transport is delivered over the same broken SONET ring. This book provides the necessary level of detail so engineers can prevent these problems and provision new SONET rings correctly.The only drawback of this book (and thus the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is its level of detail. This book is not for beginners or for light reading. I even had to read the book twice to get the information clear. Many sections are extremely detailed, explaining traffic down to the byte level. There were also a large amount of acronyms to keep track of. The book reads more like a manual than a book. Nonetheless, this book is worth the reading effort. It will be hard to find this level of detail on optical networking anywhere else, even on the Internet.The book layout is essentially split into two. The first section explains optical networking in general, vendor neutral format (fiber optics, SONET, SDH, RPR, etc). This is very useful for all readers. The second section explains the Cisco MSPP platform. This will be very useful to organizations using this platform."},{"Title":"Optical Network Design and Implementation","review":"I work every day with fiber optic networks and didnt know anything about Cisco programming but didnt had trouble for reading this book.

Nothing short of a graduate level engineering course will deliver as much content to the reader as this volume does, and at this price!Although somewhat specific in later chapters to Cisco ONS equipment, the theory and early chapters serve as a definitive reference for all Network Engineers. Optical Network Design and Implementation opens with an introduction to optical networking, Time Division Multiplexing, Fiber Optic Technology and Wavelength Division Multiplexing to refresh and educate the reader just prior to immersion into the SONET/SDH and Multiservice arena.A complete reference to Cisco IOS commands for ML-Series ONS cards is included, as well as a comprehensive Glossary, and References used throughout the book. It would be hard to find anything further on the subject, unless you have access to Cal Poly or MIT campus libraries; or you are currently enrolled in those prestigious engineering programs.For those interested in pursuing the CCIE Service Provider Track certification, or the Cisco Optical Specialist qualification, this book is necessary for your professional library.As the world hungers forever more information, and that need grows at an exponential rate, there will also be a requirement to fill that need with the required data. Optical Network Design and Implementation provides the path to meet that need by educating the engineer of the capabilities of Optical Networks now, and shows the promise of what the future will bring. By use of a broad range of technical details, configuration, illustrations and examples, Optical Network Design and Implementation can be used for anyone designing, implementing, or supporting an optical network.Traditionally Optical Networking has always been a Service Provider or Metro Area Network service and engineering necessity. As the demand for higher bandwidth and additional capacity pushes its way out of the campus LAN, additional knowledge will be necessary to implement CWDM and DWDM at the local layers of the network edge. Another area of concern, lurking deep in the campus area network where infrastructure growth usually is limited, is lack of spare fiber to implement new optical network designs. Optical Network Design and Implementation provides the knowledge to overcome these barriers now and well into the future.Even if you don't use Cisco equipment, the book can increase your knowledge and understanding of current optical technologies to provide you with design concepts and rules for building highly scalable optical networks."},{"Title":"Optical Network Design and Implementation","review":"I had been struggling to find an Optical book that covered SDH in detail from a Cisco ONS perspective.

We live under the force fields of an overabundance of musical styles, where the popular strains seem to be like an oil slick that has touched every shore now,that of the consonant triad.Peter Schat is the Man for this to step in and make sense out of this hyperreal reality which has masqueraded as music throughout the world. He himself has practiced every style and musical language known to man, and believes and we can all rightly agree that there has been a persistent fall, a transgressiveness in the art of composition, where we have multiple Copy Cats of All, with plenty of Neo's thrown in the mix to render a kinda conceptual pseudo sustenance, so we have Neo-Expressionists of various sorts, Wolfgang Rihm, Brian Ferneyhough, even Elliott Carter.Of course the market luvs plurality for now it can cash in on everyone, and the fragmentariness of the styles pulverized and multipled over the globe. These terms, as Neo this, are for discussion only and I hate utilizing all these false terms but they do point to a concpetual concretion, a frequency, a reiteration of the musics materials, if you, for example, persistently utilize dissonance as natural to you as shaving then you're an expressionist, likewise if you tend to desire never to change the chord, or fairly infrequently and are enamored over consonant sounding timbres, as open Fifths and Fourths, witrh percolator like rhythms bouncing below, well these features are smatterings of a stout upstanding minimalist, with all due respect to the serious practicioners of all credos. In steps Peter Schat who beleives he can run a pathway uniting both worlds, the Consonance-ites, and the Dissonance-ites,making sense of the vagaries of post modernities extended distended excesses, and he does so admirably with his concept of the Tone Clock. What is the Tone Clock??. It is a way of appraising and utilizing chords, striking a profound resonance(no pun hardly)with our harmonic grandfather Jean Phillipe Rameau around the middle of the 1700s. The Tone Clock's(plural) premise is for instance any three different notes can and may consititute a triad, a three note chord, not simply the 'louis louie' of c,e,g, moving to f,a,c,constitution, but dissonance unified with consonance,in a fairly rational manner, for instance c, c# and d are a legitimate triad. Then scales can be created from these configurations and one is off the the races writing seriously profound music.Does this take the fun outta writing music, I guess so because you need to follow this book, and absorb Schat's trhinking which is fairly straightforward. Schat beleives however that anyone, any persuasion can utilize the Tone Clock and he has done so himself in his interactive opera, 'The monkey subdues the White Bone Demon'. This book is actually also a collection of essays written between 1963 and 1992."},{"Title":"Dancing on Deansgate","review":"Enjoyed this book.

I'm only partially through it and I'm already disappointed. I've read lots of fiction and non-fiction about the Aztecs and this book contains tons of contradictory information than what is found in the very few records that were salvaged after the Conquest. Jonathan Kandell constantly is quoting &quot;the annals&quot; -- WHAT ANNALS?? If I had a penny for each time the word annals is mentioned I could own Mexico! Kandell also takes a very one-sided look at the lives and customs of the Aztec (Mexica) people. His viewpoints are obviously swayed by the history written by the victors of the Conquest.As for being &quot;Michener-like&quot; as someone said previously - Kandell doesn't even come close.

Kandell is just plain boring.And, if it's true, as one of the other reviewers here mentioned, that George Bush recommended it as a good book - well, then shame on me for buying it - I should have known better.As for the rest of the book (aside from pre-Hispanic history), I haven't gotten there yet.

And, against company policy, she was soon shamelessly exchanging kisses with her handsome new hire. Until the day she found out that he was no regular Joe...MR. RIGHT UNDER HER NOSE by Jennifer DrewReconfiguring Mr. Wrong...One minute, Kim Grant was stuffing spilled lingerie into her busted suitcase. The next, her fingers connected with steel--under silk--as white knight Rick Taylor helped her to save face. Her rescuer was sexy, intelligent...and stood between her and the sole rental car she needed to get home. So, before long, Kim found herself on a cross-country adventure with a man who had all the makings of Mr. Right--except that he was dead-set against marriage...And my review:I actually started out really liking A REGULAR JOE. The story had so much going for it: likeable hero and heroine, a loveable eccentric grandfather, a nice flowing writing style. Though the theme of \\"man falls in love with woman under false pretenses, only to lose her when she discovers the truth\\" is an old one, a good writer can breathe new life into a well-used plot device. This author wasn't having any problems there.My complaint was that I felt that the attitude of the hero and heroine of \\"I'm sexually attracted to you, and you're sexually attracted to me...can we get into bed now?\\" was rather immature and short-sighted. These two didn't really care about the other person as a person...they just couldn't keep their hands off one another. While physical chemistry between characters is necessary for a good romance, I like a bit more subtlety (and true affection) than that. I couldn't work up the will to finish this one after that. Two stars.Jennifer Drew is actually a pseudonym for two authors who write as one. I've yet to read a collaboration book that I liked. This one seemed better than most, but again, I felt that there was nothing but sex drawing these two together. Not that this was a lust-soaked book, because it wasn't, but I never felt like there was anything real and lasting between these two. Sex is not enough of a reason for me to cheer for a man and a woman to be together. After all, that's not enough to get a couple through the hard times that will inevitably come with a lifetime relationship.

I must say that this book has been invaluable.

For myself, the analysis techniques employed in the experiments contained within this book were the most helpful. Any physics student with experience in an advanced lab would agree that data and error analysis are the most critical part of any lab, making this book ideal as a reference.I give this book five stars, but I must admit only one disappointment with its binding. I read a review, prior to buying this text, stating that the hardcover binding is somewhat prone to wearing out quickly, and indeed I think I have seen the beginning of this demise.

The 2nd edition did not do a good job in discussing new developments since the publication of the last edition.

Some aliens who can exist in solid form or in energy are taking a trip around the universe, tripping all the way since they're young and want to try the latest and greatest in sensory experience through thier equivilant of drugs and extreme sports. They happen upon a planet where they spend some time drinking in the rich atmosphere and experiencing various solid forms, getting drunk on the sensations. When they're ready to leave, two brothers in thier number who are considered trouble makers and losers are too drunk and get left behind. The others decide they'll come back for them in an aeon or two, serves them right for being drunk jerks, right?Barion and Coyul wake to find themselves alone, with nothing but the primitive life of Earth to keep them company. Since they're so bored, one decides to give self-awareness to a monkey and start a human species. His brother warns him against this, as there are serious laws against elevating species before they are prepared for it, the disasters resulting from such irresponsible advancement of a species are terrible and the punishments severe. But, since the deed's been done, might as well improve on the design, right? figures the other brother.And so, it is the begining of all the creativity, sadness, hope, destruction, love, hate, art, and violence. Barion and Coyul soon discover that this new species just keeps going on after they die in the form of consious energy. Not quite sure what to do with them, they decide to throw them a party, and \\"Upstairs\\" and \\"Downstairs\\" develop, and religions on earth develop and influence the way the realms develop.So, after witnessing human history, and all the violence it can produce, as well as recognising the potential, they decide to intervene to stop what could very well be the next Hitler, before he is even conceived. And here is where our human charachters enter. Charity and Roy...Roy the Nazi wanna-be, and Charity, who has great potential, but doesn't know much of anything outside what she learned in a podunk little town; poverty, the local tabernacle church, and McDonalds.Coyul and Barion take them on a ride through downstairs they can never forget, giving them both thier individual dreams to wake the sleeping genious in Charity, and to show her the monster the Roy can become.

Facing the prospect of eternal boredom, they begin to tinker with the mental capacities of a few unlucky apes, and presto, \\"Christ, Beethoven, Auschwitz, thumbscrews and philosophy, Magna Carta and White Supremacy, poetry, poison gas, nuclear fission and romantic love\\" are born. Fast-forward to present day, and the two decide to intervene to prevent the marriage of Charity Stovall, an intelligent but unthinking religious hanger-on, and Roy Strider, a small-minded, vicious proto-fascist. But they do it by show-and-tell, convincing Charity and Roy that they're dead and letting them roam through Heaven and Hell to find wisdom--or damnation (it's your choice, after all).

It is a story of extraordinary emotional intensity. For anybody like me with interest in the Russian \\"condition humaine\\", this is a must read. While written as fiction, it depicts realities and truths of lives lived during Soviet times and since. Makine, born and brought up in Russia, emigrated to France in 1987 and writes his novels in French. He has found an excellent translator in Geoffrey Strachan.Requiem is anchored in the narrator, the last of three generations of one family. Makine weaves the description of the father's and grandfather's lives into the son's narrative. It is a story within and told as conveyed to him by a third party. This technique establishes a lens singling out or highlighting specific details and events. At the same time the method creates a certain emotional distance for both the protagonist and the reader from the vicious excesses of the Soviet regime and the horrors of war. In stark contrast to the depiction of devastation, scorched earth and expanding killing fields, is the description of nature and landscapes in all their beauty and harmony. There is something nostalgic and even surreal in the soothing power that the land and rural life has over the father and grandfather. It is a refuge sought from the fighting that restores and gives life. It is the dream that sustains the soldier and keeps him alive against all odds. Happiness and love, even if short-lived are possible and experienced here.The unnamed narrator was severed from this nourishing power, his sense of identity lost since early childhood, his \\"own memories falsified from birth\\". Rescued by an enigmatic family friend just prior to the killing of his parents, he grows up as an orphan. The sense of being an outsider never leaves him. Working as a medical doctor in African countries he moves from crisis to crisis. An offer to join the KGB comes almost as relief; changing identities as required for his life as a spy is the easiest part. He is thrown back into the African quagmire, caught between the Cold War's competing fronts. With a few brush strokes, Makine captures the essence of the increasingly perilous political games being played out in developing countries. The \\"game of espionage\\" brings the agent and his female partner closer together. While his feelings for her grow deeper, his outlook on life is put to the test: \\"To be able to tell the truth one day.\\" This is her wish to which he responds by telling her his family's story as conveyed to him by the old friend years ago.The story of Nikolai, the grandfather, and his son Pavel portrays two generations of soldiers caught up in the brutalities of the two major wars and the rise of Stalin. The growing violence of the Soviet regime is illustrated through specific episodes and incidents. Nikolai, fighting with the Red Army, rides off one day from the combat not too far from his home, yearning for peace on his land. Pavel joined the Soviet army to battle the Germans in World War II. He ends up in a penal company - canon fodder at the frontlines. The narrative of the fighting, the loss of comrades and Pavel's endurance is harrowing in its vivid detail. Most haunting is the image of an attempt to free a concentration camp with German snipers still hiding between the barracks. Pavel survives the war only to find \\"home\\" destroyed. Completely rudderless and troubled by the nightmares of his experiences, he drifts, runs, and hides from the deeply disquieting postwar Soviet reality in a remote area in the Caucasus.Makine has an extraordinary talent to create a dramatic framework for his story while directing the reader toward concrete specific events. Nikolai, after deserting from the Red Army, has to confront the local Soviet officials who have been forcing individual farmers to accept the collectivization of their farms. Having observed what happened to his neighbours, Nikolai turns the rationale upside down. His farm tools and his old horse are in such poor condition, he argues, that handing them over to the kolkhoz would be equal to sabotage. For Pavel the chances of survival were counted in days, maximum months: the \\"distance that lay between him and death could be measured in the numbers killed\\". There was no point in sharing one's name as the probability of staying alive to the next day was almost nil.The continuation of Pavel's story is the narrator's own story of survival, physically and emotionally. The end of the Cold War and the subsequent \\"disappearance of the Empire\\" leave him confused and challenge him to establish a new life. He feels the need for an ongoing inner dialogue with his former partner: she becomes the focus of his search for the truth. Finding her comes close to an obsession. The Parisian society crowd that he joins in his quest, speaks mockingly of the Soviet army and of his country, calling it a \\"phantom country\\". He should react, explain, or contradict the views presented. Yet, he feels unable to intervene, an outside observer, not able to fit in whether it is Moscow or Paris. Ultimately, his search for answers, his truth and for his peace of mind ends unexpectedly.Makine has created a powerful and profoundly moving portrait of one Russian family set against the dramatic backdrop of the complex realities of the Soviet era and its collapse. His characters embody real people, individuals with deep emotions showing vigour and endurance in adverse circumstances and surviving on the strength of their roots and connection to their land. The stories of their lives will linger in the reader's mind for a long time. [Friederike Knabe]"},{"Title":"Requiem for a Lost Empire","review":"It is always difficult to say what Andrei Makine's books are about. One could describe the plot or the story-line and feel that one hasn't said anything at all. Makine's novels are like all great works of art. They set up a resonance inside us that is intensely pleasureable and also painful. In Requiem, as in his other novels, Makine's prose is poetic and technically flawless, the historical content is fascinating and his irony and humor elicit a warm rush of recognition and laughter. Like all great art, it also makes us painfully aware of what is unexpressed in us.If one can say that Dreams of My Russian Summers is &quot;about&quot; the birth of a writer, then Requiem for a Lost Empire is about the struggle to tell or speak the truth. There is a silence that bounds this struggle. The three generations of men in this novel live with the women they love largely in silence. One of the women even has her tongue cut out. Yet somehow, this silence is a state of grace. Most of the time we live in the contiuum between, caught between our superstitious fear of naming things and our compulsion to do so. Makine's efforts to tell the truth, whatever level of truth one wishes to draw from his writing, have produced an exquisitely beautiful and haunting novel."},{"Title":"Requiem for a Lost Empire","review":"Unfortunately, I cannot report that Andrei Makine's \\"Requiem for a Lost Empire\\" is anything close to as good as his \\"Dreams of My Russian Summers\\". Read the book summary for the overall plot, but, basically the novel portrays the lives of three generations of the same family, as each generation literally has to escape for their lives--during the Russian Revolution, during World War II, and during the Cold War. The chases during the first two generations were gripping, but the narrative in second half of the novel just seemed to lose focus. I had a hard time putting the book together at the end.Even more of a let down, and it is hard to put this in words, was that this novel did not contain the unbelievably beautiful writing found throughout \\"Dreams of My Russian Summers\\". The book wasn't lengthy, though I wouldn't have reread it knowing what I do now."},{"Title":"Requiem for a Lost Empire","review":"The opening sentence, which you can see via Amazon's search, reminded me of the beginning of Garcia Marquez' \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude.\\" In fact, after reading the whole novel by Makine, \\"Requiem\\" reminds me of the lyrical, melancholic, and subdued side of epic realism mixed with a dreamier, French-influenced, narrative rooted in reverie and memory closer to much in Russian fiction. It takes its time to tell, in only 250 pp., a story spanning about eight decades and three generations. The Gallic quality of Makine's prose permeates Geoffrey Strachan's smooth translation into English. I imagine Makine's French sounds much like we read him in English--without as much violence done in translating as often occurs!While reviews have summarized the plot, the prose style, for me, stands out most. Among dozens of possible examples, here's my favorite: \\"The winter night was warm, the rain at the window split up the city's glow into an infinity of twinkling lights. Myriads of luminous dots spread out before me, a crude symbol of human dispersal: to discover a lost person all you would have to do would be to visit each of these sources of light, one after another, over the whole planet. Often in my despair this infinite sifting of the lights seemed to be achievable.\\" (178) This shows Makine's sensitivity, his concern for crafting evocative images, and his skill at arranging his words.The novel, also, has relevance for the early 21st c. The protagonist speculates about \\"the wars started in order to test new weapons, those ended in order to lower the price of a barrel of crude oil. \\" (224-5) The breakup of the Soviet empire brings this book, in its latest of the three generations of stories, into a realm where both the US and the USSR fight a Cold War by proxy. The shrewd cynicism of media, political, and personal manipulation energizes this novel with a more serious current that much of popular espionage or historical fiction.I sense that Makine is rising from being a skilled tale-teller into one who may reach the higher ranks of the literati among European novelists; given this ambitious yet admirably compact novel, he is destined for success. He cuts his scenes down, despite their often delicate prose, into vignettes and ruminations that convey the spirit of the times more than the immediate action alone, and this added texture deepens the action with contemplation. This is a thoughtful meditation on Russia, for wherever the plot carries the characters, that wonderfully rooted opening sentence from some redoubt in the Caucasus brings that family back to its heartland, in spirit if not always assuredly in fact."},{"Title":"Requiem for a Lost Empire","review":"Andrei Makine adds another laurel to his impressive writing career with the release of Requiem for a Lost Empire. In this short book (250 pages) Makine surveys the past century of change in Russia from the fall of the Czars and the rise of the people, through Stalin and World War II, through the Cold War with its ominous KGB into today with the undercover lives of common men striving to retain the promises of Communism. Makine does this seemingly incredible feat through the eyes of one family - sons and fathers who lived through the various phases of critical change that Russia (empire, USSR, etc) has undergone. In nonlinear fashion he draws multifacted, complex characters with flashbacks and flashforwards in a way that makes this less a history book (though it is valuably one) than the novel it is. And as if that weren't enough, Makine writes with a grace and poetry that suffuse his tale with lasting visuals and ominous grit. That the author left Russia to live in France and has written all his books to date in Frence means that we are also experiencing the work of a master translator. This little book is a gripping masterwork - highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"United Fruit Company in Latin America","review":"In the 1950s and 1960s the National Planning Association sponsored a series of studies about American business abroad. The intention was to identify lessons applicable to other businesses as they developed internationally. Consequently the books largely ignored individual management personalities in order to focus on general themes.This volume by Stacy May and Galo Plaza, published in 1958, covers the United Fruit Company's banana operations in Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica,Panama, Ecuador and Columbia. These operations date from Company's founding in 1899 but most specific plantations date from the 1920's and 1930's. They still operate today.The United Fruit Company has been controversial throughout its existence and been subject to a vast number of books. Most allegations concern corruption of host governments and officials, hoarding land, exploiting the host countries and their citizens, abuse of employees and monopoly of the banana market etc. Consequently it has long been the bete noire of leftists in Latin America and. since the 1960's, in North America as well.In keeping with the NPA mandate this book does not delve deeply into any specific controversies. The strength of the book is that Stacy May, a statistician who ran the Statistics Division of America's War Production Board in World War Two, and Galo Plaza, a former President of Ecuador, had access to United Fruit's records and largely present facts rather than opinions.The book begins with an overview of the growing of bananas which demonstrates how improbable a worldwide market in this product really is. The fruit is highly perishable, highly vulnerable to weather conditions and subject to diseases that literally wiped out plantations. This required a strategy of plantations in multiple countries, to reduce risk, heavy investment in irrigation and disease control (capital cost 5X to 10X cost per acre compared to coffee) and need to surplus land (to control irrigation watersheds and provide for relocation of planations after disease outbreaks).The next section of the book follows the physical transportation of bananas to market. Since they are easily damaged they must be handled with extreme care, need exact logistics to get to market before they spoil (life of less than a month), require refrigerated transport etc. All of these require significant capital investment in specialized equipment and facilities, while incurring substantial transportation and spoilage costs. I found it extremely interesting that the difference between what Latin America received for bananas (approximately 28% of retail), compared to what North American farmers got for their produce (approximately 38% of retail) was accounted for by the extra costs (10% of retail) of the specialized ocean transport.May and Plaza then looked at the financial returns earned by the Company. Economic theory states that capitalists adjust for higher risk, such as perishable products and unstable governments, by demanding a higher rate of return. Unfortunately, for the thirty or so years preceding their study for which comparables were available, they discovered that return on investment for the United Fruit Company (approximately 11%) was actually below that of similar sized companies operating in the low risk American market. If the Company was exploiting Central America or monopolizing the banana market it simply was not making any money from that behavior. Perceptions by Latin Americans that the Company was \\"rich\\", not implausible inasmuch as its gross profits exceeded the annual tax revenues in some Central American countries, appears to have been made without consideration of the massive capital required to distribute the bananas once they left the plantations.The authors then go on to look at the economic benefits received by the host countries from the banana plantations. Essentially they occupied coastal swamp land that was otherwise of no economic value (although reading this I could only think that environmentalists might make a difference conclusion today), with less than 1% of cropland they generated 12% of output, that 92% of revenues stayed in the countries and that the Company paid approximately 15% of the nations' taxes.Finally the book looks at the treatment of workers on the plantations. Again the numbers generally showed that the workers were paid more and received substantially greater benefits )i.e. housing, health care, subsidized food/clothing) relative to field hands in Latin America. However, at the time the book was written it also acknowledged greater union unrest (attributed in fine 1950's logic to communist involvement in union leadership).Considering that Plaza was a politician the book is relatively weak in reconciling the negative public perceptions of the Company with the logical explanations of its business and structure. There is an interesting discussion of the timing of the Company relative to the Spanish American war and America's gunboat diplomacy in Central America. There was also an interesting point about the Company's image in the larger more diversified economies (i.e. Ecuador) versus its image in the smaller Central American countries.In my title I specifically identified this book as definitive \\"background\\" rather a definitive \\"history\\". I did so because of the age of the book (1958) and the lack of coverage of many (controversial) historical incidents. The fact that the incidents aren't covered does not imply that the book is simply a management whitewash but rather that the scope of the book was never intended to cover them. However I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in the United Fruit Company for the simple reason that that the authors had full access to the financial and market records of the Company. As such they provide unparalleled insight into the factors effecting the operations of the Company."},{"Title":"The Strategic Management of Organizations","review":"I like this book for its multi-perspective reviews in strategic management domain.I look forward for the second edition!"},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus","review":"A number of years back a clay-mation Christmas special was made and I've been trying to find the book ever since.

Frank Baum and THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OZ, I felt it appropriate to read a completely different children's novel by the author. Baum wrote many other children's books not associated with Oz, but there are only a few books by the author that are easily obtainable by the general public. One of these is THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF SANTA CLAUS.The book tells the origins of Santa Claus. In the Forest of Burzee where the fairies live, there is a fairy, named Necile, whom is prone to wander outside the safety of the Forest and question things that are forbidden by the Law. Necile comes across an orphaned baby boy in the woods and rescues it from death. Even though she breaks the Law, she pleads her case before the Master Woodsman and he agrees to let Necile raise the child. So the babe is raised in the fairy woods by Necile and is named NeClaus, though everyone calls him Claus. However, Claus is not a fairy and grows and ages. At an appointed time, the Master Woodsman comes and takes Claus on a journey throughout the world so that he can see what his people, the race of men, are like. Claus is struck by the sadness of the children and decides that his life's work will be to bring happiness to all the children he can. He whittles a lifelike toy cat and gives it away to a lost boy. The boy is so overjoyed with the gift that Claus decides that the best way he can make children happy is to give them toys. He makes more and more toys and is aided in his goal by immortal friends of his youth. The myth of Claus grows as do the amount of toys he makes, the number of children he delivers to, and the distance he travels to deliver his gifts. Claus becomes loved around the world, but there are evil forces that don't like the good Claus has done. They attempt to stop him any which way they can and this eventually leads to a war between immortal beings.THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF SANTA CLAUS clearly displays the joyful imagination and whimsical wit of Baum's that makes THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ such a delightful book. With that said, THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF SANTA CLAUS doesn't feel as fresh and original, seems to lack some of the childlike wonderment of that first Oz tale, and the title character feels hollow. Perhaps the reason for this is that it isn't as grounded as THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ is. Though mostly sheltered from the world, THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF SANTA CLAUS takes place in our own world, yet it really doesn't feel like our world. Claus grows up in a secret and magical forest hidden away. When he sets out as a young man to live among the race of men, he builds a cabin in a secluded valley called the Laughing Valley. His nearest neighbors aren't people, but animals and other magical creatures. Dorothy wasn't from some fictional place that no one had ever heard; she was from Kansas and she had a family and neighbors. Claus also never experiences any personal pain, sorrow, suffering, or tragedy in his life; he's always watched over carefully by his immortal friends who ensure all of his necessities are provided. Meanwhile, Dorothy is an orphan living with her aunt and uncle and they are in poverty. That's not to say Claus is without character because he is a very joyful person that emphasizes with the children of the world and tries to do the best he can with what he is given. Despite his admirable qualities, he doesn't quite ring true; in short, the Claus of THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF SANTA CLAUS doesn't seem like Santa Claus.In writing his story, Baum purposely left out any reference to the spiritual. The modern & moralized version of Santa Claus that is usually embraced by both Christians and non-Christians alike has no place in Baum's tale. Therefore, the character we are presented with is a being that has all of the characteristics of a \\"good person\\", but none of the magic and mystery of the man or elf of myth. Claus is neither Saint Nicholas nor is he Santa Claus. Instead, he is NeClaus, the human boy raised by fairies. It's an entertaining story, but not as interesting as a story about Santa Claus."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus","review":"Claus, a young baby discovered by a a wood-nymph named Necile, becomes the first human to ever be raised in an enchanted forest, by all types of mythical creatures, including elves and wood nymphs, Ak, the master woodsman, and the evil Awgwas. During his time with the mythical creatures, Claus adopts a love for making toys, and making children happy. He soon decides to deliver toys to all of the children in the land, and is quickly given the name Santa Claus, as he is now known as a Saint, and someone who brought happiness to all.Baum has done a fantastic job in creating and describing a magical world, such as the one in which Claus resides. Filled with information about how Santa Claus chooses his reindeer, why he goes down chimneys, how he makes his toys, etc., this book is sure to please. Readers young and old will find themselves believing the magic that is Santa Claus. A must-have book for all.Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus","review":"Santa Claus. Two simple words that can make most children smile. L. Frank Baum once again has touched the spirits of many with his tale based on the legendary Santa Claus. I remember it being read to me by my father as a young child. As an adult, it is still magical with every reading. The story tells the tale of an abandoned baby in the woods who was adopted and raised by fairies in their forest. As Claus, a mortal, grows up among the fairies and other fascinating immortals, he learns all of their ways and secrets. When he is old enough, the Great Ak takes Claus on a journey to see how humans really live. After the trip, Claus leaves the fairy's forest to live on his own, for he has decided to try and help mankind. The first toy, was a cat that he had whittled, and painted to look real. It was given to a young, lost boy to comfort him. With this gift, and the help of his immortal friends, Claus began his legend of unselfish giving. Over the years, he was named a saint by the many who he touched. There are beautiful stories and illustrations of his gift-making and giving, along with those of the obstacles that he faced, including a fierce battle between good and evil immortals. From his adoption, to the night when Santa Claus became immortal, the book comes to life in the imagination. It is a tale that will touch children, as well as adults - perfect for nighttime reading during the holidays. As the holidays approach, I again look forward to losing myself in the spirit and magic,of Santa Claus."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus","review":"Mike Ploog's adaptation of L Frank Baum's &quot;Life and adventures of Santa Claus&quot;, is one of the most BEAUTIFULLY illustrated graphic novels available. Ploog's water-colour paintings bring so much life to this warm and exciting fairytale.We meet Santa as an infant, and follow his upbringing as the only human among the hidden woodnymphs. As he grows older, he dedicates his life to help the humans (in his own generous way) against the evil and corruptive Awgwas.This magical book will get you in to the Christmas-spirit. Children AND grown-ups will love this book!"},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus","review":"The author of The Wizard of Oz deserves consideration and respect for the delightful fantasies he has provided the world. This syrupy recreation of Santa's youth, manhood and ultimate immortality is quaintly charming--if you are young at heart. There are several serious issues mentioned: if we are to die, why are we born at all? No outright religion is preached, but this is Baum's philosophy: &quot;Everything perishes except the world itself and its keepers...but while life lasts, everything on earth has its use. The wise seek ways to be helpful to the world, for the helpful ones are sure to live again.&quot;This book recounts how an orphan named Claus found his true calling--to bring joy to the children of the world. Every man has his own mission, but Claus' dilemma is the morality of giving gifts to rich children, when there are so many who are poor. One chapter deals with the age-old battle between Good and Evil.Baum describes how each custom associated with the secular celebration of Christmas came into existence--without reference to the Nativity. Baum truly loved children, as he dedicated most of his writing to their enjoyment. He concludes about Sants Claus: &quot;No one..was so greatly beloved as Santa Claus, because none other was so unselfish as to devote hismelf to making others happy. For a generous deed....spreads and leaves its mark on all nature and endures through many generations.&quot; A sentimental tale for children of all ages."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus","review":"No surprises here, no amazing storyline. Just the wonderfully childish imagination we've come to expect from Baum afer 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'. Though a timeless classic for people of all ages, this story is more suitable for grown-ups trying to rediscover their youth - to a certain extent anyway. Set in a fantasy realm, this book basically tells Santa's life story according to Baum's imagination. Remember the days when we left chicken legs and orange juice for Santa under the tree? Sigh... Makes a nice Christmas gift... way better than Harry Potter."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus","review":"The pictures for this edition of \\"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus\\" are really the main features. Ploog was the conceptual artist for Disney's \\"Return To Oz\\" and it shows particularly in the nome king who resembles the character from the movie. His characters are well done and very original. The great Ak is well portrayed and seems like a fatherly tender giant while the awgwas are suitably horrifying. His Santa Claus begins as a cute child who grows to be a suitable Santa Claus who truly feels the need to help the world's children with his toys. Ploog's nymphs are like stylized Barbie Dolls with boufaunt hair cuts. They could look more otherworldly but then again that is not the biggest flaw in this version of Baum's tale. The main flaw here is changing the way the battle of good and evil was fought. In the book the immortals seek to defend Claus from the powers of the Awgwas but in this version Santa joins the battle and ends up killing the king of the Awgwas. the aim of the battle here is to rescue the pet monkey, Toy, who dies in the battle. The mistake here is to have the man of peace, Santa Claus, kill a major character which detracts from Baum's message of a character who would never fight a battle.However the pictures here are very good and fun to look at. For the most part the adaptation is not bad but perhaps doing the pictures for un-edited version would have been better. it is still a great book to look at.Philip"},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus","review":"L. Frank Baum was one of the great fantasy writers of the early 20th century -- in fact, were it not for Tolkien, I'd be tempted to call him the greatest in 100 years. His Oz books created a beautiful, vibrant land that still draws readers a century later. This book, his twist on the legend of Santa Claus, is part of that wonderful tapestry he wove.Forget all of the Santa Claus legends you've read before -- there's no North Pole, no elves, no Bergermeistermeisterberger -- the story starts with a baby found in the woods by the fairy Necile. She raises him as her son, Claus (or \\"Ni-claus,\\" meaning \\"Little Claus\\"), until the child begins to wonder about his own people. Shown the dangers of the human world by the great Ak, Claus decides to venture forth amongst the mortals regardless.Claus gets a lot of credit in this story, from inventing the first toy to inspiring a war amongst immortals to retrieve them, and all of it is done in Baum's clear, clean style that is as easy to read today as it was in his time. It might not be the best book for a small child, who may ask questions trying to reconcile this unique version of Santa with the one he knows, but for an older child who understands that the spirit of Santa Claus is what's important it is a wonderful book. I re-read it every December."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus","review":"In author L. Frank Baum's book, nymph Necile finds a tiny babe in the forest of Buzee and raises him along with the help of the great spirits, elves, nymphs, knooks and ryls under the wisdom and guidance of the great Ak (Leader of all the great Spirits). She names him Claus who later grows up asking what is his purpose in life, and then decides to make toys to deliver to all boys and girls on one special night out of the year. But as time passes he soon he discovers that he is growing old. . .A great book by L. Frank Baum that explores the fantastical life of Santa Claus-a real joy and gem to read, especially when you come to realize how many years ago this book was written. Baum's work here is so imaginative that many of today's stories of Santa Claus in my opinion pale in comparison."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus","review":"This is such a great story.

It has been written taking into consideration low budget travellers and presents sites for divers in the Red Sea around locations including the popular Sharm el Sheikh and Ras Muhammed, Eliat and the Brothers. The information on each site includes: depth and visibility; required expertise; bottom terrain; currents; marine life; safety tips; and local dive shops. Most of the chapters are easy to read and actually are very well written. However, some of the tips are a little bit outdated (the book was written in 1994). In any case, it is cheap and very useful."},{"Title":"Carnival Towel Creations 40 Designs","review":"One might wonder about using a couple of towels to create, um, a work of art. But this book may change your mind. And when guests come over to your house, they may be amazed to see what awaits them when they expect to see a rather ordinary towel!To prepare these creations, you need only one, two or three cotton towels. Usually, that means a large towel (roughly 30 inches by 50 inches) and a medium towel (roughly 17 inches by 28 inches). Once in a while, you may need a washcloth of about 12 inches square.The results are truly amusing: representations of all sorts of animals, such as bats, dogs, rabbits, cobra, cows, crocodiles, donkeys, ducks, dinosaurs, deer, elephants, frogs, goats, gorillas, iguanas, cats, lobsters, monkeys, mice, birds, pigs, bears, seals, swans, and turtles. Instructions are given for forty different creations."},{"Title":"Scoundrel (The Thrillers #5)","review":"I'm the owner and skipper of a thirty foot Catalina in the Sea of Cortez.

For me, he is both an entertainer and an inspiration."},{"Title":"Scoundrel (The Thrillers #5)","review":"Cornwell is an excellent writer, and I was looking forward to big story involving a ship and sea adventure.

Cornwell is a talented writer, not a gifted one. And by that I mean that there are no gifts in this business. He has earned the recognition and respect of readers out there based on many long hours over the proverbial pen. This guy's very good because he works at it.As for Scoundrel the first chapter will draw you in and that's the value of a good thriller- to pull us in and make you want to turn the page.

I mean, you're probably not going to get many of his brilliant signature shield walls in Boston in the early '90s. This story exceeded my expectations. The story is solid with exciting and believable plot turns as well as the author's usual knack for putting the reader on location without unnecessary description. But what really sells this tale is the main character, the Scoundrel, Paul Shanahan. To say he's flawed is an understatement. His history of choices seems to run from lazy to horrible and yet he is completely sympathetic. This is no iron-jawed elevated soul. He gets scared; he gets pissed; he feels guilty and you can't help but root for him.Cornwell also has a brilliant touch capturing the Irish accents without resorting to writing in weird dialect form. My only small complaint (I'm tempted to say 'wee') is that the edition I read still had heavy Anglicized phrasing. At first I thought it was that the main character had lived abroad so long and we were hearing it in his head but when a kid in Boston asks his mom about his trainers instead of his sneakers, I couldn't help but think I was reading a British print. (I don't think I was.) It's a tiny thing but if that kind of stuff irks you, be prepared. But don't let it keep you from reading this book. You'll love it!"},{"Title":"Scoundrel (The Thrillers #5)","review":"Bostonian Paul Shanahan is many things: part-time marine surveyor, smuggler, gunrunner, suspected CIA agent. A full-time scoundrel with ties to nothing and no one -- except to an ex-lover who died years before in a hail of bullets -- he has agreed to transport five million dollars in gold across the ocean by sailboat, money earmarked by the Irish Republican Army for the purchase of fifty-three Stinger missiles. Shanahan's instincts are telling him there's more to this deal below the surface and that he's not meant to survive after delivery. But, if he can elude British Intelligence and several terrorist organizations' most efficient killers -- and with only his life left to lose -- $5 million might just be enough to get a desperate rogue out of the game for good."},{"Title":"Scoundrel (The Thrillers #5)","review":"I was hoping for something on the same line as Dan Brown or Vince Flynn. This however was the rambling journal of a non-interesting man who I couldn't work up enough concern over whether he made it through or not."},{"Title":"Scoundrel (The Thrillers #5)","review":"I bought this because I have enjoyed Cornwell's Sharpe series. However, seeing that it had been published in the early 90's, I didn't have great hopes for it. I assumed it was one of Cornwell's lesser efforts that hadn't gotten wide distribution.The story takes place during the Gulf War and concerns an American born (sometime) IRA member who is asked to transport gold to the US by boat so that the IRA can buy Stinger missles. However, there are some inconsistencies and seeming Arab connections that don't seem to fit into this story. The protagonist tries to figure out the true motives of all involved, plus he would like to double cross his employers and keep the gold.This story reminded me of one of Jack Higgins' better stories. The characters are fairly well drawn and the story is an exciting one. Sure, there are a couple of parts in the story that one may question, but this is not meant to be great art. It is a darn good yarn, however."},{"Title":"Scoundrel (The Thrillers #5)","review":"This is a reprint of a 1992 novel by the author, and was a change of pace for the author, dealing with contemporary issues rather than historical. It is the type plot that one might expect from an author like Jack Higgins, but it is better written than the recent Higgins novels.The plot goes through many surprising twists and turns. Phil Shanahan, an American living in Europe, has a business as a yacht surveyor and sometimes delivers boats to various locations for the owners. He has been asked to deliver a sailboat to Miami from somewhere in the Med. The catch is that the boat will have a special cargo of $5 million in gold coins that are to be smuggled into the country.Nobody trusts anyone else, and Shanahan is suspicious of the assignment. Also, $5 million is a big temptation, and Shanahan has ways of creating new identities for people and boats, either of which can disappear.There are Arab terrorists involved, Provisional IRA members, and a lot of assorted bystanders, all of whom are not what they seem to be. And there is the question of long-term deep undercover agents.Shanahan gets in over his head, and plans do not work out as envisioned. There are some surprising final twists at the end.The anti-American theme does raise a question in my mind. How, exactly, do you define American? It is like saying Asian, Black, Muslim, etc. All of those are very broad terms. The United States is a very complex country that has many parts and pieces that people from outside the country do not understand. The country has always been a large melting pot of people from diverse origins having diverse religious and political viewpoints, much more so than any other part of the world."},{"Title":"Scoundrel (The Thrillers #5)","review":"I enjoyed the Sharpe series, the Warlord Chronicles and other of Cornwell's work very much. I found this to be the weakest of the books he's written. I'm uncomfortable criticizing this author because I do love his work...however...I have come to expect more from him than I found in Scoundrel. I liked the premis of the plot, but it didn't ring true at all and maybe that is my most profound criticism.Do I recommend the book? While not quite what I have come to expect from this author, I will tell you that if you are inclined to buy the book, follow that inclination. It's not a five-star work, but even flawed, it is entertaining."},{"Title":"Scoundrel (The Thrillers #5)","review":"This is a change of pace for Cornwell.

The food was always varied and quite wonderful. However, the cooks wouldn't always part with their mothers' &quot;secret&quot; family recipes. So I went cookbook shopping.The full-color photos of dishes in Mallos' book were worth the purchase price alone. Using the clearly written recipies, I prepared Lebanese, Arab, Greek and other dishes I had tasted at our informal dinners. Then I got brave and tried new ones. My friends and family RAVED. Several of my closest Middle Eastern friends even seemed a little jealous...they finally told me that I cooked their favorites better than did their mothers, and they went out and bought copies of the cookbook for themselves!You will find how easy it is to make hummous, olive-oil-infused flatbreads, tabouleh, and a score of other now-trendy dishes you pay a fortune for at the deli.The spanokopita is divine, with the golden, buttery phyllo leaves melting in your mouth to reveal the tang of feta melded with the spinach, onions, and toasted pine nuts.Mallos' book also contains the recipe for the BEST baklava anyone has ever tasted (at least of those I've served it to). A million calories a bite, but well worth it!If you are a creative cook who loves the pleasures of making good food for family and friends, this belongs in your kitchen -- or better yet, on your coffee table where you can pick it up and drool...I recently bought a new edition for my brother.

However, all recipies are clearly laid out and well explained.

It would also be a lovely addition if you just enjoy learning about other cultures."},{"Title":"The Complete Middle East Cookbook","review":"I have several Middle Eastern cookbooks and this is one of the best ones. My mother (who is an excellent cook also has a copy and refers to it constantly). The book covers every region of the Middle East with the exception of North Africa. The recipes here are authentic with a few exceptions. (See below. But then again every middle eastern home has their own version of certain recipes) and the results are always good. They are also well written and are very easy to follow. If you cook from this book you will definately be able to fool anyone into thinking that you've been cooking for years. She also has another Middle Eastern cookbook which contains some of the recipes in this book but also has pictures for every recipe. I suggest buying that book first if your not familiar with the way Middle Eastern food looks. However this book is much more extensive.The only book that compares to Mallos' book on middle eastern food is \\"The New Book of Middle Eastern Food\\" by Claudia Roden. I highly recommend both books and honestly cannot recommend one over the other. I prefer Tess Mallos' recipes slightly more than Roden's but both are excellent. Mallos' layout is better for those who want to understand the differences between the different regions of the Middle East (the book is divided by region), while Roden's layout is better if you are simply looking for a recipe. Roden's book has more historical anecdotes (though this is not necessarily a good thing because some of it is inaccurate) and read more like a story while Mallos' is more \\"academic\\" concentrates more on the specific food related practices of each region. I think Roden's book is more interesting to read just for fun. Both books skip over entire regions. Mallos skips over North Africa for some reason (she also includes Greece and Cyprus) while Roden ignores the Gulf region, Iraq and Afghanistan.I disagree with some of the recipes that Mallos gives (e.g. her tabbouleh recipe) and prefer May Bsisu's book in that regard. However, Bsisu's book is less extensive and some of her recipes take a long time.I highly recommend buying this book.

I really liked the flavors and recipes in this book. I enjoy making recipes from this cookbook; it is educational, and always good food. It has many interesting recipes, such as: curing fresh olives, raw lamb tartare, baba ghannouj, rose water syrup, and how to bake a whole lamb.All of the recipes that use rice, suspiciously, use the same cooking method regardless of country, something I am sure is not correct. Due to ethnic and religious reasons, there are no recipes for beef or pork, but plenty that use poultry, seafood, and especially lamb. The author often lists in recipes that rightfully use lamb that beef is an acceptable substitute, but I am rather suspicious of this advice.The recipes are simple, honest cooking of the street vendors and the home. There are no complicated procedures or sophisticated techniques that are born out of European haute cuisine. Too many ethnic cookbooks these days are by famous authors; the author spends a few days with the European-trained executive chef of an American hotel chain in the capitol city of the foreign country, and goes home to write a cookbook. The result usually has nothing to do with the country, but largely reflects the culinary prejudices of the usually English speaking executive chef. Not here: the author has clearly invaded the home kitchens and food stalls of each respective country. The recipes are easy to do and, in most cases, do not have weird ingredients, strange cooking utensils, or unusual cooking techniques. You should be able to do most of the recipes without much trouble. This alone makes it unique among ethnic cookbooks, and for this reason, deserves some sort of award.It has: Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, Armenia, (Syria, Lebanon, Jordan), Iraq, Gulf States (Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Oman), Yemen, Egypt, Iran, Afghanistan. Sadly, the author usually does a lousy job of describing to the Westerner what distinguishes the food of each country. A few homey, personal anecdotes are not a substitute for solid, culinary exposition."},{"Title":"The Complete Middle East Cookbook","review":"An exceptional cookbook.

My habit was to eat in a place often enough to fathom all of the flavors in a favorite dish, then try to make it at home. Going that route, I only managed a few dishes that tasted rather authentic.Imagine my surprise then, a few years later, stuck living in a backwater in Central Texas, walking through the whitebread mall, and finding this book in a remainder bin outside a local B. Dalton bookstore. I glommed onto it for $10 and it has been my constant cooking companion ever since the early 1980s.As someone else said, the photos alone are worth the full price of the book. But the real charm of this isn't just that the instructions are thorough in each recipe - like the Julia Child French Cooking book, this one presumes that you cook but that you don't know how to cook Middle Eastern food, so it tells you many of the steps in the front matter of the book. You want to make your own yogurt? There are a few recipes. You need to know how to handle okra? It's in there. Meats, vegtables, breads, sauces, desserts, pastries, they are all in there, and all wonderful. This is a book that I use most often for trying new things, and as an organic gardener in the Mediterranean-like climate, I'm always learning to cook the things that grow well here. I discovered okra last year - an African vegetable that has so many wonderful (non-slimy!) applications in Middle Eastern food.I showed this book to my mother years ago, and she spread the word to her sisters, one of whom is married to a man from Turkey. All three sisters all ended up with copies after Moustafa admired the recipes and the results.I made a big rice casserole years ago and my Puerto Rican husband perked up - it was very similar to his mother's arroz con gandules - that I was able to adapt Mallos' recipe with my mother-in-law's ingredients and get one of his favorite childhood dishes. It's a small world!I came to Amazon today looking for indications that Tess Mallos was still around, to see what else she had written, and am pleased to see she has a number of books that parse out this culinary information for different countries. I can't say enough - Ms. Mallos is a fine interpreter of the cooking in this region - she has broken the steps down to achieve authentic dishes. She addresses substitutions when the actual spices or ingredients aren't avaialable - but in this Internet age, so many things can be ordered online, the modern cook can probably make most of these without too much substitution.It may sound cliche, but if you could only have one cookbook on that desert island - this is the one to take with you."},{"Title":"The Complete Middle East Cookbook","review":"I've had the original hardcover edition of this book for maybe 20 years and although I own several other middle eastern cookbooks, I always go back to this one for the clear and complete recipes. My raved-about spinach pie that I've brought to many a pot luck over the years is from this book.I do have one comment about the fact that there is no Israeli section in this edition. I find that extremely odd as it was included in the original edition. I can only surmise that the author and publisher were pressured by political forces to remove it. That is indeed sad, almost infuriating. Israel represents a melting pot of both mid-east and European influences and is clearly located in the middle east.

Most books that boast Middle Easter cuisine are mostly Lavantian (i.e. Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Palestine), Iranian, or Mediterranean! But never an accurate attempt to explore Arabic Gulf food!Upon receiving the book, I immediately went to the Gulf section and I have to say that I am impressed with how well the author has researched the region and cuisine! Given that I live here, I know and appreciate how difficult it is to get a hold of these recipes. Therefore, despite some flaws in some of the recipes, I take my hat off to the author and for her extremely wide spectrum of ME dishes! Just to prove my point, even my mom who knows all these recipes was surprised at how the author got her hands on some many Gulf recipes and she got most of them right! There you have it!!!The Arabs in the Gulf still to this very day have a very deep and complex understanding of spices and I can totally appreciate some reviewers comments where they complain that it is hard to source some spices and ingredients! I completely understand that and that is why I think some of the recipes have somewhat been watered down for the Western reader... for example, you will notice that there is a recipe for mixed spice powder. In the book the recipe calls for about 7 or 8 spice ingredients, actually the mix used in the Gulf calls for a minimum of 12 different spices! Some of the spices are hard to come by over here... let alone in the West! There are some other inaccuracies which I cannot recall off the top of my head but they really do not take away greatly from the wide spectrum of the book!!!Take it from a Middle Easterner, this books has all the goodies from the Gulf!

Dooyeweerd exposes the would-be autonomy of modern man and traces the problem back to the Greeks. He examines aspects of the history of philosophy through the grid of Creation-Fall-ReCreation in Jesus Christ. In this I will attempt to highlight the most helpful aspects of Dooyeweerd's thoughts and end with a few criticisms and points of clarification.ReviewMan's roots are essentially religious. There is not an area of life divorced from religious presuppositions. All worldviews[i] have a starting point. The consistent Christian starting point will be the living God who reveals himself; the alternative to this is man as the starting point and this position is autonomy. Dooyeweerd shows that man's attempts at knowledge and doing philosophy from an autonomous base self-destruct. For man, having established his starting point with himself, can never rise above himself to offer a critique of his system. In short, he is absolutized the relative. He is guilty of \\"immanentist\\" philosophy. Dooyeweerd writes, \\"For this view [autonomy] implies that the ultimate starting point of philosophy should be found in this thought [theoretical?] itself. But due to the lack of a univocal sense, the pretended autonomy cannot guarantee a common basis to the different philosophical trends\\" (3). In other words, if man posits his own rationality as the starting point for knowledge, then he is left with the unbearable strain that he himself can account for all knowledge. In short, given his premises, to know anything he must know everything. And here is the straw that breaks the camel's back--he doesn't know everything and if he still maintains his original position, he cannot know anything![ii]Dooyeweerd takes sharp issue with the Thomistic \\"grace-nature\\" view of creation. But to understand this, one must first understand his Creation-Fall-RedemptionMotif. This is the biblical story, according to Dooyeweerd. \\"As Creator God reveals himself as the absolute origin of all that is outside himself\\" (188); \\"The entire fall into sin can be summed up as a false illusion, which arose in the human heart, namely, that the human I has the same absolute existence as God himself\\" (190); \\"The redemption by Jesus Christ means the radical rebirth of our heart and must reveal itself in the whole of our temporal life\\" (191). The conclusion that Dooyeweerd draws from this motif, which takes us back to the issue of \\"grace restoring nature\\" is that our whole worldview must be Reformed along Christo-centric lines, abolishing all sinful and artificial dualisms.Concluding ThoughtsI am not entirely convinced of Dooyeweerd's modal scheme. Perhaps this is a fault on my part (or the translator!) or Dooyeweerd's own writing style. Whatever the case may be, I am not ready to commend it to others. I also question whether is separation of theology from philosophy is valid. Dooyeweerd is arguing that philosophy establish the foundation of science (so far, so good) and theology as well (chs. 5-7). Philosophy should, he argues, establish a coherent structure for the temporal sciences, including theology. Not wanting his view of philosophy to fall prey to the damaging critiques he has given to autonomous thinking so far, he argues that philosophy should be controlled by the Word but not derived from the Bible.Even acknowledging this criticism, however, one can still appreciate Dooyeweerd's valuable contributions. Dooyeweerd's attack on autonomy is crucial and at points insightful. His \\"grace restoring nature\\" foundation is a much-needed corrective to a recent and quite odd Protestant fear of the created order. Lately, many Protestants have become functional Catholics in their view of matter. Indeed, there is a danger that an incipient Gnosticism has gripped many in the Reformed world. It is the prayer of many modern-day Calvinists to God to \\"make the world go away.\\" No longer does one hear the triumphant sound of defiance in the face of God's enemies. Where are the men who urge, like Joshua and Caleb of old, to \\"take the land\\" for the enemies are in fear?True, there are many legitimate faults in neo-Calvinism, especially their over-emphasis on the transformation of culture. This fault, however, is not a real danger to Reformed people today. In fact, quite the opposite is true. Of course, Rushdoony's introduction to the book is alone worth the price of the book. [brief aside: Rushdoony in passing exposes a fatal tension to natural law theories: they are making a fallen world the source of norms.]"},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"As many reviewers have noted, T.S. Eliot called \`The Moonstone' \\"the first and greatest English detective novel.\\" Is the novel worthy of such praise? We shall see...The story begins with a brief prologue describing how the famous yellow diamond was captured during a military campaign in India by a British officer in 1799. The action moves quickly to 1848 England, where, according to the British officer's will, the diamond has been given to one of the soldier's young relatives, Rachel Verinder. Yet only hours after the diamond arrives at the Verinder estate, it disappears. Was it stolen by a relative? A servant? And who are these three Indian men who keep hanging around the estate?\`The Moonstone' is told from the point of view of several characters. The first portion of the tale is told by Gabriel Betteredge, house steward of the Verinder estate, who has been working for the family practically his entire life. Although over 200 pages, Betteredge's account holds the reader's interest as he introduces the main players and the crime itself. The next account, by distant Verinder relative Miss Clack, is humorous and somewhat important, but far too long (nearly 100 pages) for its relevance to the story. But after Miss Clack's account, things really take off at breakneck speed.Readers who latch onto the T.S. Eliot quote expecting a modern detective tale will be sorely disappointed. You aren't going to see anything resembling Jeffrey Deaver, James Patterson, Sue Grafton, or even Mary Higgins Clark. You also won't see Mickey Spillane, Dashiel Hammett, or Raymond Chandler. Nor will you see Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, or Martha Grimes. You won't even see Arthur Conan Doyle. But you WILL see the novel that influenced them all.You'll also see something else. Something that modern mystery/detective writers have for the most part lost. Characters. Oh sure, modern writers have characters, but for the most part, the reader only learns enough about the character to forward the plot. In our time, plot is King. When \`The Moonstone' was published (1868), one of the novel's attractions was its characters. Collins has painted each of these characters so well that the reader feels that they know not only how they look, but their mannerisms, their movements, how they think, and their view of the world they live in. That type of character development is seriously lacking today, not from all writers, but from far too many.Of course, the down side is that Colllins also took over 500 pages to develop those characters. Is the book too long? For most modern readers, the answer is yes. I believe it all has to do with your expectation. Put modern mystery/detective stories out of your head. Then read \`The Moonstone' as you would any other novel. Get lost in the atmosphere and the characters. Immerse yourself. Most of all, enjoy. Reading \`The Moonstone' is like eating at a fine restaurant after months of fast food. When it's over, you just want to sit back in your favorite chair and say, \\"It's nice to know that the finer things are still available.\\" Yes they are. Treat yourself to this gourmet book.522 pages"},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I have become a recent convert to Victorian literature. Educated as an electrical engineer, I did not appreciate literature until I reached my 70's. This book is to the modern detective novel as Maxwell's equations are to the wireless engineer of today. All the modern detective novels follow the basics exhibited in Moonstone, but usually fall far short because they leave out one or more of the \\"equations\\". A thoroughly gripping and inventive novel by a master."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"THE MOONSTONE was the first mystery story, and it in many ways remains one of the most remarkable. Working in the shadow of the Gothic and Romantic literary traditions, Wilkie Collins managed to create something new and unique. Instead of the endless evocation of atmosphere and focusing on sinister villains, Collins focuses instead on a simple mystery and its solution: who stole the diamond known as the Moonstone, and where did it go? But any reader of the novel knows that the mystery is secondary to the exposition and the marvelous parade of characters. It isn't the getting to the resolution of the mystery that is the main thing, but the process of getting there.One of the great attractions of the novel is the extraordinary style of the writing. Although the first English mystery story, it had not yet devolved into a genre, and Collins was not aware that a mystery story could not also be great literature. As a result, he imbued his characters with enormous charm and give them each a vivid manner in expressing themselves. The multiple narratives by this remarkable characters was a strategy to deal with the problem of authorial point of view. On the one hand, Collins wanted to avoid the omniscient narrator who would know the truth both about each character and about the myster of the fate of the diamond. Collins therefore cast the novel in the form of a succession of narratives by the various participants in the novel. He thereby limits the knowledge of each narrator, but he also is able thereby to provide considerable variation in the style of each narrative. The two most remarkable segments are those by Gabriel Betteridge, House-Steward in the service of Lady Verinder and her cousin Miss Clack, a prim and fervid evangelical Christian whose missionary zeal and prudish moralizing provide many of the funniest moments of the novel. The style of these two could not be more distinct, both from the rest of the narratives and from each other. Miss Clack has constantly to fight a tendency to sermonize. She is apt to turn out passages such as: &quot;A thundering knock at the street door startled us all. I looked through the window, and saw the World the Flesh, and the Devil waiting before the house--as typified in a carriage and horses, a powdered footman, and three of the most audaciously dressed women I ever beheld in my life.&quot; Betteridge, on the other hand, is solid, practical, a tad parochial, but ferociously loyal to his employer. For him the good life consists of a good pipe and a copy of ROBINSON CRUSOE at hand. If one laughs a bit at Miss Clack, the reader comes to thoroughly like Betteredge. Between the two of them, their narrative occupy more than half the novel. The others are also quite enjoyable, but not to the degree that these two are.THE MOONSTONE is a page turner, which is to say that it is a delight to read. One wants to read quickly both because each page is such a joy and because one wants to discover what happens next. The characters are mainly enjoyable, but like so many authors his eccentric characters are far more memorable and enjoyable than his central characters. Betteredge, Miss Clack, and Sgt. Cuff far outstrip the &quot;hero&quot; of the book, who while a good citizen, is from a literary point of view a tad boring.I can agree with those readers who consider THE WOMAN IN WHITE a better book, but this is another of those comparisons that are odious. The book is so enjoyable, fun, and memorable that I can't imagine any reader lamenting during the course of its pages that they weren't reading the other book instead."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Almost everyone has heard of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes, whereas his predecessor Wilkie Collins has been relegated to footnote status. However writers in the \\"golden age\\" of detective mysteries, especially Dorothy Sayers, were very aware of Collins and his influence.The Moonstone uses a clever device whereby the narrative is passed from hand to hand to tell the story of the massive yellow diamond called the Moonstone. Ill-gotten spoils from colonial India, the Moonstone vanished for a generation until it was bequeathed as an 18th-birthday gift to Rachel Verinder. The engaging characters who tell the story of the mysterious disappearance of the Moonstone on Miss Verinder's birthday, each with his or her unique background and perspective, kept me following the story until the end. Collins also depicts the setting in rural England of Rachel Verinder's home town very effectively and without romanticizing. Unexpectedly, the famous detective plays a minor and reluctant role. In the end, I found the actual method of commiting the crime to be a bit unbelievable, but because I enjoyed the storytelling so much this was a minor quibble."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"T.S. Eliot was not exaggerating when he dubbed Collins' masterpiece &quot;the first, the longest, and the best of modern English detective novels&quot;. The Moonstone, first published in 1868, is the magnum opus of suspense and intrigue that will surely please the avid mystery and/or classics buff.The adventure begins when the priceless yellow diamond from India, known as the 'Moonstone', is brought to English as spoils of war and is bestowed upon the spirited Rachel Verrinder on her 18th birthday. Chaos soon commences. The valuable jewel is stolen that very night and the entire household falls under suspicion - including a hunchbacked maid, an assemblage of enigmatic Indian jugglers, and Miss Verrinder's cousin Mr. Franklin Blake. Suspicion of thievery does not even escape Miss Verrinder herself. The famed Sergeant Cuff is summoned to the house to try and make sense of the baffling mystery of the diamond's disappearance and the strange events that ensue.The Moonstone is comprised of three novelettes and a handful of sub-sections, each narrated by three individuals (and a handful of other characters writing shorter supporting memoirs), with their own whimsical writing styles and detailed anecdotes about their adventures surrounding the jewel's disappearance and the aftermath. Their varying perspectives on incidents throw interesting light on the events unraveling around the reader. Introducing the novel is the household's elderly and garrulous manservant, Mr. Gabriel Betteredge, with his witty maxims and proverbial quotes from his personal bible, \\"Robinson Crusoe\\". The pious and almost-fanatical Miss Clack's cold recital of events, is followed soon after by Mr. Franklin Blake's narrative of events, and the mystery's final and most ingenious outcome. It will not disappoint.I leave you with a bit of insight bestowed upon us by the lovable and amusing Mr. Betteredge:&quot;When my spirits are bad -- Robinson Crusoe. When I want advice -- Robinson Crusoe. In past times when my wife plagued me; in present times when I have had a drop too much -- Robinson Crusoe. I have worn out six stout Robinson Crusoes with hard work in my service. On my lady's last birthday she gave me a seventh. I took a drop too much on the strength of it; and Robinson Crusoe put me right again. Price four shillings and sixpence, bound in blue, with a picture into the bargain. Still, this don't look much like starting the story of the Diamond -- does it? I seem to be wandering off in search of Lord knows what, Lord knows where. We will take a new sheet of paper, if you please, and begin over again, with my best respects to you.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Wilkie Collins is considered by many to be the &quot;Inventor&quot; of the modern mystery. I state this not as an absolute, rather as a commonly held literary opinion. Other reviewers often refer to Mr. Collins in a review of a Charles Palliser Novel, or many others who are at the top of the Mystery Genre today. Mr. Collins was also a contemporary, literary collaborator, and business partner of another rather well known writer, Charles Dickens.This book later would influence the novel that Charles Dickens was never to complete \\"The Mystery Of Edwin Drood\\" due to his death in the midst of writing what was his final novel. There was a common denominator in these novels and it related to a drug, Laudanum. Mr. Collins was a user of the substance however I have never read of Mr. Dickens also having used the drug. When preparing for the book he was never to finish, Collins took Dickens to the opium dens of London, whether or not Dickens participated is a mystery along with the ending of his final work.Laudanum is a key factor in the mystery of the \\"Moonstone\\" that the book revolves around. Collins wanted to write a story that would be directly impacted by the use of the drug on a person or persons, with or without their knowledge, and how their behavior would be affected during a dramatic event while under the influence.Mr. Collins as mentioned was a consumer of this drug, when he set out to write the book he stated, \\"he would write the story as it would have happened, not how it may have happened\\". He was referring to his own experiences with the opiate, which takes an already complicated plot and adds the altered behavior Laudanum can have. The book is as complex as Palliser's \\"Quincunx\\", but I find it easier to follow \\"Moonstone\\".To the extent you feel a familiarity with the Author it may be because so much of what is written today is derivative. The \\"Diamond\\" that plays center stage in this work during the England of Queen Victoria was astonishingly \\"new\\" when published. I believe were it published again today under a new title and Author, it would be found again on the Bestseller Lists, as it was over a century ago,Mr. Collins writes with an elegant hand, which immerses the reader and binds him or her to the characters and the roles they play. The book is not brief as this was a time when Authors wrote as much as was needed, not what was allowed or could potentially be shown at the local multiplex.From the moment the diamond is found, and the story unfolds, clearly for some, less clearly for those who may have been influenced by something other than the dinner wine, the book will delight any reader of Mysteries. If Mr. Collins was not the absolute first to write a modern mystery, he certainly has yet to be surpassed by any other's pen."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"The Moonstone is a cleverly contrived tale of a stolen Indian dimond which becomes the dangerous inheritance of Rachel Vendier.

Maybe so, but the novels differ tremendously. The Woman in White is a page-turning thriller of frantic proportions ... to the extent it almost feels like a slapstick comedy. The Moonstone is a straightforward crime story, complete with well-developed characters and interesting dialogue, culminating in solving the mystery: who stole the Moonstone (..a collosal diamond)?. The story is never dull, but compared to The Woman in White it is hopelessly conventional.So I recommend The Woman in White over The Moonstone for most people.

First things first: if you are expecting a gothic, atmosphere-laden British detective novel, this isn't it. At all. In fact, I think this book is most aptly categorized as a satire, although it contains some classic detective novel features. (If you want Collins in Gothic mode, check out \\"The Haunted Hotel\\").As the product description is a little sparse, I'll try to give a plot synopsis as succinctly as possible. During Britain's colonial takeover of India, a soldier steals a valuable diamond as a trophy of the conquest. Because the diamond was part of a religious artifact, it is said to be cursed, and also has 3 attendants to guard it at all times (however ineffectually). The diamond and it's Indian guardianship is passed down over several decades until the 18th birthday of Rachel Verinder, who is to inherit the diamond as part of a dubious bequest from her outcast uncle. But on the night of the party, the diamond is stolen, and everyone in the house has an opinion as to who took it, and where it will eventually turn up. The novel unfolds as each member of the household (and others) tell in turn their own stories relating to the theft of the diamond.This telling of the story in turn (meaning shifting first person point of view) is pretty unique in the annals of mystery writing, although Ian Pears did it masterfully in \\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\", and to my knowledge this is the first time such a technique was used in English literature. Afterward it found favor with Faulkner and others, so this is significant from an historic standpoint, and offers reason enough to buy this book.So, will you enjoy this, and should you buy it? I think most people would enjoy this book, unless their taste is pretentiously high-brow. There's a lot of humor in this book, so maybe save it for a rainy day. Likewise, Collins does an excellent job of keeping the reader in suspense about what happened to the diamond, and the device of telling the story in turn is fairly ingenious and well done. However, two things about the book lowered it in my estimation. One was that this book was originally serialized, and the text suffers from a kind of \\"tune in next week\\" syndrome, rather than moving at a steady pace. The book is longer than it needed to be as a result. The second thing that detracted from the experience for me was the ending, which I feel was a bit contrived. All in all an enjoyable read, just not a productive one if you're not specifically studying the narrative technique."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Written about twenty years before the first of the Sherlock Holmes novels, this book was called by T.S. Eliot, \\"The first and greatest of English detective novels.\\"It's an exciting story, full of both suspense and humor. While slower paced than modern mysteries, it keeps the reader intrigued and eager to read the next chapter. Stolen jewels, mysterious bequests, and Indian jugglers are all elements of the mystery.The story-telling is marvelous. The plot unfolds by means of several narrators, each with his or her own style and eccentricities. The spice and humor of these various narrators keeps the story moving forward, and the switch between narrators adds to the suspense of figuring out the perpetrator of the crime. Gabriel Betteredge, one of the main narrators, is the head steward of the wealthy family involved in the mystery. His style of story-telling is fresh and delightful - and many of his rabbit trails made me laugh out loud.Published in the 1860s, this book can occasionally come across as dated in its style and tone, but in many respects it fits better with modern sensibilities than other Victorian books. The female characters are strong and independent. The ethnically diverse characters are treated with a surprising amount of dignity and respect for the time period. The Modern Library Classics edition has helpful notes to explain the elements of the story that are confusing for modern readers.The characters are memorable, the plot is intriguing, and the tone is light-hearted. It's a good mystery and a fun read."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"For a fun read, well written and clean, you can't miss with this one. The characters are unique, the plot is well-paced. It won't keep you up at night with suspense but the wit and twists will keep you entertained and engaged."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Like the Woman in White, The Moonstone is written in multiple narratives and is considered one of Wilkie Collins best novels. The Moonstone refers to a yellow diamond that Rachel Verinder unexpectedly inherits on her eighteenth birthday. The diamond, although of immense value, was stolen from a sacred Hindu statue by Rachel's corrupted uncle, Colonel Herncastle.Rachel's cousin and love interest, Franklin Blake, is entrusted to deliver the diamond to his cousin at a birthday dinner party. The night of the party, the diamond vanishes without a trace. After the diamond's disappearance, a series of strange events occur: a maid unexpectedly commits suicide and Rachel Verinder absolutely refuses to cooperate with the investigation of her missing diamond. Sergeant Cuff, who is charge of the investigation, announces from the get-go that this was an inside job!The Moonstone is not for readers who expect or need instant gratification. This novel reads somewhat slow compared to other novels, such as The Woman in White. The mystery behind the diamond's theft is something that unfolds gradually, yet will fascinate you from page one to the end.The reader is presented with a series of suspects and motives each described in detail from a cast of unforgettable characters, such as Gabriel Betteredge, Drusilla Clack, and Ezra Jennings. If this sounds like an Agatha Christie novel to you, that's because The Moonstone is considered THE novel that inspired the birth of the mystery novel. Not my favorite Wilkie Collins novel, that will always be The Woman in White, yet The Moonstone is not a novel to be considered second-best to anything. To quote Charles Dickens \\"A very curious story, wild and yet domestic with excellent characters in it and great mystery.\\""},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Pastiche Victorian mystery and adventure tales are currently in vogue; but why settle for an imitation when you can read the real thing?The Moonstone is at heart a mystery and detective story about a lost diamond. The gem is a sacred Indian artefact that carries a curse, and it leaves a trail of confusion and ruin in its path. Only the virtuous are likely to survive it, and when young heiress Rachel Verinder is bequeathed the stone by an evil uncle, her love, reputation and marriage plans are immediately thrown upside down. And the theft proves equally fateful to the host of family relations, servants, friends and professional detectives who join in to help the reader solve this artfully constructed case.But Wilkie Collins's novel, written in the era of Dickens and George Eliot, is also a commentary on the time and mores. Five principal voices, of different social and intellectual standing, alternate as the narrator, each bringing its own colour, and this helps the book pick through such archetypes as the faithful old butler, the bigoted poor relation, and the pusillanimous cousin, as well as offer glimpses of contemporary attitudes to scientific enquiry, drugs, superstition, and the law. The dialogues are equally truthful. Indeed, The Moonstone is a pleasure to read, subtly written and constantly amusing. And importantly, it skirts the pitfalls of Victorian prejudice, whether social, religious or racial. This surprising book ranks alongside the better known 19th century classics and is not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This is an important work to read because it is known as the first real Engligh detective story. As the first detective story it sets many of the standards for the modern-day detective story genre. Another reason why this book is interesting is because of the various eye-witness testimonies that make up the book. And I must mention here the first half of the book is written by Gabriel Betteridge, the butler for the family involved in this tale. This part of the book is excruciatingly funny. Betteridge's servant's viewpoint is pure genius. The book was published in 1868, and Wilkie Collins was actually quite advanced in his thinking for a writer of this era. The book is about the disappearance of a priceless diamond that had been brought to England from India as a spoil of war. The diamond has a curse on it, and it proves to be the undoing of various people throughout the book. The book is long, but the various viewpoints presented help to shorten the story."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This is really a simple detective story that has been written in a likable manner. Three main protagonists tell the tale of the stolen diamond. Among the three the narrative of Miss Clack is quite enjoyable.This book pokes fun at religious fanaticism, sycophancy and stratified social norms of Victorian England.But what attracted me was the way Indian Characters are treated by the writer. Absence of condescension and racial bigotry marks the writer's sympathetic viewpoint of the Indian Characters and even rationalizes their murder of the perpetrator. One is then surprised to note that this novel is way ahead of it's time, as Indians characters are still either patronized or vilified albeit couched in innuendoes.Though not exactly in the league of the great classics it is undeniably exquisite piece of work! The writer was a great friend of Dickens - who I believe mistreated him and as a result Collins was often depressed. That could well mean that Dickens was jealous of Collins and rightly so. Except for Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickleby, I find Dickens' writing boring and unnecessarily convoluted. For instance, one does have a hard time reading Hard Times, especially considering that Emile Zola had taken the same subject in Germinal and made it interesting and a delight to read."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"T.S. Eliot was not exaggerating when he dubbed Collins' masterpiece \\"the first, the longest, and the best of modern English detective novels\\". The Moonstone, first published in 1868, is the magnum opus of suspense and intrigue that will surely please the avid mystery and/or classics buff.The adventure begins when the priceless yellow diamond from India, known as the 'Moonstone', is brought to English as spoils of war and is bestowed upon the spirited Rachel Verrinder on her 18th birthday. Chaos soon commences. The valuable jewel is stolen that very night and the entire household falls under suspicion - including a hunchbacked maid, an assemblage of enigmatic Indian jugglers, and Miss Verrinder's cousin Mr. Franklin Blake. Suspicion of thievery does not even escape Miss Verrinder herself. The famed Sergeant Cuff is summoned to the house to try and make sense of the baffling mystery of the diamond's disappearance and the strange events that ensue.The Moonstone is comprised of three novelettes and a handful of sub-sections, each narrated by three individuals (and a handful of other characters writing shorter supporting memoirs), with their own whimsical writing styles and detailed anecdotes about their adventures surrounding the jewel's disappearance and the aftermath. Their varying perspectives on incidents throw interesting light on the events unraveling around the reader. Introducing the novel is the household's elderly and garrulous manservant, Mr. Gabriel Betteredge, with his witty maxims and proverbial quotes from his personal bible, \\"Robinson Crusoe\\". The pious and almost-fanatical Miss Clack's cold recital of events, is followed soon after by Mr. Franklin Blake's narrative of events, and the mystery's final and most ingenious outcome. It will not disappoint.I leave you with a bit of insight bestowed upon us by the lovable and amusing Mr. Betteredge:\\"When my spirits are bad -- Robinson Crusoe. When I want advice -- Robinson Crusoe. In past times when my wife plagued me; in present times when I have had a drop too much -- Robinson Crusoe. I have worn out six stout Robinson Crusoes with hard work in my service. On my lady's last birthday she gave me a seventh. I took a drop too much on the strength of it; and Robinson Crusoe put me right again. Price four shillings and sixpence, bound in blue, with a picture into the bargain. Still, this don't look much like starting the story of the Diamond -- does it? I seem to be wandering off in search of Lord knows what, Lord knows where.

His wonderful novel, \\"The Moonstone\\" introduces many of those elements we have come to expect in a good mystery such as the clever detective who sees clues that no one else does, characters with dark secrets, and exotic bloodthirsty villains.It is deservedly a classic and needs to be read in that light. The characters and setting are from another epoch with no trace of the revolting moral decay found in many modern-day mysteries.

But more or less I know Holmes' way of presenting crime and mysterious events. Moonstone goes far beyond the limit of these cliche detective scope and reaches to your hearts with its seven different characters;all narrating their own side of the story centering on an oriental myth of a sacred gem. There is the historical background, the emotional diologues, and finally the inevitable conciseness in language while dictating the action, just like in all detective stories. Wilkie Collins' touch can be seized when you go deep into characters such as Ezra Jennings. There is lot of things to be explored and make fun of! Don't be afraid of the length and page number:).

It was removed by Muslim conquerors and then taken through murder and theft by the corrupt Col. John Herncastle in the 1799 British storming of Seringapatam. Some fifty years later, Herncastle, who has been shunned by his family, leaves it as a legacy to his niece, Rachel Verinder. But all during this time, three Brahmin priests and their descendants have continued to follow the diamond in the hopes of returning it to India. For Rachel's eighteenth birthday party, Herncastle's nephew, Franklin Blake, is instructed to bring the diamond to Rachel. At the party, besides Rachel and Blake who are in love, are Rachel's mother, cousins Godfrey Ablewhite and Miss Drusilla Clack, a local doctor Thomas Candy, and a world traveler named Mr. Murthwaite. Three Indian jugglers have also come by offering to perform for the party but are refused.Rachel wears the diamond at her party. However, the next morning it is missing. Several suggestions as to who took it are made--the three Indian jugglers; Rosanna Spearman, a maidservant who begins to act oddly and who then drowns herself in a local quicksand; and even Rachel herself, who also behaves suspiciously and is suddenly furious with Blake when he directs attempts to find it. Sergeant Richard Cuff, a renowned detective from Scotland Yard, is called in, but the mystery remains unsolved and everyone leaves. During the next year there are hints that the diamond was removed from the house and may be in a London bank vault, having been pledged as surety to a moneylender. The Indian jugglers are still nearby, watching and waiting. Who took the diamond? Will it ever be found? And why did Rosanna kill herself? The story is told through narratives by several of the parties involved, including head servant Gabriel Betteredge, Miss Clack, the Verinders' solicitor Matthew Bruff, Mr. Blake, and others. T. S. Elliot called it \\"The first and greatest of English detective novels.\\" The British Conkie and the American Edgar Allen Poe are credited as co-creators of the detective story.The Moonstone has all the features that we usually associate with English detective novels--an English country setting, a bloody murder, a tragic suicide, a frustrated love affair, a bumbling local policeman, and a brilliant London detective. However, this is not a \\"modern detective story.\\" Rather than focusing on atmosphere and sinister villains, Collins emphasizes characterization and a simple mystery with its solution. Forms of the \\"d\\" word are used in a few instances, and the terms \\"Lord\\" and \\"God\\" are occasionally found as interjections. There are several references to drinking wine, smoking tobacco, and even using opium, although both the smoking and opium use are essential to the plot. Also, the opium is spoken of more as a medicine, and the dangers of addiction are mentioned. The only really \\"religious\\" person, Miss Clack, is slightly lampooned as somewhat of a fanatic, but the fact is that there are people who do self-righteously use their religion as a cudgel to beat others. The book could be done as a family read aloud with some judicious editing or explanation but is recommended primarily for teens and adults as the subject matter and style of writing would probably not appeal to younger children."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Finally had the chance to read The Moonstone, by Wilkie Collins, said to be the first detective novel ever. It was an engaging read, and I recommend it. It is broken down into different narratives, each 'written' by a separate character involved in the case, and all are fully developed and interesting, and it is also interesting to see how the different characters then appear when reflected in other narratives. At times it had me laughing, which I hope was the intent, particularly at the character of Miss Clack, a very serious Christian spinster, who is constantly trying to save souls from the fires of hell in her very strange ways."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I understood that The Moonstone is a classic so I decided to read this to be culturally literate. Well the story line may be interesting but the writing is atrocious. It is curricular, bloated, and seemingly pointless. The characters just keep rattling. A lot of writers fill in the story with descriptions of time and place to give an atmosphere to the story. This writer (Wilkie Collins) just fills it with unrelated trivia. Every once in a while I would go back a few pages to see what I must have missed. When I read again there was nothing there to miss. Ether Wilkie is extremely monotonous or other writing from this period is and I am just now lucky enough to find out. I talked to others about this and they said; \\"Now you know why Sherlock Holmes is so popular\\""},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"An interesting and winding plot, the Moonstone puts a twist on the traditional detective story. Containing several narratives rather than just the single side of the story usually pretaining to the detective alone, the reader has a chance to see every possible angle of the story. I really enjoyed this aspect of the novel, and I find myself now wishing that more books had followed Wilkie Collin's example.The one negative thing about this book, if anything, is that the narratives tend to be dragged out to almost excessive lengths. I found myself wishing at some points that the characters would just shut up and move on with the story. Some of the things that they were discussing in no means were related to the story, so I couldn't see why they had to be mentioned.But all in all, this is a rather good read, whether for the detective lover or first time reader."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Not my cup of tea. I couldn't finish this story. It was very slow moving and the narrative was of the tone \\"this happened, then that happened.\\""},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"The book is printed on 100% recycled paper which is fantastic and other than the fact that the cover doesn't have any protective plastic sheeting, I'm very happy with it."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"The fact that this book has a &quot;classic&quot; label is the real mystery here. I can't think of another &quot;classic&quot; that has such basic and major flaws. I am mystified that, as noted above in the professional reviews, T.S. Eliot thought so much of it. Honestly, the characters in the Moonstone are really ridiculous. I don't mean that they're badly drawn or personally obnoxious. But the reasoning behind their actions is frequently, in fact at many key points, illogical.It's hard to give examples that don't also give away the plot, but, for instance: the Moonstone is stolen. Everyone almost immediately fears that it was taken by the heroine, who ACTUALLY OWNS the diamond and was, in fact, just given it as a present. Why would she steal her own diamond? We follow the merrily skipping Mr. Wilkie down several more garden chapters before he finally suggests that maybe the heroine stole her own diamond in order to pay off debts, from, like, gambling or something!Even if it had been suggested that the heroine could have incurred any such debts -- which is entirely nonsensical, because she's watched like a hawk by her highly morally exemplary mom and about 50 devoted old servants, and she's an heiress -- even if she could have owed large sums of money, then WHY in the world wouldn't she have just pretended to LOSE the diamond while boating, or have a copy made and replace the original with the copy, or any other of a dozen much more plausible possibilities?Later on, a suicide note (or, technically, a letter that was only to be opened in the event of suicide) goes on for, I believe, 20 close-written pages, carefully explaining all the gaps in the plot up to that time. The letter is so long that the hero stops in the middle of it (delaying the resolution of the mystery) to REST HIS EYES! And (surprisingly!), the note is written in the same voice and style as all the other characters' accounts are written, chatty and surprisingly cheerful for a suicide note, except towards the end, when it suddenly turns mawkish.Characters change their minds constantly, in ways that just happen to further the plot. Mysterious suggestions are made about characters' backgrounds that are then dropped and never come into play at all. That and many other such psychologically inconsistent occurences and attitudes make the story a waste of time for any reader who pays attention to anything deeper than the superficial plot line. The other customer reviewer below, who quoted Dickens's opinion of the book, it right on.Still, I give it 3 stars because, if you can suspend your disbelief in the regard I've described (and I know many readers are not fussy about such things, and probably would think I was nit-picking), the book could be a lot of fun. Cursed jewels, family vengeance, proposals of marriage, dark murderous foreigners, quicksand, lots of traveling between London and the country, and England and the continent - it's certainly entertaining on that score. And they say the book is important in terms of literary history.I just wish Wilkie would have been a little more hard on himself during the plot formulation phase, and in the rewrite."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Still speaking to us across the ages is Collins' archtypal detective story, the lengthly tale of a stolen diamond consisting of no less than eight major narratives. While Collins' meticulously plotted mystery is most famous for its complex construction and detailed detective work, its &quot;solution&quot; has aged so appallingly that it is really the narrative voices that most appeal to the modern reader.It's problematic then, that the most interesting narrators, butler extraordinaire Gabriel Betteredge and wonderously mortifying spinster Miss Clack speak first, while the endless wrap-up is given over to tediously forthright hero Franklin Blake. Things perk up at the end as poignant Ezra Jennings briefly takes over, but Blake quickly dispatches him and continues with his own colorless narration.Considering its advanced age, the first half of this book works surprisingly well, but the latter sections sag badly. For those interested in the period or genre, The Moonstone is a fascinating relic, but not quite a fully functioning mystery."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"My all time favorite book.

The first narrative of the overseer, over one third of the book, was great fun. His idiosyncrasies and droll way of looking at the other characters was quite delightful. The tale itself was unfolding in a way that continued to whet one's interest as more and more unexplainable and outrageous developments occurred. Unfortunately, to my way of thinking, the book lost its momentum with the second narrative. This part of the story was told by a Miss Clack, a hypocritical self-righteous meddler. Wilkie was all too successful in depicting this contemptible character. Although she presented a different angle on the plot, the story lost its previous charm for me, and never regained it. Tedious prolongation of the suspense and what I considered to be an unbelievable resolution resulted in disappointment. The book may have historical interest as being a pioneering manifestation of the detective novel, but, for my money, is far inferior to the Sherlock Holmes stories, which were cleverer and much more compact. Due to its reputation as a classic, I had expected something with more depth. If the author had only carried through on the promise of the first narrative, I think it would indeed have been a great book."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Clearly written and sprinkled with the vivid eccentricities of Victorian England at its apex, &quot;The Moonstone&quot;--hailed even today as the archetype of the modern detective novel--has been imitated and imitated to the point that it's begun to show its age. Through no fault of its own, its seminal reliance on unforseen plot turns and carefully hidden clues might seem relatively old hat these days. But when first published in 1868, &quot;The Moonstone&quot; was utterly and indisputedly new. Some critics thought it monsterous. Others found it's gentle skewering of Victorian mores a little too shocking. Public opinion, however, granted &quot;The Moonstone&quot; almost instant acclaim.Take, for instance, the &quot;cliche&quot; around which the plot thickens: Explorers in the heart of the Himalayas find and then steal a huge diamond from the face of a Hindu (in the novel, it's quaintly spelled &quot;Hindoo&quot;) statue. Accordingly--and a little bit like the famed sapphire, &quot;The Star of India&quot;--what might be a curse, and what might also be its pursing Hindu claimants, follows the diamond from owner to owner until a beautiful 19-year-old woman, Rachel Verinder, receives it as a birthday present.If, in a movie, that young beauty was played by, say, Tori Spelling, we'd all be anticipating the grisly details of a rich prepster's murder at an illicit high school keg party, and lots of techno music, some sort of sado-machochism scene and a gang of French guys with long hair, black leather pants, and plenty of flash overall. But here that's really not the case--because the very night Rachel Verinder receives the diamond...it disappears. In other words, &quot;The Moonstone&quot; surrounds itself with one of the richest and most intriguing plots in classic fiction. Which isn't to say it's devoid of any flashiness.Not surprisingly, the detective, an enigmatic Sergeant Cuff, shambles onto the consequent fracas within the Verinder household. He's kind of a cross between the inscrutable Sherlock Holmes--an obvious copy of the original--and the always underestimated Columbo. Seeing things that not even the reader notices, Cuff expertly analyzes the case as his focus ranges through a rogue's gallery of potential theives.Did Rachel &quot;steal&quot; her own diamond, believing that she can outwit the diamond's accursed pursuers? Or did her fiance-wannabe, the young dark and dashing Mr. Ablewhite, take the diamond in order to protect the woman he loves from the curse? Or how about likely-suspect Rosanna--a former prostitute who is in love with another of Rachel Verinder's admirers, Mr. Franklin Blake? Maybe she took the Moonstone because she wishes so badly to impress the object of her heart.Like an immense parlor game--brought to our attention by the once-novel device of &quot;testimonies&quot; from major characters--&quot;The Moonstone&quot; gathers from one mannerly outrage to another until, in a quite mannerly conclusion, it rises from the quicksand of a thoroughly enticing plot, its yellow pallor luminescently taking victim after victim into its solipsistic spell.Unlike many novels of what is sometimes termed the Regency period of English literature, Collins, like most novelists and artists of the day, anticipates the breakdown of the Victorian ethic. Like Cervantes, who wrote of the dying Age of Chivalry in a lighthearted way, Collins takes the mores of the day to task on nearly every page. Rachel, who is by no means the dispassionate and meek beauty she should be, is a thoroughly modern Millie compared to the average upper class woman of the times. Franklin Blake, a world traveller, has seen and heard enough in his lifetime to see through many of the suffocating rules and sanctions, and is eternally suspicious because of it. Mrs. Merridew, one of Rachel's guardians, is perhaps the most comical character. When she begins going through the Verinder household, concealing religious phamplets in the plants, among the loose papers in the library and even under the napkins surrounding the dinner table, you can't help but laugh a little--especially when every little twinge of eroticism or morally-electric curiosity she might feel is interpreted in light of her quest to bring everyone around her straight to Jesus. Eloquently a period piece, this popular entertainment from the last days of the Age of Dickens is also pompously rich in Victorian detail and fraught with the cups and teaspoons of life among the privileged in an era where refinement was everything. Clearly delineated characterizations and strong period detail, however, seem somewhat laughable when we look into &quot;The Moonstone&quot; from our period. Yet with a willful suspension of disbelief, most readers will find that Wilkie Collins' &quot;The Moonstone&quot; exercises the &quot;intrigue muscle&quot; quite nicely."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I happened upon The Moonstone by accident, never heard of it before.

His philosophies are somewhat (and refreshingly) liberal for his time, particularly those in regard to servants, foreigners and women. His stories are sprinkled with just a dash of wit and satire, yet his characters and their motives are crystal clear and believable. In this, arguably one of the first mystery novels, (Poe began it all, after all, did he not?) the plot revolves around a stone, a great gem that has been stolen from an Indian idol. A birthday present to our heroine, it is stolen the same night it is given, and through a series of changing narratives the mystery is uncovered. It's a clever twist of plotting to make the hero the villain and then the hero again, but how it comes about I will not say. No one likes to have a mystery spoiled. The Moonstone is a thoroughly enjoyable read. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I recently decided to reread The Moonstone, a classic of Victorian fiction by Wilkie Collins. One of my online reading groups chose to read it because it is available free as an ebook these days, so it seemed to them like a good \\"recession buster.\\" That got me to thinking maybe I'd join them with this particular book (though, much as I love my Kindle, I read my aged, yellowed paperback priced originally $1.45). I could only dimly remember the plot since I last read it as a teenager. T.S. Eliot called it \\"the first, the longest, and the best of modern English detective novels.\\" That seemed like a good recommendation, and I am in the midst of laying out the plot to my own mystery, so studying a master would be good inspiration, and he certainly was.What fun to reread this book! I'm afraid I neglected my own writing for a day or two. I certainly learned some good tricks. For example, Collins invents multiple ways for critical information to be kept from the necessary characters for unconscionably long tracks of time. No quick resolutions here. Sometimes you need to hold off letting the cat out of the bag, and I got plenty of ideas in that regard. He plants clues masterfully, sometimes letting them hide in plain sight, sometimes carefully drawing attention to them but cloaking their true significance behind layers of false assumptions.But the greatest enjoyment for me about this venerable book lay in the personality of the narrators. Collins uses the conceit that one of the main characters has requested reports from each of the key witnesses to the various stages of the remarkable episode of the Moonstone, an exotic diamond originally stolen from India. In this way, Collins creates interest in his long book by changing who tells us the action, but it's more than variety that intrigues. Each narrator is built into a richly developed character. Their ways of understanding the people and events contribute to the engaging quality of the novel. After a brief Prologue \\"extracted from a family paper\\" that gives the Indian background, we hear from Gabriel Betteredge, the aged and delightful house-steward of the grand country home where the main strand of the mystery begins. He's impossible not to like, even while we chuckle at his set notions. Did you know Robinson Crusoe is an eternal fount of wisdom for all of life's difficulties, a true prophetic document? We'll hear from the spinster aunt Miss Clack, Mr. Bruff, a clever and worldly solicitor, Franklin Blake, the romantic hero of the book, Ezra Jennings, an outcast physician with Gypsy bloodlines, and Sergeant Cuff, an early example of the brilliant and eccentric detective (but there's a twist with his brilliant conclusions). Collins has fun with his story-tellers. Their blindnesses, prejudices, and humanity are all on display. We are invited to assume a superior stance to their limitations, but that, of course, is only part of the ploy. Dear reader, you will discover your own limitations as you read! But you'll also laugh at the foibles and idiosyncrasies of each narrator in turn. This is a winding, complex tale with a heart and a conscious.Collins is remarkably forward thinking for a Victorian. The do-gooder Miss Clack, who is always out to save another Christian soul, is portrayed as remarkably small-minded. Her version of religion, a parody of what we sometimes imagine of the Victorian era, does not shine as a beacon of love and charity. Nor do those characters who immediately suspect evil of all dark skinned \\"Orientals.\\" Nonetheless, Collins's portrayal of India is decidedly un-PC, as much as his view is enlightened for his day. You'll have to accept the historical moment from which he wrote. I found it interesting in light of our current East-West dichotomy that so often underlies the way we approach issues without our being fully conscious of it. The Victorians were, after all, only carrying on a tradition of bigotry against the East started by the Athenians in the 5th Century B.C.E. History has its uses on the road to enlightenment.And, it turns out, Victorian mysteries have their pleasures. Sometimes the best things in life are indeed free. (That is if you have an e-reader or you kept your high school paperbacks.)"},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Excellence is a starting point that never varies in this work. The descriptions and the plot weave a web that sets not only the tension and desire to know more, it transports you like a time machine to another time and place. I highly recommend this as a must read to enjoy and like a great meal it will nurture you for some time after partaking."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This novel might be slow-going for modern readers, but it is easy to see why Collins was so popular in his day. This 19th century novel adapts the 18th century epistolary novel to give the same multiple viewpoints and characterization through the characters' \\"own words\\" without the repetition of minor details in, say, Clarissa or Pamela (Richardson). Repetition is an essential feature of this type of novel, of course, but Collins maintains the balance between seeing events from different characters' perspectives and repeating exactly the same details (a feature that inspired Henry Fielding to parody the epistolary novel in his Shamela). Added to that, we have this novel's place in literary history as arguably (T.S. Eliot argued this) the first modern detective novel--this novel is then the last (or close to the last) pre-modern epistolary novel and the first modern detective novel.Readers were shocked when the novel first came out by Collins' treatment of taboo subjects, ranging from a (gasp) suicide (and very subtle hints of lesbian attraction--too subtle to shock most of his contemporaries) to relatively subtle criticism of colonialism and racism; modern readers may be disappointed that the sinking sands never produce the body and are likely to see what Collins intended as a criticism of racism as, simply, racist. Collins was also a product of his times in terms of his views of women, and motivations based on the idea that women are entirely controlled by emotion and simply cannot understand finances may either confuse or upset modern readers, in terms of both believable motivation and the solution to the mystery.Clearly, scholars of 18th and 19th century British literature should read this novel for its neglected place in literary history; today's \\"Common Reader\\" will need to adjust some expectations (the book is not meant to be read in an evening, for example) and be willing to \\"get into\\" the 19th century mindset (as opposed to enjoying modern novels set in a pseudo-19th century). The Moonstone is still not great literature compared to the \\"greats\\" of 19th century literary giants, but it will reward the modern reader willing to take this seminal detective novel on its own terms.Besides, it is free (or nearly free) on Kindle (long out of copyright), so buying it is neither a financial investment nor a bookshelf-space commitment--and unlike some of the cheaper modern editions, you can adjust the font size so that the longish sentences do not tire the eye."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"After reading The Woman in White and thoroughly enjoying it, I looked forward to more of Wilkie Collins. I was not disappointed with The Moonstone. Interestingly, just before reading the book, I had \\"coincidentally\\" found in other research that many ancient religions worship the moon, have a legend about a green stone falling from the sky, and guard their green-stone-from-the-sky with jealous zeal. In the first few pages of The Moonstone, the stone's history is explained. I realized that the author must have known something about the green stones and the moon god worship of ancient civilizations. That is all a curious \\"aside\\" to this review. The Moonstone is another riveting Collins' mystery novel, with new surprises popping up especially at the end. I could never have guessed the solution to the mystery, which is what makes this book so good. Not only are you wondering \\"who did it and why?\\" but you are also wondering about the final results of the matchmaking, after all the obstacles. This is certainly a mystery much more than a romance, although it seems that few authors can resist writing a good book without having a young couple fall in love. Buy this book and enjoy! (The Wordsworth Classics edition was very readable in terms of print size, and had explanatory notes at the end.)"},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"The Moonstone by Wilkie Collins was quite possibly one of my first exposures to the world of mystery novels. I can't remember if I read Sherlock Holmes series first of this, but, I distinctly remember being absolutely blown away by The Moonstone upon my first read. And let me tell you - I've read it several times since, and it never fails to amaze me, still!The beauty of the Moonstone lies not only in its ingenious plot, but in its characterization. The author has mapped out the characters so well in this book that you feel akin to them, you feel as if you've known them all your life. Their temperaments, their actions make sense and they are not just used simply to move the plot forward, but to create the illusion that the reader is literally part of the character's world. There are a lot of characters, and it may seem that some characters are in the novel merely to add to its shroud of mystery, however, as the story unfolds you will see that every character in this novel was warranted and needed for the plot to be as interesting as it is.You, as the reader, will make various guesses as to who you think is the \\"culprit\\", however, do not be surprised if you find yourself guessing wrong, only to guess again and be proved wrong yet again. The Moonstone is a novel that keeps you guessing till the very end - but leads to an extremely satisfying and sublime ending, tying romance, mystery and drama all together in a nice, neat and pleasant package."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This is a classic novel which T.S.

It features the theft of a valuable diamond, an heiress, an amateur sleuth, an English country house, a Scotland Yard detective, laudanam, quicksand, a backdrop of events in colonial India, a reenactment, and lots of red herrings.The plot is revealed using first person accounts from eleven different narrators. This device provides humour and contrast, and allows the reader to read between the lines and make deductions about what might have happened.The Moonstone was first published in serial form in 1888, in a magazine edited by Wilkie Collins's friend Charles Dickens, so there are plenty of hooks to keep the reader turning the pages. Despite being more than a hundred years old it's a fresh, exciting read and is now available free in the Kindle Store."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This book has it all.

This is a review of the free Kindle edition.The Moonstone is told by multiple narrators (seems to be what his style was), which I found more distracting in The Moonstone, for some reason. Probably due to my strong dislike of the 2nd narrator.I found the villain quite predictable, but never had any idea of how we would get there. The characters seemed quite solid, and certainly interesting with 100+ years of separation. The book has aged better than I would have thought, though it would certainly be different if written now.I prefer the Woman in White, but the Moonstone is also a must read, especially with a free version available.

I felt like I was right there in the book."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"A diamond is stolen from the English country estate of Lady Verinder and the renowned Sergeant Cuff is brought in from London to help solve the case. The diamond, said to bring bad luck to its owner because it was stolen from a temple in India, was given to Lady Verinder's daughter, Rachel, on her 18th birthday. It was bequeathed to Rachel from her uncle (who stole it when he was a young soldier) on his death. The story unfolds through several narrators, all of whom know a piece of what happened. As each of them writes his or her side of the story, the reader gets just a little more information that helps to solve the mystery.Considered to be the first detective mystery, The Moonstone by Wilkie Collins offers a glimpse into the times it was written--the 1860s. It was published serially, with new pieces of the story unfolding one section at a time for around six months. It reveals the understandings held about English ladies and gentleman, especially the thought that no well brought up young man or woman could ever commit a crime. It touches on a common occurrence at the time, the looting of jewels by English soldiers from temples in India. And, it's fun to read once you get into the rhythm of Collins's writing style (writers at the time were paid by the word, so you won't find sparse descriptions and conversations here).Each narrator brought a different perspective and style that was refreshing, and each break kept the story moving in unexpected ways. My daughter and I both found it fun to guess what had happened the night of the theft and in the days following it. My guesses were invariably wrong, but that didn't stop me from developing new theories as the story progressed. My daughter's guess about the culprit was right, although neither of us anticipated some of the twists and turns The Moonstone took before the mystery was actually resolved.The Moonstone is longer reading for mother-daughter book clubs, but it is easily divided into two separate sections that can be discussed at two different meetings. Groups could read The Loss of the Diamond, then gather to discuss their theories about what happened. They could also write predictions down and compare them to what actually happened during the rest of the book when they meet again. I recommend The Moonstone for reading groups with girls aged 14 and up."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I purchased this novel based on other Amazon reviews and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Praised by authors such as Borges, but unfortunately underknown today (it is a mystery to me why there has not been a major movie version of this novel), the plot concerns a large indian diamond, the titular Moonstone, stolen years ago by a corrupt british officer, which in turn is stolen from a young woman called Rachel Verinder on her eighteenth birthday. The book is written on epistolary form - actually, each chapter is narrated by a different character, who often view the same events in a different light. The book includes several features that would later become staples of the genre, like red herrings, a large number of suspects, a bumbling detective, a subplot concerning opium usage, but here, they seem fresh. Add to that, a number of memorable characters, including sergeant Cuff, a clear predecessor to Sherlock Holmes, and you have a memorable book (if a bit on the long side)."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"In many ways this is a brilliant work. It's difficult to review now since our tastes have changed and since part of its value was in its originality -- which has been built upon by more modern authors. Thus, it is a true classic. One's valuation of it has much to do with whether one evaluates it in the context of the 19th century or the 21st. Collins subtly criticizes much of 19th century English society in his treatment of Ezra, Clack, Mrs. Merridew, etc. Even Betteredge's reliance on \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" seems to reflect on Victorian religious mores (i.e. perhaps (?) an allusion to the Bible). Differences in social mores today can be seen in both Rachel's & Rosanna's coverups etc. The basic structure of the book--a series of eyewitness accounts reminds one of certain TV shows & the normal operation of our police or CSIs--where evidence is uncovered bit by bit though interviews & re-interviews. Today's mysteries rely on yesterday's just as today's sitcoms rely on Shakespeare's comedies. Collins appears to succeed overall in well-defining his characters and their styles along with their assumptions, prejudices, etc. However, as Collins states in his Author's Preface, \\"The attempt made here, is to trace the influence of character on circumstances\\" vs. its opposite per most other novels. This is a lengthy & enjoyable (though at times a bit tedious & wordy) novel--not really escape fiction as with many of the pseudo mysteries of today (more suspense story than legitimate mystery with clues etc. that are fair to the reader). Its values are much deeper.

It was written in the latter half of the nineteenth century. There was no television, no radio, no electric light, no Internet, no telephone. The most common forms of personal entertainment took place in the home, and the personal library, for those who could afford one, were common. The writing form of the time was designed to address this lifestyle. It was leisurely and pleasant.One might curl up in a blanket before a blazing hearth with a candlabra sporting a dozen candles for light and a novel. Dickens, Scott, Thackeray, Dumas? All delivered a pictorial style of writing where the reader filled in the images. To this list of familiar authors, then, add the name of Wilkie Collins a friend and sometime travelling companion of Dickens. Credited by some as the creator of the English language mystery novel, and police detective character in The Moonstone, Collins has a writing style that almost needs to be learned by the 21st century reader.The opening section of over 200 pages appears to be ponderous and wandering as the butler, Gabriel Bettridge sets the scene for the story. In doing so, however, Collins also establishes the first person narrative style that makes the novel work exceptionally well. Other reviewers here have filled in aspects of the story as a whole and I will refrain from repeating what they have said. The end note of the edition I own states that Collins is said to have written much of the book under the influence of opium, and perhaps that is why he was able to keep each character so true to life and with such a clearly defined and distinct \\"voice\\". Regardless, he succeeds in presenting a thoroughly entertaining tale, which must, ultimately, be read as though one were living in the late nineteenth century, devoid of twenty-first century \\"conveniences\\".Then one can comprehend why it is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"\\"The Moonstone\\" is a masterpiece. Originally published serially in Charles Dickens' monthly journal \\"All the Year Round,\\" it is widely regarded as the first of its genre: the detective story. While a contemporary of Dickens, Collins' writing style is more accessible, in my opinion, to the general reader. In fact, its initial publication in \\"All the Year Round\\" outsold Dickens' own \\"Tale of Two Cities\\" and \\"Great Expectations.\\"Collins' characters are unforgettable, especially the tragic Ezra Jennings, the silly, hypocritical Miss Clack, and the sad Rosanna Spearman.Throughout the book, the hint of things occultish makes this very unlike most other novels of the period and hightens the feeling of danger and mystery.This book is entirely delightful. Don't miss an oppotunity to discover \\"The Moonstone.\\""},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Where do I start? This book kept me up at night. I couldn't wait to find out the answers to all the questions.Some reviewers have mentioned the book's slow pace in places. There are a few slow spots, but there are far more parts where you can't stop reading.To be fair, it took me two tries to read this book. The first time I was reading it on my iTouch, which is not a good medium for a long, drawn-out book like this. I soon lost the sense of it about halfway. Once I got a Kindle though, I started again, and ripped right through it.People have mentioned that this is the first detective novel. That honor might go to Edgar Allan Poe's story The Murders in the Rue Morgue, but this book really is the great-grandaddy of them all. The idea of a stolen gem from an Indian idol started with this book. That alone makes it worth reading.People have said that The Woman in White is a better book. I disagree; they are both great books. Collins' device of different narratives works well in both.In fact, this book and its plot are so good, I had accidentally heard a spoiler (some bonehead podcaster I listened to assumed that everyone had read the book and mentioned how the Moonstone came to be stolen), but still enjoyed it (I didn't know exactly who did the deed). There is a part towards the end where you feel like you are playing the game Clue; since I got it right, I assume most readers will also.Those of you who enjoyed this book should read The Quincunx by Charles Palliser, Michael Cox's two books, and Drood by Dan Simmons. In Drood, Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins are the main characters, and there are many insights into The Moonstone, The Woman in White, Bleak House, and other works by them."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"The Moonstone is a classic, and although is a great mystery, the writing is most creative. The story is told as though one of the characters decided to write about the events over the past year. To help him, he asks other characters to take up a chapter from their own point of view. Therefore the story is \\"written\\" by several authors - all characters in the story. Because of the various writers, the style of writing changes to reflect the characters' personalities. This is a very creative method of defining each character and gives a better perspective of the events of the mystery."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Other reviewers have noted two things which I will put briefly here: this book is extremely well-written and has unforgettable characters. More than that, the story is intriguing --- even enthralling.My personal favorite is the old man who opens the story with a magnificent 200-page portrait of everyone involved. Miss Clack is also memorable, and I am sure Wilkie Collins enjoyed every minute of skewering her through first-person narrative --- an endlessly hypocritical and pious spinster, who is also the \\"poor relation\\" of the family which the novel is about. It is especially delicious to witness Miss Clack telling off the heroine, Rachel --- who is an honest, beautiful young woman worth ten of Miss Clack. Miss Clack denounces Rachel (and everyone) as \\"heathen\\" and \\"pagan.\\"Of course, this only scratches the surface. I haven't even mentioned Sergeant Cuff --- a memorable, honest, and intelligent character who has been the background model for many subsequent fictional detectives, including Sherlock Holmes.The only warning I have is this: if you have the Modern Library edition, you would be well-advised to skip the \\"learned\\" introduction by Carolyn Heilbrun, a tendentious and tedious piece worthy of Miss Clack herself."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Would it interest readers to know that at the time that William Wilkie Collins was writing THE MOONSTONE in 1858, he was cheating on Mrs. Caroline Graves, his lover? That same year he left her, and had the first of his three children with Martha Rudd, a woman he never married. Two years later, he carried on a relationship with both women! No wonder he drew the unlikable Miss Clack, the Christian evangelist, so severely. Miss Clack wouldn't have at all approved.And why did Collins write the character of the opium-addicted physician's assistant, Ezra Jennings, so sympathetically? Perhaps because Collins was experimenting with opium at the time of its writing, but hadn't yet become the delusional addict he would become later in life. Sinning always seems fun...for a season.You and I both know that TS Eliot, who loved THE MOONSTONE, wouldn't approve of my type of critique. He decried critics who look outside of the text. But so what?Tabloid-style criticism will in no way detract from the excellence of this book, even if Collins was the typical intellectual who didn't think he had to play by the rules. Collins knows how to tell a story, and to keep the reader interested. And he mastered the first person narration by strictly telling us, in several distinct voices, only what each character sees and knows, which makes for some great red herrings.Did I also mention that Collins was a best selling author and that THE MOONSTONE was the last of his successes? Who says bestsellers can't stand the test of time?"},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Wilkie Collins is best remembered for two books: &quot;The Moonstone&quot; and &quot;The Woman in White&quot;. Both of them are great achievements in the mystery field. The narration style is unique and the plot is well developed around the tale of the diamond. Keeps you right on the edge until the very end. It is strongly recommended."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"The Moonstone is one of those books that, while the first in a particular genre, still holds fast over time. Masterfully written, its themes are surprisingly contemporary more often than not--the use of opiates to delve into the unconscious, the moral arguments about stealing relics from imperial colonies. The twists and turns are stunning, but they're used to a greater aim: to map the contours of human interaction. The intro in this edition is particularly well written as well."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"An excellent suspense novel that will keep you turning the pages. As one expects with a Wilke Collins novel, the characters are fully developed, the plots are intertwined, and the outcome remains a surprise. Truly a master of the genre! You'll enjoy every word."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"THE MOONSTONE is Collins's most compulsively readable and pleasurable novel. It was phenomenally popular, and it boosted the circulation of ALL THE YEAR ROUND. It is also his most conceptually complex work. As a prototypical detective novel, THE MOONSTONE has attracted a host of psychoanalitic readings, which have stressed the novel's cognitive ambiguity - the way that it continually asserts and undermines the sources of its own coherence, most notably by breaking down the boundary between \\"objective\\" and \\"subjective\\" reality, so that it becomes a palimpsest of overt and covert meanings. As a study in ambiguity itself, the novel becomes Collins's most ambitious exploration of social and psychic identity.Mid-nineteenth-century debates about consciousness signalled the tenousness of a knowable subjectivity fixed through clear disruptive boundaries in the very drive to establish that subjectivity. THE MOONSTONE continually exploits the tenousness of these boundaries by juggling with these distinct hypotheses, and it is this that shapes its possible subversive ideological meanings. The undermining of the boundaries betwen homely and uncanny, inside and outside, normal and deviant, are homologous wiht the function of the boundaries between the \\"rational\\" and \\"occult\\" on the one hand, between \\"Englishness\\" and \\"foreigness\\" on the other, a process which culminates, through metaphoric transference and analogy, in a direct correspondence between the social construction of psychic marginality, adn the process whereby colonial \\"otherness! works as the projection of \\"English\\" fascination and fears.THE MOONSTONE is a novel about remembering, but it also is a novel about forgetting, about what is intractable, about silence, suppression and concealment. This is a basic precondition of the story: there would have been no mystery if Rachel had not suppressed her knowledge of the theft. The pleasure of the \\"discovery of the truth\\" thus depends on the interplay between conscious and unconscious forms of resistance involved in the \\"loss of the diamond\\".The Prologue tells the story of the Verinder's family guilty past of colonial expropriation. Yet the history of the diamond remains \\"unconscious\\". The novel is concerned with the journey from the darkness to the light. The reader, like the sceptical observers Bruff and Betteredge, is drawn into the \\"secret theatre\\" of the action. The mainstream physiologist William B. Carpenter had claimed in 1847, following Pritchard and anticipating Maudsley, that individuals could not be held responsible for actions that they had performed reflexively, or automatically: \\"Nor can we say a human action is wrong... when it directly results from a powerful impulse which he has no power to restrain.\\" (\\"Dr Mayo on the relations of crime, insanity and punishment.\\") Opium provides the explicit means of inducing a trance-like state in which \\"volitional activity\\" is suspended, and Ezra Jennings operates as Blake's \\"unconscious\\", the site of Blake's painful intractable memories.The function of the diamond in the novel resists any clear distinction between its metaphoric and metonymic meanings. It operates as the signifier of the meanings that are projected onto it. It is thus that the diamond itself represents the workings of the \\"hidden soul\\". As such, it is set against that other image of the magnetic yellow deeps - the Shivering Sand.Blake remains healthy because he continually becomes dissociated from the past or any fixed identity. He is a palimpsest of national identities, yet this is not ultimately incompatible with his Englishness."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This is a book worth reading many times. I pick it up every couple of years and enjoy it more and more every time. Collins mocks and sympathizes with his characters at the same time. The mystery is fun. The plot is a bit slow. The characters make the book well worth the time. They are like old friends with all of the forgivable faults and quirks that mark the best of friends."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Much can be said for Wilkie Collins's &quot;The Moonstone&quot;. The setting is drawn with a fine hand, and the characters are endearing from the outset. It also begins with a compelling setup which holds the reader's interest and curiousity. The combination of British conventionality in the 1800's--so delightful to read about now that it is safely far away--and the looming spectre of an Asian curse are irrestistible ingredients which seem to bode well for the coming tale.Much of the writing is satiric, sometimes falling away into almost slapstick humor, which detracts from any deadly seriousness. Examples of this range from the outspoken sententiousness of Miss Clack to the &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;-thumping tendencies of Betteredge. These elements add color and life to what would otherwise be a ponderous text.Unfortunately, &quot;ponderous&quot; sums up &quot;The Moonstone&quot; pretty well. There really is no reason for it to be so long, and most of this length is filled with conversations and descriptions which are simply extraneous and even dull. This becomes painfully clear by the end, when it turns out that the solution to the mystery of the stolen Moonstone is absurdly simple. It is a disappointingly deus ex machina conclusion which rendered all the buildup unnecessary. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has had similar endings to his stories in the past, but those stories were less than a tenth of the length of this novel. As a short story, &quot;The Moonstone&quot; would probably have fared much better.It is also unfortunate that the most important characters in the story, namely Rachel Verinder and Franklin Blake, are some of the least developed in comparison to others. Rachel is likable, and as an 18th century female character, as strong as any feminist could wish, but she remains at a distance from the reader and it is hard to care about her. Franklin Blake is also likable, but mostly flat. Ironically it is Godfrey Ablewhite, who appears simplistic in the beginning, who displays more dimensions of personality.As far as execution is concerned, &quot;The Woman in White&quot; is far superior to this novel, and highly recommended to anyone interested in a suspenseful Gothic-style thriller. &quot;The Moonstone&quot; makes for a pleasant read, but with so many good books out there, should be reserved for a rainy day."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I was not able to get into this book at all- I found the writing old fashioned and it often required a translation in my head to figure out what was said. It starts out with a nice mystery but then twists into something even Sherlock Holmes couldn't figure out because of details left out that no one could have guessed the twists and turns of the book. I value it because it is one of the first dective books written that spawned many more writings, writings that were better in my opinon."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I read the first few chapters and didn't care for this book at all. The wording was not something I cared for. I took a chance for $.99!"},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"loved this book! page turner, have read it twice now. a different way to tell the story, having the characters interviewed..."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"The Moonstone was an awesome book. I really like mysteries and this one was especially good because it came from the point of view of so many of the characters involved. It let you see everyone's personality from different perspectives so that you could judge which character had the mind of a criminal. My favorite character was probably Gabriel Betteredge because he was really quirky. His devotion to Robinson Crusoe and distrust of anyone who would not believe in it were amusing. He was the most informative narrator with respect to the time period. I learned the most about the treatment of women and servants during the mid-1800s from his portion of the novel. I think Rosanna Spearman's irrational conduct where Mr. Franklin was concerned was a bit beyond belief. I doubt that any servant would expect attention from a man from the upper-class society or that she would have gone to the lengths she did when her feelings weren't reciprocated from a man she had known such a very short while. I didn't like the part narrated by Miss Clack as much as I liked the rest of the book because her evangelical attitude kept getting in the way of the plot. It may be normal or slightly humorous to other readers, but it really annoyed me. I didn't particularly like Rachel Verinder because she never should have agreed to marry Mr. Ablewhite while in love with another man. At first, when Mr. Jennings experiment was introduced, I felt like it was all nonsense, but I didn't mind the scene too much because the improbable experiment didn't reveal the whereabouts of the diamond and the plot continued despite the interruption of Mr. Jenning's test. I wish Wilkie Collins had cleared up the mystery of Ezra Jennings' past. I would have liked the book better had we learned who the person he had saved his money for was and possibly what the crime he was never absolved of could have been. I liked the final solution to the disappearance of the moonstone, but I think it could have been more creative. I think the best mysteries are the ones in which the criminal is above suspicion until the very moment the author reveals the truth to his reader."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"The Moonstone is the first detective novel (not to be confused with Poe's first detective short story) and for that reason, it's interesting to read. But that's really the only reason. By today's standards, it's slow moving almost to the point of being boring, and the denouement wasn't (IMO) worth the effort. Gotta say though, the price was right!"},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Another one of Collin's masterpiece's. As good and as fast moving as The Woman in White.

Not everybody might agree with this, but all practitioners, readers, and fans of detective fiction will find much to admire and enjoy in this magnificent 1868 publication.Although not exactly the first example of detection novels, it provides the archetypal sleuth, Sergeant Cuff, an astute though idiosyncratic detective who leads the chase to the solution of the mystery, easily surpassing the dim-witted local police authorities. It also explores the full potential of the whodunit formula.Arguably, it is still the longest example of detective fiction. Unlike most other serialized novels of its era, this one is meticulously plotted. You'll find red herrings, suspense, the unexpected, climaxes that overwhelm or fizzle out, and a satisfying denouement. It is narrated largely by some of the principal characters. All are revealed in well-rounded perspective while carrying forward the story line. The most popular has always been Drusilla Clack, \\"that rampant spinster\\", a self-righteous tract-dispensing lady who likes to eavesdrop and to be judgmental.Is it the best? I would unhesitatingly award it the prize, while welcoming other internet browsers to name other contenders.Wealthy internet browsers are recommended to download the unabridged audio reading of the book. It is a novel that reads well, and the full length reading available is a model of its kind. Naxos has produced an abridged version. It has the benefit of multiple readers, but most of the charm and all the atmosphere seems to disappear in the abridgment process. Book format will put you in touch with the original text and, provided you have the leisure and disposition for tackling a 20 hour read, will provide your imagination, your mind and your literary appetite with rich material."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I think this book is the father of modern detective novels. It is easy tosee where Sherlock Holmes and Watson came from."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This was a good read. I liked the plot, the historical background and the characters were well developed. This is a well written book."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This a wonderful, engaging British mystery. It deals with the Moonstone, a valuable Indian diamond. The diamond is originally stolen from an Indian shrine by a British soldier, and later, it is stolen. The story is related by a great cast of characters, a hilarious house steward named Gabriel Betteredge, the detective, Sergeant Cuff, a lovesick housemaid, and a strange band of Indian jugglers. It was really great that the author included these different narrators; it gave different perspectives on the mystery. Published in the late 19th century, it does have some elements of that period of writing; in other words, unlike some mysteries, you won't speed through it. Once you get interested though, you will be eager to discover what happens. Also, just when you think the mystery is about to be solved, something unexpected happens. The only real criticism I have of The Moonstone is that at time it drags on a bit too much. Oh, and the edition that I was reading had the most boring cover ever. I would never have read it had it not been for a review on another blog. If you're a fan of mystery, you should definitely read this book- according to the back cover, it inspired the hugely popular genre of the detective mystery. I don't know if that claim is true, but it certainly was a great, exciting book to read.*You can read all of my reviews at my book review blog, [...]*"},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book while recovering from my surgery. It was a quick read even though not a short book. All of the characters in the book were interesting."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"The Moonstone, a huge yellow diamond purloined from an Indian religious statue, finds its way as an inheritance in this mid-19th century mystery set in England, largely in an estate home. Ostensibly cursed, the diamond disappears the night it is given to Rachel Verinder. Who took it? And why? These are the questions of the story. Narrated first-hand by a number of different characters, mostly in chronological order, the tellers' variety and depth vividly reveal Collins' skills with characters. The narrators are very believable, including the obnoxious one, and their observations of the other characters are insightful and within their roles. It meshes wonderfully, if slowly, compared to modern whodunits. This reader docked it a half star because of the setting-appropriate class and chauvinistic issues. The narrator who speaks the longest, Betteredge, is a septuagenarian head of the staff overseeing the manor's servants. He contrasts well with the other men, the famed London detective called in, the house guest philanthropist and the family member who is responsible for the delivery of the stone to Rachel. The attorney and various other lesser characters including the boy and doctor introduced late in the story and the women, the matriarch and Rachel, the religious zealot cousin who does some narrating, the possible suspect brought into the house as help after serving jail time and rehabilitating in a convent, and the relatively few other women are, like the men, fleshed out well. There's some romance, some duplicity, some ulterior motives, loyalties which may or may not be misguided, and the enjoyable aspects of any book examining lives. If the modest pace is worth the wonderful characters and well-created mystery for you as they were for me, you, too, will reap the pleasures of Collins' fine ways with words."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This is one of those classics that I put off reading for years, and years, and years. Finally got around to reading it last month. Slow going at first, but after getting a \\"feel\\" for the characters and the writing style of Wilkie Collins, I became hooked. It's long, at 500-plus pages, but I found it thoroughly enjoyable. Lots of suspense, a colorful cast of characters, and a very delightful --- and occasionally wicked --- sense of humor on the part of the author. For something written in the 1860s, this novel has remarkable staying power. The methodical pace and multiple narratives will certainly be jarring for anyone raised on the current crop of contemporary thrillers, but if you enjoy a good mystery with plenty of fascinating characters, you should not miss this one."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This is definitely a classic story. If you have read other classics you'll see many similarities between Collin's writings and later authors like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and even Bram Stoker. The author makes the characters very familiar to you in his method of passing the story to different characters. This does make the story move a little slow at times and the story lingered a little longer than I believe it should have. This story is written in the style of many of the great authors of that general period. If you like the stories by great authors like Dickens, Dostoevsky and Hugo, you will comfortable with the author's writing and you should appreciate how far ahead of his times he was regarding detective stories."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Good book-- well written. Think I would have enjoyed it more had I not read The Lady in White first."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"\\"The Moonstone,\\" frequently cited as the first detective novel in English, catches up its characters and its readers in \\"detective-fever.\\" British troops steal the Moonstone, an enormous yellow diamond, from a religious statue in India in 1799 and bring it back to England as spoils of war, where it is acquired by John Herncastle. The diamond is believed to carry a curse. Herncastle's will leaves the diamond to his niece, Rachel Verinder, to be given to her on her 18th birthday, as revenge for Herncastle's family having disowned him. In 1848, family members and friends gather at the Yorkshire country estate of the Verinders to celebrate Rachel's birthday. Rachel's cousin, Franklin Blake, who is in love with Rachel, has been given responsibility for delivering the Moonstone safely to Rachel. Everyone is anxious about having the valuable jewel in the house instead of locked up in a banker's vault. Sometime between the night of the birthday party and the next morning, the Moonstone disappears from Rachel's room.Who stole the Moonstone? Was it the Indian jugglers in the neighborhood who are suspected to be disguised Brahmin priests who will stop at nothing to restore the diamond to its rightful place in India? Was it Rosanna Spearman, a supposedly reformed thief working as a maid at the Verinder estate? Was it one of the party guests? Was it Rachel herself? We discover the truth through a series of narratives by different characters, the most memorable of whom are the Verinder family butler and \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" devotee Gabriel Betteredge, the hilariously pious poor relation Miss Clack, lovesick Franklin Blake, and the outcast biracial Yorkshire doctor's assistant Ezra Jennings.Although I'm not usually fond of mysteries, \\"The Moonstone\\" is among my all-time favorites, and Wilkie Collins is perhaps the most under-appreciated author of the mid-19th century. His \\"sensation novels,\\" as they were called in their day, are far-fetched and \\"The Moonstone\\" is no exception. However, readers willing to try something different and be a little patient with Victorian writing will delight in the humor, plotting, pacing and characterization found in Collins' best work. He held remarkably forward-thinking attitudes about women, people of color and colonialism for his day. He loves to poke fun at, or offer stinging critiques of, conventional piety. His female characters are stronger, more complex and more interesting than those of his friend, mentor and contemporary, Charles Dickens. Although he can indulge in verbal padding, a common flaw of 19th century fiction published serially in popular magazines, Dickens is far the worse offender on that score. Compared to most Dickens (the brilliant \\"Great Expectations\\" excepted), Collins' work moves along as quickly as your favorite airport lounge bestseller.Even if you think you only like contemporary books, give \\"The Moonstone\\" a try. You'll be surprised at how modern it seems compared to most 19th century fiction. Spending time with the memorable characters as they solve the mystery of the Moonstone's disappearance is wonderful fun."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Loved the way the story moved along through various characters reporting the events as they saw them through their own eyes."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"First off, I think I should let anyone reading this review know that I am a high school student. But I don't believe that this fact impacted the way that I felt about the book. I have always been a fan of mystery novels and this one was definately one of the best of its genre. The book follows a huge, yellow diamond stolen by a British officer from an Indian sultan's treasury. 50 years later, the officer leaves the gem to his neice, Rachel Verinder, upon his death. The gem is then stolen from Miss Verinder on the same night she receieves it. The story follows the search for the truth of the missing stone. But the best part about the novel is that it is told in first person narritive, by several individuals who played important roles in the story. Wilkie Collins does a masterful job at pulling off this writting technique by giving each of the narrators their own character, from which they portray the story as they perceived it to have happened. Each narrator provided deep insight into the other characters; some of whom are described from several different and sometimes intentionally conflicting perspectives. The trouble, for a reader, with trying to solve an average mystery novel is that you can be influenced by the narrator's views. Wilkie Collins allows the reader to see the events and characters through the eyes of different narrators, giving the reader many perspectives to look at and allowing the reader to decide for themselves what is really happening and who people really are. One of the complaints about Collins' novel is that he is at times long winded, but I found the story simply to be incredibly detailed, enjoyable, and beautifully written. Collins' also provides an accurate portrayal of the opinions of the Victorians during the imperialist age. Overall, I would reccomend this novel to anyone who enjoys a good mystery, especially one wiht a twist due to the unusual style of narration."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"THE MOONSTONE opens with the theft of a fabulous jewel from an idol in India. From this exotic location the action then goes forward in time many years to the English countryside. The jewel, the Moonstone, has become a family heirloom soon to be presented to a young woman as a birthday present. That very evening the Moonstone disappeared leaving behind suspicion and tragedy. A professional detective is called in but before all is revealed there will be deaths and long hidden secrets brought to light.The story was originally published in the mid 1800's which can cause a problem for a modern reader. The style of writing is much more verbose than contemporary readers are accustomed to, the vocabulary is often unfamiliar but perhaps most difficult for the modern reader are the conventions of mid Victorian society. The class distinctions and the restrictions placed on women, particularly young, unmarried women are completely foreign to the 21st century.Despite these challenges THE MOONSTONE is an excellent story on its own merits. The characters are interesting and believeable. The plot is well thought out, full of twists and turns that will keep the reader guessing until the very end. For fans of detective fiction it is interesting to see the various elements of this story and recognize them from their more modern forms.THE MOONSTONE has been called the first detective novel. It introduced many of the characteristics familiar to fans of this genre, the outsider, professional detective, the bumbling, incompetant local police, the clueless sidekick, the red herring clues that lead the reader astray and the premise that all clues must be available for the reader to solve the crime. In that regard THE MOONSTONE has its own unique place in history no matter what the quality of the story itself might be."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This is the original murder mystery novel. It predates other mystery/crime giants such as Agatha Chrisite and Dorothy Sayers. I can understand that for someone used to today's style of writing, this book may seem a bit old fashioned, but it pays to remember that it was written in the late 1800s and is one of the reasons why this genre of novels is so popular today. I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to all murder mystery fans."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I have to admit that until I did a mystery search, I hadn't even heard of Wilkie Collins. Wilkie Collins name came up, along with a description of The Moonstone as being \\"the best of modern English detective novels\\" (as quoted by T.S.Eliot). Big words, indeed. With those lofty expectations, I read The Moonstone, and have to say that this mystery definitely delivered. It lived up to those words.One of the finer aspects of Collins work is his creation of mood and suspense in the story. There is a feeling of expectation and suspense from the beginning, when the moonstone is stolen, to the case of trying to find out who stole it, to the unmasking of events, people and circumstances at the end. There is a marvelous ability to create narrative point of view from the many narratives told from the various characters. And there are many--eleven different narratives--in total. From Gabriel Betteredge to Franklin Blake to Sergeant Cuff to Miss Clack and other minor characters, Collins is able to change narrative persona and \\"become\\" that person. There is a good deal of intrigue from so many voices, because, quite frankly, you do not know if you can take what the person is saying at face value. In this way, the human element of perspective is amazingly effective in telling this mystery.There are other elements that make this a worthy mystery. Namely, you have a diverse number of characters, who have their various motives. Throw in a love affair, a tragic character, and an exotic jewel with a curse put on it, and you have quite a remarkable suspense. I have to say that I was hooked.As far as my own personal interests, I found Sergeant Cuff to be my favorite character. Surely, he's no Sherlock Holmes, but there is a way he goes about trying to solve the mystery that I found refreshing. He's no average sleuth. One of my favorite scenes was the \\"experiment\\" performed by Ezra Jennings in relation to the events leading up to the disappearance of the moonstone.There is also a little comic relief thrown in from time to time in the person of Gabriel Betteredge, who believes that life's answers and secret are all contained in Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe.The Moonstone is an engaging work, highly detailed, and maybe a little implausible, but Collin's overcomes this. I'm glad I found this one, and I've also heard good things about The Woman in White, another Collins mystery. Definitely worth a read!"},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"The Moonstone is a slow-paced detective novel written in the 19th century in London, England. The Moonstone was first obtained by Colonel Herncastle who bequeaths it to his niece Miss Rachel on her sixteenth birthday. She is thrilled with her gift and sets the gem in her bedside table that night. When she awakens the next morning, the moonstone is nowhere to be found. The loss of the moonstone is told by Mr. Betteredge, a servant in Miss Rachel's house. Mr. Betteredge offers an outside opinion, as he is not directly involved in the mystery, but sees all that goes on. The rest of the book is split up into different narratives from various characters of the book. Each character's narrative is able to give the reader more pieces to the puzzle. Wilkie Collins wrote this book so well that the characters stand on their own during their narratives. Their personalities surface and are not supported by one another. This was very helpful in keeping the characters straight due to the detail and character that Collins gave them. I really liked this part of the book because all the clues to the mystery weren't given to the reader on a silver platter. Every character in the book had a separate identity. They had more purpose than just happening to be involved in the mystery.The Moonstone is also unpredictable. Collins will lead the reader to believe and act on other facts before turning the evidence completely around and ending up with a conclusion that throws the reader for a loop. I appreciated this because it kept me reading. I found out who stole the moonstone along with the characters. It was refreshing not to know the answer and having to wait for the other characters to figure it out. I also found the little subplots that were created during the story. They showed the interactions of the characters and helped to explain the personalities of the characters even more. The only problem that I found with The Moonstone is that Collins has a lot of patience. He is content to examine every detail before moving on with the next piece to the puzzle. He also encourages his characters to wait with the solving of the mystery. It is almost exasperating to be so close in solving the mystery that only one character must be interviewed. Almost always, the character will be indisposed or out-of-town. It was a little frustrating to have to wait for the characters to return and having to read about what they had for dinner in the meantime. On a positive note, reading The Moonstone was like watching a movie. However, instead of watching the characters eat, the reader reads about it. This still only adds to the detail of the book and makes you appreciate Collins work on making sure that every element of the story is attended to. All in all, The Moonstone was a great novel, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good puzzle to solve."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Just finished The Moonstone not five minuets ago. I am still reeling from the effect of its greatness! Really, how can anybody consider this novel tedious is beyond me, this is riveting stuff! What raises this novel above the level of all the other detective novels I have read, is the characterization. Wilkie Collins created a fascinating class of characters here. Usually in a detective novel the most interesting character is The Great Detective himself, in this role Mr. Collins gave us Sergeant Cuff, who reminds me a little of Inspector Poirot, but the novel does not revolve around him, it revolves around the Moonstone, and the events as seen from the point of view of several characters. Gabriel Betteredge, the sweet, quixotic house-steward being a particular favorite. The plot is complex and mystifying, the pacing is just right, the language is elegant and not at all difficult to read. If you have never read a classic before and would like to be able to boast of at least one title I'd say this is the one. You will have a ripping good time reading it too!"},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I have to say that I'm not usually one for detective stories.

I did suspect the criminal, as I suspected everyone else in turn. And it was so superbly written, I had it read in one night. You don't have to be a fan of detective novels to read this. I highly recommend it and I hope to find some more of Collins' works in Germany.

After the death of its owner, the Moonstone is only reluctantly passed on to the niece of the deceased: one Rachel Verinder. Less than a day after she receives the gem, it suddenly goes missing.Collins' use of prose is marvelous, and his style of incorporating suspense at every turn influenced the writings of his dear friend, Charles Dickens. The story was originally serialized, partly during a period of intense physical and emotional pain for the author. There are glimmers of this, in the narratives of both Miss Clack and Ezra Jennings, two of the more entertaining and riveting (respectively) segments of the novel.The story is only barred from a full five stars due to the mild loss of empathy/sympathy for two of the characters by mid-story, and the lack of pungency in the narratives of Franklin Blake, a critical section. That said, the story keeps you engaged from the very beginning, and it will be difficult to put the book down until you find out that thief was in fact...my apologies; let me excuse myself, before I go too far."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I have read my share of mysteries but I can honestly say that this mystery is superior to any I have read because it offers superb insights into the human condition through interesting, vivid characters.The plot is tightly woven (throughout the 500+ pages of this volume) and the pieces of the mystery fall together most oconvincingly. Having read this, I imagine that other mystery greats (Christie for one) learned a thing or two about pacing and the psychological make-up of a crime.More than that, what I love about this book is the characters- especially Gilbert Betteridge, who is a funny, quirky first narrator and the detective who loves roses above crime. Collins' book also struck me in that he writes female characters who are multi-dimensional and interesting, as opposed to some other Victorian authors of his day. This is fantastic! I recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery but and also wants to understand human nature and read a well-written novel."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"My review is about the Penguin edition, not the novel, which is fantastic. In order to save space, Penguin editions are printed with type size so tiny that it is unnecessarily difficult to read to read the novels.

The Oxford editions are priced just as inexpensively as are the Penguins but have far more pages and a normal, very readable type size.The Moonstone (Oxford World's Classics)I will now order the Oxford edition of The Moonstone; ditto for the Oxford edition of any other work of literature in future.

It really leaves you guessing who, what, where, when, and most of all how. It kept my eyes glued to the page and without a doubt is one of the best mysteries ever written."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Like his earlier novel \\"The Woman in White,\\" Wilkie Collins's \\"The Moonstone\\" is a prototype of the modern mystery: A crime occurs, it is investigated, witnesses are interrogated and give their points of view, there is a reenactment, and it all comes together in a tightly knit conclusion. Collins's mastery of his material is so evident that it's difficult to argue with T.S. Eliot's opinion that this is the greatest of English detective novels.The mystery concerns a sacred diamond called the Moonstone which had been stolen from a Hindu temple in India centuries prior to the novel's events and made its way from owner to owner until it finally came into the possession of a British military officer who bequeaths it to his niece, Rachel Verinder... The diamond is delivered to Rachel on her eighteenth birthday by her cousin and suitor, Franklin Blake, at a party attended by several of Rachel's family members; but the next morning, it is discovered missing from her boudoir.Theft is suspected, and the suspects are numerous: Besides a number of servants, including Rosanna Spearman, an abject, deformed housemaid who is enamored with Blake, Blake and Rachel herself can't be ruled out, nor can their cousin (and Blake's romantic rival) Godfrey Ablewhite, a comely young man whose charitable works belie his lecherous lifestyle. Also present in the novel as a constant reminder that the Moonstone's ties to India are not so easily severed, are three Brahmin priests who are slyly tracking the diamond's passage throughout England using disguises and subterfuge, waiting for the right moment to retrieve it and restore it to its holy place.As in \\"The Woman in White,\\" Collins uses multiple narratives to relate the events and effectively introduce a bevy of colorful characters and some surprisingly wry humor. We hear from Gabriel Betteredge, head servant of the Verinder household, whose personal bible is \\"Robinson Crusoe\\"; the sanctimonious Miss Clack, who dispenses religious tracts like a cow gives milk; Sergeant Cuff, the reputable, meticulous police detective with a green thumb that might have been a model for future sleuths with personality quirks; and Ezra Jennings, an assistant physician with a topical and curiously valid theory about the possible role of opium in the crime.Comparing this novel with \\"The Woman in White,\\" I feel that \\"The Moonstone\\" has a more satisfying ending, but its predecessor has a more interesting setup and premise. Although Collins's plots are undeniably clever and tricky (I now dub him the King of Red Herrings), these two novels are pervaded with a certain gentility that deprives them of the level of menace one finds in the grittier American noir detective fiction that I prefer. This is more of an observation than a criticism, however. A mystery writer who could successfully combine Collins's prose with Raymond Chandler's style would elevate the genre to its artistic pinnacle."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"What a great book! Not only is Wilkie Collins' masterpiece superbly written, it's also wonderfully fun to read. The characters are well developed; I felt like I really new them by the end of the book and could clearly picture them in my mind. Best of all, the mystery keeps you guessing throughout the story. In short, a very well written (and whitty) story that makes for extremely enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Apparently this is the first detective novel in the English language. This is a free edition.Easy to read, not as much action as I expected from the wild plot premise -- a cursed Indian diamond.Mostly it is of historical interest -- I did not find it gripping, and the humorous writing style is a little dated, but the prose is quite acceptable.A worthy addition to one's Kindle library, though not something I would read over and over again."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This book, the first detective novel written, is a great combination of the eloquence of the Victorian novel and the entertainment of a mystery novel. Collins' main characters of Gabriel Betteridge and Franklin Blake are immensely likeable and there's a good deal of humour here as well. The only complaint I have about the novel is that it's entirely anti-climactic. Most of the suspense comes near the middle of the novel and you'll spend a good portion of the latter part of the novel with a pretty solid idea of who the culprit is. Overall, though, a very good read."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This is the first detective novel of the English language, written in 1868, and pre-dating Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes by more than 20 years. It's an excellent mystery novel, and I found the writing to be surprisingly fresh. The book is laced with humor including some hilarious tongue-in-cheek observations about religion and high-society. Collins was a social liberal, portraying his female protagonist as strong-willed, and poking-fun at the dusty, hypocritical moralizing of less enlightened folks. It all still works more than 150 years after it was written.One thing that I found a little disappointing is that The Moonstone is not the sort of mystery that can be unraveled by the reader. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle peppered his stories of Sherlock Holmes with clues, thereby enabling the reader to match wits with the great detective. In contrast, Wilkie Collins appears to have preferred to surprise his readers with plot twists, revealing in drops and dribbles new information that could not be guessed. That makes this story less compelling than the stories of Sherlock Holmes, and I wonder if that's why it isn't as famous.Another thing that must be owned is that the book is quite long. One reason for this is that there is a lot of character-development that isn't relevant to the story, but is included only because it's amusing. That's a huge part of the charm of the book, but it does mean it sometimes gets bogged down within itself. Regardless, it's worth a read."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Wilkie Collins' \\"The Moonstone\\" is an excellent Victorian period romance wrapped around a surprisingly modern crime mystery, involving the theft of an ancient and supposedly cursed diamond from a closed English country house. Collins tells the story from the point of view of several of the principal characters, providing lots of clues and suspects toward the eventual resolution of the crime. His cast of original characters, his subtle social commentary, and some primitive forensics are an added bonus.\\"The Moonstone\\" opens with the theft of the diamond by a British soldier during a battle in India. The diamond is eventualy inherited by Miss Rachel Verinder on the ocassion of her 18th birthday, only to vanish under mysterious circumstances which undermine her intended engagement to Mr. Franklin Blake. Blake will have no choice but to solve the mystery if he is to salvage his relationship with Rachel.Blake will be assisted in his navigation of the twists and turns of the plot by Sergeant Cuff of the Metropolitan Police Force, a literary predecessor of Lt. Columbo if ever there was one. The pursuit of the clues will lead to some astonishing discoveries, and eventually to the key to the mystery.\\"The Moonstone\\" is very highly recommended to detective fiction fans with the patience to work through Collins' rather round-about way of getting to the truth of the mystery."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Wilkie Collins' \\"The Moonstone\\", first published in 1868 and set in 1848, will be instantly recognizable to fans of \\"CSI\\" and other television crime shows, as a fairly modern detective story, complete with a cursed diamond, a closed-house English mystery with many suspects, conspiracies, star-crossed lovers, and one or more dogged detectives.\\"The Moonstone\\" begins with the theft of a revered religious object, a large yellow diamond known as the Moonstone, from a temple in India. The diamond ends up, probably by foul means, in the hands of a British officer, who becomes an outcast from his own family for his suspected crime. When the officer leaves the Moonstone to his niece Rachel, through the good offices of his nephew Franklin Blake, a chain of events is triggered that will lead to the disappearence of the Moonstone, an unexpected death, one or more shattered romances, and a seemingly insoluble mystery.Collins cleverly tells the story from the point of view of several partcipants in the mystery. This plot device allows Collins to introduce a host of interesting characters, to engage with the strict social mores of Victorian England, and to manipulate several plot devices that extend the detection process to the very end of the novel. Readers used to the standard 200 page detective novel of the present day will just have to be patient; Collins takes his time getting to his destination.This reviewer advises readers to save Sandra Kemp's excellent introductory essay until after reading the novel itself; it contains a number of spoilers. \\"The Moonstone\\" itself is very highly recommended as an entertaining reading experience."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"(See Imacbeth08's review for a synopsis)A few days ago I reviewed The Woman in White (TWIW) giving it three stars, as I compared it -- fairly or unfairly -- to the novels of Wilkie Collins' contemporary and friend Charles Dickens. After reading The Moonstone, and giving it five stars, I think I was correct in my estimation of TWIW. In spite of the excellent plotting and some well-drawn characterizations, TWIW is intended as a sensation novel, just that and not much more.The Moonstone, on the other hand, is a many-layered delight: satire, social commentary, well-plotted mystery, wonderful humor (that is never over-the-top, as it is in TWIW), delicious characterizations -- and serialization ending points that are suspenseful without being obviously contrived.As in TWIW, the characters unfold the story in their own narrative, revealing their own individual personalities in the process, but this device of the author's was obvious in its contrivance in TWIW; in The Moonstone the device is far more subtle. The \\"skeleton\\" of the story is boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy marries girl -- just as in TWIW -- but this basic story line is fleshed out masterfully, with a plot that includes Hindus sworn to recover a diamond stolen from a religious statue, a villain successfully masquerading as a humanitarian, narrow escapes for the hero (and a narrow escape for the heroine, as well), and oodles of coincidences skillfully presented so that the reader's willing suspension of disbelief is not disturbed.This is a book to be savored. Do not rush through it to uncover the answers to the mysteries -- although the temptation is great -- but enjoy the author's skill in plotting and the vivid characters he has created. Keep reminding yourself that this book first came out in installments, and readers had to wait from the suspenseful end of one installment until the next installment appeared, possibly providing some explanations.I don't intend to re-read TWIW -- I know the plot, and though some characters are worth revisiting it isn't worth my time to plow through 600 plus pages to do so. I will, however, re-read The Moonstone, for the enjoyment I get from the author's skill."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"The Moonstone is dated. That's not surprising; it was written over a hundred years ago. But this is the father of all mystery novels, so there's no better place to start than here. A classic, and one every mystery fan should read."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"From the outset, Wilkie Collins's 1868 \\"sensation novel\\" keeps the reader entertained and engaged as a priceless yellow diamond, stolen from a Hindu religious statue of the Moon God in India in 1799, works its black magic and controls the action. Rachel Verinder, heir of Colonel John Herncastle, who murdered to obtain the jewel during the battle of Seringapatam, inherits this possibly cursed treasure on her eighteenth birthday in 1848, only to have it vanish before she can put it into the bank. Drawing on sensational details--three Indian \\"jugglers\\" who approach the house to perform a juggling act, the disappearance of the jewel from an Indian cabinet during the night, the certainty that the theft was an inside job, a housemaid with a criminal past, and a paint smudge on night clothing--Collins creates a haunting atmosphere and builds suspense.Telling the story is Gabriel Betteredge, the house steward, a man who has been asked to set down his recollections by Franklin Blake, who was present in the house at the time of the jewel's disappearance, and who is in love with Rachel Verinder. Betteredge is a delightful story-teller, providing details, humor, and suggestions about what happened with a conscientiousness that makes him a reliable narrator. As the story becomes more involved and the characters take on lives of their own, other narrators take up the story where Betteredge leaves off and provide new information.The second narrator, Miss Drusilla Clack, Rachel Verinder's cousin, is a \\"poor relation\\" who is also a religious fanatic, and her commentary and her behavior provide some of the funniest moments in Victorian literature. Collins's use of humor, in fact, is one of the ways in which he surpasses his friend, Charles Dickens, in keeping an audience entertained. Franklin Blake, rejected by Rachel, provides additional commentary about the events, as do a doctor and his assistant, a local police sergeant and his investigator, the family lawyer, and a traveler to India. The use of multiple points of view is one of the great advances Collins makes in the history of the novel. The fact that this is widely regarded as the first of the great mystery novels (though not dependent on a single detective) is another plus.Overall, the novel is surprisingly modern in its ability to appeal to a wide audience. Collins is adept at manipulating his readership and in keeping suspense high. His characters are often engaging and frequently humorous, and in its ability to deal with social issues of the day, the novel provides pertinent commentary about colonialism, religious fanaticism, and class issues. Collins never forgets, however, that he is writing to entertain, and in this he succeeds admirably. n Mary WhippleThe Woman in White (musical tie-in) (Penguin Summer Classics)"},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Among its many other delights, this book has my favorite \\"butler-narrator\\" in all of fiction, Gabriel Betteredge. Betteredge's insights into the British upper classes are downright hilarious.Take, for example, the passage in which he describes Miss Rachel and Mr. Franklin's newfound passion for decorative painting. After noting that the lives of the British gentlefolks are spent, for the most part, \\"in looking about them for something to do,\\" he goes on:\\"Nine times out of ten they take to tortuing something or spoiling something -- and they firmly believe they are improving their mind, when the plain truth is, they are only making a mess in the house. I have seen them . . . go out, day after day, for example, with empty pillboxes, and catch newts and beetles and spiders and frogs, and come home and stick pins through the miserable wretches, or cut them up, without a pang or remorse, into little pieces. . . . . As for Mr. Franklin and Miss Rachel, they tortured nothing, I am glad to say. The simply confined themselves to making a mess; and all they spoilt, to do them justice, was the panelling of a door.\\"Betteredge has the loyalty of all good British butlers, but it's a tongue-in-cheek sort of loyalty. At one point, the main detective in the story makes a case against Miss Rachel. I love Betteredge's response, in which he advises the reader to \\"cultivate a superiority to reason\\":\\"It was downright frightful to hear him piling up proof after proof against Miss Rachel, and to know, while one was longing to defend her, that there was no disputing the truth of what he said. I am (thank God!) constitutionally superior to reason.

This fact testifies the popularity of the book, but somehow because of the famous comment by TS Eliot, &quot;The Moonstone&quot; is likely to be regarded as 'detective fiction.' The fact is slightly different, and you have to keep that in mind before you read it.The story is absolutely the classic style of &quot;Who-Done-It.&quot; The Moonstone, a sacred Hindo stone is stolen from India, and makes its way to the peaceful Yorkshire countryhouse where the rich daughter Rachel Verinder lives with her mother. On her birthday night, however, immediately after the stone is presented to the young lady, it vanishes without a trace. So, who stole it? Or is it just 'missing,' as the inimitable London detective Sgt. Cuff thinks?The story sounds like Agatha Christie (who, like Collins, wrote stories about the British middle-class), but if you are looking for some ingenious 'trick' or something, you will be disapponited. The story is written BEFORE Sherlock Holmes is born, and though the basic elements of detective stories can be found here, Collins does not use them as you might expect the later writers like Conan Doyle do. I cannot reveal much, but I can tell you that the whereabout of the stone is not necessarily the primary concern of the novel.The most strikingly original aspect of the novel is its characters. Remember, &quot;The Moonstone&quot; is primarily a Victorian novel, and Wilkie Collins is one of the best friends of Charles Dickens, who wrote &quot;Great Expectations&quot; which attacks the idea of 'gentleman.' The story is told by many characters themselves, and they unwittingly reveal the hidden side of their personalities in the narrative. The best case is the statement of Miss Clack, whose too religious attitudes conceal her surpressed curiosity (and perhaps love) for handsome philanthropist Godfrey Ablewhite. Clack's narrative, always amusing and in a sense grotesque, is one of the greatest among the 19th English novels.About the mystery of the novel ... well, there are lots of them in there, but they are rather about how and why these colorful characters did certain things or didn't. Rachel Verinder, independent and strong-willed (Collins loved this type of females), certainly knows something about the missing stone, but she never talks about it. The housemaid Rosanna Spearman knows something about the 'smear' of the paint (one of the crucial points of the story), but she never talks about it ... until the time you know the reason. The 'mystery' is about these people, rather than about the Moonstone.{ABOUT THE BROADVIEW EDITION by STEVE FARMER}Broadview's edition of &quot;The Moonstone&quot; comes in handy for academic use, so let me record the details of the book. It has Mr. Farmer's informative introduction that follows the modern critical readings of the book. Plus, you see the novel's contemporary reviews, and the play version of &quot;The Moonstone&quot; (which Collins himself made for the stage) and even the reviews of that play. You also get the excerpts of the letters concerning the novel and the play, and the brief newspaper accounts of the real-life cases of Constance Kent and Northumberland Street (both of which became part of the story). The long (and well-chosen) list of select bibliography is included.You may not find the same thrill as you have in Doyle or Christie, but &quot;The Moonstone&quot; is still a good example of great storytelling. Read it like you read Dickens, another great storyteller.&quot;The Moonstone&quot; is made a TV show starring Greg Wise in UK in the late 1990s. This version is also great, keeping the atmosphere of the original novel intact.

It's great reading through and through -- great Victorian writing, exotic characters and scenery, terrific plot, likeable characters (Sergeant Cuff and Franklin) etc... Not only that, it's an important work for those who consider themselves fans of detective fiction since many consider it the first detective novel of all time. In fact, I'd argue that it puts many modern and popular detective novels to shame. I'm amazed that Collins had such a good handle on a &quot;page turner&quot; that long ago. This is such a good mystery that it will make you want to read The Woman in White which is equally as good if not better. I have to admit that I also enjoyed the PBS version of the Moonstone as well. Don't read the abridged version -- the full version is a classic read and well worth it."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"A previous reviewer notes that he became a fan of Victorian literature in his 70's. I am in my 60's, and have become a fan of the same due to my recent purchase of a Kindle. I am a lifelong reader. I bought the Kindle so I could pack a single \\"book\\" for a recent trip to Rome, rather than loading down my luggage with 6 or 7 as is usual on a trip. Then, being frugal (and the trip to Rome costing a pretty penny), I started downloading free books to my new Kindle. The great majority of these are works that are in the public domain, many of them from the Victorian era. Using this method, I downloaded a bunch of them, and to date have read Dracula (excellent!), The Home Life of Poe (like an extended People magazine interview), and The Moonstone (see herein).I read Wilkie Collins as a girl, but so long ago that I don't remember if it was Woman in White, or The Moonstone, or both which I read. The Moonstone, I must confess, is a thoroughly engaging piece of mystery writing.Collins uses the device of having the narrative told by several different first person narrators. In this, the book is like Dracula, whose story is told completely in letters, diary/journal entries, and newspaper clippings. In The Moonstone, the narratives are written after the mystery has been solved, to fulfill a request that each person who had witnessed key moments having to do with the mystery put down in writing only what they witnessed and observed. The individuals of whom this request is made then consult not just their memories but also their own diaries and household records, to put together testimony written after the fact which maintains the urgency and freshness of the original sources, with a bit of reflection by each narrator which nevertheless never provides plot spoilers.Other reviewers have written about Gabriel Betteridge, the valued and loyal major domo of the Verinder household, and about Miss Clack, the hilariously clueless spinster cousin who is a Peerless Evangelizer of the Christian Gospel in her own mind. These narrators are indeed wonderful. From Betteridge, we receive our best portrait of Sergeant Cuff -- \\"the mighty Cuff\\" -- the police detective hired to discover who stole the Moonstone after the local authorities botch the job badly. Althought Sergeant Cuff gets to narrate a very small part of the story himself, it is in Betteridge's chronicle that we get the pleasure of making the acquaintance of a detective who has the idiosyncrasies of Sherlock Holmes, Miss Marple, Nero Wolfe et al, even though he is not as central to the story as those worthies.Ezra Jennings is a melancholy character who enters the story in its later chapters. It was his narrative that I found most exceptionally stirring. Jennings is a physician's assistant with a checkered past and a foreign demeanor, treated as an outsider and trusted by few.Rosanna Spears, a hunch-backed maid taken into the Verinder household after a stint in a woman's reformatory, is another melancholy character whose actions stem from motives that transcend class or station in life. I confess that in her story I found myself angriest at the rigid class distinctions that in every generation predispose some folks to fortune and some to misfortune - the Victorians had no monopoly on this any more than do we. Rosanna suffered the double whammy of poverty and feminine ugliness. If Rachel Verinder has been a servant but retained all of her beauty, her fate would have gone better than Rosanna's, just as Rosanna would have had a better (if not happier) life if she had been an heiress with a humb-back.The Moonstone has all the ingredients of a delicious mystery tale -- adventure, romance, a MacGuffin that is the priceless jewel of a centuries-long-worshiped idol, murder, theft, passion, coincidence misinterpreted, and Robinson Crusoe. What more could a mystery lover want?"},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Wilkie Collins was an English writer who penned one of the first and greatest detective stories with his novel, The Moonstone in 1868. He not only portrayed suspense, excitement, and doubt all at the same time, but he also created a great mystery with his story of a stolen diamond.While writing The Moonstone, Collins was grieving the loss of his mother and was also sick with rheumatic gout. His grief and illness crippled him and caused him great pain. In The Moonstone, Collins includes a character burdened with a similar illness, and thus portrays the type of pain he himself was going through. However, Collins persevered through his illness and pain to continue publishing parts of his story each week in the newspapers so he would not disappoint his English and American readers.The mystery in The Moonstone draws the reader into exotic settings and characters which spice up the story that begins in India in 1799. An English Colonel steals a breath-taking yellow diamond from the forehead of the moon-god statue and returns to England. However, there is a curse on the person who takes the sacred gem from its intended purpose, and the curse extends to the person's family. Upon the Colonel's death, the diamond is passed on to his niece in England in 1848 on her eighteenth birthday. The diamond is stolen the very night it is presented to her at her birthday party with many guests and servants in attendance. From here on, through narratives written from the points of view of different characters, the story falls deeper into mystery, and the characters are not who they seem to be on the surface. The reader keeps wondering who took the diamond and why. The mystery is many-sided and is truly not entirely revealed until the very end, certainly not disappointing the reader, who has been taken on a long but fascinating ride.The Moonstone definitely stands out because it is written in nineteenth century English. For an American reader, it is almost like stepping into a different time and culture. However, the old-fashioned English often times causes the reader to reread some of the words and phrasing in the sentences, lengthening the reading process. But overall, the mystery and its unraveling are fascinating, methodical and well-organized. The only drawback is that it takes the reader 552 pages before his curiosity is finally satisfied.A.C."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"The Moonstone is chock-full of everything a Victorian novel should have: vivid and colorful characters, intricate language, elaborate plots, and bizarre coincidences. The insight into Victorian ideas about race, class and gender alone gives it tremendous value and merit.This book simply shouldn't be read with modern expectations. Just sit back and let the story take you back to a different time and place. This edition with the explanatory notes is also very nice for any outmoded terms that you may come across."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"The Moonstone is a wonderfully written English mystery novel of the mid 1800s. It tells the story of the path of a stolen Indian gemstone. The path begins from the day it was stolen from the forehead of a sacred statue of the god of the Moon guarded by three Brahmins (or Indian priests) to and from its journey Yorkshire. While in Yorkshire, the stone is eventually passed down to Miss Rachel Verinder on the day of her eighteenth birthday and within the same night, the precious Diamond is stolen. In several narratives, the theft of the Diamond is described.I believe that The Moonstone was a fascinating and well thought out mystery novel. Although I thought it was a little too lengthy near the end, this was only for the better. Collins uses eight different narratives to re-tell the story of the missing Diamond. The characters develop into believable and helpful elements of the story. The narratives allow Collins to achieve suspense, thrill, and mystery. In my opinion, he has successfully accomplished the true title of a classic mystery novel."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I first learned of Wilkie Collins while studying the life of Charles Dickens, with whom Collins had an up-and-down friendship. For those who've struggled through a heavily-footnoted Dickens epic, you'll be pleased to know Collins' writing is much more &quot;modern&quot; and accessible.Reading &quot;The Moonstone&quot; today, it's hard to believe the novel caused an uproar when it first appeared. It seems quaint and harmless. But Collins' Victorian audience was thrilled with his depiction of dark doings at the House of Verinder, and his gentle (by today's standards) satirizing of Victorian mores and manners.The novel is organized as a series of &quot;narratives&quot;; my favorite is that of Gabriel Betteredge, faithful servant of Lady Verinder. Betteredge is simply delightful, full of gentle humor and insight. Here, Betteredge is relating his early days with Lady Verinder and her husband, Sir John:&quot;Well, there I was in clover, you will say. Placed in a position of trust and honour, with a little cottage of my own to live in, with my rounds on the estate to occupy me in the morning, and my accounts in the afternoon, and my pipe and my Robinson Crusoe in the evening - what more could I possibly want to make me happy? Remember what Adam wanted when he was alone in the Garden of Eden; and if you don't blame it in Adam, don't blame it in me.&quot;So yes, Betteredge gets himself a wife. He's just one of many vividly-drawn characters in the novel. And while the plot moves along with appropriate twists and turns, it's the quirky characters who provide the most satisfaction.&quot;The Moonstone&quot; works on many levels and always leaves me happy to have fallen under its spell."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Mysteries/suspense are my favorite reads.

Some will say The Moonstone is his best work; although, I tend to differ. I found it a bit slower than Woman In White, but still a good victorian read that no one should miss."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Wilkie Collins' \\"The Moonstone,\\" an epistolary mystery story published in 1868, often is cited as one of the first, if not the first, detective novels ever written. No less a literary luminary than T.S. Eliot attributed to Collins the \\"invention\\" of the detective novel genre. \\"The Moonstone\\" is certainly an excellent mystery story, featuring what would become staples of classic Western detective fiction -- an amateur detective, a renown professional investigator, incompetent policemen, multiple false leads and red herrings, and an \\"inside job.\\" It's also subtly laced with social commentary about class, race, sexuality, religious evangelism and substance abuse in Victorian England during a period when the British Empire ruled about a quarter of the world's population. For anyone interested in the genesis and evolution of the modern socially conscious detective novel, \\"The Moonstone\\" is impossible to ignore."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Wilkie Collins (1824-1889) was a masterful Victorian novelist of what were labelled as \\"sensation novels.' Collins is also among the first English novelists to pen detective stories. Along with \\"A Woman in White\\" he is best known for \\"The Moonstone\\" his periodically published best seller. The novel has been adapted for stage, screen and television a number of times since its publication.The novel deals with the theft of a huge and expensive yellow diamond dubbed the moostone. The novel's prologue reports that it was initially stolen by Col. John Herncastle who brought it back to England. All of this occurred during the British Army's storming of the Hindu stronghold of Seringapatam in 1799.The novel is told by a series of narrators who give their story of the happenings which led to the second theft of the moonstone: The mooonstone was stolen on the night of June 21, 1848 at the Yorkshire estate of the widowed Lady Verinder. Her daughter Rachel is celebrating her 18th birthday that memorable evening; she is presented the valuable gem by her enamored cousine Fredrick Blake. Blake has brought Rachel the stone all the way from London.It was a gift for Rachel from her uncle Herncastle who left it to her in his will. On the night of the disappearance three strange Indian jugglers have appeared on the premises. They are, in actually, three Hindu priests of the Brahmin caste in search of the famous moonstone. They will not let anyone stop them from returning the gem to the idol deep in the Indian jungle which is worshipped by Hindu devotees. The moonstone is stolen that very night? Whodunit?The cast of characters are well drawn, eccentric and quirky. Among themRachel Verinder-The virginal young maiden who is the recipient of the moonstoneFredrick Blake-Rachel's lover who is one of the prime suspects in the theft due to his debt problems.Godfrey Ablewhite-The pious hypocrite social do-gooder who courts Rachel.Roseanne Spearman-A strange housemaid who has been in prison for theft. She commits suicide by dying in the shifting sands on the coast of Yorkshire. She leaves letters and is a key to unraveling the plot. Roseanne is madly in love with Fredrick Black though she is plain and poor.Lady Verinder-A beautiful widow who is mortally ill. She is Rachel's motherDr. Candy-a local physician.Eliza Jennings-A fascinating man who assists in the resolution of the mystery. He is medical assistant to Dr. Candy.Miss Clack-the humorously annoying character who is related to Lady Verinder. She seeks to force religious tracts on the unwary and carries a torch for Godfrey Ablewhite.Mr. Bruff-The gruff and rough attorney for the Verender family.Septimus Luker-A shady London pawnbroker.Gabriel Betteridge-A faithful servant of the Verender family. His narration is the longest in the book. He is inordinatley fond of reading Robinson Crusoe while enjoying his pipe and friendship with his two faithful dogsAlong the way the reader will learn about opium addiction, legal matters, love and murder. The Moonstone remains as one of the best detective novels in English literature. To reveal the plot is to destroy the story for first time readers. Enoy the mesmerizing spell cast by the master of suspense-Wilkie Collins!"},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"While on a military campaign, two young men take decidedly different turns in their lives when one makes a decision that the other just can not accept. Cut to years later, when a precious stone is left to a relative. Complicated relationships and chaos abound in this mystery by Collins.Franklin Blake has been entrusted with delivering the stone to its heir. His decision as to whether or not even give it to the girl is complicated by its history. He does giver Rachel the stone, and from the evening of her birthday until over a year later their lives are both turned upside down with the disappearance of the moonstone.The fun part of this book is trying to figure out who stole the moonstone. Collins will lead you in one direction while subtly pointing you in another. Pretty soon you're going to suspect so many people you'll wonder if it will ever be figured out. Well, I had a couple of choice suspects, but I couldn't figure out if they really were the culprits, and if they were, just how in the heck did they get away with it? Needless to say, I was justified in my suspicions, yet still surprised as to how Collins describes the way the mystery was solved. Franklin Blake very much reminds me of another Collins character, a Walter Hartwright from The Woman in White. (I highly recommend that one!)"},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"The Moonstone is the perfect introduction to the Victorian novel. Written in the day of serialized fiction, when reading was still a primary form of entertainment, The Moonstone is a gem. Full of cliffhangers, written from multiple points of view, it's the tale of a stolen jewel whose original owners will stop at nothing to get it back. In the hands of a lesser author, The Moonstone would be confusing and rambling, but Wilkie Collins so adeptly drew his characters and gave his narrators such distinctive voices that the reader is drawn deeper and deeper into the story, anxious to read on to see what is going to happen. The tale is liberally strewn with clues, but it's the description and the characters who make it so readable. Who could ever forget the ominous and deadly Shivering Sands or Miss Clack's cheerful and relentless distribution of improving 'little tracts'?Unrequited love, greed, jealousy, hypocrisy; valiant heroes, romantic heroines, exotic villains, comic relief and a mystery to tie them all together-everything we love to read about is present in lavish measures. The Moonstone is a book to curl up with on a winter weekend and get lost in. One of the best of Victorian novels, when a precise turn of phrase was appreciated and families eagerly gathered by the fireside each week to hear the latest installment read aloud, The Moonstone has been in print since 1868 for good reason. It's a great story told by a master storyteller and puts most romantic suspense novels to shame. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is tired of what's currently available in the fiction marketplace. Read this and see what an excellent book really is!"},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"A cursed diamond plundered from India and known as the Moonstone becomes a birthday gift of a lovely young heiress. On the very night she receives it, it is stolen in a crime that is baffling to all and whose investigation is stymied by the very woman who should be most interested in getting the diamond back. Characters include two cousin-suitors of the heiress, her indomitable mother, a lovesick serving girl with a humpback, the Robinson Crusoe-obsessed house steward, an unflappable private investigator, an outcast, drug-addicted, and misunderstood physician, a band of \\"Hindoo\\" jugglers/thieves/brigands intent on retrieving the diamond, and a spinster cousin who comments mean-spiritedly on the action from her holier-than-thou, let-me-save-your-soul perspective. The narrative is told in the first person alternately by the different characters as they are closest to the action and best able to offer insight on events.This novel is famous for its narrative style, its featuring of a private investigator, and its surprise ending. I really enjoyed the narratives by Miss Clack and Mr. Betteredge, both of whom are hilarious. Other narratives were less enticing. As with other Collins novels, the love interests themselves were pretty dull. Cuff, the investigator, reminds me of a C. Auguste Dupin-Sherlock Holmes sort. However, this private detective gets it wrong for the most part. His love of roses struck me as silly. The surprise ending was also dissatisfying. It was implausible to say the least, but it was still enjoyable to see the plot tie up. The final outcome of the Moonstone seemed right.This novel is a classic of detective fiction and certainly worth the read. An oldie but goodie."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"The Moonstone was recommended to me by my cousin during a recent trip to Ireland. I must say that at first, I had a hard time getting into the book, but then I was absorbed by the well-crafted and realistic characters. Though these characters would have \\"lived\\" about 150 years ago, they jumped off the page with their idiosyncrasies and humorous outlook on life. The only complaint that I have about the characters is that their names were a bit heavy-handed, falling under the guise of \\"charactonyms\\", such Mr. Bruff, the grumpy family attorney, and Godfrey Ablewhite, the overly-involved church volunteer. The tales of Miss Clack and Mr. Betteridge caused me to intermittently laugh out loud, and Mr. Betteridge's devotion to Robinson Crusoe as his chosen life anthem was priceless."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I first read The Moonstone about four years ago, and recently picked it up for a second time after reading The Thirteenth Tale, a modern book that was inspired by another WIlkie Collins novel, The Woman in White. Said to be the first \\"cozy\\" British mystery, The Moonstone features lost jewels from exotic places, a suicide, and the ever-present bumbling country detective.A cast of characters converge on Lady Verinder's country estate to celebrate the 18th birthday of her daughter Rachel. Franklin Blake, her cousin, comes from London to deliver the Moonstone, a jewel bequeathed to her by a relative who fought in India and claimed the stone during a raid fifty years before. During the night after the party, the stone goes missing, and suddenly everybody behaves suspiciously, especially Rachel, who Sergeant Cuff suspects of stealing the Moonstone, and a servant girl named Rosanna Spearman. Added on top of the mystery is the presence of three strange Indians. What's their role in the case? And who really took the Moonstone?The ending surprised me twice, not least because of the way in which the mystery was revealed. Told from the perspective of Franklin Blake, loyal servant Betterige, a spinster relative, a lawyer, and others, this book is the ultimate in detective fiction. Although hard to plod through at times, I loved this book."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I am not usually a big fan of detective novels. I find that the Sherlock Holmes stories, while entertaining, do not give the reader enough of a hint as to what is going on. The Moonstone on the other hand, on which the Sherlock Holmes stories are based, is entertaining to the end, and the reader is let in on what is happening most of the time. When this is not the case, the mystery just gets better. Towards the middle the book does get slow, but that is made up for by the excelent beginning and finish. The language also tends to get a bit tedious, but the captivating storyline makes up for it all.

Since then, I've loved it. Wilkie Collins' ability to craft a detailed plot, eccentric and believable characters, a unique storytelling style...all of that comes together to create one of my favorite books. Relating the events surrounding the theft of the Moonstone via a series of narratives, Wilkie Collins changes voice dramatically from Betteridge, the Robinson Carusoe loving servant, to Miss Clack, a poor and fanatical cousin, to Franklin Blake, the lovelorn hero.

The savvy young Englishman Franklin Blake, in respecting his recently dead uncle's will, brings the Moonstone to his lovely cousin Rachel Verinder. When the Diamond disappears on the night of her birthday, a mystery ensues and winds from the streets of the underworld of Victorian London to the very heart of India, where superstition and idolotry rule the people; the characters entangled, including a debt-ridden philanthropist, a love-sick suicidal young woman, the Englishman that passes among Indians...The mystery twists, turns, and leaves the reader breathless--the Diamond takes as many victims through murder as through the pages of this wonderful novel. The Moonstone is as addicting and enticing as the opium trance which finally solves the mystery; as ensnaring as the evanescent light of a diamond. This is a wonderful novel equal to any of today's thrillers."},{"Title":"The Moonstone (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I say The Moonstone is 'almost' excellent because I've read The Woman In White, which is by far a superior novel. If Wilkie Collins had not written The Woman In White, I would say that The Moonstone is an excellent book, but the author has surpassed that. The Moonstone is an interesting crime novel where the narrative changes several times throughout the novel.

The book is a very good read with the characters clearly defined and described and consistent throughout the book. The settings I cannot vouch for, having never been to England, but the descriptions certainly created very vivid pictures in my mind of where things were happening and how the events looked. Collins was a very keen observer of human nature and captures the various characters' foibles and idiosyncracies in a wonderfully amusing style. At no stage in reading this book was I bored or wanting him to hurry on and get to the point. The slow unfolding of the mystery, the careful introduction of clues, the intricate weaving of the story through the different narratives made for an interesting, captivating and ultimately entertaining story. The terribly mysogenistic views most of the men have of women are probably true to the era in which it was written. The description of the life of the \\"idle rich\\" is also probably quite true for its time as is the clear picture given of the life of the servants and very busy poor.

They are (in order): The Three Musketeers, Twenty Years After, The Vicomte De Bragelonne, Louise De LA Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask.I don't think I need to tell people about the story, but I will. The action and dialogue in the Dumas' stories rivals anything written since. Especially the dialogue. If Dumas were alive today he'd be writing for TV and movies, his dialogue is as fast and witty as anything around.There are many different printed versions of these stories around. If you pick and choose at random from different publishers, you may miss parts of the stories, have overlaps, or run into major editing. Just look at the versions of the 'Man in the Iron Mask' and see the different page count. At my local library I found two books that said 'Complete and Unabridged,' only one had 10 less chapters than the other.So, sticking to one publisher increases your chances of getting the whole story. These Oxford World Classic editions are excellent. They do have all five books. They don't cut anything out. They use one of the standard translations (I'm not sure if there has been a new translation in the last 100 years). And they are newly printed. Some publishers versions look like photocopies of old printings and are pathetic."},{"Title":"The Vicomte de Bragelonne (The romances of Alexandre Dumas)","review":"This book, like all of Dumas' other works, is excellent and should be read by all.

I think the interaction of the four friends(d'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos and Aramis),and how they deal and act with one another at this point in their lives is very interesting. If you get this book, you better make sure you have close on hand the next two(Louise de Valliere and The Man in the Iron Mask)because it ends abbrutly, leading you in to the next book. But it's definately a must have."},{"Title":"The Vicomte de Bragelonne (The romances of Alexandre Dumas)","review":"If you are reading this review, you have probably already read the Three Musketeers and Twenty Years After. You are wondering if it is worth it to continue with the series. If you decide to go on, you have three more 600+ page novels ahead of you. That is a lot of time and energy.If you are foremost into the swashbuckling aspect of the Musketeer stories, I would not go forward. The Musketeers are now in their late 50's. They are still vital characters but they are no longer young men looking for any excuse to duel with the Cardinal's Guard. From this point on, there is a lot less sword play and campaigning. The focus of the story moves to the intrigues of Louis XIV court.I am continuing with the series because I like the characters. I want to find out what happens to the four friends. In this novel, D'Artagnan and Athos are the principal characters. Aramis and Porthos do not show up for the first few hundred pages. Dumas has kept me entertained for the first two thousand pages of this saga and I am counting on him to keep me entertained for the next 1500 pages."},{"Title":"The Vicomte de Bragelonne (The romances of Alexandre Dumas)","review":"Before I begin reviewing this book I'd like to comment on it's place in the total D'Artagnan Romances. The D'Artagnan romances are a trilogy started with the Three Musketeers, followed by Twenty Years After. The last of these stories is broken up into three volumes which are The Vicomte De Bragelonne (part 1), Louise de la Valliere (part 2), The Man in the Iron Mask (part 3). If you are like me and reading library copies you may even find The Vicomte De Bragelonne broken up into four volumes either all titled The Vicomte De Bragelonne, or titled the same as the three volumes with Ten Years Later added as the first volume of the story. With that being said, on to the review...This story take place around ten years after the events of Twenty Years After. We find Luis XIV now king, but hardly so sense Mazarin holds all the power. D'Artagnan is still a Musketeer, but is losing faith as what he had earned in the previous book has been taken away from him. Seeing that his friends have prospered out side of the Kings service, while he has made no progress, and being dissapointed with the useless king who allows himself to be overshadowed by Mazarin, he leaves the king's service with a bold plan to make his fortune. This leads to a reunion with an old friend, and one of the best of a series of adventures that takes place in this, the last of the Musketeer series.This volume brings back the great four musketeers, all of whom have gone their seperate ways. This volume is dominated by the charaters of D'Artagnan and Athos. A fine begining to a wonderful but long story.Review continued with Louise de la Valliere..."},{"Title":"The Vicomte de Bragelonne (The romances of Alexandre Dumas)","review":"After writing The Three Musketeers and Twenty Years after, Dumas wrote a third installment to the trilogy. It is probably the most controvercial book in the trilogy, as can be revealed by reading many of the reviews. For starters, it's LONG: over 200 chapters. As a result, the English-speaking world has split it into three books: The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Louise de la Valiere and The Man in the Iron Mask (the most famous volume). The length is certainly a problem, in fact is it THE major flaw in the conclusion of the trilogy. Dumas is never terse or concise, but in this three-part book, he produces an monolith. This was largely due to him overcomitting himself and having to write this much for financial reasons. However, while this is a major setback, the three books still have elements of great, almost sublime Dumas left in them, which can be extracted if approached in the right way.The final installment of the trilogy represents the dear old Athos, d'Artagnan, Porthos and Aramis maturing and growing old. The trilogy thus moves from more active and straightforward swashbuckling to a more complex and sombre picture. Like the previous book Twenty Years After, it is not completely clear as to who's in the right and who isn't, only this time it is more so. Like the previous book, age has placed the former Musketeers in a somewhat divided situation, this time involving many a clandestine dealing of state and international level. Finally, in this three-part saga, we are introduced to a huge number of characters while our Four at times take a back seat for several hundred pages. This has been criticised as well, but has a point.In terms of this specific volume (The Vicomte de Bragelonne), it is the most historical one, as initially d'Artagnan and Athos are brought out of retirement, united in their royalist causes. After completing an adventure reminiscent of their former, more \\"action-packed\\" years, the intrigue of the newly-ascended Louis XIV begins. It is here that we can see Dumas as painting a brilliantly detailed picture of what he sees as France moving towards a more centralised, efficient yet pedestrian autocracy from Richeleu to Mazarin to Louis XIV. For the first time, d'Artagnan finds himself serving (and appreciated by) the king, however, the novel asks the question of whether this is at all a good thing. In the power-struggles of the court, we see the irony that the \\"detractors\\" of progress are often more honourable than its supporters.If you only expect more action involving the Four, then don't bother reading this at all. However, if you persevere, you will get to see sublime glimpses of what a long way the Musketeers of old have come (for better or worse), what they think about the entire society they live in and what Dumas thinks. As well as some of the old-fashioned-style adventure. I think that the fact that this is obscured by an overly-drawn-out style, while annoying, does not detract from this being an honourable conclusion to the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Vicomte de Bragelonne (The romances of Alexandre Dumas)","review":"The Vicomte De Bragelonne is another masterpiece by Dumas. Although not as captivating as the first two books in his series (The Three Musketerrs and Twenty Years After), VDB certainly has its moments. VDB is followed by Louise de la Valliere and finally the series ends with the story of the Man in the Iron Mask. This book starts of rather slowly compared to the others and certainly is not as captivating albeit it is a good read. The ending is a little weak too. The middle is simply a page turner. Adventure after adventure. This book sets up the plot for the last two in the series (all three were really one book entitled Ten Years Later). The Musketeers (d'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis) could not be more different in this book. They are taking diffent sides of the governmental rift as Louis XIV finally makes his rise to power. I recommend this book. END"},{"Title":"The Vicomte de Bragelonne (The romances of Alexandre Dumas)","review":"This somewhat humerous book is Dumas' work all over. When I first read The Three Musketeers, I got so hooked onto Alexandre Dumas' works and I just had to read all of its sequels. This book, of course, takes place about 10 years after the other sequel, Twenty Years After, ends. This book is originally part of a huge book called Le Vicomte de Bragellone, but publishers balked at the 1500-2000 pg book and chopped it up to three pieces. This is the first of the three. D'Artagnan is still serving as a musketeer and Louis XIV is ruling over France. In &quot;Twenty Years After,&quot; one scene (I can't give away which scene it is) ends quite mysteriously. Athos goes out to give the finishing touches to the scene. D'Artagnan although almost 45 by now, is still witty, charming, and daring. He goes about carrying out plans you can't even think of. One of the new 'main' characters, Raoul acts with the nobleness and honor he bequeathed from his father. Towards the end, the Aramis starts behaving very mysteriously (which is explained in &quot;Man in the Iron Mask.&quot;) It has several parts which will just make you fall out of your seat laughing. This book (and all of Alexandre Dumas' books) is Dumas at his prime."},{"Title":"The Vicomte de Bragelonne (The romances of Alexandre Dumas)","review":"I have a copy of this book dated 1910, it was my mother-in-law's. One day I picked it up on a whim, and was instantly pulled into Dumas' narrative. This is a very well-written and entertaining story set in the period during the very beginning of the reign of Louis XIV.Dumas has a way of transporting you back in time. His writing is effortless, and flows smoothly from one chapter to the next. He is a great storyteller, and the dialog is superb.What fascinated me the most about this story was the historical portaits. I always wondered about the period in English history after Cromwell and before Charles II. Dumas describes the situation and gives fascinating descriptions of the personalities of Lambert and Monk, the 2 English generals struggling for power after the fall of Cromwell's son.There are also very interesting descriptions of Charles II (Stuart), Louis XIV, and Cardinal Mazarin, along with a description of the political situation in France at the time (1660).I checked my 1910 translation with the sample pages of this book and discovered it to be almost identical, the only differences being the substitution of some of the French words left in my translation, to English.I found the Vicomte de Bragelonne to be refreshing, entertaining and even a little educational."},{"Title":"The Vicomte de Bragelonne (The romances of Alexandre Dumas)","review":"This novel is the last part of \\"The Three Musketeers\\" trilogy, begun in 1844, when Dumas was in the middle of writing \\"The Count Of Monte Cristo\\" (another success) and half a dozen other long novels. Brief synopsis: Ten years have passed since the musketeers fought the son of Milday. Raoul De Bragelonne, the son of Athos, is passionately in love with Louise De La Valliere, one of the Duchesse D'Orleans' women, Louis XIV is in love and intent on making himself absolute master of France, Mazarin plots, Athos is writing his memoirs, D'Artagnan is on a mission which takes him from Holland to the dunes of Brittany and Aramis, always scheming, has a mysterious plan involving a masked prisoner, with Porthos in tow. I consider it one huge installment (as it was originally written), so I'm not going to review \\"Louise De La Valliere\\" or \\"The Man In The Iron Mask.\\" Dumas wrote it that way and that's how I see it. This last novel consists of 268 chapters, making for a long and intriguing read. It's the darkest installment and it's doubtless this as much as its length which explains why readers prefer the first two parts of this heroic saga. The middle section, \\"Louise De La Valliere\\" (here in the U.S. and elsewhere; in France, it's only known as \\"Le Vicomte De Bragelonne\\") is where the action-of which there is no scarcity-dies down for a good while and focuses more on the amours and intrigues of the court. \\"The Man In The Iron Mask\\", the most famous part of the trilogy, while \\"Le Vicomte De Braggelonne\\" and \\"Louise De La Valliere\\" are disregarded, picks up where the middle section leaves off and the action reaches a feverish pitch as the saga plunges headlong to its shocking conclusion. Makes for a crackling good read. As someone whose knowledge of Dumas begins with his birth in 1802 and ends with his death in 1870, I have to say that the saga never runs short on swashbuckling action, heart-stopping suspense, forbidden and intriguing romance and impossible obstacles.\\"The Three Musketeers\\" introduced us to Athos, Porthos and Aramis, brave men in the service of the king of France, also known as \\"The Three Inseperables.\\" D'Artagnan is a young man from Tarbes, Gascony, who seeks to join them. Together, they overcome seemingly impossible odds to save the throne of France. It's, of course, the most famous...and with good reason. \\"Twenty Years After\\" continues the adventures of these four brave men two decades later as they answer the call of duty and fight their way to thwart the villains and save the day yet again. A masterful and most worthy sequel. The Musketeers saga reaches its exciting conclusion in \\"The Vicomte De Bragelonne.\\" The longest, but the most entertaining adventure of them all. Read these classic novels for yourselves, but if you're reading them for the first time, read them in order. Otherwise, you won't have a clue as to what the hell's going on. Rated PG for violence."},{"Title":"The Vicomte de Bragelonne (The romances of Alexandre Dumas)","review":"Most people are familiar with the story ofThe Three Musketeers (Oxford World's Classics)- \\"all for one, one for all\\" is a pretty common catchphrase/concept and actually does come from the book - andThe Man in the Iron Mask (Oxford World's Classics); both have been made into numerous movies over the years.

And it is extraordinarily good fortune for readers that there are, as Dumas' writing is exceptionally vivid, intense, dramatic (without being over-the-top) and action-packed. Throw out almost everything you think you know about these stories if your only experience with them is via the movies - even the better versions cannot hold a candle to the books. They are full of intrigue, suspense, and treachery; of politics, passion, and incomparable prose - they will take you on a high-speed ride through French history that I guarantee will entertain as well as educate.

He also introduces the two contesters for Mazarin's vacated seat: Colbert and Fouquet. Dumas' grab of high adventure is still well focused with Athos' and d'Artagnan's separate jaunts to England, which results in d'Artagnan finally becoming a man of independent means.What I found disturbing was the dumbing down of Porthos and the menacing slyness of Aramis.

I am grateful to him that in all his books he presents the history of his country in such a captivating form that one falls in love with the French history and its rich culture.

The Vicomte de Bragelonne; 2. Louise de Valliere; 3. The Man in the Iron Mask. In additio to these three long detailed novels the author also wrote two earlier books dealing with the lives of D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos and Aramis: 1. The Three Musketeers and 2. Twenty Years After.The plot: Complicated to say the least1 A 658 page small print novel using the elevated and ornate language used at the court of French monarch Louis XIV (reigned 1638-1715). Young Vicomte de Bragelonne is in love with Louise de la Valleire. She is a maid at the court of Henrietta Maria the wife of Monsieur the Duke of Orleans. Orleans is next in line to the French throne. He is effeminate. Henrietta has men who are in love with her including the Duke de Guise and the English Duke of Buckingham who journeys with her from Britain to her new home at the French court.D'Artagnen is captain of the musketeers. This intepid soldier travels to Holland and aids in the restoration of Charles IIto the English throne. These events occur following the death of Oliver Cromwell Lord High Protector. D'Artagnan persuads General Monk the parialmentary puritan soldier to aid the cause of Charles II and restore the Stuart dynasty to the throne. Aramis is pursuing a life in the Roman Catholic Church and is a bishop. Porthos is aiding in the building of Belle Isle Fortress owned by finance minister Fouquet. Fouquet will later give this fortress as a gift to the young Louis XIV. Powerful men such as Mazarin and Colbert are afoot with their quest to win the favor of the king and retain power.A background in the political scenes is aided in the Odford addition by a long list of biographies of the historical characters involved in the Musketeer novels.

As a matter of interest, if you are a fan of \\"The Count\\", you must take a look at these fantastic new sequels to the original, written by the mysterious \\"Holy Ghost Writer\\".

Both books are available on Amazon, Goodreads and Barnes and Noble. But don't take my word for it - check out the many glowing 5 star reviews on the books, if you still need convincing! :)"},{"Title":"The Vicomte de Bragelonne (The romances of Alexandre Dumas)","review":"If Amazon allowed for 1/2 stars, I would really give this book 3 1/2 stars. It's better than just \\"OK\\", but it's really not as good as \\"The Three Musketeers\\" or \\"Twenty Years After\\", both of which I thought were great, but which I rated 4 stars because I don't love them quite as much as \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\", which I wholeheartedly give 5 stars. (Among books by a single author, I like to rate the books relative to each other.)In any case, if you're committed to reading the complete d'Artagnan Romances, you can't escape reading this book.At this point, I think I need to be clear about what series I am reading and commenting on. The d'Artagnan Romances were all originally published as serials, and they were later published in book form as a trilogy:Book 1: The Three MusketeersBook 2: Twenty Years AfterBook 3: Ten Years LaterApparently, \\"Ten Years Later\\" is such a tome that it has been further split into 3, 4, or 5 volumes, depending on the publisher. I am reading the set of FREE Kindle ebooks available here on Amazon, and this series consists of a 4-volume version of \\"Ten Years Later\\":Book 1: The Three MusketeersBook 2: Twenty Years AfterBook 3a: The Vicomte de BragelonneBook 3b: Ten Years LaterBook 3c: Louise de la Valli&egrave;reBook 3d: The Man in the Iron MaskFirst, one note on the Kindle formatting: Oddly, the text of the entire book is centered, just as it appears in the \\"LOOK INSIDE!\\" sample. It takes a little getting used to, but at least the ebook was free.Now, on to my thoughts of THIS Kindle publication of \\"The Vicomte de Bragelonne\\"...The \\"The Vicomte de Bragelonne\\" is slow to start. It seems to be named about as appropriately as \\"The Three Musketeers\\", which is to say, not very appropriately at all. (\\"The Three Musketeers\\", of course, follows FOUR close friends in the King's service - d'Artagnan especially - not just Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.) In \\"The Vicomte de Bragelonne\\", we get a brief glimpse of the Vicomte de Bragelonne at the very beginning, but then he goes his own way, and we don't see him again until about two-thirds of the way through the book. At best he is a supporting character, so why name the book after him?!We trudge through some preliminary scenes that set the stage, and d'Artagnan - our protagonist - doesn't even enter until about 11% into this Kindle version. We are immediately faced with a major question about d'Artagnan, but rest assured, Dumas will explain everything in due time. Athos comes in around 22% into this Kindle version, and that's when the story really picks up.This installment has even more politics than the first two books, which - despite the fact that I am quite interested in real-life politics - made for less interesting reading for me. At times, when the story focused on Monk or Mazarin, it seemed like nothing was really HAPPENING, and I was just waiting for the next adventure or intrigue to start. The adventures, of course, once they did get started, were nothing less than what you would expect from d'Artagnan!Unlike the first two books, there was no central antagonist in this one - no Milady or Mordaunt to tie all the adventures into one cohesive story. Sure, I do wonder how the reign of King Louis IV will progress (because I have no knowledge of French history!), but that's not exactly a pressing plot. Ultimately, I suppose I should cut this ebook some slack, since it was never meant to be one self-contained novel, and instead is just one excerpt of a seriously long serial.Porthos doesn't make his entrance until well towards the end of the book, and Aramis comes in even later.As usual, I appreciate the sense of honor portrayed in the series, particularly from Athos. At one point, he says, \\"I am never happy when I have a duty to accomplish.\\" Another favorite quote comes from d'Artagnan: \\"We are not truly generous and good save from the moment when the eye has become hardened, and the heart remains tender.\\" This statement kind of sums up the passing of time for the four friends - together they have seen war and death and betrayal, yet each holds the others in a special place in his heart.As this is only the first part of the original book, the ending is pretty abrupt. I've already got the next ebook queued up on my Kindle."},{"Title":"The Vicomte de Bragelonne (The romances of Alexandre Dumas)","review":"I love D'Artagnan and his adventures, wished I could have been in his time to share every moment with him."},{"Title":"Last Words (Fourth in the Margot O'banion Mystery Series)","review":"Margot O'Banion Lake, film editor, joins her long time lover, Max Skull, film director, and his director of photography, David Wong on a trip inside the jungles of Venezuela and Guatemala to get a feeling for the latest film, \\"Last Boundary.\\" This fact colors the entire book, although, the trip is short.

Despite warnings from Max and others from the film to stop her investigation, Margot needs to know what happened to the author, whom she once so idolized in her youth. Not having read the earlier three mystery novels in this series I had a hard time understanding her affection for Max, the father of her college-aged son and who is so obsessed with his movie that he neglects Margot and writes off her misgivings about the shoot. Otherwise, this is an enjoyable mystery that provides a glimpse into he world of movie-making, rock-and-roll, publishing.

But don't let the light touch of Donkeys Still Talk fool you, Kidder's humor is the vehicle for real depth and truth. Such depth can only be delivered by someone who has lived through the trials of life and has found the secret to lasting joy.

This book is truly a God send and much needed in the lives of every born again believer in Jesus Christ. So often in our Christian walk we simply forget that God is in control of everything pertaining to us and He allows certain trials, tribulations and struggles to enter into our lives to build our character and cause us to grow closer to Him. Virelle simply reminds us that we must learn how to accept what God allows to come into our lives without crying and complaining. I highly recommend this book to any and everyone. To sum it all up in a nutshell all that's being said is that we grow up and move in the direction God has for us. We were called to suffer with Christ and if we do not suffer than we will not rein with Him.

For each day of the year there is a reading from God's Word, the Bible, accompanied by a golden nugget from brother Nee. He did not use fluff, hype, or the jargon-of-the-day in an effort to promote himself. Rather, this humble servant sacrificed his soul-life to be used by the Lord to unveil His unsearchable riches to His seeking lovers. Through this brother's ministry I have progressed in my love and appreciation for the Lord Jesus and His glorious expression on earth, the Church, which is expressed practically in the local churches. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to all those who seek the Lord in sincerity with all simplicity and a pure heart. The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.

It's a frolic through a kitschy circus-flavored world where lawyers are also tarot card readers and Ninja assassins; where a red-headed dwarf shouts &quot;Auto Zone!&quot; every morning; and where the sun pops up over the horizon &quot;like a banana-flavored Moon Pie.&quot;The characters--including a grill cook philosopher insomniac, a con man who schemes to freeze his wife's head after her death so she can live in future times, and a grandmother (called &quot;Grandmom&quot;) who is retired from the circus where she had a knife-toss-at-little-doggies-act--are so vigorously eccentric that you shake your head and ask yourself, &quot;What the hell was that?&quot;"},{"Title":"Midnight in Monaco","review":"He's got something--I think it's a talent for telling or writing stories & an interest, too, in style (though not a style I'm at all crazy about--it's still a good sign).He's much too much in love with gratuitous & zany violence to suit me--& he seems otherwise self-indulgent as well--he doesn't seem to have much taste--he tries to pull off gags in the course of narration that are weak in themselves & beside the point--he skips some of the (apparent) essentials of building (esp. character) or of managing a consistent & coherent narrative--& even so he gets quite a few small & terrific effects, including humor & probably accurate social observation & (even though it can be cheap) surprise.He'd be better--this seems perhaps a naive thing to say but in this particular case I really think it's to the point--if he had more interesting people & subject matter--if he could write about things he didn't have to look down on & make fun of--but he's a lot better than average, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Midnight in Monaco","review":"A tremendously funny and sad came-of-age narrative that recalls the hearty, chaotic family fictions of Richard Russo and Ralph Lombreglia, with the cold steel screams of Thom Jones or Denis Johnson lurking in the basement.

This is a given for any book or other work in the print medium, and, for that matter, for any human artifact. Nevertheless, after teaching philosophy for thirty-six years using everything from classic sources to newspapers to novels as texts, I have settled on Wolff's About Philosophy as the best means for introducting the most diverse of all academic disciplines.Naturally, the book reflects the author's interests and preferences, although these are never presented as truths above debate. In fact, Wolff reveals his willingness to revise his own traditional, Western preferences for rationality-based theoretical constructs devised (virtually solely) by those of the male gender. Objectivity, too, comes up for careful scrutiny and, ultimately, rejection as an appropriate property of an acceptable philosophical theory.In the end, About Philosophy is both a highly personal, and yet, a highly accurate documentation of 2500 years of philosophical speculation and research. Its faults may include that, in spite of its thoroughness and clarity, it does not summarize the views of every philosopher and movement in the Western tradition. No volume, introductory or not, could accomplish this, but the ideas selected by Wolff are clearly among thegerminal springboards for the entirety of Western Civilization."},{"Title":"About Philosophy (8th Edition)","review":"Although this book has much good information about the origins and reasons that philosophy came about, the author chose to use this college textbook as a springboard for his bias towards some of the great philosophers.

Unfortunately, this book makes me have a dislike for philosophy. This text is unorganized and difficult to read (this is coming from a student with a 4.0gpa, bio major). It reads more like a novel(the format) than a text. The author constantly adds his own opinions and stories into the same paragraphs that explain a Philosopher's ideas. By doing this, it makes it extremely difficult to distinguish the words of the author from the words of the philosopher. Like I said earlier, this book does not read like a normal text. It's not functionally readable and I feel that it has no place in the classroom. I feel as though my professor is setting the class up for failure... especially since our entire class is lost! I've had many professors who had horrible teaching techniques but I was able to still come out of classes with a 'A's because the courses' textbooks were so helpful. This book is plain bad, on every level. Although I haven't received a horrible grade in this class (yet), our class grade average is poor. The fact that our class average is horrible and that the students constantly complain about this book should be a wake up call to this professor (as well as other professors out there who are assigning this book to their beginner students). It's not about whether this book contains relevant facts, it's about finding the best possible tools for getting 'the message' across to students. This book is FAR from being the best tool for teaching. Often times, professors forget about the needs of the student."},{"Title":"About Philosophy (8th Edition)","review":"This is one of the worst text books I have ever had to read and try to understand. Used this text for an online class -- tough subject to figure out on one's own and the text, laden with the author's opinion and stories, made it difficult to weed out what was important and what was crap. I had to use a different, older Philosophy text book as a guide to understand what Wolf was trying to convey in this text. I thouht I was going to enjoy philosophy--I'm counting the days until I don't have to open this book ever again!"},{"Title":"About Philosophy (8th Edition)","review":"This book will teach you nothing about philosophy. I would have given this book a negative star review but thats not an option on this grading scale. The most common theme in this book is telling you how philosophers work. they tell you a step by step processes that are oversimplified and can be combined to make less steps or in some cases one step. what is important in philosophy is what the questions are then what the suggested answers are and finally how to understand how to come to the suggested answer.I would reccomend a book called sophies world which is advertised as a story ( that is really boring ) but is actually a text book that does what I suggested earlier. if you can force yourself to read through sophies world you will actually learn something about philosophy. Anyone who reads this book will notice there is a lot of information that was just added in to make the textbook long enough to be considered a text book. one example is how the book tells us that platos written work is considered a philosophical work as opposed to a work of art. wow how important. another problem is the definition format. instead of explaining a philosophical aspect they just waste the readers time an example of this is aristotles term catharsis which is \\"a cleansing or purging\\" the book could have just stated that some people feel plays arouse emotions while others feel they purge emotions and then explained the argument behind both views."},{"Title":"Embracing Men","review":"Klaus Gerhart's book of black and white male nudes is full of young male beauty. Gerhart is less narrative than Bruce Weber in that his nudes are rarely playful, or moving, or interacting in any other way other than embracing. Gerhart is less slick than Herb Ritts with over the top fashion models. Rather, Klaus Gerhart appears to wish to show the beauty of the male as a natural phenomena, much like the beauty of nature. He contrasts his nudes against rocks and boulder, driftwood, caves and caverns and sand dunes. He is not interested in protraiture. Only a few photographs demonstrate a handsome face, most focus on the body and obscure the face. The fact that the faces are not fully revealed, and the bodies are contrasted against natural forms, allows the bone and muscle structure of the male to be highlighted. His range is very good. Notice his photograph of two men kissing and trace the line where their two faces meet. Notice the underwater nudes as seen through rain disturbed waters. There is a quite tranquility about the work. We expect to hear boys playing and dogs barking with Bruce Weber. We expect to hear club music in the background when we look at Herb Ritts. With Gerhart, we expect to hear wind in the pines and dunes."},{"Title":"Embracing Men","review":"This large format soft-cover book contains some truly stunning images. The plates are all B&amp;W, a medium that conspires to allow the photographer to present his subjects without distraction.Some of the most startling photographs show men in conjunction with some amazing natural rock formations allowing the viewer to conspire with the view that man is a hard beast, yet as the subjects are totally dominated by nature one is also forced to accept how weak and small a man is.One striking fact about all the images is that they have a misty quality which works well and I hope is not an error in the book production. Well worth adding to your collection of male erotica."},{"Title":"Embracing Men","review":"The tranquility of Klaus Gerhart's work reminds us of the naivete and peacefulness of the style of photography popular until the 1930's.

With dark humor and realistic characters, Vladimir Arsenijevic creates the story of a developing family.The expectant father and narrator of the book seems to be the only sane character. His wife is a pregnant, clean for a little more than a year drug dealer. Her actions are a great source of humor throughout the book. The narrator's Hare Krishna brother in-law Lazar is a pecular story. Although it seems unlikely that there are many Hare Krishnas in Eastern Europe, it seems preposterous that one would volunteer himself for war. These characters, in addition to parents and junkie band members, set interactions as the main conflict develops which the narrator's preparation for fatherhood.While this coming of age story is plagued with drug use, it fairs much better than a William Burroughs book. It has humor and a plot. The plot is too thin to carry the entire book, but it is an entertaining venture."},{"Title":"In the Hold","review":"The thing I noticed most of all about this book is the strength the author has is creating original and interesting characters - from the main character, who is overly honest, wry and sarchastic yet is deeply affected by the war, to the glue-sniffing former friend who is so out of it that he wants to join the Crotian army because he'll be paid more.

So, all of a snap, he took to calling me Ornery.\\" The author, Gwenyth Swain, dedicated the book to a friend of the family who used to call her 'Ornery'.The story tells how John Jacob Niles, premier collector of mountain folk tunes, discovered the young girl singing in a village square to divert the local sheriff from insisting that her preacher-father move on. Niles persuaded Annie to sing the verses over and over until he had them written down to his satisfaction, and the words were preserved for generations to come.The drawings by award-winning illustrator Ron Himler fit the story beautifully, and coincidentally show Annie's father strongly resembling the Swain grandfather of the author!SAVOR THIS STORY WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS."},{"Title":"I Wonder As I Wander.","review":"I know this song. I have sung it as a solo and directed choirs to sing it. The words and the music combine to make a beautiful sadness...a sense of being alone and yet peaceful.

It is sure to bring a tear to your eye."},{"Title":"I Wonder As I Wander.","review":"Set during the hard times of the Great Depression, Wonder As I Wander by Gwenyth Swain is the enchanting picture book story of Annie Morgan, a young girl pondering the mysteries of life.

Nowhere else is the history of a fitful battle against the annual floodwaters unleashed on the Sacramento Valley by the powerful Sierra Nevada watersheds captured so comprehensively. Kelley, however, informs us in a style that is relevant and entertaining. The valley resident treasures it for its history of the Big Fight. Political scientists enjoy it for its history and the lively way Kelley uses the fight over flooding in Northern California as a study in California and national politics."},{"Title":"Battling the Inland Sea: Floods, Public Policy, and the Sacramento Valley","review":"I was deeply influenced by Kelley's early works on hydraulic mining in the 1950s (his book Gold vs. Grain and his papers such as the Forgotten Giant: ...Hydraulic Mining...). I also heard strong praise for this book from many water professionals in the Sacramento Valley. As I eagerly read this book, therefore, I expected more of the same: a study of the massive impact that hydraulic mining sedimentation had on California rivers, flooding, and politics in the late nineteenth century.Fortunately - I was surprised to learn - Battling the Inland Sea (BIS) goes well beyond the physical and political effects of historical sedimentation in several important ways. This book is much broader in its geographic extent and substantive scope than Kelley's earlier works. Geographically, mining sediment primarily impacted the lowermost Sacramento River (below Fremont Weir) and its Sierra Nevada tributaries (especially the Feather, Yuba, Bear, and American Rivers). BIS is more broadly concerned with flood control in the Sacramento Valley up into and beyond the extensive Colusa and Butte Basins which had relatively little impact from mining sediment. Moreover, the emphasis of the discussion in BIS is on the history of flood control efforts in the Valley and the surrounding political culture of flood control. Although these topics are inseparable from the mining sediment issue in some areas, it is a much broader topic involving a set of deeper issues. In fact, Kelley makes it clear from the outset that the Sacramento Valley was prone to extensive flooding and that the natural river channel was incapable of conveying but a small fraction of the flow during large floods; long before mining sediment arrived. This emphasis is key to understanding the importance of BIS to educating both professional river managers and the lay public to the actual flood risks in the Valley. The long history of flood control in the Sacramento Valley represents a fight against nature. Mining sedimentation is a complication that exacerbates an already intractable flood-prone situation, but it is not the primary cause of flood risk. Extensive low-lying basins are the inherent cause for concern.The common ground between BIS and Kelley's earlier work is that he, again, presents an inspired historical overview of the political culture underlying California water politics. The complex developments of the period are put into a context of shifting ideologies of resource management, perception of nature, and the vagaries of politics and economics.I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in these broader topics. It is, of course, a must-read for students of California flood-management history.Allan JamesGeography DepartmentUniversity South Carolina"},{"Title":"Battling the Inland Sea: Floods, Public Policy, and the Sacramento Valley","review":"I am a big California rivers environmental history buff, and I found this book to be too similar to his publication &quot;Gold v.

Much of the earlier chapters are virtually cut and pasted verbatim from his previous book. Despite these criticisms, it remains (to my knowledge) the most comprehensive book written about the Sacramento River to date.

I could go into more detail about what's wrong with the book but the editors at Course should've done their job and I'm not going to do it for them.Even the quote from a reviewer for the Dr. Dobb's Journal on the front cover is deceptive. It praises the book series and not the book itself. That should've been a red flag for me but I wasn't paying attention.This book is a waist of time."},{"Title":"Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"I would recommend the book for begginners and people interested to learn from zero how to program in Visual C++. It should be the first programming language book to someone starting to study Visaul C++"},{"Title":"Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"Iam going to refrain from using certain words but this is the worse book i have every read. This is not for beginners. Doesn't really explain anything clearly. It just tells you to input the code and some of it doesn't even work. get another book"},{"Title":"Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"This book deals more with using MVC++E 2005 Express and not the basics of programing in MVC++E. For learning how to use MVC++E this is the book, learning how to produce good C++ code it is not. Example, knowing how to and when to use Union's, Struct's and class's is a plus, I currently don't see this from this book."},{"Title":"Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"I think this book is very badly organised, AND IT LACKS MOST OF THE BASICS ON HOW TO WRITE YOUR FIRST VISUAL C++ PROGRAM! THE AUTHORS SHOULD TAKE LESSONS FROM GREG PERRY'S \\"AN ABSOLUTE BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO C\\" WHICH IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF HOW TO TEACH ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS!I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND BUYING THIS BOOK, UNLESS YOU REALY WANT, BUY BUYING THIS BOOK, TO ENCOURAGE THE AUTHORS TO DO BETTER IN THE FUTURE.What's worse, it actually LACKS the basics to get you started. I think that, to an absolute beginner, this book is not a good textbook at all ! If you buy and try to read this book, you will probably hate programming for the rest of your life!Very, very, very bad book in my opinion."},{"Title":"Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"I orderd this book with Ivor Horton Beginning Visual C++ 2005 (which I allready own the previous version of) so I can give it to my 14 year old cousin.But this book will only make my cousin a lazy bad coder, that is not going to be able to make things without the .Net framework.There is a reason that C++ is still being used and Microsoft still develops IDE for it. This books is sneaky way to let people to take knoweldge of C# (which is a bad rip of Java) and the .Net framework and has nothing to do with developing C++ applications for newbies with of without using MFC.Of the over 65 books I have ever orderd at Ammazon I have never been disappointed to write a review.This title should be refuned, because the title does not cover the content.It could be a Microsoft press book, because you only learn how to use .Net and the structure of C# so it becomes easier to make the transit.It even is being told at the Introduction pages.On page XII: Who should read this book?Those who know c++ but not .Net.Those who want to become more comfortable with .NEtOn page XIII: This boo reacquaints you with C++ from the .NET perspective.It starts simply, concentrates on the basics of the .Net framework....By the end of this book, C++ programmers will have a good grasp of the ground-level basics and the confidence to begin deepening their exploration of the .Net framework using C++.......It offers you an excellent springboard if you want to dive into the emerging realm of C# development. By the time you finish reading this book, you should be comfortable with many of the same language structures and methodologies that exist in C#.Well for anyone who everlooked at nice written C# or JAVA(which C# is a rip off) knows that they a experienced C# or Java coder, will never be able to write GOOD C++ code.If you are thinking about learning to programm for platforms that always uses a microsoft OS (embedded or not) then this pro-vendor lockin book, might be suitable.But if want to be able to programm platform independent, and therefore also foro Microsoft OS, then this book will learn you only bad habits, which in years as competitors emerge (such as Intel compilers for dual core on Apple and Microsoft) you are not able to write code unless Microsoft supports that platform.For this reason I am not going to give this book to my cousin."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Susan Elizabeth Phillips writes an engrossing contemporary romance. Fancy Pants is a wonderful example of a story well told. While a little longer than some of the SEP books I have read; the magnificent job she does of creating a well rounded character is evert present in this book. The relationship between Francesca and Dallie is well done and how can anyone help but love little Teddy. I highly recommend this story... its one of life and love and the ever desired happily ever after."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Admitly I wanted to fling this book against the wall more than once as I began reading it - the first 100-150 pages are less than typical SEP writing. It was one of her earlier books so she had not crafted her writing style as we know it in today's books; however, once you get past the first 100 pages of \\"Old World\\" fluff - they could be cut down to 10 pages and had more effect - the book takes off! When it does, fasten your seat belt and hang on. It's SEP at her finest! The last couple of chapters - not to mention the epoulge - more than makes up for the first 100 or so pages! I would give it a 5 star rating but in all fairness I had to deduct 1/2 a star for the 100 or so pages in the beginning. All in all, well worth the read."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"This book took me much longer to read that I was hoping that it would or than it should have so I have been trying to pin down exactly what it was that made it such a long read. I think what it boiled down to was the book just did not move along a good rate. It was very slow in part and seemed as thought there was too much background given for certain parts of the story. While the story itself was kind of a different take on opposites drawn to each other and the stress and argument that go along with that situation. The character were fun to get to know and so very very different. Francesca starting off with everything, losing everything and then making herself whole again. And Dallie, the pro golfer, who seems to be just a little to carefree and doesn't seem to care about much.At times, I felt like the story was pulled too thin and more background added to make the story work. The story was pretty predictable but not in a bad way. The book was worth the read but not something that I would pick up again and read in the future. It was a one time read in my opinion.I enjoyed the different settings in this book. Everything from the prime time in Europe, to middle of nowhere Texas, to New York City. I enjoy seeing how each of these character would react in the different settings and what flaw they would bring out.The banter and arguing in the book brought some great life to the characters and helped me to relate to each. I could understand who they were using the banter to get their own goals accomplished. This made the book stronger.Overall, this is classic romance story but for me it was a bit longwinded."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"SEP again writes of human transformation, this time in the form of a spoiled European beauty and the rough-around-the-edges golfer who challenges her beliefs. Although the characters didn't quite hit home the way other of her characters have, SEP's writing shines throughout. Engaging."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I haven't read many of Susan's books but I enjoyed most of the ones I have and would enjoy them more if her characters were more moralistic and not so free with their favors. I loved how this book portrayed the heroine with much backbone after realising her potential. I loved the plot (spoiled to independent)."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"This story has more than one romance and is emotionally stirring.We meet Francesca at a \\"present\\" time (1990) and then flash back to her spoiled rich-girl childhood traipsing the world with her socialite mother. Beautiful Francesca has watched her mother charm men all her life. She has never had to work or worry about money. Then she is left bereft and impoverished at the age of 21. Francesca discovers that she is too short to be a model and her personality is too snobbish and aristocratic to help her find employment readily.Francesca is talked into taking a small acting part in a film that lands her outside of Gulfport, Mississippi. When she stalks off the set and ends on an empty road she is lucky to get picked up by Texan charmer, Dallie Beaudine.Dallie is the most gorgeous man Francesca has ever met and Francesca can't seem to impress him with her own looks. As a 25 year old, carefree golfer, Dallie and his side-kick caddy, Skeet, travel from tournament to tournament. He does okay on minor courses but hasn't been able to win in the major tournaments. Dallie had no idea how much trouble he was getting when he stopped to pick up a stray, crazy, British, spoiled \\"fancy pants\\". Their personalities clash yet they are drawn to each other.Just when Francesca thinks things are going to work out between Dallie and her, she learns a devastating fact that sends her on the run again. But little Francesca has grit. She fights to survive and to make a life for the baby that she finds is on the way. Sparks fly (again) when Dallie meets Francesca's son, Teddy, nine years later.Francesca gets an unexpected friend in Holly Grace and the book tells Holly Grace's story too: her young friendship with Dallie, her continuing friendship with Francesca and her rocky romance as she feels her biological clock ticking down.Although this is an older book, I enjoyed the setting as I was actively involved with the Honda Golf Classic during the 1970s and I recognized the famous golfers mentioned. I love the deep, full characters that SEP creates and their journeys to maturity and love. The banter is good and the plot is full of drama. The sexual scenes are pretty forward considering this was written in 1989 but they are healthy and not vulgar.I have listened many books by this author on Audible and love the narrator, Anna Fields. Unfortunately she is no longer living. I am looking forward to listening to the latest story, Call Me Irresistible: A Novel, which includes Teddy all grown up."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I just finished Fancy Pants and got online to read some of the comments of others. I am very disappointed with some of them! I found this book extremely well written. The message and meanings revealed in this book are brilliant! I loved Dallie, loved Francesca, loved Holly Grace, Skeet and Teddy! I seriously recommend reading Fancy Pants. This was my first SEP book. I definitely plan to read more of her work."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I enjoy Susan Elizabeth Phillips books. This one is fun to see someone reared to be completely selfish and spoiled be completely humbled. I wasn't completely sold on our handsome hero, but his deep-seeded doubts were believable and heart-felt. I'm not sure he ever completely grew up, though, like our heroine did."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I'm a new Susan Elizabeth Phillips fan. All it took was one book and I was hooked. Fancy Pants was the second book I read by SEP and I definitely was not disappointed. SEP is the 'romantic comedy' queen. This book was so much fun to read. I laughed and cried and couldn't put it down. I have recommended Fancy Pants, as well as five other SEP books I recently read, to all my friends and I know they have loved them too."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I had read 2 books by Susan that I loved (Match me If You can , and It Had to be You) and was really looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, it is very disappointing. The story goes back and forth, and not in a very clear way. The plot has some holes and I kept jumping whole pages, which is always very frustrating to me. I thought I wasn't going to finish it. The beginning of the book- actually the first half- takes forever. The book starts to come together on the second half but by then I was bored to death. Sorry about this one but I can not recomend it."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I've read most of SEP's books and loved most of them, especially Lady Be Good, where I first met Dallie, Francesca and a grown up Teddy as secondary characters. I enjoyed this book. I agree with a previous reviewer who categorized it as a very 80's book, I was laughing at the mental images of the description of some of the outfits, there seems to have been a lot of beading, velvet and shoulder pads.The book is longer than most romance novels, almost 500 pages, but I didn't feel that any of those pages were wasted. There is a lot of backstory/flashbacks, and I really didn't mind all that. However, you should know that the Dallie and Francie don't meet until around page 100, so be patient and keep reading.None of the characters in the book are perfect. Most of them are flawed and damaged and sometimes, not particularly nice, but you felt for them. Overall, I would recommend this book to others. I personally can't wait to read Ted's story. I read in an interview with SEP that she was waiting for Ted to marinate a little longer before she wrote his story. Here's hoping it's better than Fancy Pants and as good as Lady Be Good."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Susan Elizabeth Phillips is one of my favorite authors, and this was the first book I read by her so it remains my favorite. More often than not, I find romance novels boring, unbelievable, silly and completely by the numbers. It would do SEP's novels an injustice to simply refer to them as romance novels. Her stories are fun, intelligent, unpredictable and bittersweet. She can have you laughing out loud on one page and on the next have you in tears. She creates these wonderful, fascinating, complex, and FLAWED characters...as opposed to the simplistic, boring, goody-goody perfection of most romantic leads. And perhaps no characters in all of her novels are so flawed as Francie and Dallie. Francie is a silly, spoiled little girl whom you can't help but feel sorry for when she's left on her own with no idea how to take care of herself. Dallie appears to be stronger and more put together than Francie but hides a world of self-loathing and pain; it eventually becomes apparent that he is in fact the weaker one. It is a delight watching these two grow up into strong individuals of worth and merit. Some readers didn't like or see the need for the telling of Dallie and Holly's romance but I loved it. It was great insight into the character of Dallie and it moved me to tears. Unlike in most romance novels, in SEP's books you can actually understand what the characters see in each other and why they need the other so. Also, one thing I hate in most romances is when the leads fall in love (or at least all-consuming lust) with each other within days of meeting; SEP never tries to pull this and I appreciate it so much. Her books are more realistic but still light and warm enough to be considered fairy tales. I really wish there were more romantic novels like this."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Even though I thought this was slow off the starting block, it turned out to be a fantastic read, re-read & re-read as well as listening to the book on tape. These individuals seemed like real people-not characters in a book and I could identify with them. I loved Dallie & Francie and their son Teddy and their relationships with each other. I loved the secondary characters too. I really liked Holly Grace & Gerry's story. I pick up this book about once a month and read it just because it is such a \\"feel good\\" story."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I decided to buy Fancy Pants because the character, Dallie and Francie, appeared on her book &quot;Lady Be Good&quot;. I enjoyed all of SEP's books I owned and so I wanted to try this one also. This one was rather different than those I had. It had lots of flashbacks, very complicated characters, and of course the taste of the 80's. I can't say that this was one of her best, but I don't think it was a disappointment for me also. I did managed to finish it :0). But if you don't consider yourself a truly SEP fan, I think you should try her newer books, like Dream a Little Dream or It Had to be You. If you are SEP big fans like me, I think you should give this book a try to taste some different experience."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Based upon the reviews I read here, I thought I'd hate this book, but I really didn't. I didn't misunderstand any of it, and though I could have done without Francie's mother's lineage, it still wasn't as bad as Glitter Baby, which is the only book I've ever had to discard without finishing."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I was glad to find this older SEP book, because I wanted to read about Dallas and Francesca after their mention in Lady Be Good. I agree with most reviewers that it started out very slowly. I had a hard time getting through the backstory and I didn't like Francesca at first and was glad to see that Dallie was unimpressed by her. And, I didn't like Dallie that much either.When all was said and done, though, the story was wonderfully developed and the character complexity was compelling. There was Dallas and Holly's heartbreaking past, Francesca's horrendous efforts to rebuild herself, the struggle between Dallas and Teddy and, of course, the eventual personal growth acheieved by all. Having been a single parent myself, I applaud Ms. Phillips' realistic portrayal of the resentful little boy who tries to protect his mother from the man he dislikes.This is an unforgettable, richly-drawn book that must be savored slowly, at its own pace, to be completely appreciated."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"writers in the field with their best offerings. With that being said I have to say that \\"Fancy Pants\\" entertains but it is not one of her better books. Francesca and Dallie are ablaze but only in the first half of the novel. I have to admit once they part after their road trip the novel kind of stumbles. I actually put it down only to pick it back up later and I was glad I gave it another go because you do see how these two characters are able to grow up and face their demons.(Although it does take Dallie a little longer.) I think some of the other reviewers said this novel lacked the trademark humor of other SEP books but I have to disagree. I loved the bar bathroom fight!!! I also found the secondary characters Skeet and Holly Grace to be very funny. I still like this book better than \\"Breathing Room\\" and \\"Honey Moon\\" which got four star ratings. SEP fans should still give this one a go so long as you go in knowing it's not as much fun as her Chicago Stars books, just a bit of a miss but not to be missed."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"After having read 'This Heart of Mine' by Susan Elizabeth Phillips, I decided to read Fancy Pants next. I was disappointed. The book is very dated in the 80's. I lived through shoulder pads as fashion once already! The characters are rather easy to dislike. By the end I could have cared less if they got together or fell off a cliff. If you are trying to decide on buying a book, choose something else of Susan Elizabeth Phillips."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I know many people either love or hate this novel but it is not your typical story. First off it is LONG. There are many pages but the story is deep and goes for many years. Kind of like an epic novel. The heroine (Francie) is a royal *female dog*. Spoiled to the core, rude, lazy, shiftless, arrogant etc. But she is physically beautiful but the reader realizes this only gets her so far before she falls on her face. Our hero (Dallie) is also gorgeous but he's bored with life and isn't too ambitious. Somehow these two idiots find each other..but wait!I won't give too much away but suffice it to say that these two people get transformed in the \\"School of Life\\" (aka, the hard way!) and become two unforgettable characters that will find their way into your heart. Life knocks them down and they find better people within themselves and find REAL romance with each other & live happily ever after:) One of my favorite romances."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I normally never stop reading a book but I had to put this one down. I am a big fan of Susan Elizabeth Phillips and her Chicago Series but I absolutely hated this book. Francesca Day was the worst heroine I have ever encountered in my reading. She was selfish and self-centered and even in the middle of the book when she was supposed to be becoming independent and a better person she did the most selfish thing yet. She had a baby by Dallie Beaudine, a man that was a bit of a mess and sometimes a jerk, and didn't tell him for 10 years. Or I should say, he didn't find out for 10 years. She was never planning to tell him, he had to figure it out on his own. I was so furious with the character I couldn't even read pass that.Dallie Beaudine had lost his first child, just 2 years old, in a terrible accident and Francesca Day robbed him of 10 years of his second child's life. It was the most selfish thing I ever read. I felt like she was the villain instead of the heroine of the story. She tries to explain that if she had gone to him then she would have never become independent but that is just complete garbage and completely self-centered, showing again that she only thinks about herself despite what Ms. Phillips was trying to portray.Holly, Dallie's first wife, got on my nerves as well. Knowing that Francesca had slept with Dallie and just so happen to be pregnant she didn't even tell him. Choosing to believe her story about it being another man's child knowing how much family means to Dallie. The book goes through chapters explaining how Holly and Dallie are so close but she just accepts the story and become friends with Francesca with no question and not telling a man she claims to love. Then she is angry and shocked when she finds out the truth. SMHThis book was a huge disappointment and the first one I couldn't finish."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I could not put this book down and have read it twice, and will probably read it again. I have given it to several other friends and they all felt the same way. It is a great book!"},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Susan Elizabeth Phillips is my favorite author and I have read almost every romance book that's been written in the past twenty years. I have read everything she's written and the only commet I can think of besides 'absolutely the best' is, please write faster. I can actually see the characters and not just be reading about them. If it takes me over a day to read one of her books, it means I've had many interuptions. My favorite one was 'Hot Shot&quot;. Her books are keepers."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Hated the characters, especially our hero(?). In real life he and his friend would have spent many years in prison for kidnapping. All SEP's other books are great."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"This book is, without a doubt, the absolute worst, most horrid book I have ever read in my entire life. I wish I'd read the dictionary or something instead. The hero and heroine were also the worst characters I have ever heard of in anything (including movies poems, television, etc.) I read this book like 2 years ago, and I still remember, with great clarity, exactly how horrendous this book was.*SPOILERS!*There was a part in the book where people actually had to HOLD the hero back because he was about to beat the crap out of the heroine! PHYSICALLY resrain him! Who does he think he is? Chris Brown? I was appalled.Now, here is yet another \\"secret baby\\" plot. Only the heroine doesn't keep the baby away because she thinks he'd be a bad father. NOOO... She allowed her pride to keep her child away from its father. And she did it for YEARS! And although he didn't know where she was, she could have told the man where she was at any time because she knew where he was staying! And she wasn't even sorry about it! And she did this KNOWING that he had a child who had died! What kind of insensitive, selfish...Anyways, the child was also unattractive. OKAY Susan, we get it. The boy is ugly. You do not have to shove it down our throats by telling us 50 times a page! I'm amazed that anyone oculd have actually liked this trash! Someone needs to tell the author that it's never okay for a guy to put his hands on a woman, and it's never, ever okay to be so selfish as to keep your child from its father. Ugh. I couldn't have picked out a worse book if I had tried."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I would give this book to all my friend to read . It was a great book to read. I have most of the books that Susan has wrote so far."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"If you really have nothing better to do and can borrow this book from the library, read it. Otherwise, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"The first book by Susan Elizabeth Phillips I read was \\"Nobody's Baby but Mine,\\" which I found very enjoyable escapism. However, this book of hers is loads better, it is just wonderful, I enjoyed it tremendously and will definitely be buying more books by this author. Keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"This is my first encounter with Susan Elizabeth Phillips, and I was not disappointed. The first couple of chapters had me wondering, but I tramped on not letting them dissuade me for which I am happy. Ms. Phillips captured me with her story and I am now a fan.At first I kept thinking, 'how am I ever going to get through this story' but at the end of it I thought, 'why does this have to end?' I finished the book 4 days ago and I still keep wondering about Francie, Dallie, Teddy, and Holly Grace and wonder what they're up to. That in itself stresses to me what a good book this is. Maybe I am easily entertained, but I don't think so because I am a seasoned reader. I liked 'Fancy Pants' and I am sure you will too."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I've always enjoyed Susan Elizabeth Phillips in the past. She usually creates fun if not always endearing characters and has a knack for snappy dialogue that always managed to keep me hooked. Apparently this book is one of her earlier efforts, written in the 80's, and it suffers from many of the excesses of its time. It's more of a saga, which harkens back to the Danielle Steele, Jackie Collins books I read early on before I knew there was better stuff out there. All full of glitz, glamour, money and little else. An earlier exchange between a glamourous beauty and her playboy paramour (with whom she's been playing hard to get) \\"You're not woman enough to handle a man like me.\\" Her witty whispered response that gets him all hot and bothered, \\"You're not rich enough for me.\\" That pretty much sets the tone of the book thus far and I'm not overly impressed. The usual wit of the author seems to be missing but since it's an audio and I'm trapped in my car anyway I will continue on . . .Later on: I'm glad stuck with it but honestly if it had been a paperback I would've put it down long ago. After wading through pages and pages of insipid backstory the author finally tightens up the story and focuses on a few main characters. The backstory, as I said earlier, reminded me very much of a Danielle Steel novel but did serve the purpose of explaining why the heroine of the book was such a self-centered, helpless brat. When gorgeous socialite Francesca loses everything she's forced into lowering herself by accepting an acting job which she believes will be glamourous and make her an instant star. Things don't exactly go her way and she finds herself on the street in a stained gown and at her lowest point when golf pro Dally takes pity on her and picks her up. Dally is the first man prettier than Franscesca and she's instantly smitten though the two fight like children. Dally totes her around and foots the bill until he tires of her (and she discovers he's married!) and she's left to her own devices again. This is the point, probably somewhere halfway through the book, where she finally grows up and becomes a real person instead of the annoying spoiled brat who only wants a man to save her. I have to credit the author here because she did an amazing job of turning a thoroughly unlikable, whiny character into a admirable person."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I loved all the books in the Chicago Stars/Bonner family series so I thought I would feel the same about this one. While a bit drawn out, I did like Francesca's transformation from spoiled brat to a woman supporting her child on her own. I had a particular fondness for parts of this book that took place in Lake Charles because it's near where I was born and where my own parents grew up."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"The story starts out too slow and takes up too much of a time frame. (10 years) It is dated and I had to use my imaginiation to picture different clothing than described. Though all in all I liked the story and the ending it took too long to get there and I thought about not finishing it several times. Not her best book."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I loved it... crazy characters and all. It isn't the typical romance novel with a predictical plot. It's different packed with wit and humor. I look forward to reading more by this author."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I wasn't going to read this book soley because my mother had read it first but I was so bored while visiting I decided to pick it up cause it had a cute cover and I ended up loving it. While there is a lot of background story I think it helps to give the characters depth and allows you to really undersatnd them. The only problem that I had with this book was it took so long for the characters to get together that once to book ended I didn't want it to I wanted to read more. Great book definitly looking forward to read more SEP books"},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Reading about this book in a Self Magazine article, I decided to read it for myself.I nearly didn't finish the book. By the second chapter I nearly put the book down as the characters were so repulsive to me. Still I forced myself to read on. Halfway through the book I finally had to just skim through the rest of it so that I could get to the end. Too long, too convoluted with rather crude characters and no where near enough romance or even sex for that matter. The sex that happens is some of the most mediocre I've ever read. The book almost redeems itself in the last couple of chapters by actually getting a little bit interesting but you shouldn't have to wait until the end of a book to finally get interested. Just overall a very trying book that I wouldn't recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"As I was reading this book, I kept telling myself, poor Francesca's life can't possibly go any further down the tubes. But low and behold, she just gets deeper and deeper. I laughed and I cried BIG buckets, and the tears are well worth the the time and effort to read this book!I couldn't believe how strongly emotional I became involved in this story. One thing I have learned since this intro into SEP's works is that all of her books will make you feel the same rollercoaster of emotions that this one inspires.I know I haven't given much detail as to this particular story, but trust me, If I got started I dont think I would be able to sum up what I would say without giving too much away.Francesca and Dallie have one of the rockiest relationships that end up as one of the most endearing couples I can remember. Be sure to read &quot;Lady Be Good&quot; after this one. It picks up with two new characters that lead off from Dallie and Francesca's story.MS. Phillips---if you ever write another book, please, PLEASE give us Theodore's story!"},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"From the back cover:\\"Until I wrote Fancy Pants, I didn't know I could make readers laugh. But laugh they did, and I finally found my voice as a writer\\".Beautiful blonde teenaged woman beaten and molested.Beautiful blond teenaged man beaten.Beautiful blond toddler dies by drowning.Blond parents badly traumatized and mated to not-blonds in what author apparently thinks is happy ending.Mother of stupid obnoxious heroine in designer clothes killed by vehicle after stupid obnoxious heroine's father killed in auto accident.What exactly is supposed to make me laugh?I wanted a good read. This was a stressful waste of time and money."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"What I really liked about Fancy Pants is that it wasn't your usual romance. Plus, I was glad to finally find a book where I hated the main guy for most of the story. I actually found it refreshing because yes, the main characters are irritating but that made them seem more real to me. I thought Susan did a great job and I really enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I have read almost all of Susan E. Phillips books and was eager when her earlier ones are reprinted...Af far as Fancy pants is concern it should stay out of print. Dissapointment does not even covers it. The relationship between Dallie and Francesca left me feeling somewhat disgusted. If you want to read SEP's best try her Kiss an Angel and Nobody's Baby But Mine......don't even glace at this one."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I wish I could give this book more than 5 stars! This was a great book. This book wasn't just a Romance it also had a few moral lessons, one of them being beauty is not that important and it is whats inside that counts. I also was pleased that Franscesca transformed into a strong willed woman on her own and not with the help of Dallie. I really would recommend this book, its a little slow in the beginning but don't stop reading if you get bored, keep reading, it will be worth it."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I might've liked this book more if I'd read it when it was first published, but I didn't pick it up until long after I'd become a fan of Susan Elizabeth Phillips and she'd had time to cement her writing skills and character development talent. Fancy Pants is worth the read, if only to get to know some characters who appear in her most recent book, but I'd never recommend it to anyone who's never read Susan Elizabeth Phillips before."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I have read some positive and some negative reviews of this book. All I can say is that one man's ceiling is another man's floor. I loved the book and have read it many times. SEP does not do short love stories. Her books are multilayered and they may not suit everyone but I love all of them. This book has a goodlooking pro golfer who never quite makes it to the top but seems to enjoy his easy going life. What you find out in the book is that is the facade he uses to hide an unbearable pain. The heroine in the book is a spoiled English girl who is stranded in the US with no money and no way to get home. She and the hero meet up on the side of the road and their lives are never the same. If you want a straight ahead love story then find another author. She has many characters in her books and you get to know all of them. The ending is happy. SEP has promised she always has those but the H and h have a long road to get there. I find her books make me think, make me laugh and make me cry. I read all of her books over and over....never get tired of them. I can't ask for more than that other than I wish she would write faster."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I enjoyed this story. Yes, it is placed in the 80's, but I thought it described that era well. I had a hard time putting the book down, because I was rooting for the characters to overcome their imperfections due to their upbringing. I didn't expect to love the story because of the ratings, but I truly did."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Susan Elizabeth Phillips is an auto buy for me and one of my favorite authors. I came across What I Did For Love when it first hit the shelves and have been a loyal fan of hers since. I love her writing style in her books and the stories she creates brings out so many emotions in me. I was saddened to not love this story as I have her others. I read Lady Be Good, which follows this story, first. I loved the older Teddy and Francesca and Dallas were great secondary characters, it made me anxious to get ahold of Fancy Pants so I could read their story. I knew that they had a rough go at it and spent some years apart, but I was still ready for the love they showed towards eachother in Lady Be Good.I started this book with high hopes, struggled through the first few chapters, felt deflated through the middle and started to get into the story towards the end. Without that great begining and middle, I couldn't say that overall, it was a great read for me. The first 100 pages are filled with Francesca's back story and bits and pieces of Dallas Beaudine's life. We were able to gleam information about Francesca's upbringing and even had a look into her mom's. I was a little frustrated wondering when Francesca and Dallas were going to meet and when they finally did, I was hoping for sparks or some of that chemistry that I saw between them in Lady Be Good. What I got was a whole lot of annoyance, especially coming from Dallies character.Francesca was selfish and spoiled, but she also did a lot of growing in this book and I really found myself loving her character. She started with everyhting, lost everything, then pulled herself together when she was at her lowest and not only re-built her life but re-built herself as well. It was empowering and I was rooting for her the whole time.Dallas on the other hand gave me mixed emotions and I had a hard time liking his character. I had some heartfelt moments from him. He had a rough childhood and pulled himself away from his father and set out on his own at a young age and this is when he encounters Skeet. I really loved the bond these two created and I loved that he picked up strays being animal or human in every town they passed though. Little things like that gave me small glimpses into the person Dallas was. His backstory with Holly we were able to see through flashbacks was beautiful and tragic. I felt more of a connection between Dallie and Holly than I did between Francesca and Dallas. They had an incredible pull between them and as I was reading about when Holly and Dallas met in Highschool and how they found there way to eachtoher just to have it fall apart with the death of their son. It pulled out such strong emotion from me and I couldn't understand why these two didn't deserve a second chance. It was confusing, I didn't know where the story was going and what Holly's part in it was.Francesca built up very strong feelings for Dallas but I didn't see any feelings toward Francesca from him and I didn't like how he talked to her or treated her. I get that she needed some tough love, but at times I thought he was a bit cold with her. Towards the end, when Dallas discovered he had a son with Francesca, shock, hurt, I understood. The anger he carried toward Teddy and the comments on how he looked put me off his character a little more. I wanted to really like Dallas, but until he had his revelation towards the last few pages where he was able to face his demons with the support and pushing form Francesca, I didn't get him. It wasn't until those last chapters and the last few pages where Dallie's character came together for me and I was finally feeling like these two belonged together"},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"There are too many detailed backstories presented, flashbacks/timeline shifts sometimes make things confusing, and the book is too darned long. But if you stick with it, by the second half of this you'll discover you can't put it down.Yes, the heroine is unlikable, which is why the very first scene has her in almost-present day recalling the time she was lying on a deserted Texas road, penniless, pregnant, and marooned in a country that was not her own. THIS is the image that kept me going through. I wanted to see her reduced to such a state.And then when she was, I wanted to see just how she was going to dig herself out of her predicament. She does so on sheer guts, which is something I always love reading about! Heaven help us, she becomes a real human.So please look at these other, more negative reviews and tell yourself that yeah, they're right for the most part, but reading through to the second half of the book will pay off. This is not SEP's best book (most of those would get 5 stars), but in the wider world of contemporary romance, it's one of the better ones. I think you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I've read about 6 of SEP's books and this was my least favorite. I liked the main characters, but only in the last 100 pages. It took a long time to get to Francie and Dallie's character development and I felt like SEP fast forwarded through the best parts of the story and lingered on the worst. I'm glad I read this book but don't start with this one! SEP is a great writer, very funny and imaginative. It didn't shine through in this work as it has in others."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I didn't think that I would like this book, but I can appreciate how one of the main characters(Francesca)evolved. It starts off like most romance stories (I almost gave up many times),I hate sappy romance novels with no real depths to them -and this one almost comes close, but it has some redeeming qualities.It's ok."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I didn't care for this book too much when I tried to read it either. Francesca was much more likeable in \\"Lady Be Good\\". So was Dallie for that matter. Of course, they are a lot older and, hopefully, more mature by that time.However, I am a die hard SEP fan. Loved all the Stars books, the \\"circus one\\", and most of the others. The darker ones like \\"Honey Moon\\" and \\"Hot Shot\\" aren't for me. But that's just me.My beef here is how many people sneer at the 80's feel to \\"Fancy Pants\\". Well, duh. Maybe that's because it was written in the 80's. It was also one of SEP's first books and she has learned to cut to the chase much quicker these days without leaving out the sparkle."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"After the disappointment with Just Image, I was hoping a better result at my next SEP try. No such luck. Granted, this one is not as bad and contrived as Just Image, but it wasn't that much better either. I can see why so many reviewers here kind of lost patience with the story and had to force themselves to finish. I think the problem is that the author took too much time setting up the stage for Francesca's transformation. For over half of the book, the readers have to endure her childish, self-centered, immature, shallow, vain, and spoiled girl act. We are so tired of her by this time that we really don't care whether she redeems herself or not. But the worst part is after her transformation I dislike her even more. When Dallie confronted her about hiding his child from him, her reason was that so she could grow up. She essentially deprived her child of a father because of her own benefits. Later, when she found out her child did not like Dallie, she felt no remose or gulit to the fact that she was the reason father and son disliked each other. God, what a selfish woman she was!@There is also all that back stories about Dallie that takes up more pages. Consequently, there is very little room left for romance. In fact, I really was pulling hopelessly for Holly Grace and Dallie. Their story has so much potential. They have been through something so painful together that their bonds are endearing and heartfelt. Dallie and Francesca's relationship paled in comparison to what Dallie and Holy Grace shared. SEP later wrote books with similar themes where heroines transformed themselves beautifully. The most recent one is Aren't She Sweet and I think she did a much better job with that one."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Loved this book. A very good book for a relaxing Saturday afternoon. Can't wait for the next book. Susan is an awesome writer."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It really takes the reader into a whole different perspective on love with all the trials and tribulations of Susan' s books."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Great book! Makes you laugh, and makes you cry! Always enjoy the books Susan Elizabeth Phillips creates ... only wish she could write them faster! :)"},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Fancy Pants is an older work of Susan Elizabeth Phillips and one I missed while reading SEP's earlier books several years back. After finishing Call me Irresistible, I couldn't help but wonder about Ted's mom, Francesca, and her story. I discovered it was revealed in the book, Fancy Pants. This story takes the reader on the journey of the life of Miss Francesca Serritella Day, from her momentous conception, to her tumultuous 30's. Born in an English upper class home, Francesca is used to having people cater to her every whim. When it comes to men, they can't resist her Vivian Leigh-like beauty. Francesca becomes involved in an opportunity to leave her home in England and make it to Hollywood for a chance in a lifetime movie career. When things do not turn out the way she thought they would, she must finally live in the real world and make a life for herself in a new country at the tender age of 21. This story is entertaining, funny and heartwarming. I couldn't help but fall in love with the characters from golf pro Dallie Beaudine to Holly Grace, Skeet, Miss Sybil, little Teddy and of course our little Miss Fancy Pants. Take the journey with Francesca and see how she manages to dig herself out of the deep hole her life has become and work her way up to a new, grownup beginning."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"This story was very long winded and proved to be a big disappointment. After reading Ain't She Sweet (which was hilarious) and \\"It had to be You,\\" I expected a story line with lots of humour and unexpected turns. Fancy Pants did not deliver. It was boring and predictable with attempts at humour, but it simply fell flat on its face."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"You know what you are going to get when you read SEP and she delivers to the level of expectation. Is it great liturature...no but it is fun and light and this serves a purpose at certain times. Sometimes you just want the ride without having to think a whole lot."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I loved it. This is my second time reading it and I thought it was great. Loved Dallie - the overbearing jerk. Ms Fancy Pants - what a girl - dusted herself off and got on with life. Please read this book. It is so much more than any of the one star reviews. OK it may be an oldie but I don't think it is at all dated. She even made the golf seem interesting - I was on the edge of my seat at the Classic!!"},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I read this book ages ago, and recently borrowed the Kindle version through my library, which goes through amazon.com. I enjoyed the book the first time, and enjoyed it again this time. I am giving the stars rating based on the story itself.HOWEVER, be advised that the Kindle version is loaded with spelling and punctuation errors, and sometimes random little words that make no sense. I do not know if this is the fault of the publisher, or whoever, but there is no excuse for it. At times, it detracted from enjoying the story (which is a fun read).If the library Kindle version that was obtained through amazon is the same Kindle version sold here, brace yourself. The first 1/3 of the book was fine, but after that, the errors and typos were pitiful."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Really liked this love story. Would have given it five stars except that it was unnecessarily long, giving background on characters that were not integral to the story. I suspect that because this was the first book of the series, Phillips was perhaps laying the character groundwork for books later in the series, but it became cumbersome at times...Having said that...The background on Dallie and Francesca made the reader invest deeply in these characters and the outcome of the story... Loved Francie's evolution and how she helped Dallie become a man.... And wow, those last 100 pages almost made me pee my pants! I never thought a golf tournament could give me heart palpitations, but SEP succeeded in making me care about a sport I had no interest in.... Oh, and who can forget Teddy: Mr. Irresistible....#love.Really, this book has it all...I laughed, I cried, and was in suspense till the very end...satisfying."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Everyone knows SEP is a good writer, able to come up with interesting characters from wildly disparate backgrounds who somehow get together, but this book is not one of her greats. First off, it suffers what I consider an &quot;80's disease&quot; - a Sidney Sheldon/Judith Krentz - like obsession with designer names, foreign princes, descriptions of yachts, and lots of pre-AIDS catting around. Secondly, its characters are not all that endearing: our heroine is obsessed with looks, money, and success, and our hero is obsessed with bimbos and failure. He neglects to tell her he's married; she neglects to tell him she had his son. I had a hard time liking these people, wondering if it was worth the effort to sort through several relationships and lots of confusing flashbacks. I don't feel I'm giving away too much here--if you like SEP, you'll struggle through it anyway--I just wish someone had warned me what I was in for."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"In Fancy Pants, Susan Elizabeth Phillips introduces us to two excellent characters - the spoiled rich witch and the down-home down on his luck golfer. Unfortunately, I found it a real slog to actually get to where these two are introduced! I realize the necessity of a well-developed back story, but I felt rather smothered by it in this book. Sparks fly when Francesca and Dallie are together, but they're not together often enough or early enough. As always, Ms. Phillips' writes a thoughtful book, with lovely secondary characters, and vibrant leads. But I find her books erratic - &quot;Nobody's Baby&quot; had a delightful wit and charm which I missed in the sequel. Here, there seems a combination of humor and desperation! Perhaps I have become used to books requiring less involvement by the reader, but I would not recommend this book to a friend who had not read any of Ms. Phillips' work - start with &quot;Nobody's Baby&quot;!"},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I did not like this story. Dallie was so insensitive and cruel. And he slept with hundreds of women and Francesca knew this but she STILL gives herself to him. SEP gave him all the advantages over her and she had none over him. The story was too one-sided. He treated her like dirt and she accepted it. I was so thrilled when she left him. Unfortunately the story did not end there. I kept hoping she'd never see or think of him again. Maybe bring in another love interest who was worthy of her and who could love her. But no. SEP apparently still had unrealistic hopes for Dallie being the love interest. The book had a lot of boring parts, too. Who cares about Dallie and Holly's romance? Why bother to tell their entire story? What is the point? I REALLY HATED that part of the story. Dallie did not deserve Francesca. He was so unfeeling toward her. I thought it very improbable that she could fall for him with the way he treated her. And then when she left him (for years) he never bothered to look for her...he hardly even thought of her. This does not redeem him at all in my mind. This does not convince me that he loves her or that his feelings might change. Of course, she pines for him and thinks about him often. How utterly pathetic. He didn't suffer when she was out of his life. Then all of a sudden their back in each other's company and they are in love? I don't think so. I didn't care about Dallie and I especially didn't see the point of rehashing his old romance with Holly. Maybe those two should've gotten back together since he thought more about her than about Francesca. I'll never read this story again and wish I'd never read for the first time."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"They always say that the 1st written novels are the best...yet, I can't say this book is the best, nor it is the worst. I read some of the reviews and I was kinda bracing myself for a terrible book, but instead I found a book that is about picking up yourself again after luck has turn its back on u, and yes, it's still a Phillips romance on its best...Most readers find this novel disappointing because it's not your typical boy meets girl on the 1st chapter. They are too frustrated because it's taking so long for Francesca and Dallie to meet. I bet they're muttering, &quot;the hell with Chloe and Black Jack, just get it on,&quot; I didn't mind the history part, it builds the anticipation for the best parts. You learn about their lives. You learn to love them when u hated their guts at first. Like Francesca, I just wanna strangle her on the 1st few chapters. And sometimes, she's just too dumb and vain, and then halfway through the book, I just wanna cry for her and give her a little push, saying, &quot; go on, u can do it!&quot; Phillips has once again able to pull some emotions out of her readers. A few times, I banged the book to the wall, and hated the turn of events. But that's wat makes a good book, if it can make u scream, laugh, or hurt for the characters, I'll say it's worth ur time. I like Phillips; she's not afraid to embarrass her characters. Teddy is the best kid Phillips has ever written. I assure u, Fancy Pants is another winner! Don't let others stopped u from reading it!"},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I finally got around to reading Fancy Pants with great excitment. I have every SEP book and I had just finished \\"It Had to Be You\\", so I guess my expectations were high. FP is purely AWFUL! From the hero being a jerk (that I never grew to like) to his being married (yep ladies, and he doesn't get a dee-vorce in a hurry either). To the heroine being a moronic brat that well, 'finds herself' and therefore becomes attractive to the jerk. There are few likable characters, and it takes 13 years before they 'run' into each other again and actually have a 'romance'. If you feel compelled to read this book, do NOT buy it, check it out from the library. I sent my copy there."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I definitely have mixed feelings about _Fancy Pants_. Susan Elizabeth Phillips is one of my all time favorite authors and the first book of hers that I read was _Lady Be Good_. I fell in love with Francie and Dallie in that book and couldn't wait ot read more about them. _Fancy Pants_ somehow manages to fall flat. I was looking for some SEP belly laughs to come out of this one and I was sourly dissapointed. Basically, _Fancy Pants_ felt too long. SEP takes about fifty pages to actually start talking about Francie, another fifty to introduce Dallie and then another hundred to actually get them together. When they actually have a little fling, there is no real passion or heat between them. Dallie comes off as an abusive, unsuccessful golfer, and Francie seems like a spoiled little rich girl. The book gets better in the second half. Francie becomes a lot more down to Earth and a lot easier to like. She becomes a lot like a person I would like to know and not one that I would never get along with. Unfortunately, Dallie doesn't change too much and it seems like he didn't deserve Francie or their son. SEP does the whole eighties thing where she doesn't focus on the story that she's pushing (the relationship between Francie and Dallie) and moves totally off the subject to talk about Francie's grandmother and mother, her every acquaintence, and just about every single person who makes an appearence in the book. I totally did not understand or appreciate the telling of Dallie and Holly Grace's love story. It slowed the book down and wasn't all that interesting. Still, SEP shows her promise in this book and there are some of her traits hidden in areas that reveal what is to come in the future. For die hard SEP fans, _Fancy Pants_ is an okay read. For new comers, stick with the new stuff. Her Chicago Stars series is absolutely fantastic and _Kiss an Angel_ as well as _Lady Be Good_ are must reads."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Based on the reviews, I saved this one for last of all SEP's available books because I had a feeling I wasn't going to like it. It turns out I was right. This is one of her earlier works, where it's confusing to determine the actual genre of her story, much like I had a problem with Glitter Baby and Hot Shot. When I realized that the next book by her includes Glitter Baby's daughter Meg and Teddy Beaudine, the offspring in this novel, I thought it would help to get the backstory.Francesca Day was born amongst the british elite, rich, beautiful and spoiled. When her mother is killed in an accident, she finds that her mother was actually in debt and Francesca wanders aimlessly as a socialite taking advantage of any situation. At a party, she's convinced to go to America to do a part in a movie. She's told she'll be compensated when she gets there, but when she realizes, while out in the middle of nowhere, that the movie is a cheesy D rated vampire flick, she knows she's been bamboozled. She hightails it out of there wearing a southern belle costume, a suitcase of clothes, a cosmetic bag and absolutely no money. This is how Dallas \\"Dallie\\" Beadine first meets her.Dallie is a second rate golfer with a lot of potential, but at every major tournament he plays, he always ends up choking. He hides his failure behind extremly good looks and careless humor. With his pentient for rescuing strays, he decides to help out Francesca and gives her a ride to the airport. With Francesca's haughty british attitude, and Dallie's devil may care attitude, they do not hit it off and things only get worse as they spend more time together. Francesca in her desperation clings to Dallie, they become lovers, and culminates to a separation when Francesa learns Dallie is actually married. She leaves for good only to find that she is pregnant, but pulls herself out of adversity to raise her child, Teddy, in secret and become a successful news woman and celebrity.Flash forward ten years later, at an off chance encounter Dallie meets little Teddy Day and immediately realizes that the boy is his son. In a fuming rage, he kidnaps Teddy forcing Francesca back into his life to deal with it. Only after ten years, although Dallie has made some effort with cleaning up his act, he's still the terrified loser while Francesca is a warm spirited, intelligent, and beatiful woman. They're together for less than a day when they both realize they still have this amazing chemical lust for one another and start up again throughout the turmoil to eventually create a loving and lasting relationship.That is essentially the core of the story, however there's a lot of pages dedicated to things that seriously detract from the book. For starters, the beginning is tirelessly boring because it's about Francesca's grandmother and mother and their relationship. Then it's about Francesca and her mother's relationship. Then Francesca gets raped. Then her friends turn on her. Then Dallie metaphorically kicks her when she's down, and literally slaps her back when he so richly deserved it, knocking her into a car. Then she's alone, abandoned, penniless and pregnant. We get it already, her life sucks, give her a break for crying out loud. The worst part is about Dallie and his wife Holly Grace. They have this weird open marriage, and regretably a third of the book is spent on Holly Grace and Dallie's relationship. Who cares? It's sick and unhealthy and I can't imagine how this contributes to a romance. To see Dallie fall for Francesca is easy ten years later. To see why Francesca would fall for Dallie isn't likely to happen in a million years! He has no redeeming qualities and when he kidnaps his son, he's mean to him and scares him to death. How could Francesca witness her childs misery and still be attracted to the guy who is her child's tormentor? Overall, it's simply too confusing and you'll find yourself skimming through chunks at a time trying to pick up the core of the story. My only saving grace is the child Teddy. As I mentioned earlier, her next book will feature him and he's also in Lady Be Good where I really liked him. As for the parents, they left me cold. This is only one for the die hard fans at desperate times."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I rarely enjoy older romance novels, written in the 70s and 80s, for one reason or another--mainly, the heros are often abusive, the heroines, wimps. I enjoy Ms Phillip's writing so much though that I decided to give this book, one of her earlier works, a chance.The first quarter, though entertaining, didn't have me overly impressed. The two main characters were not endearing in the least and yet, I found myself feeling sympathetic towards these two imperfect, and seemingly incompatible, people (the magic of Ms Phillip's writing!). But suddenly, near the end of the first half of the book, something completely unexpected happens (find out for yourselves) and you find yourselves caught in the book's grip but good.Reader's only familiar with Ms Phillip's more recent works (Texas Heaven, Dream a Little Dream, etc) may at first find themselves a little unsettled by this different side to Ms Phillip's style of writing. The characters are more complex with sharper edges (ie not-so-lovable characteristics) and yet, you can't help but be drawn into this powerful, inspirational(that's right!) novel. I know I'm being vague but I don't want to ruin a single amazing moment of this book for anyone who listens to me and reads it (please!)."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"This book was not at all what I expected. The fact that it spans so many years is far different from other romances that I've encountered. I don't think I'd like this \\"epic\\" style in every book I read, but because it was rather unique, I enjoyed it in this story.The characthers definetly aren't very likable, but at the same time they are really well suited, which somehow makes their romance endearing. The heroine is a spoiled, vain brat and the hero is self-pitying and the ultimate \\"jerk jock,\\" but they were so enthusiastic about their flaws that you almost had to like them.I give SEP credit for not falling into a typical romance formula, as I was continually surprised by the various plot turns.Probably not my favorite book ever...I didn't like how the main characters were seperated for so long, and how perhaps they didn't know each other all that well. But, for a fun read, this definetly does the trick."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Huge SEP fan here. I found Fancy Pants to be out of the norm of the regular &quot;boy meets girl&quot; romance formula, but loved it anyway. I liked the fact that both Francesca and Dallie were not very likeable characters in the beginning, and though most characters grow and change, no two characters needed to more than these two. I liked that details of their lives (like Danny's death) popped up throughout the story, surprising us. The only thing that seemed a bit &quot;much&quot; was the large amount of time spent on some secondary characters (did Naomi, Chloe, Black Jack and Miranda need so much time in the story?) I did almost wish Francesca had bumped into Nicky, or someone from her old life at the end so they could have seen how much she had changed.In any case, this was a bit different, but the payoff at the end was great (as usual)."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I think this the only SEP romance that I hadn't read before. It's one of her first books and is longer and more detailed than some of her more recent works. It's a riches to rags back to riches story. The heroine, Francesca, is spoiled and annoying in the first part of the book. Several awful things happen to her, but instead of giving up, she rises to the challenge and really grows in character. The hero is Dallie, a laid-back golfer who has a strange relationship with his best friend/ex-wife. As always, the secondary characters are well developed and likable. This is the first story where we meet Teddy, the hero in the book she's writing now. The story is dated (similar to Glitter Baby), but I really enjoyed it. It is a good book to read or re-read in preparation for her new book which may be out in 2010."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I bought this book 10+ years ago and have read it over 20 times. I love it! I thought Francesca and Dallie were deliciously complex characters and the story that evolved over years and years was great. I have since actively sought out the rest of SEP's titles and while they have been somewhat interesting, they paled in comparison to Fancy Pants. A fascinating read."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"As with all S.E. Phillips books it was humourous with realistic characters. I was not dissapointed."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"The best romance novel I have ever read! Absolutely no doubt. I purchased it almost ten years ago, but have read it at least 20 times.

I couldn't pull myself away from it. Francesca is someone I can relate too.( unfortunalty) I loved this book!"},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Admittedly this might not be SEP's best book in terms of wit and fast pace, it is starting out really slow but it is picking up and is getting more and more interesting. It is different from all her later books maybe because it is focusing much more on character and less on snappy dialogue one is so used to in her other books. I therefore found it profounder and it had me so hooked I couldn't stop reading. If you give it a chance and don't get impatient with the slow start you might actually find out that it is one of SEP's most special stories."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"This book is was my fist sep.

What an absolutely HORRIBLE electronic edition. It's VERY obvious that the publishers ran an old paper copy of this book through an OCR scanner and couldn't even be bothered to proofread it. I've seen fan fiction written by 6th graders with fewer typos. There were numerous typos on EVERY FREAKING page! Unless you're dying to read it somewhere where there's no bookstore available, do yourself a favor and buy the paperback. Whatever happened to having pride in your work? If I were the publishers or SEP, I would be incredibly embarrassed by this edition."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"The protagonist does not have enough redeeming qualities. She is a one-dimensional, unlikeable character. She is rich, selfish, and beautiful--that's about it. Seeing her punished for being that way was not enough to keep me reading. The hero is more complex, and his job as a golf pro is an original one for a romantic hero. Some minor characters add interest, but not enough. This novel is not funny or entertaining."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"after reading this book i dont know if i should throw it against the wall or sigh to my hearts content..i gotta say that this is one of the worst i've read of SEP but i still stayed up all night and finished the book cause i simply could not put it down. the characters were very well defined and definitely had a lot of character in them but the plot eh...i wasn't too overjoy by the fact that he was already married and still in love ..eck. read if you have time but i suggest you move on the SEP more recents and FABulous books such as Heaven, TExas, Dream a little dream etc."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"... this book still gave me belly laugh after belly laugh. Just when you thought poor \\"Francie\\" couldn't dig herself any deeper, she gets herself into another scrape. That was actually my favorite section of the book. But she does make a success of things in the end and it's certainly fun to watch how she evolves. (There's a really funny section at the end of the book, too, with Holly Grace and her boyfriend.)"},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I wish I could give this book more than 5 stars! This was a great book. This book wasn't just a Romance it also had a few moral lessons, one of them being beauty is not that important and it is whats inside that counts. I also was pleased that Franscesca transformed into a strong willed woman on her own and not with the help of Dallie. I really would recommend this book, its a little slow in the beginning but don't stop reading if you get bored, keep reading, it will be worth it."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"You have the main character of Francesa who really grabs your attention. What she winds up doing with her life is truly inspirational. But, she falls for a guy who I don't find particularly interesting. And, I don't really see how they fit together. He is angry and treats her like dirt. I didn't care much for him at all, and couldn't picture these 2 together. SEP has a habit of always having angry men in her novels, who these woman have to tame. Still, in true SEP traditon, there is always a happy ending."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I'm very dismayed, How could SEP release such a lacking novel?? I must admit I'm an avid fan of \\"the Stars series\\" I've read the first 9 chapters waiting for the humor, passion, etc that I've come to expect from SEP.--Save your $$ skip this one. Written very well, but just nothing in this to keep your interest.Good Day"},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"The back of this book says \\"Come enjoy the adventure of a lifetime, an irresistible story that's touching, hilarious and passionate, all at the same time.\\" I'm not sure what book the were reviewing but it sure wasn't Fancy Pants! I managed to get 150 pages into the book before calling it quits. I could not imagine trying to wade through 350 more pages of these horrible, totally unlikeable characters. Don't waste your time or your money on this book. I wouldn't even check it out of the library. I am going to go and throw this book in the trash, something I have only done one other time in 50 years."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"a character i started out hating became someone admirable. a great story about changing for the better. a romance, yes, but really more about growing up and learning what is important."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I am not a huge fan of contemporary romances in general but there are two that have a home on my to keep/to reread shelves and one of them is Susan Elizabeth Phillips, Kiss An Angel, so I decided to give this one a chance. I think Susan is going to have to be an exception to my rule of not enjoying contemporary romances because this was a great read! It made me laugh, I could feel the sizzle between Francesca and Dallie and even at one point it even brought tears to my eyes. I posted on Twitter that romances usually do not bring on tears unless it's from laughing so hard. This book is filled with unexpected twists and turns. You may think you know what is coming next but expect the unexpected as they say in Survivor.Frannie was so clueless that it was hard to imagine people who live like her although I suppose to could equate her life style in the beginning as very Paris Hilton like. Frannie is not deliberately cruel but she does not have even a glimmer of what life is for those who are not born with a silver spoon in their mouths and are told being beautiful is the most important thing in life. As can be expected she makes an amazing turnaround in the book but not really for the reasons you would expect like winning Dallie's love. Some of the choices she makes were a total shock for me but they made the story seem more real as things did not immediately turn up roses for Frannie.Dallie also isn't your typical hero. Yes, he's handsome and charming at times but he can also be a real ass and I mean a REAL big ass. So at first I was totally rooting for him and joined him in looking down at Frannie but seeing Frannie grow and Dallie stagnate quickly had me shifting alliances to sympathize with her.Holly Grace, Dallie's first love, was a surprising addition to the story and she added a little twist to the story that was also unexpected but I really enjoyed. She and Dallie's best friend, Skeet, were some of the best supporting characters I've read in a long time.Put all together this was a fun, romping romance that I highly suggest for the romantic at heart."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I can't tell you how pleased I am to see Fancy Pants still in print. Its been a while since the last time I've read it. However, the plot and the characters are unforgettable. It makes me believe that love can be found it unexpected places, lost and then found again. I'm sure I'll have to enjoy this at least one more time.I'm embarrassed to admit that I haven't gotten around to Ms. Phillips other works, but I'm looking forward to correcting that mistake.By the way, did anyone else think the character of Holly Grace resembles Jerry Hall?"},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Fancy Pants isn't your normal romance. Case-in-point: at the beginning, the hero's a hedonistic drug addict, the heroine's a preternaturally spoiled rich bitch with an attitude problem the size of the state she finds herself in, and the back-ground characters provide a little more than color. Still, here's what I'm going to say about it: get this book. Do more than read it--savor it. Revel in it.Because there's a hell of a lot to love about it. The story, fortunately, allows for the meandering of fate and lives and--oh! la!--provides for oodles of character development. We get tons of background on the characters, which, I think, ultimately, allows for a greater understanding of their thoughts and actions. Fancy Pants, is, I think, an experience unto itself. It's not short; it's not breezy; it's not uncomplicated. It is, however, deep and long and involved with its characters, and I love what SEP does to them: one this book's greatest strengths is that its longevity allows for the characters to undergo great changes and even greater challenges, the likes of which usually aren't seen in romance novels. These characters evolve; they grow; they become more complicated and throw a few punches--and, in the end, all endeared themselves to me.I can see where other reviewers are coming from; in the beginning, Francesca and Dallie are no more endearing and sympathetic than a bullet in the head is. The thing is, I loved tracing their journey from then on out; they become infinitely more complex and sympathetic. The scenes and characters SEP imbues in Fancy Pants are unforgettable--from Francie wandering down a lonely highway in full Civil War era regalia, to the heartbreaking romance between Dallie and Hollie Grace (all told in flashback, and I swear, this part of the story made me cry), to Francie flinging the last bit of change in her pocket to the sky and making a clean break, the anguished final scenes with Francie's Red Dress of Evil--oh, goodness, I could never recount them all.There's a lot to love here. The dialogue (internal or otherwise) is smart and snappy; the pacing is languid when it needs to be, and breakneck when it needs to be; and I can't say enough about the writing. Oh, the writing, the cadence of the words, the palpable imagery: SEP has never, in my opinion, done better than she has here."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"From the blurb on the back cover of my paperback edition, I expected a comedy. This is not a comedy. It has a few humorous moments but overall it is about growing up: Chronologically and emotionally. Enough other reveiwers have given a synopsis of the plot so I won't bother except to say that the back stories are very necessary. This is a long book but well paced so it went by quickly for me. As for all of those cracks about the 80's clothes, remember this was written in the 80's. I can't give it 5 stars because that is reserved for her best works and this doesn't quite meet the level of writing that she displayed in \\"Heaven, Texas\\"."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"It has flawed characters, who eventually change and improve themselves, in different ways and with very different motives. I love this author. I loved this book. Although not mandatory, I recommend reading this book before reading Lady Be Good, because of the sequence of characters. This author also delights me with wit and humor. I laughed out loud more with Lady Be Good than I did with this book, but I consider them both great. Sexual content: mild. Genre: contemporary romance.OTHER BOOKS:For a list of my reviews of other Susan Elizabeth Phillips books, see my 5 star review of \\"Glitter Baby\\" posted 1/15/09."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"The background story was too long and a tad too boring for this book. I nearly put it down after reading the first 100 or so pages and they haven't met each other yet. If I didn't peak at the ending of the book, I wouldn't have finished this book at all. The relationship of the couple is a little hard to understand, mainly because it seems that they're not together a lot. I think SEP could have done much better w/ this book, considering her writing skills in the other books."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"SEP's books normally are winners to me but unfortunately not this one. I agree with a previous reviewer who wrote that this book has too much back information. While I understand the need for an author to fill in her readers with some background info about the main characters, SEP certainly went overboard with this book. I kept skipping pages & pages of useless (to me) information about Francesca's grandmother, mother, etc.. and remember thinking \\"Just get to the point & give me more of Dallie and Francesca already..!\\"But then again, that's ok.. since this was written quite a long time ago, and by comparing this book with her more recent ones I can see the amazing growth SEP has gone through as an author.If you're a first time SEP reader, I would suggest you pick up her more recent ones: Match Me If You Can, Ain't She Sweet, etc."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Having come to this book after reading &quot;IT had to Be You&quot; and most other SEP books I have to say I was disappointed with this work. The first half -establishing the background of the main character -was way too long. The most interesting part of the story was the character transformation of the heroine but this was lost amongst all the other sub-plots!! Still love Ms Phillips' work but Dream A Little Dream and Heaven Texas are much better than this."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"I couldn't help myself. After reading about the first 100 pages, I couldn't put the book down so I stayed up all night long finishing this book. I enjoyed the difference in style here than in the other books by Susan Elizabeth Phillips that I have read. That is one things that I love about her, each of the three books that I have read have been written in a different manner. It's weird but I like it. But back to this book, I liked the backstory on the characters before and after they had gotten together. That's not really something that other authors put several chapters into doing. They usually take several pages. Furthermore, this is one of the best romance novels I have read. I get a kick out of SEP's character interactions. She is terrific with dialogue and situation. I can't wait to read all the others I have missed out on."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"After devouring all of SEP's other books, I had this one on order for over a month. I finally received it, settled down and was thoroughly disappointed. Icouldn't get into it, it was very slow moving, the story unbelievable and the cat fight where everyone stood around watching was uncalled for. I was really disappointed. Sorry."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Okay I admit about 5 years ago I bought the original book but I could not get through it because it started off to slow. Well I decided to try it again when I saw it at a used bookstore and I was very glad I did. This book was to funny for words, and I do not think I have seen anything like the fight scene between Fancy and Dallas in anything I have ever read. Buy this one buy do not put it down after the first hundred pages or so it gets a whole lot better."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"This is the third Susan Elizabeth Phillips' books I've read. This was not the usual &quot;stay up all night and read&quot; kind of book. I found it slow getting into and hard to get interested in the characters. The book was complicated as far as characters go...Francie and her European ties/Dallie with ties to golfing and Holly Grace having been married to Dallie at one time and now Francie's best friend. It captured my interest midway in the book; however, after that I really thought it was good. If you are a devoted Susan Elizabeth Phillips fan, this is not her typical book. Her other works are great. This book is mediocre in my eyes."},{"Title":"Fancy Pants","review":"Don't buy this book! It was sooooo boring and I couldn't get into it. A real let down after SEP's other books - try First Lady, Nobody's Baby But Mine or Dream A Little Dream instead. At least they have some zap and keep you interested...Fancy Pants on the other hand sent me to sleep zzzzzzzzzz! SORRY!"},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I really could'nt get into this novel, I only finished it because I started it. The characters were unrealist and boring except for maybe Veronica and her crazy famliy. To me this book was a waste of my time."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"The novel was interesting enough to find out what the over-the-edge characters would do next. However, the women, except Desiree, were mean, stupid, and/or unrealistic. We all know women that exhibit negative traits, but that's because no one is perfect. What's more, no one seemed able have a decent relationship with a Black man (unless the Black man was with a White woman). Instead the only positive relationships were made up of interracial couples. In fact the only Black male relationship explored was with a Black gay male who was involved with a man of mixed heritage. Not even he could have a relationship with an African American person, male or female. In my opinion, the author has major issues with Black women, and she may be a little color struck as well."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"Gingersnaps was a ok first novel for D.W.T. I found the book interesting BUT there were a few problems. Too many characters. The focus should have been just Aletha &amp; Desiree. There was not enough character development on Veronica(which would have been nice). I didn't like the way her boyfriend just walked out on her. Another problem was Louise. It seems that Louise was just thrown in the book without any real background on her. That whole ex-nun thing was confusing to me. If Delorys would just stick to one or two characters and develop them, then her next book will be a 5 star novel"},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"GINGERSNAPS was an ok book and it kept the flow going, but the closer to the end of the novel, the pace sped up so quickly and so many characters were inserted at one time, it seemed unfair to the reader and to the characters that didn't get their fair share of the spotlight. Characters, I might add, that deserved more than others. Overall, I hope that her second novel has more consistancy in pacing and characters than this debut novel."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I've decided to comment because I found the book to be thought provoking and a personal challenge to me. I have been primarily attracted to and committed to Black men. However, their lack of reciprocal commitment to Black women has always baffled me. I admit that African-American men and women are going to have to work very hard at building positive relationships and if this book helps us get any closer to that goal then I applaude the author. I admit the author sort of goes a &quot;little&quot; over-board with her depiction of the female characters and their neuroses, problems and prejudices but after all it is FICTION. I commend the author for her effort and courage to challenge sisters to re-think our struggle (for power/control) with our men. (And if this shoe doesn't fit you, then ....)This book also made me question other girlfriends and some of my male friends, literally, engaging them in conversations about what is wrong and what do they desire from their relationships. This is the first romance novel that made me search myself for why my &quot;tall, dark and handsome&quot; is still in paperback and not in my bed."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I found the plot of this book very degrading to African American women. The author, who happends to be a woman, focused on to many different characters instead of developing fully 2 or 3 main characters. I found this book to be extremely wordy and I could never fully grasped where the book was going. I wish I would have read the customer reviews prior to buying this book instead of having to warn you about it now."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I am guilty of judging a book by it's cover. How I regret going that. This book was one of the most disappointing I have ever read. I realize Delorys Welch-Tyson is new to creating literature. However, I never imagined being quite so disappointed upon completing this book. Most of her characters remained underdeveloped. The book should have simply focused on the two main characters, Althea and Desiree. There was not enough dialogue and Althea was portrayed as an unbelievably immature 40ish year old woman. I wish Ms. Welch-Tyson better luck on her next novel. Maybe that novel will be more than just an attractive cover."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"Incomplete storylines, unrealistic characters, details we don't need to know about and your Snaps were numbered incorrectly. WHY ARE THE SISTERS ALL CRAZY? WHERE IS THE LOVE? WHO WAS THE EDITOR? :( As an avid reader of black writers I am truly disappointed and cannot understand how this book could have have been found worthy of publishing. The potential of this book has been LOST. Please before you publish your next book, DEVELOP YOUR CHARACTERS, BE SURE TO COMPLETE ALL STORYLINES and please, please, please EDIT, EDIT, EDIT. Don't get me wrong, this book has at least 3 storylines that could developed into books. So I hope Ms. Welch-Tyson takes this as constructive criticism from someone who knows what they like to read. Finally, if you really loved yourself and saw your life as a beautiful thing you would be in that all too short line of &quot;FOLK&quot; portraying sisters on a more positive note.PEACE OUT"},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"Unlike many books about black women this book doesnt suggest their main problem is black men. Rather it suggests black women should take ownership of their own happiness and be responsible about achieving this. Although the issue of dating across racial lines is promiently featured in this book, that isn't what this book is about. Rather it suggests the beauty of black women can be enhanced with a letting go of anger about men and a commitment to one's own happiness.I did not see the dialouge as sterotypical I think many people, in a mass culture speak in generalities, but underneath the surface the real issues become apparent, as we get to know each other. As I got futher into the book I found many comments that were similar to those I often hear from women, I've known. A good read, a different perspective, I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I tried several times to complete this book and I found it a waste of time, I wouldn't suggest this book.

The characters, except for Desiree and Aletha, were not well developed, the plot seemed very unreal, and with every character there seemed to be an issue of race in one way or another, mostly negative. I think the author should have left out the other four characters because, apparently, they lacked depth. Judging from the outcome of this book it seemed that she could not sucessfully handle all six characters in one book. It was truly pathetic! Ms Tyson needs think twice before she gives up her day job!!"},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"Started out great, but bogged down toward the end---not enough characterization on some of the &quot;gingersnaps,&quot; only focusing it seems on three of them.

Come on!"},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"This book is awful to put it mildly. No plot, no point to it, no nothing. Where was the editor?

I have to say that I was slightly dissappointed. All the &quot;Gingersnaps&quot; had some serious issues. Aletha was totally manipulative, jealous, controlling and demanding. I could find no redeeming qualities in her character at all. There was no reason that I could see to even have Veronica's character in the book other than to show the connection between her and Marshall's lover Eric. The idea of Louise, as an ex-nun who had a child out of wedlock and had never married writing a book about how to get and keep a good black man was totally inplausible. Debra was another one that I felt really had no reason to be in the book. Her character along with Veronica's were never really developed. Janeen had to be naive and just plain blind to not know that Marshall was gay. The way his character was described in the book it was as if it was so obvious that you had to be deaf, dumb and blind not to pick up on it. Desiree was the only character in the book who did not seem to have major &quot;issues.&quot; Overall, the book was okay. I think there were too many characters to the point that some were not really developed at all. I will be interested to read this authors next effort."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I DIDN'T GET IT.THERE WERE TOO MANY CHARACTERS THAT HAPPENED TO BE INTERTWINED SOMEHOW WITH ONE ANOTHER.

Aletha and Desiree, Snaps 1 &amp; 2, were the only characters that we really got to know. The other women featured appeared to be undeveloped drop-ins. The book would have needed another 300-600 pages to give them more depth. If they had not been made main characters (per the flap), perhaps the reader would not have been so anxious for more on them. Fortunately, the Christmas dinner at the Browns made up for some of the lull. I believe that this author has potential. Please take the criticism given by your readers constructively, not negatively. Your next work will benefit from it. Please keep writing because everyone deserves another chance.. God Bless!"},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I was terribly disappointed in this book. The author's portrayal of black men was typical, while white men were shown as kind, understanding, etc., etc., etc. And who was she trying to convince that Jewish people are not white? The objective of this book seemed to be to push Black women in the arms of any man who isn't Black. Shame on you!!!"},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I can't say enough BAD things about this awful book. I was disgusted. I was appalled. And if I didn't know any better I would believe she (the author) did not even write this book and it's some kind of big joke. Let me just tell you what's wrong with this book: First, the Black female characters are completely stereotypical bordering on Sambos. Every Black female (except for the one married to white Jewish man) was neurotic, crazy, self-absorbed, idiotic, self-centered, delusional, un-enlightened, un-intelligent, backward, country, and shallow. I'm not exxagerating. I was amazed at how much this author seemed to HATE Black women. It was dripping from the page. Second, I was very upset that in a time where Black authors have experienced a resurgence of popularity that this woman could write such a negative portrayal of Black women. As if Black women don't get enough of this in the media. I'm highly suprised with this author's portrayal of her own group; it's seething with self-hate and self-contempt. Third, one character mentioned to someone she wished to visit the motherland. The mental reaction to the person she was talking said to himself (a Black man) that her dream of visiting Africa was a &quot;plebian pretension.&quot; Can you believe that?? No African Americans know exactly where they come from, but a dream to visit Africa is certainly no &quot;plebian pretension;&quot; is more of a sincere dream to visit where you know your ancestors onced lived. Finally, all the happy people in the book were either gay or married to non-Blacks. And all the women who wished to marry men like their fathers (Black) were helplessly stupid and self-centered. She even had a scene in the book where a Black woman, her Jewish husband, a Chines American and her Jewish husband sat in the kitchen and BASHED Black women and proceeded to blame any relationship problems on them (Black women). I was really ashamed that this book even got published. So, readers of Black fiction, please do not waste your time or money on this book. If you want to read something worth your while read: Toni Morrison, J. California Cooper, Walter Mosley, Yolanda Joe, or Sheneska Jackson-- Black authors that show Black foibles AND triumphs."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"Six women who live around the New York Metropolitan area are facing another Christmas...STILL SINGLE!!!

But after that...the book just seemed a soap-box for espousing TOO many philosophies about life and relationships- something that should be saved for a non-fiction book. On the one hand, DWT broadened horizons beyond the usual black-only male/female relationships. Many of the thoughts expressed about race were what we think in reality, but don't talk freely about. However, the end was SO unrealistic! How did Aletha finally win the award, after a man had been killed on the show? Why didn't we get to see Louise- the ex nun, develop pre/post confession? Why is it that Reggie popped back up at the end of the book, having finished his new novel? AND, what was up with Desiree's short story? I mean, you get the gist of why she wrote the story, but why would the author decide to make that the epilogue?! The final words of the novel tell you &quot;they all lived happily ever after&quot;, but I would like to have actually SEEN the characters transform, as opposed to a general summary. It seems that DWT tired of writing and the book, and stopped, just to have an ending. I recommend the book for it's varying views, but it's not one to leave you smiling or laughing."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I am an avid reader, often buying books I feel will be worth it in hardback..Well this book was definitely not worth it. I finished it because whenever I read I feel the need to know what happened to the characters, I guess I get involved with their lives. Well Miss Welch did give me that satisfaction but it seems that in the end she said &quot;oh my it's too long&quot;, and therefore skipped to the ending without popular develpment. Oh well I guess next time her book will have to be a paperback!!!"},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I thought the book was great. I could really relate to most of the women portrayed in the book, either myself, a friend, or relative at some point in our lives. At first when I read it was the story about 6 women, I figured I might get lost or confused. But , this talented author made it easy and interesting for me to keep up with everyone single one of them. I read some of the negative reviews given, and I have to ask, &quot;What book were they reading?&quot; I have to say to Mrs. Delorys Welch-Tyson,&quot; Good Job&quot; homegirl and keep up the good work, I am awaiting your next piece of work!"},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I heard how great this book was. A friend passed it on to me. How happy I am I DID NOT spent the money on it. Snap One, Snap Two etc, reminds me of going to the bakery, buying a box cookies, but only to discover they were all broken and different flavors. It is obvious the writer believes she is the next great female author, as the she flung BIG words throughout the book. Is she REALLY trying to write a book or vent about HER life."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I have the same opinion voiced by so many others here. This book was a big disappointment for me. I was so excited about reading it too! I just didn't get the point."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"The writer has a way to go. LONG way. Since this new upswing in AA contemporary fiction has come about, it seems like there is no standard for what's acceptable. This novel reflects that. Not all writers are great storytellers. This book was all smoke and mirrors. I pity the tree that gave its life in vain.And yes, I did notice all the (bogus) 4 star rating that came in Nov/Dec. (see below) Not only was the style of the reviewers writing the same, but did s/he have to use all caps each time? I hope that wasn't the author giving bogus 4 stars. That would truly be pathetic."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"Writing a book is one way of expressing your feelings particularly about things that gripe you. Author Welch-Tyson seems to have a gripe about almost everything and plays out her feelings in the personalities of her characters, most notably Aletha (a very uncomplementary composite of an Oprah Winfrey-like character). Unfortunately, all of the African-American women (except for Desiree who is married to a Jew), seem to be unrealistic and emotionally unstable. Ms. Welch-Tyson will undoubtedly offend many readers with her overly decriptive references to skin-color, hair texture, social position, and illegitimacy. I feel this book tried to cover too many controversial subjects. Christmas at the Brown's was somewhat ridiculous, but still amusing. The murder on the talk show was just plain ridiculous and very unnecssary."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"This book was okay and just okay. It wasn't a can't put it down book, I was kind of disappointed. Generally I read the customer reviews but this time I did'nt. The ending was funny. I got kick out of Althea having to rent a date and finding out that he was looking for the same type of man she was. I didn't like the jumping around from character to character and the only characters that really had an ending were Althea and Desiree. Maybe I missed it, I really don't know what the bottom line was."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"This was a book that I looked forward to reading, but after reading it I was disappointed and confused. It just seemed like something was missing, like the thread that tied everything together. I could not understand why Debra and Veronica were major characters. Those 2 characters were not well developed and did not really contribute to the novel. I have to admit although, Christmas at the Browns made the book worth the time it took to read!"},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"The author had good ideals; however the characters could have been developed more. For example, Janeen, Veronica, and Debra could have been flushed out more. Also, the author appeared to rely too heavily on the thesaurus. However, I would share the book with a friend. Overall good read."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I buy a lot of contemporary African American fiction and really looked forward to reading this book. Sure enough, it start out fine, but by chapter 3, I started losing interest and never regained it. With the exception of Desiree &amp; Aletha, there was nothing there to make us care, much less want to read about, the other &quot;main&quot; characters. Most of the storyline was both disjointed and unrealistic--it left me saying to myself &quot;and?&quot;. Too much space was wasted on minor characters who brought nothing to the overall story; it seems as if they were thrown in as an afterthought. The author repeatedly touched on a subject that many African Americans are sensitive about; skin color &amp; hair texture. I understand that descriptions are necessary to develop pictures in our minds, but we were reminded too often about &quot;the deep-brown-skinned, big-legged empress&quot;; &quot;her beautiful, banana-colored, hazel-eyed. curly-haired daughter&quot;; or &quot;her nappy locks, high, round black-lady derriere and exotic cherry-wood complexion&quot;. It was just too much--a lot of wasted space describing people that the reader had a hard time caring about."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"Seems like most people didn't care for this book, but I loved it. I think if you just lighten up and take it as total entertainment, it's great. It's fun and juicy, like an African-American version of Melrose Place. I lept laughing out loud and whooping it up during the party scene towards the end of the book. It's no &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot;, but God, was it entertaining! I can't wait for another novel from her."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I awaited this book with great anticipation. I purchased this book as a possible selection for my book club. I was thoroughly disappointed. I truly hated this book. I hated the plot, I couldn't believe the characters. The characters were very extreme, either extremely evil or so perfect; nothing in between. The way the chapters were tied together was very lame. Dropped characters without any &quot;real&quot; ending. I cared NOTHING about these characters, with the exception of one, the black women were portrayed as evil, mean, nasty, vindictive. Not all black women have those agendas portrayed in the book, not all black women feel that way about men. I just couldn't get over this book. The ONLY reason why I finished this book was \`cause I hate to not finish a book, I spent my $16.50, I darned well was going to finish this book. I kept hoping that these women would have some kind of &quot;earth-shattering&quot; experience to change their personalities; I realize as the story was getting close to the end, that it wasn't going to happen. What's wrong with wanting to date black men &quot;exclusively&quot;? What? You will only have true happiness if you sample/date outside of your race? What was Ballantine Books thinking? I know that the publishing houses now realize that African American people read and spend major money on books; but, does this mean that anyone with a &quot;waiting-to-exhale&quot; story can write a book? Don't get me wrong, I firmly believe in supporting African-American Artists; but, not if they put out crap like this. Not only is this book not worth buying in any form (hardback or paperback), it's not even worth getting it out from the Library."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I found a copy of this novel and the author's other novel, Ladyfingers at the library during my vacation in Nice. When I started it I could not put it down. Athough, we women in Europe are not as confrontational as those in the States, we definitely have similar problems. Confusion about roles, a man's curious behavior in relationships and the homosexual issues are universal, just with a different flavor.I enjoyed the humor of the story. Being a Parisian, I especially appreciated the unique nuances in the relationships of the New York City women. The main flaw in this novel is that certain characters weren't developed enough: Louise Washington, and particularly, Debra Parker."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"Three stars? oh give me a break!! This was a great book!! It kept you guess and was funny as heck!"},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"This author didn't make black men or women look or sound very good at all. She seemed to imply that black male/female relationships are futile. A self-hating odyssey of an confused black woman. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Perhaps she should get to know more black men."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"If you reading this review before you buy this book, DON'T DO IT!!! Save your money! The book was awful. Disappointed is a mild word to use. Our book club read the flap and thought the book would describe us (bold, strong and spicy)...we changed our book club name after we read this book. The only good thing about this book was the artwork. I guess it is true..you can't judge a book by it's cover."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I would like to say thanks Ms. Welch-Tyson!!!!. This book was fun and I could not put it down. First of all it is definitely realistic and it was full of fun to read. Yes, I would leave it on the subway as a gift to make someone else's day. Can't wait for your next book. Keep jotting down your thoughts, they are great so far!!!! Your cover was the BOMB!!!"},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I read this book last November thinking that I would find something interesting from a fresh, new voice in African American fiction. I was very disappointed as I read further into the book. There were too many characters in the story that I was left wondering about at the end of the book. However, even though I did not enjoy her first novel, I think that it will be interesting to see what her second novel will be like."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I enjoyed the book, it took several chapters before I was hooked. I commend the author for the use of diverse characters."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I must agree with every reader who gave this book one star. I was put off reading about the Armani, Bill Blass, Chanel etc., etc., etc. chi-chi stuff. Who cares who wore what from whom and what color it was, I wanted something to get interested in. Skipping around with no end in sight is maddening. I was left cold in the attempts to create characters who went no where. They should have been more fully developed than they were. It took me forever to finish this book and then I found myself skipping whole pages to do so. I'm sorry Delorys, it really could have used some more work."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"GINGERSNAPS WILL BE AROUND FOR A LONG TIME. IT HAS WELL DEVELOPED CHARACTERS, A FAST MOVING PLOT AND ENOUGH MESSAGERS TO REWARD A SECOND READING.

I need to go on &quot;Forgive and Forget&quot; and apologize to Terry McMillan. Just when I demonized her for her rough and hostile treatment of Black men in her novels, along comes an author that makes her look like an absolute angel. Gingersnaps is one of the most blatant attacks on Black-on-Black love relationships that I have ever read! It's clear the author of this book had an agenda besides telling a story, as there were absolutely no positive Black man/Black woman relationships featured in the book. The Black woman character who who expressed in interest in dating only Black men was presented as some sort of hostile, racist, borderline psychotic with lesbian tendancies. Everyone else presented had some serious personal and relationship issues, that, as the author brazenly shows, can only be solved by hooking up with anyone who is not of African descent. Did anyone else notice that the only character in the book presented as intelligent, mature, and grounded was a Black woman psychologist married to a White man (hmmm... I wonder what message is being sent there?). All of the Black on Black relationships in the book were dsyfunctional, and none of the book's characters exhibited any sort of mental and spiritual maturing you would normally like to see in a character as a story progresses. Even the talk show host never showed any signs of growth or maturity, even after a man was killed on the set of her show. Some of the other reviews I have read said this book should open Black women's minds up to as to their dating options (meaning date anything other than Black!) Well, this book doesn't subtly &quot;open your mind up&quot; to dating options, it blantantly blows it apart with a shotgun! If you want to date interracially, that's your biz, but don't dog your brothers and sisters because of it. Hey, if I'm overreacting, I'm sorry, but I'm a Black man and I'm a little sensitive to some to the mess presented in this book. Terry, I apologize! You weren't so bad after all!"},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"Actually, it was atrocious. I don't think I need to say much, because most of the other reviews hit on everything that's bad about the book: too many characters, only two of which are paid enough attention to; making Black women into caricatures to drive home the author's point of finding happiness in a relationship with someone of another race; using outlandish adjectives to describe the most common things, just to name a few. And what was with the author's obsession with Jews? All of the characters were unrealistic. Aletha is the only one I can buy, because she was a celebrity, so I could see her being that self-absorbed and expecting things to always go her way. But Desiree is just so PERFECT! Just because she's a psychologist, and married to a Jewish man? Get real! Marrying outside of your race does not guarantee marital bliss anymore than marrying someone of the same race does. I was pretty interested in Veronica's story, but the author left us hanging. Debra was absolutely ridiculous, and I can't tell if Tyson was implying that her negative experiences with Black men had driven her to lesbianism, or if she was just in such denial that she kept dating men even though she really liked women. Either way, that character looked like a total idiot, and Tyson did a bang-up job of offending lesbians, Black men, and Black women in one fell swoop. Janeen and Louise were both pretty minimal characters, and just plain stupid. Too stupid for me to even waste time writing about.Here's what I got out of reading Gingersnaps: psychologists, Jewish MEN, and people in interracial relationships have got their stuff together. The rest of us, particularly Black women who want to be in relationships with Black men, are just crazy."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I really, really wish I read the reviews from here before I purchased this book. I couldn't even finish reading it, I thought I was going out of my mind with confusion and boredom. I thought the dialogue was too long,too pointless, with too many vague flashbacks. I felt the novel was more of the writers personal views on matters being voice through her characters than it was actually a &quot;story&quot;. The characters were not well developed at all, and they were unrealistic to me. It's sad to think that forty year old women would act as childish and immature as she presented her characters to be. You'd think at that age a woman would be more mature and grounded. I'm sorry, maybe her next efforts will be better."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I don't think so. The woman portrayed here are down right scary. I couldn't believe the stereotype of an angry black woman was perpertrated in this book.This was a sad commentary on what this author thought that successful black woman are. The only character that I liked was Desiree and her husband. And she had issues as well but not to the extinct that her sister Aletha did. Aletha went into her boyfriends home with a key that he did not no that she had and shot him because he was in bed with a white woman. And I quote as she shoots him \\"Nigger I own you\\". What kind of mess is that. Granted she had a right to be upset but this was just to much. Then the main characters brother decides that he is gay and leaves his wife for another man. Now if anyone she be upset it should be her. Veronica is mad at her baby's daddy because he runs off to Switzerland but comes back to see his baby to make sure that the child is his. Veronica had a right to be angry. The boyfriend decides he is going to go back to Switzerland and only date the swiss woman because they are so gentle. Bull....This story was just to much junk. The straight black men only wanted white women. There were to many characters to keep the story straight. I read the other reviews so I had to read this story. Just downright SCARY, SCARY, SCARY..."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I was recently given a copy of Gingersnaps and stayed up all night reading it. It was hilarious and thought provoking. The story is about a group of powerful women who are all linked together by a talkshow host. The message of the story, as I see it, is that women should try to avoid taking the power of their professions into the bedroom with their mates."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"Gingersnaps, by Delorys Welch-Tyson is a novel of six, connected, humorous, short stories linked together, each one called a \\"Snap\\". The novel shows the various ways women make mistakes in their quest to find a suitable mate. I enjoyed the portrayals of haughty, fabulous and successful African American New York City women, and how they came to be who they are. There are also many compelling issues discussed in this novel, some which may be disturbing, yet thought provoking. I enjoyed this novel tremendously. It was a usique approach to the popular African-American, 'how to land a brutha' folktales. I'm looking forward to Welch-Tysons other works."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"The high drama of the six swaggeringly successful divas kept me laughing throughout the story. The family Christmas party was truly inspired. The men were fully developed characters (I wish I could meet any one of those guys. Who are they? Where are they?) as were the women. New York City seems like a very challeging place to live and find love. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in trying to learn to communicate better with the opposite sex."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"Amazing how a second read can change one's original opinion. The first time I read it I thought the author was insulting and condescending to black women. Just a lot of malarkey. Then I read it again, and realized that it was satire, and had some terrific dialogue and interactions between the characters. I began to wish I knew people myself who I could have those types of constructive dialogues with. The relationship between the two sisters was enlightening and fun.Gingersnaps is deceptive and I definitely recommend to anyone who has read it, to give it a second read. You might be surprised!"},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was fun, very readable, with some great dialogue. The story keeps moving, things keep happening, and every character's thoughts and intentions are clear. It was fun, and I was looking for a sequel from this author. Delorys, where are you?? I hope you didn't let these naysaying reviewers stop you from picking up the story where it left off!We should remember that this is FICTION and not take it so personally. As an African-American woman, I have known variations on all those characters and their friends. But this is true of just about any fiction -- it's a story.Enjoyed reading this fun one."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"This is one of the worst books I've read recently. The characters are so one dimensional and offensive, I don't see how the author could stand them long enough to write the book. Only Althea and Desiree have some basis in reality, although Althea is little too selfish and Desiree is a little too perfect. Don't waste your money on this book!"},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"Ms. Welch-Tyson made the characters very real. Of these six highly successful Black women only one of them sseemed to have her head on straight. And that is very sad. However, this book was well written with characters who were as real as my right hand.Any book that can make me feel like the characters are my relatives, friends,or neighbors is a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"This book was okay even though I had a difficult time getting into the read. Some of it was too Hollywood and pretentious. Aletha's and Desiree's parent's were quite humorous and should have had more of a role in the story. I would have enjoyed the book more if Ms. Welch-Tyson had not left the other characters hanging."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"This book had a good start, but after the first few pages I wanted to leave it in a New York City transit subway station but I was scared I would be fined for dicarding garbage."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I feel that the author included to many characters whose lives where entwined. Although, I finished reading, I would not recommend to anyone. Keep trying Delorys!!!"},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"When I read the preview of this book I thought it was going to be about sisters that had it together and had something to say. This book turn out to be a bunch of dsyfunctional sisters who all had self inflected issues. I read alot of books and this one was definetly a waste of time. Can someone please tell me &quot;What was the point&quot;."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I thought this book was a waste of my time. The author devoted too much space to skin color, interracial dating/marriage, wealth, and Desiree. I thought that there were 6 snaps, what happend to the other 4 (I forgot about Althea). Someone said that the author was describing herself a little in the text, I think she was. She could have did better. I won't pass this book along to my friends or family, because they would think I had lost my mind reading trash like this."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I enjoyed this book and have passed it to one of my sister/friends. The beginning started off a little slow but once I got to reading I was like this book is good. I read the reviews before I read the book. I wanted to read for myself and I'm very glad I did. Some of the readers I felt were a little harsh with their review. I'm sure that each novel will get better...Delorys keep the faith and God Bless!"},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"This book kept me reading for &quot;that big moment&quot; that never came. I finished the book feeling like I just wasted several days of my time. It is not at all what I expected. There was no excitement but the author kept making it seem like she was getting to the apex but never developed the story that far. This was merely a collection of short stories that really had no point.Better luck next time."},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I could not finish this book, A FIRST!!! I read the first half and paged through the rest to see if it improved, it did not. There is really no plot just scenarios created so the characters can convey the authors messages. Mrs. Welch Tyson has embraced every negative sterotype about an array of different ethic groups. * We have mean angry Black Women (the real problem is all of these characters are insane) *Dominating and angry Jewish Women(the Jewish men are painted as loving and caring and lucky to have escaped these women). *Man-Hating Lesbians *Black men who are afraid to Commit. *Gay Men who deceive their straight female lovers (this is by no means a complete list of of the insults). The only sane black women is Desiree(sanity provided by her loving, successful and faithful Jewish Husband) as a matter of fact most of the characters find happiness when they make the decision to find lovers and mates of a different ethic group, There is a very real push to get Black Women to explore other options. SO WE TOO CAN BE HAPPY! RIGHT"},{"Title":"Gingersnaps","review":"I read an awful lot of books in my spare time. I felt as though this book was a waste of my time overall. I'm sure with more practice that Mrs. Welch-Tyson will improve. It generally takes me 3 days to read a 300-page novel, this was one was reasonably short and it took me a week. The characters lacked a lot of something,I just can't figure out what that something is yet. Good luck next time."},{"Title":"Martin B-57 Canberra: The Complete Record","review":"Outstanding. This one word sums up how this book impresses me. I served with the 8th TBS at Phan Rang, Vietnam and, sadly, took part in stripping the birds of weapons for their last journey home. This airplane and the wonderful people I served with have a special place in my memory and my heart. Mr. Mikesh has done a wonderful job of capturing the full life of the Canberra with terrific pictures and insightful facts and details of this airplane. Since he flew the bird for quite some time he was able to flesh out the aircraft's story instead of simply compiling a book based on facts and figures. His book brought back some wonderful memories for me and I am grateful Mr. Mikesh took the time to write it. If you have any interest in military aircraft, get this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Martin B-57 Canberra: The Complete Record","review":"To those who flew and maintained it, the B-57 was a way of life.

I grew up as a child of an Air Force officer and enjoyed the life of being around aircraft, uniforms and all that goes with this life. I found the book to be very knowledgeable and informative. It is accurate and has many subjects that at the time were not allowed to be discussed openly (EX:The Patricia Lynn). I discovered this book by chance (I was looking for a birthday gift for my father)and was very pleased and surprised that it had a photograph of my father, who also was not aware of this book or of him being in the book. My father talks about alot of the history in this book and shares alot of the stories of the people he knows and of certain events. To the author, thank you for writing and taking the time to reware these men and publish what alot of people did and still do.

From page one to three-hundred plus this book is a page turner.It all starts with Anna's wild, uncontrollable behavior that gets her sent to Camp Archstone on Andros Island. Everything is mechanical in this wilderness camp for bad girls. Every girl has a story to tell and Anna doesn't know who she can trust. On a camping trip something goes horribly wrong and the real adventure begins. The girls must fight for their lives and the reader feels as if they are truly a bad girl. There are so many different scenarios, and secrets living within the island. The whole time Anna has flashbacks of her own secret that she's hiding. Who will make it to safety, if anyone?This book was a great read. The ending wasn't as strong, it was kind-of sappy in my opinion. Other than that, this makes for a great summer read. I would say it's for the young adult 18+ crowd."},{"Title":"Bad Girls","review":"Bad Girls-A Novel is a book! Yes, people it's a book too! The celebrity gossip blogs are so busy focused on the movie no one is taking the time to actually read the book. The early buzz is that Hilary Duff or Lindsay Lohan may be attached to the movie. The book was written by Alex McAuley. The book reads like a movie. You can tell when you read it that cinema is in the future. The story opens up with a action packed scene. Anna is on the run. Two men on her trail. She is out in the wilderness, scared and hoping that she won't be found. When \\"The Boxer\\" and the big fat man finally catch her she struggles and gives them the silent treatment. This scene actually is a little foreshadowing. Anna's parents arrange for her to be sent away due to her \\"out of control\\" behavior. This is a good book a very interesting read. If you like Lost or remember the movie Lord of the Flies you will like this book. What I didn't like about the book is that some of the characters seem one dimensional. Perhaps I was picking up on the fact that a man was writing female characters. The cover is awesome but the title is a little unorignal. How many movies, books and songs have been titled \\"Bad Girls\\" over the years? I felt like they were acting in the book. But it's a good book and probably will make a good movie."},{"Title":"Bad Girls","review":"I liked this book alot. It takes a very interesting book for me to finish the whole book. I finished it in a week. I can't wait for the next Alex Mcaulay novel to come."},{"Title":"Bad Girls","review":"I bought this book based on the cover art and the fact that MTV published it. It exceeded my expectations and got better and better as I read. The main character, Anna, is not that \\"bad\\" but is sent to a boot camp anyway by her somewhat insane parents. She makes friends with some of the girls she meets there, and enemies too. Then the book starts to become like Lord of the Flies with a Gossip Girl element when the camp falls apart and Anna has to run or fight. Some readers might find it somewhat scary or disturbing, but I could not put it down."},{"Title":"Bad Girls","review":"Feeling they have lost control as their sixteen years old child Anna continually defies them and breaks all their rules, the religious Wheelers turn to a radical solution. They hire \\"soldiers\\" from Camp Archstone to abduct their daughter and take her to a remote Bahamas Island for several weeks of boot camp. Anna thought her parents were too strict, but they seem permissive as she lives in a survival camp run in the strictest of military styles; insubordination leads to harsh punishment from the in your face 24/7 staff.Anna fears her bunk mates whose behavior seems over the edge past sanity. However, her terror turns to outright horror when on a forced several miles hike up the mountain someone kills the leader; the others react just as frightened. Everyone panics with the girls fleeing into the jungle while deviant drug dealers pursue them with plans to rape and then kill the teens. To Anna the biggest fear remains her violent bunk mates who cannot understand teamwork is the only way to save their lives.BAD GIRLS is a heart pumping thriller that never slows down from the moment that Anna is abducted with the concerned unsure consent of her parents and never slows down until the final tropical jungle feverish confrontation. The story line feels like a gender bending Lord of the Flies crossed with female prison movies like The Big Doll House and The Big Bird Cage. Still this is an adrenalin action-packed tale with the audience rooting for Anna to survive her ordeal.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Bad Girls","review":"To put it simply: This book was amazing. It combines drama/comedy/and suspense. I couldn't put it down and ended up reading the entire book in a day. I thought that the characters all seemed very real and easy to relate to. Anna, the main character, was sent to the wilderness camp because she was a 'bad girl', but as the book goes on you find that she's really just a normal teen who has made some mistakes. When the girls are lost in the wilderness to fend for themselves they have to pull together and trust each other if they want to survive. As you get farther into the book the girls stumble across some eccentric (but not necessarily nice) characters. I do wish that the book would have had more of a closure saying what happened to the other girls when they were left to themselves. I suppose the author did this as to leave that up to our own imagination. 'Bad Girls' is definatly worth reading."},{"Title":"Bad Girls","review":"Anna Wheeler is a bad girl. After her abortion she became nothing more than an embarrassment to her super-religious, christian author of a father. One night as Anna come back from partying with her boyfriend, stoned and drunk, she is taken from her home, and with her parents approval, sent to a girl's wilderness camp in the bahamas. This camp, Camp Archstone, is full of other girls with problems like or worse than Anna. One has stolen over $25,000 worth of electronics. Some girls, like Anna, just had drug and drinking problems. Then there is Kara. Kara is a blond beauty who happens to have an obsession with seeing other people in physical and mental anguish. Before she went to Camp Archstone, Kara was responsible for making a girl go to a hospital for the mentally insane. At their second day at camp, Anna is forced to go on a twenty mile hike. On the hike, they got unexpectedly shot at by drug dealers. The girls scatter and they are lost within a gigantic jungle. Anna and some other girls must find their way to civilization before they get shot by drug dealers or die of starvation. This book is a interesting survival story filled with suspense and is reasonably believable. I recommend it for girls in their late teens interested in realistic fiction.Teen girls will be like this book the most because they will be able to relate than anyone else to the main characters. Anna's resentment at her parents for sending her to Archstone will be more understandable to a teenage girl than, say, a grown man. Teen girls will also understand some of the girls behavior more. One girl, against her best interests, continually asks questions and tries to irk one of the camp's \\"councilor.\\" She gets sent to a solitary confinement box.This book is very suspenseful. The author uses lots of foreshadowing techniques to increase suspense. After the hike turns terribly wrong, one girl, who was sitting apart from the others, disappears. There are also lots of twists, some of the people who you would naturally think would survive, because they are the main supporting characters, have awful things happen to them. One gets shot by a drug smuggler after she tries to run away, the other breaks her leg trying to cross a river.The author did a nice job of making the book seem as possible as he could. In Bad Girls, the author, Alex McAulay, had a very convincing setting. McAulay had the camp outside of the United States, so that the \\"councilors\\" would be able to use punishments that they wanted. One girl's punishment is to stand in the \\"heat box.\\" The \\"heat box\\" is a tall, metal box that attracts heat. A girl has to stand in it for the day with no food or water, all they have is unbearable heat. McAulay purposively picked an island in the bahamas known for its drug problems, so the drug smugglers didn't seem at all random.Bad Girls is an interesting book that would interest teenage girl. It is filled with suspense, survival, and teen drama. Convincingly set and told, this book will be an enjoyable read that you won't be able to set down."},{"Title":"Bad Girls","review":"I wasn't sure how to take Bad Girls at first. Right away we were put into the action; Anna Wheeler -an out of control sixteen year old girl- is running for what seems to be, her life. In the end, her attempt for freedom fails and she is thrown back into the hands of her captives.While she rides off to her destination, we learn what was brought Anna into her current situation. Back in Georgia, Anna had partied and stayed out late. She got high and drunk, and then had an abortion to top it off. It seemed like Anna's life couldn't be more out of control. Finally, we learn she is going to be sent to a \\"Wilderness Camp\\" called Camp Archstone to help change her into a respectable young women. This is -of course- the work of her over religious, former military man of a father, whom Anna couldn't have a worse relationship with.Anna arrives at Camp Archstone and is given everything she will need at the camp. Things go along as planed in Archstone for the next day or so. It is a prison like camp, where the girls are treated like inmates and must endure gurling physical activities, while overcoming psychological problems as well. Then when a hiking trip goes terribly wrong, Anna and the girls she has met at the camp, must band together to survive in the wilderness of the remote Caribbean island that Camp Archstone is on.Bad Girls drew me in right away. I was able to sympathize with Anna almost right away, even with her \\"bad girl\\" flaws. Yet, I couldn't help but feel by putting Anna and the other girls in Archstone, the author was only looking for a way to get these girls in the wilderness. After they run into the forest when someone is shot, Archstone is basically out of the picture. McAulay could have done a better job trying to weave Archstone into the story more, and make it more important in the second half of the story.Anna and the other girls seemed to sit around a lot as well. Parts of the story seemed to lag when his happened, and you just wanted to move on with the story. Also at times, the story seemed to be pushing itself a little too much, that it was hard to take is seriously. When the story ended, it seemed so abruptly. There was no closer with Anna's life and the reader is left to guess what happens next. Will she tell her father the truth? What will happened to her photography teacher and does Anna clean up her life when she returns? What about Camp Archstone, does it remain open? These questions and more are left unanswered and makes you wish for just a few more pages in the book.Overall, this a very enjoyable read. Having these spoiled high school girls try to survive in the wilderness is so intriguing, and you feel like your right there with them the whole time. It can creep you out but also make you cheer on Anna to survive in the end. There is also enough drama to draw the fans of Gossip Girl or other teen series in for the read. If you're looking for a quick read that you can't put down, this is something to pick up. While is might seem slow at times, it soon picks up and you're back in the wilderness fighting for your life.Alex McAulay did a good job with this one. If only he had made the details flow better together and tied up the loose ends."},{"Title":"Bad Girls","review":"Okay, so this is probably like a strong PG-13, they use the f-word and talk about rape and sex and drugs, but I loved this book.

There seems to be no way off the island and that is if you can escape the guards, forest, mangrove swamps, and chain link fences. No talking during meals, quiet time, class and most other times.They're about to embark on their first long hike to Clayton Peak, ten miles southwest outside the camp. Counselor Adler and Miss Richards will be leading one group, following the Blue Hollow Trail, into the forest past Diver's Gem, one of the largest blueholes on the island. The other group will be headed up by counselors Brody and McGathy down the Nevis River to the Andros River Basin, 1/4 mile from Clayton Peak. Both groups should be reaching the Peak around 5:00 p.m. and spending the night there in sleeping bags which they will carry along with food, water, and supplies.Things happen on the way to the Pike which cause the girls to be without their counselors, on their own in the woods and scared for their lives. Help is on the way. Right? Right?Gunshots. Arguing. Fear. Screams. An old lady in a run-down shack and what's that sticking out of her neck? Sometimes being the prettiest doesn't always work in one's favor as they are about to find out."},{"Title":"Bad Girls","review":"With some authors, after you read one novel of theirs that you enjoyed, you feel like you MUST read more. Possibly read every novel ever written by that particular author.Because of my opinion of Alex McAulay's novel Shelter Me, I decided to read this novel next. Immediately, the setup of the novel reminded me of Shelter Me, and I was hooked.That's where the similarities ended. With this, I attempted, for every page I read, to guess what would happen next. Would they get sold into slavery? Would they get raped in the forest? Would they go insane, and kill each other? was this all a test, a planned part of Camp Archstone?Very few of my predictions (And I mean VERY few, three out of the hundred-ish I made) came true. That being said, it was one of the reasons I liked this. It wasn't what I expected, therefore it became more interesting.I enjoyed this book enough that I plan on having my friend read it, but I doubt it will ever fall under my 'favorite' books. I say doubt, because you never know what the future will bring, and maybe it was my fault for reading two novels within two days of each other by the same author, but I've decided to give this a 3/5."},{"Title":"Bad Girls","review":"I've read a few MTV-published books and they have all been pretty good. At first I was a little creeped out about a male author writing a book about a bunch of incorrigible teenage girls. I thought I was in for Lord of the Flies meets Caged Heat, but thankfully I was proven wrong!The book takes off pretty quickly and is filled with little twists and turns that you don't see coming.

Her father forced her to have an abortion because he felt an out-of-wedlock grandchild would tarnish his reputation as an author of Christian themed books and his standing in the church he attends. He is also a grade-A hypocrite. Anna's mother is a shadow figure, an undeveloped character who seems to cling to the background and is merely an echo of the draconian father.Anna never reveals the identity of her baby's father - her photo teacher. Sadly, she covers for him and after her trauma, he won't even give her the time of day. It was a darn shame he wasn't brought up on statutory rape charges. Anna, meanwhile spirals out of control. She takes drugs; goes to all night parties with her boyfriend, Ryan. After sneaking in her window during the wee hours of the morning, she is met with a horrible surprise. Two men from Camp Archstone on Andros Island in the West Indies \\"kidnap\\" her at the behest of her parents. They manhandle her; force her to say degrading things and drag her into their truck and from there, a plane to the island. Anna tries to run away twice en route to the sea plane, but is captured both times.Camp Archstone can best be described as an idyllic hell. The island is described as idyllic in its natural state, but the camp itself is hell, plain and simple. The girls serving 12 weeks (\\"longer if we feel you need it\\") there were quasi military uniforms; line up and risk beatings; being locked \\"in the box\\" and other heinous punishments. Even a simple softball game becomes an exercise in punishment; the \\"officers\\" tell the girls they have to give the game their all or risk severe consequences.One girl is punished for crying; another is punished simply for asking questions. On a 10-mile hike, the \\"officers\\" tell the girls to know the geography and the terrain. Naturally Anna hates every minute of it and the fact that during their enforced therapy sessions, the camp psychiatrist has been given full authority to prescribe medications. Anna is very resistant to this.Nobody enjoys the hike and when one girl is injured, the director takes her back to the bunk/infirmary. The others are expected to continue. Their leader is a cruel, punitive man straight out of a military nightmare. He slaps one girl, obviously relishing this and has physically abused the other girls. His turn at bat comes up when he falls dead from a sniper's bullet. The girls then have to fend for themselves and the next few days are a terrifying exercise of survival; finding snipers; drug dealers and other questionable types as they try to make their way back to camp.This book makes me think of a hybrid of \\"Lord of the Flies\\" and some tired \\"Survivor\\" reality show. I didn't like most of the characters and found the story, while interesting rather implausible."},{"Title":"Femmes Fatales: Feminism, Film Theory, Psychoanalysis","review":"Mary Ann Doane's book, \\"Femme Fatales\\" has a great cover with the wonderful Louise Brooks. The essays and articles helped explain feminism and the film industry. It's sad to believe that the film industry will always be a male industry but that's the way it is. We learn from the book about how the audience including ourselves are manipulated by the director's. The author does an excellent job in bringing together the feminine mystique from female's point of view and males at times as well. The femme fatale, long may she rein."},{"Title":"Madness in America: Cultural and Medical Perceptions of Mental Illness Before 1914 (Cornell Studies in the History of Psychiatry)","review":"MADNESS IN AMERICA: Cultural and Medical Perceptions of Mental Illness before 1914 is a delectably readable, in depth investigation of mental illness during a time when few kind words for the clinically insane were in vogue. Psychiatry hadn't really evolved into a respectable zone of medicine until Freud and people with now well-defined disorders of the mind were grouped into madhouses and insane asylums populated by tertiary syphilitics, victims of brain tumors, and mentally retarded unfortunates. This 'untouchable' status left the population free to derive all manner of perverse etiologies from demonolgy to withcraft to religious punishment and that opened the door for not only charlatans but also for artists of every field to interpret whatever they wished. As the keenly gifted authors Lynn Gamwell and Nancy Tomes have researched and described in this lavishly illustrated tome, madness was a much maligned yet rich source of inspiration for scientists and artists alike. Extensive illustrations of the ghastly tools of the asylum doctors' trade are interwoven with beautiful and accurate renderings of the human nervous syatem and etchings, drawings and paintings by well known artists whose works were never thought to reflect madness until this volume. This book could (and most assuredly does) easily stand on its own; the fact that it accompanied an exhibition showing the drawings, instruments, and art inspired by madness during a learned physical documentary in 1995 only adds to the richness of this venture. Kudos to the authors, the publisher, and the curators for a true gift to the realm of scientifically artistic investigation."},{"Title":"Madness in America: Cultural and Medical Perceptions of Mental Illness Before 1914 (Cornell Studies in the History of Psychiatry)","review":"This book is full of illustrations, paintings, political cartoons, photographs beautifully reproduced in a generous scale.

What I got was what I really wanted: a well-written history of the Jews from ancient times to today.Two things make this book great. First, Dimont is a good writer, both insightful and entertaining, with occasional flashes of ironic humor. Second, Dimont puts the history of the Jews in the larger context of World History and keeps from a narrower Jewish perspective.On the one hand, Dimont does not hide his general admiration for the Jews, both for their endurance and their contributions to society that are far out of proportion to their percentage of the populace. On the other hand, for those who believe that Jews have suffered nothing but persecution for thousands of years, Dimont presents a different viewpoint which shows Jews often prospering.No one will find Dimont fully objective in his history, but they should find that he presents an overall balanced work. Written with both Jewish and non-Jewish audiences in mind, Dimont has put together a wonderful book that is good for both those interested in Jewish history or those interested in Western history in general."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"This popular history of the Jewish people succeeds in bringing the four thousand year saga alive for the general reader. The author observes that even though the furniture of the West may be Greek, the house of Western civilization is Jewish. One of the questions examined in this book is: How did the Jewish people survive the disappearance of every civilization in which they lived? The following six eras are discussed in the Preface: the Pagan World, Greco-Roman civilization, Diaspora, Islam, European Middle Ages and the Modern Age. Dimont accepts the psychoanalytic, philosophical and existentialist interpretation of history that holds that ideas motivate mankind and shape history.Part One: The Portable God, explores the age of paganism, the origin of the Hebrews and of monotheism and the ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judah, until the coming of the Greeks and the clash of Greek and Hebrew culture. In Part Two: Age Of The Apikorsim, he looks at the survival of Jewish culture and religion under the Greeks, the Roman take-over of the land, the destruction of Jerusalem and the various Jewish revolts until the final banishment from the Holy Land.Part 3: Moses, Christ and Caesar investigates the birth of Christianity as a Jewish sect, how the religions were separated during the aforementioned wars and revolts and the spread and ultimate triumph of Christianity in Europe. The next section, Invisible World Of The Talmud, explains how Judaism and Jewish identity were preserved in the diaspora by means of Talmudic learning.In Part 5: Mohammed, Allah and Jehovah, the author covers the rise of Islam and the Arab expansion, the golden era of Jewish scholarship and the end of that period with the Mongol invasion of the Middle East and the Christian reconquest of Spain, whilst the following, The Prince And The Yellow Star, considers the Middle Ages, Crusades, Renaissance and Reformation. It also examines the role of the Jewish people in the feudal age and the origin of Kabalah.Part 7: On The Horns Of Modern Isms, chronicles the emancipation from the ghetto to the enlightenment when Jews started occupying important positions and became intellectual leaders in Europe. This section looks at Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the United States, Nazism and finally, Zionism and the birth of the State of Israel. In the last part: Cultural Mosaic, Dimont attempts an historical explanation of the incredible survival of this miracle nation.In his view, the first 2000 years represent that third of the Torah and Talmud which concerns priesthood and sacrifice that preserved the Hebrews from paganism. The second 2000 years had to do with that third of the Torah and Talmud that preserved ethnic identity through ritual while spreading Biblical ideas of humanism. He speculates that the last one third now remains, that part that deals with universal concepts of justice, morality and ethics.There is an extensive bibliography divided into various sections and an index. Although here and there certain observations in the text have become a little outdated since publication, Jews, God and History remains a magisterial work and a gripping read inhabited by fascinating ideas, personalities, events and historical facts. The style is engaging and accessible throughout. I also recommend A History Of The Jews by Paul Johnson and WorldPerfect by Ken Spiro.A History of the JewsWorldPerfect: The Jewish Impact on CivilizationStanding With IsraelYour People Shall Be My PeopleEpicenter: Why current rumblings in the middle east will change your futureThe Fight for Jerusalem: Radical Islam, the West, and the Future of the Holy City"},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"A book that spans Abraham to Maimonides to Disraeli can't get every detail in, but I still found the book very informative. I found Dimont's interpretation of events enlightening -- for example, in the Middle Ages the ghettoization and ostracization of Jews, in a way, helped the Jews, because they were free from the ludicrous system of Feudalism. Could we consider the Jews the originators of the Free Market system (which is a good thing)? Dimont hints at this.I also didn't know that the Church was in many ways the *protector* of the Jews (Gregory the Great forbade the forced conversion of Jews), and that it was lay Christians who incited and joined the Anti-Semitic mobs. This makes \\"sense\\" in a social psychological way(not to give credence to Jew hatred). You have a bunch of serfs, illiterate, ignorant of their own religion, ignorant of the Tanach/Old Testament (Catholic Church liturgy really builds entirely from the NT), ostensibly owned by their lords, and then you have a bunch of educated, \\"free\\" Jews who were different religously from the oppressed Christians. Jealousy, envy, perception of a disruption in the \\"natural\\" order, thus Anti-Semitism. The Nazis would pick up on this later, quite literally emphasizing the \\"natural order\\", except the Nazis, as Dimont shows, aren't Christian but anti-Christian as well as anti-Jew. Their hatred of Jews had nothing to do w/ \\"deicide\\", rather motive that can only be described as Darwinian pagan \\"Blood and Soil\\". The Nazis had enough Zyklon-B gas to kill 20 million more, yet only 3 million Jews left in Europe after the evils of the Final Solution. The Nazis were going to go after everyone.I also liked the tidbits Dimont throws in: Germans during WWII had a higher suicide rate than Jews in the concentration camps. Amazing! What spirit pulses through the seed of Abraham! This book reaffirmed my faith in the Creator. This is an excellent book for Christians to read, so that all Christians may understand and appreciate the history of our Jewish brethren."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"Max Dimont's \\"Jews, God, and History\\" is a now well-known summary of the subject. As has been pointed out by many previous reviewers, this book is appropriately acclaimed for being readable, helpfully condensed, and free of scholarly obfuscation. His collection of the facts of Jewish history is accessible in ways that more detailed and research-based works are not. One could quickly use an outline of the book to keep the chronology straight and get immediate access to greater detail when needed. He summarizes the key events and issues of Jewish history in a manner that can act as an introduction to more detailed works.Unlike more scholarly works, he is honest about his advocacy. He advocates a universal rationalism, on the model of Spinoza, rather than a philosophy based on revelation or authority. He minimizes the effects of Christianity and Islam. He is unabashed in his citation of the beneficial effects of Jewish innovations. His roll call of influential Jewish individuals (pp. 328-372) is a mini-encyclopedia in itself. He advocates a non-supernatural approach to history, so he accepts historical and psychological rather than theistic explanations. His secular approach may make the book more accessible to a larger audience.Dimont's assets are as monumental as are his liabilities, with three areas of particular weakness. First, the title is a misnomer. The book contains a lot about the Jews, a lot about history, and little or nothing about God. It therefore has the paradoxical effect of portraying the uniquely Jewish theology as unnecessary to understanding Jewish history.Second, Dimont states that whether God is or is not involved in history is irrelevant to the story of the Jews. \\"It makes no difference whether it was Abraham who projected this experience onto an imaginary Jehovah or a real Jehovah who proposed it to Abraham.\\"Lastly, Dimont's book contains numerous historical inaccuracies, unsupported theological speculations, and personal prejudices. The following are examples:\\"Moses is to Judaism what Jesus is to Christianity.\\" On the contrary, most Jewish authorities cite Abraham as Judaism's founding father, and Moses as neither divine nor a cosmic savior.\\"In its early days Christianity, too, was embraced mainly by slaves.\\" This is historically inaccurate because none of the 12 disciples were slaves, the early priests and bishops could not have also been slaves, and the Roman homeowners who held early Christian services in their homes could not have been both homeowners and slaves.\\"It makes no difference whether Moses was a Jew or not.\\" The evidence of Jewish scripture states the opposite.Dimont refers to the Maccabean revolt \\"as the world's first religious war.\\" However, religious holy war was practiced during time of Saul, centuries before the MaccabeesThe author cited two events which led to the downfall of Rome: the growth of Christianity and the migration of the Huns. Historians have shown that the growth of Christianity helped the Roman emperor Constantine solidify his power and build up the Roman Empire. In addition, the growth of Christianity strengthened the Eastern Roman Empire until the 15th century.The author claims that \\"Christianity existed at least two hundred years before Jesus\\". He bases his opinion on the Dead Sea Scrolls' description of the Essene Community. How is it possible that Christianity existed prior to Jesus' birth?\\"Nothing he [Jesus] preached, taught, or said was in contradiction to what other Jewish prophets, rabbis, or sects said or taught.\\" On the contrary, Jesus' controversial practices of working on the Sabbath, eating with gentile sinners, and claiming to be able to absolve sins incurred the wrath of local Jewish religious authorities.\\"[St. Paul] had repeated hallucinations.\\" Historical evidence indicates that Paul's visions and intuitions were no different from those of other important religious leaders throughout history.\\"From a historical viewpoint it makes no difference whether Christ actually appeared to Paul or whether Paul had a hallucinative experience.\\" However, it does make a difference whether historical evidence indicates that Paul had visions of Jesus as the eternal Christ or whether he was a madman experiencing hallucinations, which are contrary to observable fact and equivalent to psychosis.\\"Jesus had taught that one learned to love God by loving man.\\" Evidence of the New Testament states the reverse.\\"Islam had succeeded where Christianity had failed.\\" Dimont explains that by the 7th century Islam had spread its influence throughout the Mediterranean world. However, Christianity had already become the official religion of the Roman Empire, two centuries before the time of Mohammed.\\"It may be that Nietzsche did not advocate what he wrote.\\" To the contrary, Nietzsche never printed any retractions and consistently maintained and published the same point of view from early adulthood throughout his life."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"This book was recommended to my by an internet friend. It is far outside of my usual area of reading. I did not think that I would understand the book, much less enjoy the read. Just how interesting would Jewish history be to a Christian? I was very wrong in my assumptions. This book turned out to be a real page- turner. I couldn't put it down. When I was in high school, many years ago, I could never figure out what made the Jewish kids so smart. They seemed to be the grade leaders in every school in the city. This great book answered that question and many others that I have always had about the Jewish people and religion. In my opinion, every adult, Muslim, Christian, Jew, or whatever religion, should read this book. The way you look at the world will be forever changed!"},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"Can't add much more to the reviews except my own experience with it. I read this book 10 or more years ago, but I remember vividly how well it explained Jewish history, and to a large degree, our world today. I heard it recommended by a preacher and found it for about a dollar at a used book store. It really opened my eyes.The author seemed to be very level-headed, i.e. he had no bones to pick, no political motive, no desire to influence anybody for any reason. It is an entertaining as well as very instructive book. It is very well written and easy to read, in fact, I remember reading about half the book at my first sitting, which is remarkable for me because I am a very slow reader.Based on my limited experience, it is one of the best, most readable books on the subject you will find."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"This is a good (entertaining in parts) history. It is a passionate book. However, it was first published in 1962 and it hasn't aged well in the company of modern Jewish historiography. Dimont tends to make connections between events and draw inferences which, in the absence of footnotes, sometimes appear as almost wild generalisations. Often he pounces on one or two people or events as encompassing a totality of explanations for hisotrical trends. For example, the influence of Alfred Rosenberg on the Nazis is undoubtedly exaggerated in the book. The book lacks the socio-political sophistication of modern works but, allowing for the cold war context after WWII, it is still worth reading with some reservations."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"This book truly reviews the glorious history of the Jews.

This little book is stunning in its breadth and depth. This book is always in front of me, tattered and abused, but thoroughly used!"},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"This fact-filled book [review based on the 1962 edition] offers so much! One might be surprised to learn that the Karaite revolt was quite similar to the later Protestant Reformation (pp. 204-208), that the Hasmonean John Hyrcanus had converted the Idumeans and the Galileans to Judaism by force (p. 91, 98), and that some Jews burned Maimonides' works even before Christians ever burned a single copy of the Talmud. (p. 182, 240) Thereafter, many more unauthorized copies of the New Testament went up in flames than Talmuds, while Jewish translations of the Old Testament were never burned by Christians. (p. 240)Ironically, early laws restricting Jewish life were commonly modeled after similar Old Testament and Talmudic laws that restricted non-Jews (p. 219), and the later Inquisition's authority for executing heretics (BTW rarely Jews, except Marranos: p. 226, 315) was based directly upon Deuteronomy 17:2-5. (p. 224) Jews generally chose to live apart from gentiles (p. 251, 254). Compulsory ghettoization didn't occur until much later, and then only in specific locations (p. 251, 255).Dimont focuses on Jewish achievements and privileges (e. g., most medieval Jews were freer than most gentiles: p. 303), and puts pre-Nazi European Jewish sufferings in perspective: \\"It must not be supposed that the majority of Christians hated the Jews. Quite the contrary. Only a small segment were Jew-baiters. When left to themselves, Jew and Christian lived peacefully side by side...It must also be remembered that the ritual-murder charges, the Host-desecration libels, and pogroms took place over a period of seven hundred years and over an entire continent. By and large, most of the ghettos and shtetls were not affected by pogroms or general maraudings.\\" (p. 258)Compulsory ghettoization, and accusations of ritual murder, Host-desecration, well-poisoning, etc., didn't begin until about 1100 AD (p. 220), and usually were the most common and extreme in Germany and Austria. (pp. 239, 242, 246-247, 251, 254, 255) The first expulsion of Jews from a nation wasn't until 1290--from England (p. 229) The Crusaders, whose ranks included not only the devout but also criminally-minded adventurers, were equal-opportunity killers of Jews and non-Jews. (p. 220-221) Compulsory wearing of the yellow badge didn't begin until 1215 (p. 220) and didn't apply to Jews living in the shtetl. (p. 257)Dimont (pp. 377-378) gives details on the anti-Christian character of Nazism, and rejects the emphasis upon \\"unequal victims\\": \\"If the Christian reader dismisses what had happened in Germany as something which affected a few million Jews only, he has not merely shown his contempt for the 7 million Christians but has betrayed his Christian heritage as well. And, if the Jewish reader forgets the 7 million Christians murdered by the Nazis, then he has not merely let 5 million Jews die in vain but has betrayed his Jewish heritage of compassion and justice.\\" (p. 388)Unfortunately, Dimont repeats Polonophobic whoppers--the \\"Polish nonhelp\\" to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the later \\"well-armed\\" Warsaw Polish insurgents (p. 384), and--even more unbelievable-- \\"Poles turning over\\" 2.8 million Jews to the Germans for extermination. (p. 386)As for non-Jewish victims, Dimont writes: \\"The chilling reality is that when the Russians overran the concentration camps in Poland they found enough Zyklon B crystals to kill 20 million people. Yet there were no more than 3 million Jews left in Europe. The ratio of contemplated mass killing was no longer 1.4 Christians for every Jew, but 5.3 Christians for every Jew. Nazi future plans called for the killing of 10 million non-Germanic people every year.\\" (p. 388)."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"\\"Jews, God, and History\\" is a marvelous, well-researched, well-written chronicle of Jewish survival in spite of the world's desire to obliterate them. Dry? Boring? No way!"},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"This is a book that everyone should read. Not only does it teach all about the history and meandering of the Jewish people, but also about much of European history as well. The survival of the Jewish people throughout the past 2000 years despite almost non-stop attack and anti-Semitism from all sides of the Christian world is probably the most amazing miracle that exists, and the lessons derived from knowing this history are truly awe-inspiring and dramatic. It is a deftly written, highly engaging book which contains tons of information but in a style that is approachable and entertaining. The author, Max Dimont, is a wonderful writer and historian. I strongly recommend this book to all, including those who are not Jewish. Everyone would benefit from knowing the information in this book."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"Most history textbooks hardly mention Jew except as isolated individuals. I remember my old World History text called Judaism the oldest ethical religion, but hardly had a word about Jews until World War Two. This book fills in the gap well. It is very readable. It does not pretend to be impartial. (For an impartial, rather dry history, an interested person should read Jones' History, no doubt out of print for many years, but a good university library should have a copy.)There is a good treatment of the schools of Hillel and Shammi.On the other hand the origins of Jews in Russia are hardly mentioned. The reason why Jewish contributions to science or math do not begin until the 19th century is not addressed, which is to me a very large question, Judaism being in the thought process it induces so closely related to the processes of natural law. There are small bits which seem more like gossip than documented history. He mentions, for example, that during the Renaisance period half the brides were married pregnant. Now, how can he know that?Still, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"As if Dimont's own ideas weren't ridiculous enough, he calls on every obscure theory he can find from every incredible source one could hope to come across, including such notable historians as Sigmund Freud. Dimont makes drastic claims without so much as an explanation or footnote. Moses was a reject Egyptian priest of a pagan god until he led the Israelites out of Egypt on the condition that they followed his monotheist religion? The book of Deuteronomy was a forgery by King Josiah in a conscious effort to create an \\"exportable Jehovah\\" in light of the impending Babylonian exile? The prophets were a counter-temple movement? \\"The Hebrews\\" and \\"The Israelites\\" refer to two separate people groups? The theocracy established at Sinai was the beginning of the concept of separation of church and state? Really? If you want incredible theories, this is the book for you. If you want genuine, historical insight into Jewish history of the patriarchs to the first and second temple periods, look for it in the Tanakh, the Apocrypha, and the New Testament. Presenting every wild theory on equal grounds hardly counts as a genuine account of history."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"I took over a year to digest this book. It is factual and informational. It skips around a bit, but is basically chronological. No stones are unturned and I learned a lot. No need to elaborate further, as it is the best history of the Jews written in English.As for the other analyses, \\"Jews, G-d and History\\" is truly a book that is honest to a fault. Until the final chapter, Dimont is assiduous in making sure the reader sees no hint of bias. No doubt he IS a liberal, but also a Zionist. Toward the end, he explains how atheistic and socialistic (left-wing) the Nazis were. And, in a stirring final chapter I'd like to force Obama to read, Dimont basically relays the facts of Israel's army being a pure DEFENSE force and all the missed opportunities for so-called 'peace' by the Palestinians and other rogue Arab states. I guess in the revisionist's world, honesty is wrong. This should be a textbook in all history classes. I won't hold my breath.If the \\"Palestinians\\" (a group so reviled by other Arab nations, their people can ONLY find freedom IN Israel!) laid down their arms tomorrow, there would be peace; If the Israelis laid down their arms tomorrow, there'd be genocide."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"Mr. Dimont does not apparently have any academic credentials, and his book shows it. While it is true, as another reviewer mentioned, that Dimont includes an extensive bibliography, Dimont does not provide footnotes, endnotes, or even informal mention of sources within his text to signal the sources of his claims. As a college English teacher, if one of my students handed in a paper written this way, it would fail. It's unclear which sources provide which information and which \\"facts\\" have been merely invented. This is unethical writing, bordering on academic dishonesty. Dimont frequently supports his points by referencing \\"scholars\\" or \\"archeological evidence,\\" yet never reveals which scholars, in which texts, nor quotes directly, nor does he say what archeological evidence, found by whom, working for what institution. Shabby work. I confess that I am writing this review after only having read to page 37 of this book. While I rarely judge a book on so few pages, I feel obligated to review this book on this evidence, since I feel so misled by the many of posted reviews. To read further would subject me to the danger that I may remember some of Dimont's questionable \\"facts\\" and accept them for truth. I am so concerned about the potential for misinformation and disinformation in this book that I do not even feel comfortable reselling this book, as I often do with books I will not reread, since a less critical reader might take this for accurate history.

Instead, the books exaggerated claims just serves to malign their very real contributions.The section on the history of modern Israel was the most biased of all (with a combination of contempt and dismissiveness shown to the viewpoint of Arab inhabitants).

Just for example, Karl Marx was never &#34;venerated&#34; by a billion people. When Communist regimes collapsed in the nineties it was clear that Marx was only venerated by a few hare-brained &#34;intellectuals&#34; in the West.

In my search for a readable book on Jewish history, I recommend this book as the best of the bunch. It is highly readable without bogging the reader down in too much detail. First and foremost, it presents Jewish history in the context of world history. It explains how despite the multiple Diaspora of the Jews, their faith and culture survived thousands of years of exile and extreme persecution in foreign lands. The section on the writing of the Talmud and its amazing cultural restorative powers is particularly of interest for me, for it explains how the Jews have survived as a people for so long without a physical nation to live in. No other culture has survived milennia scattered among the nations and yet reunited to form a nation as Israel has. I would go so far as to say, the existance of Israel is proof that God exists, for Israel is today's modern day miracle, and Israel is God's chosen people to deliver his message (and Messiah) to the world.I have read other books on Jewish history, but they tended to be more academic and dry. While \\"A History of the Jews\\"A History of the Jewsis highly rated by multiple readers, I did not find it as readable as Dimont's volume.If the reader is interested in Jewish fictional history, I highly recommend James A.

There is no doubt that Dimont believed that western civilization was created by Jews, or should I say, the Isrealites, or should I say, Christians, or should I say, Puritans, etc. We are all Isrealites.

One important factor was the Talamud because it was a code for Jews living in Diaspora. He also covers the many splits in Judaism that have occured throughout time. He ends talking about the formation of the state of Israel. If you are a closed minded person then you may have trouble with Dimonts up front writing. Jew, G-d and History is a keeper for any book collection!"},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"Max I. Dimont is an ex-shoe salesman and unskilled laborer with a quest for knowledge and a consequent desire to write down what he had learned and pass it on. This particular book, Jews, God and History was a million seller. It was first published back in the early 60s and continues to sell thousand of copies to this day.Max was Jewish and he obviously got interested in his Jewish ancestry. He clearly decided to read up on his people in a quest to figure out what the Jews were all about and how their culture has sustained itself through the centuries.He ends up writing this work and several others that he somehow managed to get published and he became a literary success. Getting this book published may have been luck but his writing of it was not. It is the culmination of a good deal of literary sweat. He did a great job with this book.I liked it not because of Max's love of his religion and Jewish heritage but because of his acknowledgment of secular explanations for Jewish mysticisms and his copious facts to bolster his boasting on his Jewish heritage.For example he tells us that we can accept the mystical interpretation of Abraham's meeting with God and the establishment of the Jewish Covenant or we can interpret the event as a psychological Freudian style projection - an \\"auditory or visual hallucination.\\" But whatever explanation we choose, it nevertheless does not change the history or the historical facts or legends. The result of which was circumcision and the Jewish declaration that they are the chosen people. Whether God chose them or they chose a God of their liking is the reader's preference.The book thus becomes a more rational, historical accounting of the Jews and their longevity as opposed to a proselytization.He does the same with Constantine's famous episode. The reader can chose between the mystical, visionary fable or a psychological interpretation (or drunkenness for that matter). It doesn't matter, as the facts or legends of the Jewish history keep rolling along.The author presents the question of how did the Jewish culture or civilization survive for over 3,000 years without its people even having a nation or a country for the majority of that period. But that is a confusing question and the question itself points out the Jewish confusion about what \\"Jewish\\" is. Is it a race, a nation or a religion?Christianity survives without a nation or a country. Islam survives without a nation or a country. Buddhism survives without a nation or a country. Protestantism survives without a nation or a country. Hinduism survives without a nation or a country. A religion doesn't need a country. It needs followers or believers.Germans must have a country. Americans must have a country. French must have a country. Nationalities have countries, faiths have followers. Are the Jews a race or a religion?Adolf Hitler labeled the followers of the Jewish faith as a race. As far as my understanding goes, they are not a race and since they have had no country for most of their existence, they could hardly be considered a nation.Jews primarily constitute a religion. But their religion has been kept close to a small \\"family\\" of followers all stemming back to an original tribal heritage with limited membership. As a consequence we have this nationalistic and religious confusion. Many Jews talk among themselves as if they are a nationality.On the religious side, the Jews have been so egalitarian in their acceptance of inordinate beliefs among their followers that some Jews proclaim their agnosticism and even their atheism without any traditional ostracism or excommunication. This adds to the race/nation/religion confusion.But, how did the Jews survive the pogroms, the persecutions, the vilification, the holocaust etc. and why all of this hatred towards the Jews? How did the Jews form such a strong bond between and among their followers even with the Diaspora - banished from their original homes in Judea and Israel and dispersed all over the world?Max Dimont tries to answer these questions and he gives a very cogent explanation. Along with this search for answers to the \\"Jewish Question\\" comes a brilliant and entertaining presentation of Jewish history and the fundamental teachings of the Jewish faith, traditions, and customs.This is a great book for Jews and non-Jews - anyone who wants to learn about the history and origins of the Jews. And if you are interested in the history of the human race, how can you not be interested somewhat in the Jews.The book closes with a chronological history of Palestine/Israel to the date of it publication. For an even better and more up to down Chronology see Thomas Friedmen's From Beirut to Jerusalem.The book is admittedly biased towards the Jews. Max is proud to be a Jew and he is not ashamed to tell the reader why. He is boasting about the accomplishments of his people throughout the entire book - but rightfully so. He may be stretching the importance of his \\"nation\\" of people as do the Irish, Italian, Catholics and Protestants but his little group, approximately 18 million at the time that he wrote the book, certainly has some boasting to do.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:Mein Kampf - An Analysis of Book One"},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"If you are wanting to expand your knowledge of the history of the Jews, this is a good book to begin with. It will give you a detailed overview (without getting bogged down in minutiae). The only drawback is that it was written in the 1960s, and while it says that it was updated in 1994, the updates did not (and could not due to space constraints) do justice to the upheaval and turmoil that has occurred in the decades since it was origninally written.A slightly newer history that might serve as well is Paul Johnson's A History of the Jews (1998). For an overview of Islamic history, you might check out Karen Armstrong's Islam."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"Presents the turbulent life of the Jews throughout the centuries. Mr.Dimont is very passionate about his subject and it is a wonderful read. An absolute must for religious studies students, Jews and Christians."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"Jews, God and History is a sobering but very entertaining romp through 5000 years of Western Civilization, which as Dimont so carefully points out, is in many essential respects, the invention of Jews.This is the way history should be written -- sweepingly, across vast stretches of time but balanced, unsentimental, with a flair for the comedic, and as factual as one can expect given the span of time. While Tom Cahill's \\"The Gift of the Jews\\" was a delicious somewhat scatological romp, this is robust, equally readable and entertaining history.The crux of the story is that time-and-again it has been ideas that have saved Jews from total destruction. With great skill and efficiency, Dimont chronicles most of these attempts at destruction -- demonstrating that at each turn, it has been ideas rather than guns or military might that has saved the Jews. The most important of ideas was the Jewish invention of a single god in the mind (monotheism).By inventing a transportable, unitary spiritually-based (as opposed to idol-based multiple) gods -- Jews were able to get in on the ground floor of the \\"God franchise.\\"Their version of a single spiritual personal \\"god in the mind,\\" undermined (at the same time that it added coherence and stability to) the previous fragmented system of ritual, sacrifice and the idol worship of multiple gods. By replacing this unwieldy and corrupt system with a unitary, internalized and personalized, but mostly imaginary god, Jews were able to export their ideas to friend and foes alike.\\"The Word\\" of this mostly imaginary god could then be canonized and codified into a book (the bible, Torah, Talmud, etc.) and elevated to the level of law. Once perceived as law, the \\"word of God\\" served as the final arbiter of man's moral life. As law, it could then be delegated and spread by God's appointed lieutenants, the prophets.This colonization of the idea of God, swept across the Western and most of the Eastern world and still serves as the primary underpinning of both the Christian and Islamic religions. What the Jews did in effect was to franchise the idea of a single god, making religion a top-down tool for managing man's moral life. It was a stunning achievement and a quantum improvement over everything that had preceded it.The hidden bonus of the book however is not just that it is a good story told by a good writer and historian, but also that Max Dimont is a skilled and uncompromising Social Scientist who does not apologize for it. He is equally facile in Existential Philosophy, Freudian Psychology, Economics, Political Science, and modern and classical Anthropology. They all seep through and immeasurably enrich this incredible human drama.As but one interesting aside, it is instructive to note that Dimont confirms Freud's suspicion in his (Freud's) last book \\"Moses and Monotheism:\\" that Moses was indeed an Egyptian Prince, rather than a Jew. Dimont's reaction however, is a measured but laconic \\"so what?\\" The point is that whatever ethnicity he was in fact, Moses chose Jewish ethnicity as the vehicle through which to disseminate his ideas about god.A great book. Five Stars."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"While many people do not understand the history of the Diaspora, this book is a great eye-opener. No wonder it got such great reviews.

To the reviewer who, after one chapter, decided the book wasn't any good, it is she who missed out. Too bad."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"I enjoyed this book and recommend it. Max Dimont wrote with a contagious enthusiasm that flows from chapter to chapter giving the feeling of almost being present in the time and moving with the writer from one era to the next, starting with the Pagan Period and the first obstacle to Jewish survival around 4500B.C. and coming to the conclusion around the time of Pasestine/Israel 1914. (The book was written in 1962, and Max Dimont passed away in 1992). He puts an almost storybook quality to his historical viewpoints, and sometimes it does seem that he makes generalizations or takes liberties, though he does say in one chapter about Moses that \\"this of course is not conclusive evidence, but it gives some basis for such a speculation\\". Acceptance of the Jewish people throughout history seems to \\"wax and wane\\", and sometimes human nature proves at it's worse, but Max moves you along through the history of the Jews like a tour guide on a bus, pointing out all of the contributions, obstacles and entertaining bits of history along the way. The contributions of the Jews is astounding to our civilization. There are many facts that I don't think most non-Jews are even aware of, but that can be cross referenced and backed up with other literature if you are interested in the research."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"Dimont is a master of condensing vast amounts of historical account into a concise, readable, and engrossing volume! Dimont has a writing style that places him in the league of Will Durant and Barbara Tuchman. Jews, God and History covers the fabric of Jewish history from its beginnings to the present and does so while placing the Jewish experience into the matrix of world civilization. Dimont presents the reader with various theories of history and offers an interpretation of the Jewish saga which rings true. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"A great read for any student of Jewish or biblical history. Although, one might smile from time to time at some of the statements concerning the roots of many of our most cherished mythologies, the point of view expressed is clearly developed from a sound intellectual base. The analysis and dissection of the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Jewish is particularly intriguing. But the main achievement of this book is to cram more historical data into one book than any I have ever read before and at the same time, to keep it readable. It is also an excellent reference book."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"This is definitely a biased book. But however much one may wish, it is difficult to write a totally unbiased view of history, particularly when it is the history of your own people. If you ask a devout Muslim to write about Arabia's history, he will consider the period before the advent of Prophet Muhammed as dark ages. This is not a scholarly book but a popular paperback. So one should not expect too much from it.The author's pride in his Jewishness is evident in the book as he literally rewrites history and ascribes almost all great ideas to the Jewish civilization. He seems to be driven by the constant desire to prove to the readers that the Jews were also great fighters and not simply moneylenders or petty salesmen.But in his zeal to focus on the Christian and Muslim world, he seems to have forgotten completely about the Hindu and Chinese civilizations. Most of the practical inventions of the ancient world have come from the Chinese and many of the philosophical ideas ascribed to the Greeks have come from the Hindus. These are glaring deficiencies in the work, but if one wants to have a general idea of Jewish history and takes the &quot;facts&quot; presented in the book with a generous dosage of salt, it is a great introductory work. The Jews have had a very tough time in history until recently, yet they have survived and prospered. So there is definitely something great in their culture that has preserved them so far."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"I was really excited about this book, but I was very disappointed. Writing about a religious community in a secular way is very awkward. The writer has to fall back on specious claims to justify what happened(he will later say&quot;Oh yeah, the relgious people believe this...) but the focus seems to be on secular atheism. He also throws in something out of nowhere about Darwinism for what reason I don't know. I am not a Christian, and I am not very familiar with the Christian church and history, and I found his repeated references to Paul and the church(pretty much at every significant point) confusing. This book was a real let down for me."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"I usually don't do this, but here I am writing about a book after reading only its first chapter. I have found it so shallow, oversimplified and misleading, I feel there is no need to read the book any further. The author is engaged too deeply with the grand historico-racial theories of Spengler, Toynbee, etc., and too little with historical accuracy. For example, he claims that Persians are a dead nation. I am sure millions of Persians (aka Iranians) would be very surprised to hear this. This is just one mistake among very many.Besides, all thing Jewish are described as oh-so-positive, while all things non-Jewish, even the very best ones, somehow acquire a negative tint. Jewish identity is put &quot;uber alles&quot; (above all). Consider this quote: &quot;... intermarriage was diluting the Jewish strain -- again a ... threat to Jewish identity, a threat to ... racial purity&quot;. This from a pen of a Jewish writer, writing after the Holocaust! Is there any need to read this further?If anyone knows a more factual, more detailed and less biased book on Jewish history, please tell me."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"This is an outstanding overview of Jewish history for the general reader. It is tremendously rich in information and written with an underlying warmth and sympathy that move the reader greatly. It is a good introduction but should not be the only book the reader reads on the subject."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"Of all the Jewish histories I have read, Jews, God &amp; History best describes the survival of not only the Jewish race and religion, but the actual idea of being Jewish. To paraphrase Joseph Heller in God Knows -- If God chose to flood the world again, Jews would learn to breath under water. This is the idea behind Max Dimont's wonderful little history (although Mr. Heller wrote God Knows after Mr. Dimont's book -- but as they say, &quot;great minds think alike&quot;). Read, learn and enjoy this masterpiece of Jewish history."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"Dimont brushes aside the false mystique that has tinted the perceptions of Jews by Gentiles and even other Jews. With an easy-to-read but intelligent style and wit, Dimont dispels many religious and cultural fabrications about the Jews and their relations with the world-at-large, avoids religious argument, and makes an impressive attempt to minimize his biases (he succeeds more often than not). This should not be the last word on the history of the Jews, but it should definitely be the first book you read about them."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"In The Jews G-d and History, Max Dimont has managed to combine the secular with the sacred in a clear consise manner. I especially enjoyed the interweaving of &quot;Jewish&quot; history with a time line of what was happening throughout the world. This book, somewhat colored by the time period in which it was written, the 1960s, does make one think about what really happened (was Abraham &quot;smoking&quot; when he saw the angels or spoke to G-d?)and is it important, or is it the message that counts? The same for Paul. My only complaint is I cannot find a large print edition of this book."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"Does it really exist the jewish God?While you read this book you will see that whenever the jewish people had a strong problem, almost from magic appear a man who made whatever it has to be done, spoke to everybody who has to be spoken and the jewish people save their problem. Who sent these persons exactly the time the jews needed? Why nobody can destroy the jews in 4,000 years and are the only people that survive that long?I think the answer is yes.While you read this book you will understand the history of the jews, why they think their way, and why they survived to all the history problems they had or even they have now, at the end of the book are to many biographies that make the finish of the book long and boring, but the main story of the book is amazing, but you have to have in mind that is a very hard book to read, you will have to be concentrated in the book, you won't be able to read it while hearing music or something else, you will have to be 100% in the book."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"Jews, God and History is a phenomenal work which undertakes the difficult and tedious task of presenting the 4,000 year history of the Jewish people. Instead of presenting this history from an insulated point of view, author Max I. Dimont shows the history of the Jews in the context of the entire world; in the vast tapestry of human history on this planet, the Jewish people are shown to be a strand that makes its way through every corner of the fabric.Dimont immediately draws the attention of the reader in his introduction, musing about how such a small population of people have had such influence on the greater world. Some of the most influential people in history were Jews: Moses, Jesus, Paul, Baruch Spinoza, Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Albert Einstein. Two of the largest world religions, Christianity and Islam, grew out of Judaism. The Jews introduced to the world the concepts of monotheism, prayer, church, redemption, universal education and charity. Perhaps the most interesting idea that Dimont brings up in his introduction is the age of the Jewish civilization; whereas all the other pagan civilizations that existed at the time have long since disappeared, the Jews are still around today. Dimont goes on to say,\\"The Chinese, Hindu, and Egyptian peoples are the only ones living today who are as old as the Jewish people. But these three civilizations had only one main cultural period, and their impact on succeeding civilizations has not been great. They contained neither the seeds for their own rebirth nor the seeds for the birth of other civilizations. Unlike the Jews, they were not driven out of their countries, nor did they face the problem of survival in alien lands. The Greeks and the Romans are the only other nations which have influenced the history of Western man as profoundly as the Jews. But the people who now dwell in Greece and Italy are not the same as those who dwelt in ancient Hellas and Rome.\\"Needless to say, these facts makes the reader wonder \\"what is so special about the Jews?\\" and Dimont makes his best effort to answer this question in the most scholarly way possible, even explaining eight different theories on interpreting history and how they apply to the Jewish people.Although Dimont uses the Bible as a source for his telling of early Jewish history, he makes it clear that he is approaching the material from a secular standpoint. On the subject of Abraham having a vision from God, Dimont states that the most important part of the encounter is not if God actually appeared to Abraham or if Abraham dreamed up the whole thing; what matters is that Abraham decided that he had a covenant with God, and his descendants continued to have that covenant. Dimont stresses that this point so important that Jewish history is built on it: the covenant that the Jews believed they had with God gave them the will to survive as Jews, which is a main reason why the Jewish people didn't simply disappear into the many civilizations they lived in throughout history.In the chapters where he describes the Jewish religion, Dimont really shines. He explains the beliefs, rituals and scholarship in a way that is both accurate and accessible to people completely new to the material. It is in these chapters that he describes a crucial moment in Jewish history: the shifting of the religion from sacrificial rituals in the temple to prayer, scholarship and the expansion of morality and justice. These changes were instrumental in the preservation of the Jewish people; without being near their temple and their High Priests, the Jews might have simply given up on their religion while in foreign lands (a fate that occurred to most of the pagan civilizations of the time).I've learned so many fascinating things from this book that I want to go on and on about: the exchange of ideas between the Jews and the Greeks, the Jewish Reformation Movement, the vital role of Jewish people in medieval society, the Jewish influence on both capitalism and communism, etc. This book is crammed with information, but Dimont's lucid writing style and occasional injection of dry humor and wit definitely made this book much easier to read than your typical history tome. For both Jews and non-Jews alike, I think this book is a must-read if you have any interest in world history.[Disclosure: This review also appears on FingerFlow.com, a site for review and discussion of creative works.]"},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"Jews, God and History is a significant accomplishment, because it's a well-written, interesting and historically researched survey of 5000 years of history. Max Dimont wrote original in early 1960s, this edition is updated by his wife and daughter, filling in the more recent years of Mideast tensions and bringing the reader up to about the beginning of the 20th Century. The themes of Jewish resiliency and survival will make Jewish readers proud and reflective about our heritage. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"i enjoyed reading this book. my only comment is that the author didnt even mentioned the jews in the middle east and the surrounding areas.surely there was a lot happening in the middle east in the past 2000 years that was influantial in some way. nevertheless i recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"This is a good, accurate book. For those with little knowledge of the subject, it is a good start; however, it oversimplifies and overgeneralizes in many areas. I would suggest that a reader of this book supplements his background with more detailed studies of the various topics."},{"Title":"Jews, God, And History","review":"Topically organized as well as chronological, this is a good introductory history. Like all general audience works, it is bound to gloss over issues that are in debate and like, much modern Jewish history, the development of modern Israel and Zionism is sanitized. Still, this is probably one of the best popular works around and quite a pleasant read."},{"Title":"Upgrade: 10 Secrets to the Best Education for Your Child","review":"This is an excellent entry level book for someone who is interested in knowing the most important reasons to take responsibility to educate your children."},{"Title":"Upgrade: 10 Secrets to the Best Education for Your Child","review":"Upgrade:10 Secrets To The Best Education For Your Child by Kevin Swanson (Executive Director of Christian Home Educators of Colorado) is a \\"parent friendly\\" study of the definitive modern education process of home-schooling. Informing its readers of the many intricacies and understandings of the home-schooling process which Swanson has come through years of experience and expertise to knowledgeably grasp, Upgrade offers an invaluable and instructive reference which focuses on the preeminence of character development, one-on-one instruction, the nurturing of individuality, and establishing a fundamentally competent knowledge of the basics. Upgrade is very strongly recommended reading, particularly for parents of homeschooled children for its uncompromisingly useful information."},{"Title":"Upgrade: 10 Secrets to the Best Education for Your Child","review":"Kevin Swanson believes that a successful education is achieved when a child is prepared to make maximal use of his God-given talents and abilities in the accomplishment of the child's calling. With great passion, he writes a series of 10 principles for achieving the best education for our children. Swanson's list of \\"10 Time-Tested Secrets for a Successful Education\\" are:1. The preeminence of character2. Quality one-on-one instruction3. The principle of protection4. The principle of individuality5. The routing in relationships6. The principle of doing the basics well7. The principle of life integration8. Maintaining the honor and mystique of learning9. Build on the right foundation10. The principle of wise, sequential progressionIt is obvious that Mr. Swanson favors homeschooling as the best option for living out the ten principles. However he is still able to challenge those whose children are in other schooling environments as well as teachers themselves. Some of these principles would have really helped me out when I taught in a Christian Academy a few years ago.This book gives adequate critique of the problems in modern education, and also supplies many solutions to those problems. There is an obvious indebtedness to the teaching of Doug Phillips of Vision Forum Ministries. Although he only references them one time, he gives the same analysis and historical understanding of the sickness of modern education. You may not agree with all of Mr. Swanson's conclusions, but you will appreciate his passion for providing students with a distinctively Christian education that captivates the mind and heart of the students. I heartily recommend this book as a resource for Christian parents in determining how they can best educate their children."},{"Title":"Upgrade: 10 Secrets to the Best Education for Your Child","review":"This book is a concise, highly readable description of ten principles to guide the education of children. One of the great strengths of this book is that by stating principles the author mostly avoids making recommendations in terms of curriculum, teaching styles, or other specifics. In fact one of the principles is the \\"Principle of duality\\" which states that any one method or focus will not work with every child.This book is written from a Christian perspective, although I believe that all parents and educators could learn from the principles of this book. If you are a Christian you will appreciate the Scriptural foundations provided for each principal.The author, Kevin Swanson, is the Executive Director of Christian Home Educators of Colorado. Although he certainly encourages home schooling as an advisable option for most families, I feel that he does not go over the line on pushing this as an agenda and even acknowledges that home schooling is not the best option for every family and situation.As a Father with his first child entering preschool next week, I found this book to be very beneficial in providing a focus and clarifying my thinking on educating my children. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Upgrade: 10 Secrets to the Best Education for Your Child","review":"If you are a teacher or a parent who is passionate about the education of your children, you must read this book. His definition of education as \\"the preparation of a child intellectually, emotionally, spiritually, and physically for life and for eternity\\" made a lot of sense to me, as a homeschool mom of five, and to my husband who is a school headmaster. We are not just looking for our children to ace the SAT, but we are preparing them for so much more- life here and life in eternity. What will that kind of education look like?

One to go back to over and over."},{"Title":"Upgrade: 10 Secrets to the Best Education for Your Child","review":"This book has a lot of great content and a message that Christian parents and educators need to hear. It also has a lot relevance to those who many not be Christians but want the best education for their children. The author lays out universal principles that are applicable over the board, not a specific curriculum that will be outdated in five years. I would definitely recommend this book to others. I gave it four star only because I reserve five star for the best of the best."},{"Title":"Upgrade: 10 Secrets to the Best Education for Your Child","review":"As Kevin Swanson clearly states in the Introduction, \\"parents have a committed interest in their children's education; and they must, therefore, be equipped to make intelligent, well-informed choices concerning that education.\\" Admittedly I rate this book highly since I myself am a home educator to my 6 year old son. Like most home educators, and parents in general, I care deeply about the education of not only my child (and future children), but also about the education of other people's children.Each chapter is laid out in a simple and consistent manner with helpful subheadings and a clearly written conclusion reminding the reader about the key concept of that chapter, providing them with ample opportunity to assess their own conclusions from what they have just read. Mr. Swanson clearly lays out data from National Assessment and Evaluation Program results for education and shows how well students perform in Public vs. Private Schools as well as discusses how both Public and Private schooled students compare with home schooled students.In addition to his personal stories, Mr. Swanson provides examples from history and uses Scripture throughout to illustrate his points and to point the reader to the purpose of education which he defines as:\\"...the preparation of a child intellectually, emotionally, spiritually, and physically for life and for eternity.\\"While this book and the author clearly supports and encourages home education, this book is not making the claim that the \\"best\\" education for your child is necessarily home schooling.

It examined the modern educational system - from God's perspective. It validates a parent who is seeking the best future for their kids.

We prefer cooking dishes from scratch in less than 1 hour. This book fits our constraints perfectly. Without it, we would be lost in the kitchen."},{"Title":"1000 Vegetarian Recipes From Around the World","review":"this book has a lot to choose from. very well put together with calorie counts, time needed to prepare, and plenty of pictures.i like the fact that all cultures are represented in the book. pages are easy to wipe off too. happy cooking!"},{"Title":"1000 Vegetarian Recipes From Around the World","review":"This book has a lot of promise, and I really want to like it. I'll start with what's good:The book is organized fabulously. Each recipe is on its own page, with a large color photo, a few step-by-step photos, nutrition information, and a difficulty gage. The recipes are organized into general sections, like Soups, Pasta & Rice, Outdoor Cooking, etc., though there's no table of contents or index. There are a lot of recipes that look and sound delicious, and make you want to jump right in and start cooking.Once I started cooking out of it, though, my thoughts changed a bit. I'm a beginning cook who doesn't have a lot of extra cash (college student). One major problem with the book that I began to notice right off the bat is that the vast majority of recipes are very \\"gourmet\\", whith long ingredient lists and uncommon ingredients. Several of the pasta recipes call for fresh pasta, there's liberal use of fresh herbs and gourmet mushrooms, and a lot of them simply don't seem to be aimed at the quick-and-easy set (which is fine, if that's what you want).The real clincher for me though was that none of the recipes really turned out that well for me. I skip back and forth between this book and another (Fanny Farmer) for recipe ideas, and even for nearly identical dishes the ones from this book took longer to make and turned out bland and unappetizing. There were several that I didn't have any comparison for that ended up being a disaster.Of course, I haven't tried all of the recipes here, so there could be some real gems I haven't come across (or that I screwed up in the process). I hope that's the case, because I'm going to keep trying it every so often amongst my other books. But as of right now, I wouldn't recommend this over any other vegetarian cookbook. While it's nice to look at and get inspired by, the time, effort, and taste just hasn't been worth it."},{"Title":"1000 Vegetarian Recipes From Around the World","review":"due to the fact that many of my friends that see the book want it immediately, and, for those that live out of country I usually oblige.First of all this is not just a cookbook for vegetarians since almost all the recepies can be used as fabulous, new and tasty side dishes. The author had to use a lot of creativity in these recepies since in being able to present a dish that not only looks tasteful but also is considered as a main dish for the vegetarians in your crowd. There are some pastry and filo dough items that are quite unique .....The presentation of this book as well is fabulous. ALL and I mean ALL the recepies take up only one page, each page has a presentation picture, and, for any slightly more complicated recepies small thumbnails showing the prep steps. In colour of course ..... Also, each recepie gives a carb, calorie, sugar etc breakdown, an estimated time for completion of the dish and a small graphic as to how many steps are required to prepare the dish .... The instrcutions are clear cut and concise ...Since this is an 'international' edition of, I guess, a USA book the recepies are very very varied and include dishes from both the Far and Middle East, from Thailand, Latin America etc etc .....

I could not cook/live without this cookbook.The pictures are excellent, and the recipes are varied: Indian Hyderabad pickles to stellar Italian pasta dishes. Over the past year, I've tried the appetizers, breads, pasta dishes, salads and met tasty success with all of them.This cookbook is more of an introduction to than a tutorial in international cooking. Some of the recipes are a bit westernized, and the dishes suffer minor compromise. The desserts are a little too health-conscious for my taste, but the rest of the book makes up for it. Despite these drawbacks, I would recommend this cookbook to anyone--vegetarian or not, beginner to advanced cook."},{"Title":"1000 Vegetarian Recipes From Around the World","review":"I bought this cookbook because my kids decided to become vegetarians, and my repetoire was limited. I have found the recipes very easy to follow. There are great pictures for many of the steps. Most recipes cook up very quickly. So far they have been pretty bland, so be prepared to add extra spices. I like the international flavor of the book."},{"Title":"1000 Vegetarian Recipes From Around the World","review":"I've noted in my last few cookbook reviews that I've been spending some time lately going through my big bookshelf of cookbooks and giving kudos to the ones I love and giving away those I don't.I took this cookbook off the shelf last week wondering why I didn't remember any dishes I'd made out of it...I've had it for years. (I got it at TJ Maxx for a couple bucks. Can't beat that.) It's gorgeous, it's huge, it has a photo of every recipe, it even contains nutritional information.In short, this cookbook is put together the way I want all my cookbooks to be. A world of selections and you know what you are getting...So, I began flipping through the pages to decide what I'd be cooking from it this week. Oddly, although I enjoy reading a cookbook like some do a novel and taste the flavors in my head even before cooking...it was no easy task to find a recipe I wanted to cook.While the build of the cookbook is wonderful, oddly, it's the recipes that make it lacking for a better rating.There are, for example, maybe 50 rice recipes alone. Not dishes with rice in them, mind you, but just flavored rice. Jasmine rice, cumin rice, coconut rice, pesto rice... fairly plain. There are a lot of dishes that just have \\"little\\" to them or seem to be \\"filler\\" recipes in order to get the book bigger, it seems. Which may be, perhaps, why it wound up being sold at a discount store.Then you have the \\"wow\\" dishes that I wanted to cook until I read the nutritionals and found that many had around 800 calories for a small serving. So I passed on those. I'd normally set aside dishes like this for a dinner party but they weren't THAT much of a \\"wow\\". Such as Vegetable Ravioli at 822 calories, Spinach lasagna at 720 calories, Walnut and Olive Pasta at 823... Nothing special, just really fattening for small servings.Then I found some really unusual dishes (scores of these) like Indonesian Onions, honey and nut nests (spaghetti with honey and nuts and lemon juice), olive cake, crisp pickled vegetables, etc...not my thing. And there were TONS of these.But, sadly, most dishes were more like side dishes than vegetarian meals. Scores of fairly plain potato dishes and the barbecue section consisted primarily of just plain chopped vegetables on skewers. And, trust me, I love me some 'taters...but not these.Some dishes were very plain, or common like nachos (yes, really...a recipe for putting cheese on chips and maybe even gettin' wicked with it and adding refried beans.)(grin). There were lots of salsa recipes and fairly drab salad recipes. And I'm in a salad phase right now so I was an easy sell on salad but found few that weren't odd or bland ingredient-wise.So, I'll be totally honest. I tore out 9 recipes I wanted to keep and put them in my binder. I wanted to keep this one! I really did...but I only kept a little over a handful of its contents. Yeah, just nine. I'll give away the rest of the cookbook...I cooked 6 dishes from this book this week and they won't be repeats. But there are still some that do sound good that I am going to give a shot...and those are the 9. These include beautiful dishes that read well with full flavors like the Trio of Potato Purees, Mexican Potato Salad, tomato and pasta bake, and some soups.That said, I don't meet many cookbooks I don't enjoy. I love to cook. I love to food...and this cookbook would be good if you are looking for simple ideas like Bell Peppers with Thyme, potatoes in olive oil, some flavors of rice, etc. That's not a bad thing. It just, for me, tends to lean to being more of a side dish cookbook and not a very hearty one at that. However, there are lots of vegan recipes interspersed throughout the book so if you are a household including both a vegetarian or sometimes vegetarian and a vegan, this cookbook may be just the ticket for you.It missed my own kitchen as its target audience...veg eaters but flavor lovers, but I can't help but say it was wonderfully organized. It's dishes, for me, were bland or a little too exotic but, that said, if you never count calories there are some uber yummy sounding dishes at around 800 calories in here that I had to pass over.

Basically 90% of my home-cooked meals come from this book, the rest is generally from the internet.Before I move again I'm going to sell the rest of my cookbooks because they're really just taking up space (and getting covered in dust)I am just so happy that I had a roommate with this book years ago, because with it being out of print, I don't know if I would have even known it existed!(and to the person that thought there were too many expensive ingredients---cookbooks are just a guideline, you have to be willing to substitute sometime, and in that case, the internet is your friend)"},{"Title":"1000 Vegetarian Recipes From Around the World","review":"This is without a doubt the best cookbook I own. It taught me how to cook Indian food. One of the best things about it is that there are photos for each and every recipe. I am one of those people that needs to know how it's supposed to look when it's done, especially for international dishes that I have never seen. My Indian husband said that I can cook better than most Indians; I owe that to this book. In most cases, I have to double the spices to get the flavor closer to traditional Indian food. There are not just Indian recipes in here, but that's what I bought it for. It took the fear out of approaching something very foreign and complicated to me. Great Dhal recipe, potato fritters, samosas, and 997 more recipes... yummy! Well written, helpful photos, a keeper."},{"Title":"1000 Vegetarian Recipes From Around the World","review":"I've been using this book for 5 years now. I've been a vegetarian for 11 years now. It's one of my most used along with the Moosewood cookbooks. Lot's of variety from easy to difficult, gourmet to simple. I love the indian recipes here the most. That being said, with a thousand recipes in here the Index and complete lack of any kind of Table of Contents makes it very difficult to use. For the price I'm amazed they got away with that. I often find myself flipping through hundreds of pages to find \\"that one\\" recipe that is perfect for whatever I need. Say your looking for a omlet-frittata type thing you remember making at one time. Any other cookbook you would look up eggs in the index right? Not here, the index goes almost solely by the name of the recipe which often has nothing to do with the main ingredients. With all the specialty ingredients here they really needed more explanation about what some ingredients are and where to find them. Prepare to do some research to find out what you need and construct your own useful Index. Once you've done that it's really got some great stuff."},{"Title":"1000 Vegetarian Recipes From Around the World","review":"LOVE this cookbook!!!

They are easy to prepare, ingredients are readily available, no extra shopping trip necessary if you include fresh produce in your weekly groceries. Most importantly, the recipes are very economical and the end results are delicious, consistently.Recipes are satisfying, we never feel like something more substantial is missing. The 'i-t&uuml;pfelchen', (the extra cherry on the creme) is the caloric and nutritional information.A wonderful book for starters if you are just beginning your vegetarian journey. It includes recipes for lacto-ovo vegetarians as well as vegans.The pictures are appetizing, 1000 recipes from which to choose, you will never get to the end of this book. It is extremely well organized.Although they are easy to make, the recipes are fancy enough for special occasions.Since owning this book, all my other vegetarian books have receded into the backwall of the bookshelf.

My parents stumbled accross this book and gave it to me as gift. I was a bit skeptical as other vegetarian cookbooks leave alot to be desired. But I was floored by the difference in this book. Yes the layout is different. It is organized by courses - which I love. Your appetizers, soups, salads, etc.. are all in neat sections. Great pictures show you what the finished product looks like, and wonderful step by step pictures help for the more difficult tasks. Now, don't take me for a novice in the kitchen. I have prepared my share of dishes that most house chefs wouldn't even attempt (in level of difficulty). I have yet to find a recipe in this book that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. You might have to add a bit of salt or pepper to suit your taste - but I usually don't. I find the recipes are designed to bring out the individual flavours of the elements of the dish. If you are looking for &quot;BAM!!!&quot; look for some books written by some other chefs (who shall remain nameless). But if you want to be wowed by phenominal vegetarian recipes (which even the vegan can be content with) check out this book."},{"Title":"1000 Vegetarian Recipes From Around the World","review":"This is the best cookbook of all.

The author was a woman who wrote in 1704 of her travels in the New England region of North America. When this was largely still raw frontier.We get a first hand account of colonial life, apparently uncensored. Many aspects come thru her narrative. Including the presence of slaves. Her descriptions of them and their experiences and duties, at least as perceived by her, are rather neutral. She does not condemn slavery but accepts it as a natural order of things. It is perhaps this casual acceptance that can be the most jarring feature of the book, to the contemporary reader.In passing, you might also appreciate that white women then had a fair amount of freedom. Less than white men, but not oppressed or constricted as some women today are, in some Muslim nations."},{"Title":"The journal of Madam Knight","review":"This book was a real treat to read. :) Sarah Knight was a woman who lived in Boston and traveled mostly by herself on horseback from Boston to New York City and back. Luckily for us, she kept a journal. She wrote candidly and with a sense of humor about the trials she faced on the journey as well as the people she encountered. Historical fiction is wonderful but a genuine diary is even more revealing. I'd recommend this little book to anyone interested in our colonial history."},{"Title":"Meyebela: My Bengali Girlhood","review":"Taslima Nasrin&#65533;s is a strong competent voice from Bangladesh. She has been in exile ever since her controversial book \\"Lajja\\" or \\"Shame\\" about Muslim persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh caused a fatwa to be issued against her. Meyebela, My Bengali Girlhood: A Memoir of Growing up Female in a Muslim World is Nasrin&#65533;s heart-wrenching account of a desperate childhood in Mymensingh, a relatively small town in Bangladesh.In this memoir (one of two volumes), Nasrin openly questions her religion, Islam, and its discrimination against women. Her sad and depressing childhood was an unfortunate byproduct of a unique combination of cruel elements, one of which was a repressive society where \\"I was simply supposed to accept&#65533;without asking questions&#65533;whatever the grownups decided to bestow on me, be it punishment or reward.\\" Taslima was treated like a second-class citizen all throughout and horrifically abused by her uncles. Add to these, Nasrin had very unstable parents&#65533;a mother who was driven to religious extremism by a philandering father and a father who was extremely harsh yet very insistent on education. Having had his first two sons fail his \\"expectations\\", he pinned all his hopes on young Taslima and her sister, Yasmin. The girls were denied all social interaction (Nasrin&#65533;s father had high walls built around the house so the girls could not look beyond it and get distracted) and the books were made to be their only focus.Nasrin&#65533;s memoir, which is set against the Bangladesh war for independence, makes some very important points about religion and a girl&#65533;s role in an oppressive society. Like a flood of memories though, her memoir seems to shift out of focus occasionally. Towards the end, parts of her statements get to be repetitive.Taslima Nasrin did become a doctor and lived up to her father&#65533;s expectations. In that sense, he \\"won\\". But eventually Nasrin did manage to find her own voice-- one that continues to speak powerfully on behalf of oppressed women all over the world.Nasrin in her memoir tells us what life truly is like for many girls around the world. It is our duty to listen. It is sad though that we can often do little more than be outraged."},{"Title":"Meyebela: My Bengali Girlhood","review":"A very interesting book, not always fun to read and maybe like the first reviewer says not always really well, or at least tightly, written. However, the account of this girlhood was shocking to me. I think now I understand feminism much better then before. And even though I've spent some time in Bangladesh, I now feel like I understand life in Bangladesh much better than before as well. I feel it was extremely worthwhile reading this book. It taught me a lot about how most of the world lives."},{"Title":"Meyebela: My Bengali Girlhood","review":"I'll be brief since one reviewer elucidated my points quite well.There's no doubt that Taslima Nasrin will go down in history was one of the greatest writers the south Asian community has even produced. She has clear vision on contemporary issues within the south Asian world. Her recent novel is of course a \\"magnum Opus\\"that will be remembered by many. My only contention is that she tends to have a rather fervid tendency to over-generalize excessively. At times her statements about Islam in the book contradict her statements in speeches and other prints. Her critique of religion regurgitates old-fashioned arguments that stymies the reader( at least this reviewer). A good biography indeed. However, don't use it as a critique or religion."},{"Title":"Meyebela: My Bengali Girlhood","review":"I read the book on a recent business trip and found it beautifully written. It maybe just one instance of a female muslim childhood, but as long as it is truthfully told, there should not be any objections. THe narrative voice is clear and poetic. The characters in this book come across as vivid and complex. Even though some very painful and ugly incidents are described, the book does not try to shock. Rather, there is a sense of humanity and love in the way the stories are relayed..."},{"Title":"Meyebela: My Bengali Girlhood","review":"My husband is Bangladeshi, so I was interested in reading this book. The book is interesting in providing an insight into a dysfunctional, abusive home and childhood. It makes clear the critical need for third world countries to seriously address the issue of abuse and oppression of women. However, the book gets repetitive and tiresome after a while.The reason I am giving the book only two stars is because it treats all of Bangladesh and all of Islam as one-dimensional. We are left assuming everyone is like that. Both of my husband's sisters have graduate degrees and his mother was head of the household, even though his father had spent a decade studying religion in an Islamic school. There wasn't any abuse and no prohibition against his sister's playing outdoors. They didn't wear head coverings either.The subtitle A Memoir of Growing Up Female in a Muslim world is misleading. Her story unfortunately is common for females all over the third world including India, China, South America, Africa, and to a lesser extent the US and Europe. Domination and abuse of women knows no borders and is practiced by members of all faiths. Nasrin is not objective and makes a lot of generalizations about Islam being the problem. I am Christian but I also grew up with a domineering father. Nasrin, unfortunately, has alienated her countrymen instead of engaging them."},{"Title":"Meyebela: My Bengali Girlhood","review":"I usually enjoy reading books by women writers from the Indian subcontinent. This was one book that could not hold my attention - badly written, repetitive, and unnecessarily lengthy: a tedious read. Ms. Nasrin sounds like a manipulative child - she knows what the West wants to hear and makes too much of an effort to please."},{"Title":"Incises: Pour Piano (Version 2001)","review":"This was originally written in 1994 as a showpiece for piano competitions,an obligatory item to be learned by the participants. It is late Boulez, the more accessible period where dimensions of surface seem to have interested him yet not in a simplistic way.Many draw the same breath of this \\"Incises\\" with the youthful(quite widely played) \\"12 Notations\\" for piano solo,but those earlier shibboleths were quite naive little piano textures,violent and brutal,yet obvious and predictable,well they were student creations revealing an interest in modernity. \\"Incises\\" for piano solo here however was destined for larger habitations as the \\"12 Notations\\" (that found themselves metamorphosized into brilliant orchestral etudes. Boulez seems to have takened a deep interest late in life in the music materials as objects where the creator then through some functional plan can work where the music can go by themselves templates shapes, forms \\"readymades\\" I guess we can call them,something already in the world;very post-modern inorientation.\\"Incises\\" here found a resting place in the much more ambitious prize winning \\"Sur Incises\\" for Three Pianos, Three Harps, and Three Tuned Percussion instruments. Curious how \\"Sur Incises\\" still maintains its \\"etude\\" dimension\\" not really setting itself into an \\"Other\\" trajectory. But I like to consider \\"Incises\\" the piano solo and its revision in 2001 as a totally isolated piece absorbed in its own pathways, and places for piano timbre.\\"Incises\\" the term refers to \\"cutting\\",not the way people of all expressive lifeworld modes today cut themselves (as a signifier for -feeling- [real]), but more a function of time and [nature], the way the inevitable flow of water for example ;cuts; itself into a river as it slowly descends down a continent,how channels :cuts: through sediment, or more lapidarian how a steel needle might=cut= a metal plate. Boulez's creativity has searched at times for process, how a concept might come to define and direct the way the music and its materials proceeds and envelopes itself in durational shapes,time and lengths. We could even speak of Piaget's theories on how children experience time, to find where Boulez's quite obvious piano solo here finds itself,its function. The piece has many repeated tones,very virtuosic,very direct,no mysteries; it plays itself to the grandstands.The \\"cutting\\" is in the way lines interrupt,intermingle, glide,roll,turn,bend,shape override and juxtapose themselves/itselves onto each other\\"cutting\\" themselves within the texture of the musical proceedings. Marilyn Nonken plays the hell out of this piece, if you have ever heard her Boulez, Winston Choi as well."},{"Title":"Stampede to timberline: The ghost towns and mining camps of Colorado","review":"I have been researching the area of Colorado where my great grandparents were pioneer settlers in the 1870s. Their town, Rosita, in Custer County, is listed in many \\"ghost town\\" books, with a paragraph or two about its history. That's what I was expecting with Stampede to Timberline, but this book provided much more in-depth information.In the 1940s, Muriel Sibell Wolle traveled to Rosita, and to dozens of other old mining areas. In each community, Wolle interviewed the oldest residents she could find. She asked them to recall details of the earliest days of the area and she recorded their stories in this book. Wolle also sketched a scene from each community, which she used to illustrate her stories.In this book, I was delighted to find historical details about the area I have researched, that I have not found anywhere else! This is a large book, and every locale included in it has first-hand reports of historical information. This book was a huge undertaking and accomplishment for Muriel Sibell Wolle.I would very much recommend Stampede to Timberline for students of Colorado history and for tourists, as well."},{"Title":"Stampede to timberline: The ghost towns and mining camps of Colorado","review":"Having had an interest in ghost towns since the 1960s, I have accumulated a large collection of books on the subject. I can say without any reservation that the books by the late Muriel Sibell Wolle and also books by Lambert Florin are in a class all their own. I have not seen this particular edition because mine was printed in 1974. The first printing was in 1949. This latest version should be the best of all.Muriel's books are what ghost town books should be. They are filled with stories about the towns and the people who lived in them and that brings the towns to life. I also have many newer books on ghost towns but none come close to those by Wolle or Florin. For example, newer books by Philip Varney have nice color pictures but they lack the real heart of ghost town books... the stories. Varney and later authors tend to simply present dry facts and statistics about the towns (and not many of them!) accompanied by color pictures. They treat the towns more as scenery while largely ignoring the history that makes the towns so interesting. Wolle and Florin's books are mostly text and the are illustrated by charming b&w; drawings. Wolle, an artist, did her own sketches. I have no problem with color photographs of ghost towns since I am a professional photographer myself and ghost towns are one of my specialties but there is just a timeless quality and moodiness to sketches and b&w; photographs that link them to the past.It's hard to put Stampede to Timberline down once one begins to read it. In fact, reading it has rekindled a dream I have had about moving to Colorado (I am retired), getting an old but rugged 4WD vehicle with good ground clearance and searching for more of these towns and mining camps. Be warned that if you are not from Colorado or are otherwise not used to driving on mountain passes, you will be in for a shock when you try to get to some of these towns. Some of the \\"roads\\" are so narrow that one car barely fits on it with it's wheels hanging over cliffs that may be thousands of feet high. Some of them couldn't even be called trails! They're more like incredibly steep boulder strewn riverbeds that cling to cliff faces. You will read about some of Muriel's adventures on those roads in this book.The only negative about Wolle's books and those by Florin is that they are dated and many of the towns described in them are greatly changed since the books were first written. Some towns have vanished; some have crumbled to near oblivion; some have been re-born and are thriving. But no other books about ghost towns give you greater background information on these old towns and mining camps or treat you with such fascinating reading.Wolle and Florin made a tremendous contribution in preserving the memory of these towns. Their books should be the foundation of any library about ghost towns. I cannot recommend this book or Florin's books more highly."},{"Title":"Stampede to timberline: The ghost towns and mining camps of Colorado","review":"I ENJOYED THE BOOK AS IT TELLS IT LIKE IT WAS.REAL GOOD STUFF ON BLOODY BRIDLES WAITE, ONE OF MY UNSUNG HEROES OF THE WEST.

This way the publisher and the compilers keep on plundering unashamedly the parents' pockets. Interestingly, to compile comes from the latin \\"compilare\\", which means to plunder. Compilation as it is, plus \\"obvious\\" literary theory, this book should cost no more than its weight in paper plus a few dollars. The obvious recommendation to the student is: when completed the course sell this \\"brick\\" before a new edition appears, and buy and read the full versions of the classics (Sophocles, Shakespeare, Lord Tennyson, Ibsen, Chekhov, Faulkner, Melville, Browning, J. Keats, Donne, Wordsworth, W. B. Yeats, ...); disregard all the remaining mediocre authors this book includes. Regarding Sophocles, Oedipux Rex, the translation the compilers have chosen is by Duddley Fitts and Robert Fitzgerald. Fitts was a playwriter, and Fitzgerald, academic as he was and popularly known for his translations of The Iliad and The Odyssey, was never a \\"translator\\" but a \\"paraphraser\\". Read the translations by Lattimore for a \\"taste\\" of the originals, or better: the translations by Murray. Regarding \\"obvious\\" literary theory a few sentences choosen at random from the 9th edition will suffice: Drama \\"normally presents its action (a) through actors, (b) on stage, and (c) before an audience\\" (pp.1028).\\"The sharpness and vividness of any image will ordinarily depend on how specific it is and on the poet's use of effective detail\\" (pp. 702).\\"Talented authors achieve compression by exercising a careful selectivity\\" (pp. 274)."},{"Title":"Perrine's Literature: Structure, Sound, and Sense","review":"I am an A.P. teacher who ordered several copies from Amazon, and after a year, the bindings on the books were destroyed.

Kenyan book and I have read almost all of them after reading this one. As simple as the new birth in Christ is to receive, the understanding of the realities of being a new creation contain a wealth of revelation. This book, as with all of Kenyan's books, contains a wealth of scripture to substantiate who we are in Christ, what being born again means positionally and vitally, and what that position in Christ allows us to realistically see ourselves as. If we don't understand our position in Christ we cannot have the faith God requires us to have to &quot;reward those who diligently seek him&quot;.

It biblically breaks down the &quot;new creation&quot; process and through the Word of God shows you what that means and how it was appropriated. You clearly see your new identity and you get a clear picture of not only what God sees and thinks about you, you also get biblical proof that those thoughts are indeed factual. If you struggle with guilt or condemnation or at times think that things are just &quot;too good to be true&quot; you must read this book and realize it is very true.It is impossible to rise to your true stature and destiny if you first don't know or even understand what it all entails.

I found it to be an inspirational and life changing book. We are truly New Creations when we have given our lives to Jesus. Kenyon so powerfully brings out all that the Realities that such a term means. A personal example is how my prayer life has been transformed. Kenyon helped me grasp the reality that I, as a child of God, can walk into the throne room with my petitions, without any sense of shame or condemnation. I love the way Kenyon brings out the power of Scripture to show all that Jesus did on our behalf. Kenyon's explanations has given me a greater boldness to live in the freedom Jesus intended me to have. The Scriptures were always there, but Kenyon makes them come alive and brings out the exciting possibilities of the power that is ours in order to advance His kingdom on the earth.

Allen Smith I could get my hands upon. The premise: a belligerent, zag-tailed feral tomcat is adopted by an elderly millionaire, gets named &quot;Rhubarb&quot; for his fierce cantankerousness, and inherits an ailing New York baseball team that just natcherally rises to pennant contention under the unlikely circumstances attending upon their change in ownership.With no attempt whatsoever to prettify the character of the most un-Disneyesque animal protagonist in the history of popular fiction, *Rhubarb* tickled the hell out of me back then -- so much so that the dentist thought there was a leak in his nitrous oxide system. It's worth reading no matter how long it takes to find a copy. Anyone who can't take delight from this representative slice of America in the '50s is so much in need of a prescription for mood-elevating pharmaceuticals that obliging a patient to read the first chapter of *Rhubarb* and watching his reaction could probably serve as a better assessment of depression than the Beck scale."},{"Title":"Rhubarb (The New York Loons)","review":"This book has been in my family's library for the past 54 years, but I had never read it until last night when I was looking for something to cheer me up after I'd finished reading a very sad book that had drained me emotionally.

It was a joy. The characters are goofy. Who cares if they're believable? They're hilarious! I've ordered everything else by H. Allen Smith (even though most of it is out-of-print.

Allen Smith yarn. When Thaddeus J. Banner (Gene Lockhart), multimillionaire owner of the Brooklyn baseball team, passes away, he wills the team and his $30 million estate to his pugnacious pet cat Rhubarb. Banner's press agent Eric Yeagar (Ray Milland) finds this hilarious, until he discovers that he's been appointed Rhubarb's guardian and business manager. One of the crosses Yeagar has to bear is the fact that his sweetheart Polly Sickles (Jan Sterling), the daughter of Brooklyn team manager Len Sickles (William Frawley), is deathly allergic to cats. Still, Yeagar must keep Rhubarb with him at all times, especially when the cat turns out to be a good-luck charm for the perennially basement-dwelling Brooklyn ballplayers. Thanks to Rhubarb's inspiration, the team makes it to the Pennant Race, whereupon the plot really thickens.

It outlines clearly how the problem of the Palestinian refugees was created - by forced eviction at the gunpoints of Zionist terrorist units, the leaders of which later became many of Israel's prime ministers - and explains, through detailed examination of the historical record and of international law, the sense of justice that a right of return would create in the international community.This crucial issue, which has always been at the soul of the current conflict over Israel/Palestine, is usually overlooked in American news analyses. This book brings the issue to the fore with compelling intellectual force. No person concerned with justice, be he Jew (as I am) or Arab or of other origin, can afford to ignore it.Yossef LevinsteinIsrael"},{"Title":"Palestinian Refugees: The Right of Return (Pluto Middle Eastern Studies,)","review":"Many will unfairly denounce this book simply for virtue that it does not show Israel in a purely positive light. However, this book is well-timed as it contains much revisionist history about the Arab-israeli conflict. For example, the Israeli government in 2002 finally declassified documents that showed that the Mossad funded and helped create Hamas to destabalize the PLO and fragment the Palestinians with a \\"homegrown, religious alternative.\\" Shimon Peres has come forward and testified to this and it is undisputed fact.This book in no way favors the Palestinians. It gives equal time to discussing the sycophantic leaders who have allowed Arafat to stay in power and disrupt the peace process at nearly every turn. The main purpose of this book, though, is to provide a clear argument for the sake of evaluating the possibility of the refugees returning to their lands in Israel. It discusses very eloquently through several articles how such a return would actually work to the advantage of both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. This book is a major-policy read, so you won't find much propaganda. This book is not for the lightly attentive. There are many details and a lot of governmental and diplomatic language involved. Not for the light reader.This book also contains one of the last articles that renowned academic and Nobel Peace Prize winner Edward Said wrote before he lost his battle to lukemia this past year. Edward Said was most noted as the man who propounded the theories of Orientalism and Occidentalism.If you wish to gain a better understanding for what viable options there are to solve the current Arab-Israeli conflict, read this book."},{"Title":"Palestinian Refugees: The Right of Return (Pluto Middle Eastern Studies,)","review":"I have read many topics on the issue of the Arab and Israeli Conflict and only few of them have been written as well as this book with all the facts. Personally, I enjoyed the book only because I have read numerous books with the pro-Israeli views and this is the first I have read that was pro-Palestinian. It was very interesting to see how both sides contradict each other and debate without even speaking. I also did not know much of what was happening to Palestinians thanks to American media and the lack of their portrayal of such topics, however this book was excellent in explaining such things."},{"Title":"Palestinian Refugees: The Right of Return (Pluto Middle Eastern Studies,)","review":"This excellent, scholarly volume presents the most comprehensive coverage to date of the various aspects of the Palestinian refugee issue. Its sixteen contributors--American, Arab, and Jewish intelectuals--provide in depth research and analysis under four headings: (1) the historical context, (2) the interests of the major actors, (3) return or permanent exile, and (4) refugee claims and the search for a just solution. The volume is extremely timely as the refugee issue is one of the major questions in the &quot;final status&quot; talks mandated by the 1993 Declaration of Principles that is the legal framework for the entire Oslo peace process. (One must hope that the past year of Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be resolved and that negotiations for a final settlement will be rsumed.) The book is of added importance, coming in the wake of research by numerous Israeli scholars (Benny Morris, Avi Shalim, Ilan Pappe, Zeev Sternhell, Simha Flapan, Tom Segev, &amp; others), who have conclusively demonstrated Israel's planned, organized, and implemented strategy for removing the Palestinians. All have illustrated that in its quest to have a &quot;Jewish State,&quot; the Haganah and other forces undertook a systematic campaign of ethnic-cleansing that created the refugee issue. Aruri's book then, provides a bridge between Israeli responsibility for creating the original refugee situation and its responsibility today for resolving it in a just manner. &quot;Palestinian Refugees&quot; makes a compelling historical, human, and legal case for the Palestinian right of return. The volume is an excellent source for those engaged in research on the issue; for graduate and undergraduate students; and for policy makers and practioners. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Palestinian Refugees: The Right of Return (Pluto Middle Eastern Studies,)","review":"Nur Masalha in chapter 2 writes that Plan D was implemented in early 1948, officially implying the clearing and expulsion of Palestinian villages and villagers. Maslah goes through some of the 100 or so massacres by the Hagannah. For example he quotes the account of soldiers in Moshe Dayan's batallion about the massacre of 80-100 people at Al-Dawayma in October 1948. Safsaf, Oct. 1948, several dozen men dumped in a well and shot; hundreds massacre by Palmach, elite strike force of Hagannah, then hundreds more in forced march of inhabitants to Arab army lines; 70 Arab detainees massacred May 1948 at Ayn Zaytun. Hula, October 1948, Shmuel Lahis murdered perhaps up to 80 villagers he was gaurding in this Lebanese village (Masalha does not mention that Lahis later became secretary general of the Jewish agency and was amnestied after recieving a seven year prison sentence for this crime and was given a liscence to practice law by the Israeli legal council on the ground the his act carried no stigma). Masalha writes this to show that massacres were a big part of the policy of the mainstream Hagannah; not simply those of the \\"dissident\\" Irgun and Stern Gang. Masalha continues with a discussion of the explusion of thousands of Azame tribesmen from 1949 to 1956. He notes that Northern commander Yitzhak Rabin, which like his role in the Lydda and Ramle expulsion of 1948 as Palmach commander, he recounted in his memoirs his using the cover of the Suez war in October 1956 to expel thousands of Israeli Arabs in Northern Israel to Syria. It happened one day after the Kafr Qassem massacre.Wadie Said discusses the abysmal treatment of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, where they have little chance of employment or getting the social services given to other Lebanese. They must even build their houses in their camps in ramshackle manner so as not to make them permanent. The reason given is that the government insists that the they don't want to give up the Palestinian right of return to their homes in Palestine by integrating them into their society but they are more likely actually concerned about tipping the precarious confessional balance in favor of Sunni Muslims. Said gives an instructive incident from September 1995, when Gadaffi expelled all Palestinian workers from Libya as a way of protesting the peace process but the Lebanese government insisted those coming from Lebanon couldn't return but had to reapply for a passport even though Lebanese law said they didn't need to.Noam Chomsky that the U.S. supported Israel's rejection of Sadat's offer to recognize Israel in return for the Sinai in February 1971. When the Arab states and the PLO supported a resolution in January 1976 calling for adding a Palestinian state to resolution 242, promising to let Israel live in peace and security, the U.S. vetoed it but a month before Israel had engaged in a \\"preventive\\" bombing of Beirut, killing 57 civillians in Beirut to let the security council know what it thought while it was deliberating.Salman Abu Sitta presents his scheme for possibly resettling refugees within Pre-1967 Israel. He reasons that there is alot of land available seeing as how only 14 percent of Israeli Jews live on 78 percent of the land. The refugees for instance could fit right in to their former homes in the Galilee which is already majority Arab anyway. In the Negev there is lots of space. Most of the Kibbutzim, which are mostly bankrupt in the area could easily be replaced by Arab farmers. However Israeli policy as crafted by Sharon and Rafi Eitan as ministers in Netanyahu's government in the late 90's has been to sell off the Kibbutz land i.e. former Palestinian land at exhorbitant prices to be shared with the former Kibbutzers to developers who will build houses for Jewish immigrants.Jan Abu Shakrah gives a fascinating overview of the situation of the Arab Jews that came to Israel following that country's creation. In Iraq, she writes, there was no official discrimination but many Jews faced employment discrimination and were subjected to propaganda urging them to immigrate by Israel. In 1951, to try to stop the drain on the economy caused by the flight of Iraqi Jews, the government froze all assets of those leaving, giving them two months to return, with the exception of the elderly and students. The Jewish elite of Iraq, about 5,000 stayed on probably until the nationalist upheavals and the rise of Ba'athism and continued to exercise influence, administiring the \\"abandoned\\" Jewish property. In 1950 and 51, the Mossad launched a terrorist campaign in Iraq to try to make Iraqi Jews leave. Called Operation \\"Ali Baba\\" it was written about by one of its participants, an Iraqi Jew named Naeim Giladi who established a panel to seek reparations for abandoned Jewish property, holding Israeli officials and the Iraqi officials that they colluded with and bribed accountable, along with the Western governments. She notes that it is curious that no pother is made about Jewish property in Yemen. The airlift of Jews out of there was apparently made with the agreement of that government. She also interestingly says that the Allon affair or \\"the mishap\\" as Israelis like to call it where Israel sent agents to bomb American and British cultural centers in Egypt in the Summer of 1954. with the apparent attempt to disrupt relations between Egypt and the West but Abu Shakrah claims also that it was designed to terrorize Egyptian Jews into coming to Israel."},{"Title":"Palestinian Refugees: The Right of Return (Pluto Middle Eastern Studies,)","review":"Why is it that of the 50 million refugees in the last 50 years only the Palestinians are still 'refugees' with special rights that mean they will be considered refugees forever. Why are the Jews of Israel no longer 'refugees' or the Sikhs who fled Pakistan or the Germans from East Prussia. Why? Why are only Palestinians accorded special rights and status. Why have only the Palestinians not been absorbed? It is an interesting question. If the Germans fleeing the red army had been put in camps in 1945 and left there for 60 years we can assume they would have turned out like the Palestinian refugee problem, and likewise for the Jewish refugees from europe or the Sikhs in Punjab.Thus book pretends that the Bible caused the Palestinian refugee problem, an especially specious and racist argument. Likewise the author should have said the Koran caused the refugee problem because it orders the takeover of the world, but that would be rediculous and foolish as claiming the Bible is a blueprint for ethnic cleansing. So what pretends to be a edited collection of arguments about the 'rigth of return' which is a myth of international law, is really a racist text. Where is the right of return for the people of Kaliningrad(Konigsburg)? Interesting question. Will there be a 'right of return' for the Copts or the Armenians or the SIkhs?No. So why only the Palestinians?Seth J.

Ms Claiborne's writing style was witty, and the interactions between Melisande and the goalkeeper Mr. Bell was delightful. The part about the &quot;She-Devil of Mooresby Hall&quot; was a hoot, and Mr. Bell's reaction to the She-Devil's offer of marriage was one terrific piece of writing. After reading only a few pages of the book I was well and truly &quot;hooked&quot;, so I settled in for a long night of reading.Unfortunately, my enthusiasm for the book began to fade as the character of William Tiger Taggart took shape. After a few chapters I started getting irritated with this Will person, and after a few more I really started to dislike him. I found him conniving and underhanded, and mercenary to an extreme. About halfway through the book William's financial predicament is explained and Ms Claybourne starts to accentuate Will's more redeeming qualities, but unfortunately I never got over my initial dislike of Will.I also found that there were a lot of loose ends in the book and a lot of actions that were not completely explained. I can't go into too much detail without giving away the story, but I never really understood why Will left Scotland or why he came back. Another compliant I have about the book was the abrupt ending. It took 295 pages of text to develop the problems, conflicts and misunderstandings between the characters, and FOUR pages to resolve everything. Frankly I felt a little cheated. The Epilogue was also painfully brief (a little over a page) and uninformative. I would have like to know if the distillery succeeded, did Wildcat go back to America, did the prison reform experiment work, was Melisande brother able to manage the estate on his own, did Sister Maggie ever visit again, did the people of Devonshire miss the She-Devil?"},{"Title":"Tiger by the Tail","review":"William Taggert was on his way home from the colonies when he broke the nose of the mayor's son and landed in gaol.

Though she plans to annul the marriage, Will and the rest of her family have other ideas. They think he's just what she needs! I thought both the families as well as Will's friend W.C. were very good supporting characters who enhanced the relationship between Mel and Will.

Her brother and grandfather both wanted Wil to stay marry to her and tame her to stopping bossing every one around. It was quite touching and funny at the same time to see Mel pretending to be blind (after she recovered) in order to stay with Wil. The only minor complaint I have is that the hero and heroine did not discuss how they feel about each other at all even after they freely acted as husband and wife. He kept thinking she looked down at hims and wanted to leave; and she kept thinking he was not attracted to her and wanted her to leave.

Although intended for a popular audience, the detailed contributions of the expert editorial staff have produced a volume that is both educational and entertaining. Structured using a \\"Culture Area\\" model, the book is divided into chapters that describe the lifeways of similar societies living in similar environments.What makes this book distinctive from other, more authoritive, texts is its rich supply of full color maps and illustrations, many of which document rarely seen events and artifacts. Others clearly illustrate such complex processes as a seasonal round in the Great Basin, the construction of a canoe in the Subarctic, and the assembly of a tipi in the Plains. In addition, the text of each chapter contains various _fictional_ first-person narritives describing details of daily life in these societies. While the usefulness, accuracy, and appropriateness of these \\"accounts\\" are questioned by some, in most cases, I've found that they help readers and students to imagine, sympathize, understand, and relate with these traditional lifeways. As such, they add more than they detract from the educational value of this text. However, there are some obvious factual errors which most be guarded against, whose presence may be evidence of the potentially dated nature of this volume, originally from 1978. Similarly, any new developments and discoveries of the last twenty-five years are not represented. Further, from the perspective of this Archaeologist, discussion of the prehistoric and developmental aspects of these societies is incomplete.Yet, despite these failings, the interest and enthusiasm this book instills about Native American cultures and how they lived, and its rich factual content, ensures that America's Fascinating Indian Heritage will remain a widely-used introductory text for this subject."},{"Title":"America's Fascinating Indian Heritage: The First Americans: Their Customs, Art, History and How They Lived","review":"Highly informative.

It covers from 12,000 years when Indians (Asians) and Eskimos came over to North America and settled and adapted to the new world by farming and hunting. The book covers North America to the present with a good historical background on their way of life, religion, and even political organization. Their respect from plants, animals to the environment leaves a paradise for us to enjoy, learn and appreciate. The difference between East and West, North and South, hot and cold, dry and humid, mountain and plain, made the tribes unique. They lived with stone tools and bow and arrows for thousands of years.Their life was impacted with the arrival of Columbus. Each chapter gives a description on such impact. They were the \\"savages\\" needed to be civilized and Christianized especially in 19th Century with a lot of confrontation and resistance. On page 389, it said that Russian trappers raped, murdered and enslaved native peoples. In a few years, the Alents, a people closely related to Eskimos, were almost exterminated. The more numerous Eskimos were also cruelly oppressed by the trappers. As they did not have the anti-body against European diseases, they died out at an alarming rate.The chapter\\"Renaissance of an Ancient People\\" gives hope to a bright future. Impressive are the Confederacy and the Great Peace of the Iroquois. The Seeing Indian History chapter listed museums, archeological sites and attractions throughout USA and Canada. This is the living history of America."},{"Title":"America's Fascinating Indian Heritage: The First Americans: Their Customs, Art, History and How They Lived","review":"Could not ask for a better intro to the subject, had been wanting one for quite a while.

It's a corky, cute little tale, about a butterfly who thinks her beloved mouse friend has been eaten by a fish. Out of this comes a story that follows the same format as \\"There was an old lady who swallowed a Fly.\\" This happened, then this happened, then this, etc. It's a zany little book, especially at the end. It has a happy ending. There are 26 actual pages, not counting the cover page and dedication page. There are 5 pages of full color illustrations included in the 26 pages. The illustrations are bright and lively. It's probably 1st grade level, maybe second. Young children who hear the book several times will be telling this story, I'm sure.

(Oooh, look at these complex formulas, Tipler MUST be on to something here!) There are absurdities abound. I do not know how the Times and other respectable book reviewers came to give this book such a high rating - no sane person who reads this book could come out with such glowing praise for stupidity.

There are two reasons for this: (1)The science in the fictitious work will be more realistic and better reasoned and (2) the novel will be much more enjoyable.It is amazing that a man theoretically as bright as Tipler can be capable of such immense self delusion and intellectual density. Virtually every significant statement he makes in the book is based upon numerous unproven and unsupported assumptions. His resulting conclusions are the purest of fantasy, bearing less resemblance to reality than Burrough's Pellucidar.I could cite an example of Tipler's absurdities from any page of the book, but I'll choose one from a random page-how about page number 57? &quot;...rather than let the earth be vaporized seven billion years from now, our descendants would have long before taken the entire planet apart...In the very long run, first the entire solar system, then the entire universe of matter will be taken apart and converted into habitat for the expanding biosphere.&quot; Really?

He patently ignores any questions on the nature of consciousness. An emulation of a person is still not the same person. Were I \\"resurrected\\" according to Tipler's theory, the \\"me\\" that is inside me now, looking through my eyes, would not be the same future \\"me\\" looking through the replicant's eyes. In which case, I could not care less if a future me is resurrected, if the consciousness I am now will not be resurrected along with my \\"information.\\"Tipler is obviously emotional in his arguments - his emotionalism seeps through on many occasions with his references to Hitler and the Nazis (read his dedication as to why this upsets him).Here is a man who has spent so much time in the halls of physics that he has become yet another stereotypical arrogant scientist. Tipler refutes any idea of an immortal soul because \\"science says so,\\" and yet so obviously wants there to be God and immortality that he's stretched the boundaries of mathetical reason to concoct one.This book is just one great example of the problem with science: You can use mathematics and logic to justify anything, but just because you can logically \\"prove\\" something doesn't make it so. Conversely, just because something cannot be proved through mathematics and logic doesn't mean it is NOT so.Thus, the entire foundation of Tipler's argument is built on wet sand. Just because science cannot prove the existence of a God doesn't mean God does not exist. Conversely, Tipler's \\"proof\\" that an Omega Point God will exist doesn't mean it will definitely happen.Tipler's desperation to merge science and religion clouds his thinking.The ultimate irony is this: Were Tipler to simply shut up his overly-rational mind and simply do some meditating, he'd find the God he so desperately seeks."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"If Tipler's magnum opus wasn't so long and jam-packed with incredibly detailed (although somewhat fantastic) interpretations of physical theory, you could swear he was just another physicist trying to cash in on the general public's vague understanding of science.(i.e. if you use a lot of fancy scientific terms and include a thick appendix at the end with equations that would remain incomprehensible to people without four Ph.D's, then you can get a majority of people thinking &quot;Yea! That sounds about right!&quot;) Combine this with most people's need to reconcile their religious fantasies with real discoveries about the universe and you have the makings of a best-seller/gold-mine!Something tells me though, that Dr. Tipler wouldn't spend so much time writing this huge book if he didn't half-way believe what he was preaching. There is so much in this book that makes for interesting (and fun) speculation -- exploring the universe with microscopic space probes, emulating personalities on supercomputers -- a lot of which has a good chance of happening in the not-so-very-distant future. As a good introduction to all kinds of ideas which sound like science fiction, but are really possible, this is a great book!However, if you're only looking for the real answer on immortality...you can save yourself a lot of time by considering only two of the arguments (the &quot;final&quot; arguments on which the whole theory rests): Tipler's assertion that the universe will collapse (&quot;the big crunch&quot;) into the Omega Point, and that life will be possible up until that point is reached. First, the most recent (and most accurate) measurements of the geometry of the universe seem to indicate that the universe will expand forever (i.e. will never collapse to a point). Second, even if the universe did collapse, life would absolutely not survive anywhere near the final point. The state of the building blocks of life (atoms) in whatever form life would come in (carbon- based, silicon-based, whatever-based...) would be torn apart in the final &quot;big crunch&quot;. No building blocks= No organization= No life. Even if THAT wasn't bad enough, consider the all-powerful supercomputer at the end of time that will supposedly resurrect us. Even the smallest, most compact supercomputer takes up space...yet even the Omega Point has no room for the tiniest imaginable computer...because a point is just that -- a singularity with no area.

Sending a 100g universal constructor and computer together with Earthly genetic material at 0.9c to neighbouring star systems and beyond is appealing, but a little further in the future than anticipated in the book. What are the chances that a von Neuman probe as described will survive such a journey to a neighbouring star through the interstellar medium? Every (atomic) particle it encounters will appear as a cosmic ray, let alone small specks of dust! Something more is needed to solve this problem. I believe also that Dr Tippler's contention that there are no other living species out there is probably incorrect, and he therefore falls into the human-centric theories and assertions of old. Nevertheless, a good read, with its main contribution being speculative means of survival and proliferation in a future universe."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"Linus Pauling got lost in his own head after copping the Nobel Prize (Chemistry), and then wasted his credibility on Vitamin C advocacy (Medicine). A much lesser light, Professor Frank J.

What, exactly, is Tipler's enterprise here? Why to separate the unwary from their money. This is disgusting and cynical, and Tipler is laughing all the way to the bank. I would have hoped that his mathematics and physics colleagues would have torn his credibility and career to shreds for this travesty, but it doesn't look like it's going to happen in any meaningful way.

It is true that Tipler does go into some laughable tangents on occasion, seemingly as comic relief from some heavy cogitation; however, the mature thinker would be wise to avoid 'throwing out the baby with the washwater.' His thesis is both grand and admirable, especially since it bravely and coherently speaks about a supreme \\"why\\" as much as a cosmological \\"how.\\"The thrust of his argument is that the ultimate meaning of the universe is the evolution of information processing --including consciousness. Human consciousness is but a tiny, very early step in a process of exponentially increasing computational capacity which will engulf most of the universe over the next hundreds of trillions of years. Final gravitational collapse will compress all this evolving information into a point of ultimate knowing.In essence, God is seeking to understand God, although Tipler prefers the math-like term \\"Omega Point' to uniquely distinguish this final omniscient state of compacted information, which approaches infinite density. One of his many thought-gems is that universal 'subjective' experience, undergoing this compression toward infinite knowing, will consequentially experience itself as temporally approaching infinity (i.e. eternity), although this happens within an 'objectively' finite period.Furthermore, the \\"Resurrection\\" will not occur in the traditional sense that the reader may initially think upon hearing the term. For Tipler, that event will come about as all possible quantum states (i.e. all possibilities that ever could have been) are emulated in this ultimate information- processing state of omniscience. In effect, the \\"thoughts by God\\" (via very concrete information processing mechanisms) at that point will include a perfect and complete reproduction of you reading this review once again, and even every single possible branching of events that could possibly take place from this instant forward.This book is not for general readers, for whom it will be immensely frustrating. Many such readers may not adequately grasp the flow of his thesis, but rather will be fixated on his much less rigorous but more easily understood side arguments, which frequently have much to be desired. Overall, the long, involved explanations will soon frustrate those with insufficient scientific background, lack of patience, or intolerance for abstraction.Tipler himself is refreshingly honest in speaking of his own personal --in contrast to scientific-- doubts about many of the ideas he presents. Fortunately, he has the courage to admit a shortcoming of total understanding, which some readers may find offensive, although it shows value in substance over form. Likewise, those readers seeking scientific ammunition for a reinforcement of traditional beliefs will find it necessary to distort many of Tipler's arguments and conclusions to arrive at a concordance.It's safe to say that any grand explanation worth considering must synthesize many complex elements of human understanding within a consistant scientific framework. This book cuts new and fertile ground to that end. The Physics of Immortality is a great mental stimulant with many grand ideas to challenge and enrich scientifically-literate, open-minded seekers of ultimate meaning."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"Imagine the entire cosmos conquered by nanotech self-replicating machines?

Tipler is the best that I have encountered. His analysis is consistantly, rigorous, and depends intensively, upon mathematics,economic,and cosmological concepts formulated by such lights as computer theorist,Alan Turing; economists such as Gary Becker, and David Friedman; and Cosmologists such as Jacob Bekenstein,Bryce DeWitt,John A, Wheeler. One common thread in &quot;Immortality&quot; is that the universe is increasing in the information it holds. Also that the cosmos, despite Entropy, appears to eventuate in a capability to &quot;process&quot; -given massive amounts of time. Physicist, David Deutsch at Oxford's Quantum Cryptography Group seems to disagree and agree with Tipler's conclusions (The Fabric of Reality-Penguin Press)-Tipler's homepage has responses to Deutsch.Much of the attackers of Tipler, who I have conversed with, over the last few years seem to fall into two camps. The first are religious fundamentalists who are hostile to Tipler's Decided, non-Trinitarianism -which may be construed as an affront to profoundly, held beliefs. The second group are proud, agnostics &amp; atheists who seem enraged and Tipler's mixing of faith and physics. Both attacks seem less substantial then the arguments aginst his work.-and more importantly they seem Ad Hominum. In other words-Give me Scientic Reasons why Tipler's analysis is Erroneous -don't just tell me this is junk-tell me specifically, why this is? So far, after 5 years of looking what many other authors have to offer-Tiplers is the most logcally rigorous and scientifically based. Alternatively, one can just hang the sense of it, and jump into the Athiest camp, or do a &quot;leap of Faith&quot; and join in with the Religious Fundamentalists. For me, personally, Tipler's understandings seem the intellectually richest."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"&#8203;The theological study of eschatology examines the end of time and the ultimate future of the world. In Frank J. Tipler's The Physics of Immortality, eschatology is presented, tackled and applied to the universe and life as a whole. In his book, Tipler claims to have proven that an afterlife, God, freewill, and the resurrection of the body into Heaven indeed exist, and these mysteries can be logically proven to be true through modern science.&#8203;An intellectual jack of all trades, Frank Tipler is a mathematical physics professor and an esteemed theoretician in global general relativity. He also exhibits extensive knowledge in various subjects such as computer science, economics, particle physics, cosmology, and evolutionary biology. Interestingly enough, Tipler has also formulated a convincing argument proving the existence of God and universal bodily resurrection. Through his end of time model dubbed the Omega Point Theory, he explains how every human being who has ever lived will one day be resurrected into eternal life--and does so in a method not unlike how other scientists determine the properties of an electron.&#8203;The Omega Point Theory does not require any faith since its foundation is based on pure logic and science, and is actually an atheistic scientific approach. Theology though is based on the assumption that life is immortal through some supernatural means. Regarding other faiths, the \\"Omega Point Theory is consistent with only those features of religion which are found in all of the great world religions\\" (Tipler 16). Tipler compares the Omega Point Theory to various religions and makes comparisons to Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, tribal African religions, and more. He claims that the Omega Point essentially fits with all of them in some way, shape, or concept. For example, \\"the Blissful Realm of Japanese Buddhism\\" (Johnson 47) seems completely consistent with the Heaven predicted by the Omega Point Theory , and his theory is \\"in agreement with the universal Muslim belief on the absolute oneness of God\\" (Johnson 132 and Tipler 304). The Omega Point Theory, being more of a science, makes five basic claims about the universe, which are as follows:&#8203;1. The universe is spatially closed ( it has finite spatial size and has the topology &#8203;of a three-sphere).&#8203;2. There are no event horizons, implying the future c-boundary is a point (The &#8203;Omega Point). In other words, life never dies out.&#8203;3. Life must eventually engulf the entire universe and control it.&#8203;4. The amount of information processed between now and the final state is &#8203;infinite, so there will be an infinite number of experiences and events.&#8203;5. The amount of information stored in the universe diverges to infinity as the &#8203;final state is approached; so more and more is learned, with no repeats in &#8203;information (Omega Point Institute).&#8203;As critiqued by Sandberg, \\"...the Omega Point is the logical conclusion of our striving towards higher levels, regardless of its nature. It is more of an engineering problem than a philosophical question.\\" Obviously, Tipler approaches this topic in very technical terms and uses an abundance of mathematical and computer related vocabulary. In order to avoid a complicated regurgitation of all the theorems and laws of physics, as well as diverging from the larger theological question, I will state that Tipler has sufficient supplied ample information to support the five points of his version of the Omega Point Theory. The Omega Point Theory is not entirely his own; Tipler seems to have based many of his ideas off of the French Jesuit Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's work--including the 5 basic universal claims (Teilhard). However, the five points are not replicates of Teilhard's points. Tipler has modified the Omega Point concept into his own logic-oriented theory, and envisions an event in the very distant future called \\"The Big Crunch\\" (66-124). The Big Crunch is a hypothesis that the universe will collapse (or crunch) upon itself after its expansion eventually reverses--like an inverse to the Big Bang Theory. This hypothesis though now has been rejected by scientists because of observations of the universe expanding at an accelerated rate--not a decelerating rate as was originally assumed from gravitational forces; Tipler now stands corrected from more modern information. He has amended some of his views regarding the Big Crunch, yet has construed an alternative method to \\"crunch\\" the universe upon which the end results keep his original concepts intact.&#8203;Anyways, \\"The Omega Point\\" refers to the final state of the universe. It is to the future what the Big Bang is to the past: a termination point on the time continuum. It comes in the context of quantum cosmology with wave functions, boundary conditions, and such. Tipler gives multiple [what he presents as] experimental tests for his theory in his book (139-153), although the definitive confirmation of his experiments will never be experienced by any currently living human. In fact, the confirmations may or may not even come in the next one-hundred billion years.&#8203;&#8203;To apply the terminology, the universal wave function acts in a manner like the Holy Spirit because both are the fundamental entities from which physics itself is assumed to follow. Furthermore, there are aspects of Tipler's theory that use the Turing Test passing method (explained later) that correspond to angels (157). These angels, as described by Tipler, exist as super intelligent computational systems that are of the same essence of God, yet are only components of God. Essentially, the Omega Point Theory conjectures the evolution of super-minds before the final ultimate catastrophe destroys the whole universe in a giant black hole--which could considered the Omega Point [in time]. His theory also exonerates the \\"God of moral responsibility for evil\\" (264), by basically arguing that sin is finite and a happy afterlife will be infinite. This therefore logically and literally meaning that there will be an infinite amount of good over what evils we have experienced in the end. Another way to think of it, \\"God judged it better to bring good out of evil than not to permit any evil to exist\\" (Tipler 265), as said by Augustine in Enchiridion, who nicely summarized the Omega Point theodicy in that sentence.&#8203;The Omega Point not only will resurrect us but also will love us, and is where an interesting fact arises. The main reason why Tipler compares the Omega Point with God derives from a technicality in a biblical translation. Tipler teases out the nuances from Exodus 3:14, and claims that God is \\"primarily a future being\\" (4). In this section of the Bible, God speaks to Moses and God's name has been translated as \\"I AM THAT I AM.\\" Tipler points out what even esteemed theologians such as Ernst Bloch and Hans Kung have commented on; the Hebrew word Ehyeh is the future tense of Haya which means \\"to be.\\" Ergo, the biblical translation should go something along the lines of \\"I WILL BE WHAT I WILL BE.\\" The essential Christian message contains much eschatology, and some theologians have understood that \\"Jesus proclaimed the rule of God as a reality belonging to the future\\" (Tipler 4). However, Tipler continues to say that \\"This is the coming Kingdom... God does not yet exist... God's being is still in the process of coming to be\\" (4). This would imply that God is a future being and, being ultimate, God would be the ultimate future. This idea fits very snug in the Omega Point Theory.&#8203; This is exactly why early on in the book, Tipler explained why one must study the future evolution of the universe instead of only looking at the history and the present state of the universe. Because there is so much scientific evidence showing that the universe will continue to exist for at least another 100 billion years, it is logical to say that almost all of space and time lies in the future. Hence, by ignoring what will come, \\"science ignores most of reality\\" (2). Tipler makes a convincing expostulation by saying that most scientific knowledge and assumptions are based on the past (i.e. archeology, astronomy, etc..), so science should consider taking a gander at how the future will come about as well.&#8203; So how will the future come about, and how is any of this nonsense possible? Tipler [for a large portion of the book] temporarily strays from the theological aspects of his argument to develop a foundation for some technical background that will be helpful to the reader in various instances. Initially, he discusses the probability of space travel. Why would we want to leave Earth? Because the planet Earth is doomed, and will be wiped from the face of the universe within approximately 1.5 billions years when the sun expands. Although this may be an astronomically large number, it is relativity small compared to reality as a whole and the time for life to ensure its ultimate survival.&#8203; One major challenge in outer space is the large distance between Earth and other stars; the nearest one, other than the sun, being Proxima Centauri at 4.2 light years away (Dolan). This would mean that it would take a space craft--or as Tipler calls Von Neumann probes--roughly 4.2 years to get to Proxima Centauri if it were traveling at the speed of light (the value estimated at 300,000,000 meters per second). If the Von Neumann probe were not traveling at this speed, it would take much longer to reach its destination, proportional to its speed slower to the speed of light. Unfortunately, adequate propulsion technology is not the only technology that is deficient; advanced computers that have human-like judgment capabilities would also be required for a successful trans-galaxy mission.&#8203;According to scientific evidence and tests, the human brain has the ability to code 1015 bits of information, which is assuming that each neuron connection stores one bit. Another fascinating discovery is that the human brain can process information at a rate of 10 teraflops per second (Bell). When Tipler was writing the book in 1994, computers were on the brink of reaching both of these performance points; now in 2007, both of these figures have been attained and surmounted. Such technology is critical to space travel because it would be a vital step in being able to create artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is probably required for space travel because [at such great distances] remote communication would heavily lag in response time and would be critical in many situations. Just think, it would take years for signals traveling at the speed of light to pass between Earth and the Von Neumann probe, and such a slow response time would cause jeopardizing results. The only sure-fire solution would be to embrace artificial intelligence. Tipler envisions artificial intelligence exceeding human intelligence within 50 years (20), and also negates the visions of conflict between humans and machines as portrayed in movies like the Matrix and I, Robot. By reminding the reader of an economical concept called comparative advantage, it would only make sense for mankind and intelligent machines to co-exist. Nevertheless, remote piloting of the probe would not make for a viable option.&#8203;Some have considered using a human pilot, but unfortunately even more concerns arise on the areas of sustenance, longevity, and much much more. The only practical and possible solution would be to utilize computers that are advanced enough to have human-like judgment. Because a self operating machine would require nothing other than energy provided by the sun, costs regarding size and propulsion are immediately diminished immensely. Nanocomputers have been in development for a number of years and are computers that use every atom to represent a \\"bit\\" and store information (Bell). This means that supercomputers could be shrunk to no larger than one-hundred grams in mass. Tipler goes on to explain how such a small object can be accelerated to near light speeds via a high powered laser beam and solar sails. In summary, it would likely take only less than a decade to get such a probe to other stars. So if such a space craft were created (which is now possible, with the exception of artificial intelligence), it would be able to successfully transport human cells and begin colonization of other solar systems. Humans would be able to grow and develop in the foreign regions of space through a process similar to cloning. After a space station has been created, humans could continue to reproduce naturally. Materials for construction will not have to be transported, since basic elements are present throughout the universe. Because of the advanced nature of the computer's artificial intelligence, overseeing a successful operation should pose no problem. Keep in mind that Tipler has this process blue-printed out (55-66), where this summation does not.&#8203;Although it may sound totally far fetched, universal colonization is physically possible (Tipler 55-66). According to Tipler, his research, and other scientists, the visible universe has around 10^80 particles in it, hence it has a finite size. In addition, humans can only be in a finite number of physical states. Due to the finiteness, all the possible states of reality can be calculated by advanced mathematical algorithms and be virtually recreated.&#8203;This is where the Turing concept comes back into play. To make the distinction, the Turing test is a method in determining if a computer is able to \\"think\\" like a human and therefore be able to make human-like judgments. This test would analyze if artificial intelligence is up to par for what would be needed for universal colonization. Now a Turing machine is an imaginary device that has \\"an infinite one-dimensional tape divided into cells... and stretches infinitely far containing either \`0' or \`1'. The machine has a read-write head, which at any time scanning a single cell on the tape. This head can move left and right along the tape to scan successive cells. They are simple abstract computational devices intended to help investigate the extent and limitations of what can be computed\\" (Barker-Plummer). The main point Tipler eventually makes with Turing machines is that they can emulate any other machine, including itself based on mathematics and algorithmic patterns. They can calculate anything, much like a modern computer does based on the bits of 1's and 0's. Through implementation, they Turing machine encompasses all other machines at some level of implementation. Comparing the infinite capabilities of the Turing machine and the finite number of states of the universe, it is logical to say that the entire universe can be calculated and virtually recreated. Just a hint, Tipler's idea of the afterlife incorporates this concept.&#8203;Tipler identifies the state of infinite information capacity with God--the Omega Point. The implication of this theory for present day humans is that this ultimate cosmic computer will actually be able to resurrect everyone who has ever lived, by recreating all possible quantum brain states within a master simulation. This would manifest as a simulated reality, except without the necessity for physical bodies in \\"reality\\". The Omega Point therefore represents an afterlife with an infinite duration, and could take any possible form due to its virtual nature. However, this reality is not what was conceptualized in the Matrix movie, with a separate reality and illusion world. The virtual world would be real life, and there would be no \\"outside\\" or \\"bigger picture.\\" The afterlife is considered more virtual in the sense that everything will be perfectly organized.&#8203;The first step, according to Tipler, to achieving eternal life is for life and the biosphere to expand to the size of the universe itself. Clearly this Omega Point Theory does not rest on a supernatural deity, but rather on a being or state that will actually exist far into the future. Immortality, as Tipler defines it, is when information processing never ends. Minds would then continually persist, rejoicing in their own virtual reality. The afterlife would be not unlike an infinitely long computer program, and is also addressed in more common terminology. Heaven is the infinitely happy afterlife that would last forever. Hell, on the other hand, belongs to evil things and the Omega Point would make it so that such things will simply cease to exist. Hell is not viewed as a fiery burning pit, but rather a punishment of non-existence. Purgatory is a transitional state of fixing or changing evil things into good ones, as is normally viewed by many Christians (Tipler 241-269).&#8203;My analysis of Tipler's work is not nearly as convincing, simply because Tipler provides so much more constructive evidence to reinforce his concepts. But the physics behind the resurrection of the dead to eternal life is quite different than other proposed methods. Tipler's afterlife is rather a continuation of the entire universe for eternity, and not rising into some abstract spiritual plane. He argues that with the emulation of all the possibilities of the universe, a later emulation of the original person would be created as a result and therefore be the same person.&#8203;Much of Tipler's book is dedicated towards mathematical and logical proofs, as well as stories and examples to aide the reader in the same direction as the logic behind the theories. This book was intended to be understood by anyone with a high school education and some background knowledge--but to fully understand the quantum physics behind the Omega Point is beyond me. Besides being fascinating in its bold proclamations, this is--in fact--a very large book filled with complex ideas and sophisticated thinking. Tipler displays an impressive breadth of knowledge and guides the reader through a thrilling amusement park ride-esque thinking process. Unfortunately, many may overlook some of Tipler's ideas because a reader with simple curiosity to what he has to say will likely never decipher the Appendix for Scientists partition--which I may comment is really designed for only individuals with extensive scientific knowledge. This seems to be where the juiciest information is located and explains how the Omega Point hypothesis actually works (Tipler 395-508); unfortunately I'm not at a level to decipher what Tipler has to say. However, one opinion that Tipler made clear was that theology must become a branch of physics in order to survive because they ask essentially the same questions and seek the same answers.&#8203;Varadaraja Raman suggests that \\"before we rush to make special arrangements for our caskets on this basis, let us note that by 'resurrection' the author means simulation of ourselves\\" as Tipler said in his book \\"in the computer minds of the far future\\" (227). Immortality in Tipler's argument seems to be possible, yet it is just not what people traditionally think of personal immortality in Heaven. The author declares himself to be a an atheist and confesses that he \\"does not yet believe in the Omega Point\\" (305), although he assures the orthodox religions that he is \\"eager to prove that 20th-century science is confirming Judeo-Christian visions of the divine.\\" Regardless of Tipler's purpose behind the book, everyone can agree that both good and bad theological concepts has been rejected, whether or not they is true. After reviewing Tipler's theories, both Macmillan and Sandberg are still highly skeptical with the entire Omega Point Theory, and the results look rather bleak as to how many individuals are wholly convinced. So has Tipler finally found an ultimate answer to the ultimate mystery? Perhaps life, as a whole, should wait and see what unfolds in the ensuing 100-billion years.Works CitedBarker-Plummer, David. \\"Turing Machines.\\"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

Then use this information to create living cells of these life forms in the star systems.* A 100-gram payload would hold all DNA coding for 10,000 individuals, and could reach 90% light speed in 1.5 months, using a moon-based 10-gigawatt laser to push the craft.* With multiple probes at 90% light speed and Relativistic time dilation, it would take 600,000 years to colonize the entire Milky Way Galaxy, which is 100,000 light years across.* The nearest Virgo Cluster of large galaxies is about 60 million light years away, and could be highly colonized by life from biosphere probes in about 70 million years.* All life forms frequently replace all atoms in their bodies as life forms develop. The substance of human beings is thus not preserved, only the patterns. So future life will extract the relevant information from radiated background noise.* Huge clusters of future intelligent life, among all known galaxies, will use game theory to conspire toward universal defeat of death by life. Part of this cooperative conspiracy will be to assemble a network of a Godly \\"Omega Point.\\"* The Omega Point will find a way to overcome the accelerated expansion of the universe [today, believed caused by dark energy's pull], and will carry out the reviving of previously dead intelligent life forms.* The life-born, Godly \\"Omega Point\\" will thus create such perfectly accurate simulations of these past lives, that those past lives will in fact be resurrected.* The Omega Point will want to do this because of its commitment to knowledge and triumph of life over death.* The dead will be resurrected when the computer capacity of the universe is so large that the amount of capacity required to store all possible human simulations is an insignificant fraction of the entire capacity.* You're dead and completely unaware until the Omega Point resurrects you. But you will awaken as if no subjective time passed, even after trillions of years.* The Omega Point will not resurrect individuals it considers irretrievably evil, but will guide flawed humans toward acceptable levels of good via long Purgatory processes.* \\"Hell\\" will be non-resurrection and true, non-aware death. \\"Purgatory\\" will be resurrection and a process of purification.Whether we find Dr. Tipler's scientific analyses and resultant speculations likely or preposterous, desirable or undesirable, he at least stimulates thinking about grand-scale potentialities that many of us might not otherwise imagine, and he lays some scientific bases for such speculations. At best, his hypotheses might be decent science; at worst, at least provocative science fiction!"},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"Upon seeing this book, I knew I had to read it. The premise itself was enough to ensure the purchase. However, once I started on my journey from cover to cover, I soon became perplexed at some of the intricacies of modern physics. Tippler states in the beginning of the book that anyone who has had a high school education will be able to make it through this book. Well, I was still in the process of receiving a high school education when I started reading this book, but I still feel that the layperson would be unable to comprehend some of the more difficult subject matter (antimatter, nanotechnology, et cetera). The original idea behind the book was enough to keep me going for 150 pages, but after that, the bottom fell out of the whole thing. To this day there are parts I cannot make heads or tails of. This is NOT a book for a layperson, but because of the controversial subject matter, I do recommended it to anyone who has had a couple of college-level physics courses or aced an AP Physics class in high school. Otherwise, don't make the mistake I did in taking Tippler's word"},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"As science ficiton, this book fascinates; as speculation it excels; as science it compasses what Science should have compassed to begin with - the domain of all Knowledge, not being cornered by Religious bifurcation. What is troublesome is the potential (which Tipler flirts with) of having Everything Ironed Out, of revealing the universe is just a &quot;chessboard&quot; to quote another reviewer. Tipler doesn't entirely ameliorate this fear. Methinks he is more calling for further speculation, rather than displaying his excogitation of Reason's Triumph. Also, there is a particularly acute poetic horror in the notion that something is Lost Forever....and this book appeals to the fundament of compassionate desire to defy this; namely, Resurrection. Resurrection of humanity...nay....resurrection of Everything. Of worms. Of icicles and snowflakes. Of fancies. If there is no poetic dimension, no ultimate Unknown, and no omni-compassion...then Tipler's theories are repugnant. If such can be accomodated - and accomodating human religiosity explains much of his book - then his book is an ethical peak as well as a fantastical one.I highly recommend this book, with the caveat that the physics equations (all very pretty, but practically meaningless to most readers) exist in the same realm of Faith as the works of Hawkins. I'm not too worried about their holistic veracity...this book is more of an inspiration about life's potential, than concreted physics."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"Reading TPOI allows the reader to experience a tremendous scientific achievement. Dr. Tipler's mastery of three separate branches of physics/mathematics (global general relativity, quantum mechanics and computer complexity theory) is truly impressive, and he winds various arguments from these disciplines together in a completely integrated tapestry.The theory of TPOI is a scientifc theory, and needs to be evalulated as such. I am hoping that Dr. Tipler is at work on an updated edition, which would summarize the status of experimental confirmation of the theory. Rather than the top quark and Higgs boson results, most people have focused on the results of the High Z surveys of Type Ia supernovae. Most orthodox cosmologists would express the opinion that these surveys seem to imply a very large \\"cosmological constant\\" that will result a a \\"runaway universe,\\" where the galaxies will accelerate away from each other at faster and faster rates. The Omega Point Theory requires the universe to recollapse in a \\"Big Crunch\\" - the opposite of the Big Bang. There is no consensus, however, that the Type Ia suveys really reveal this. As Dr. Tipler explained in both TPOI and \\"The Cosmological Anthropic Principle,\\" a non-zero cosmological constant of the magnitude implied by the observations is totally inconsistent with the standard model of particle physics. Instead, Dr. Tipler and other theorists favor a theory of \\"quintessence,\\" which is essentially a theory of how the energy of empty space can change over time. When you put that together with all of the other arguments for the Omega Point theory, such as avoiding violations of unitarity, the theory is still as compelling as when TPOI was first published."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"This book is quite good... but only for a Physicist I'm afraid. If you're looking for a \\"proof\\" of God, you won't find it in this book unless you're highly into Einstein's Physics. You have to realize that the author has a different paradigm than a majority of humanity. To a cosmologist, this is an intriguing and plausible hypothesis. To the average reader, it's undecypherable. To a clergyman, it's blasphemy. That being said, the book is not entirely wasted on the average reader. Tipler's ideas on embracing AI as a natural evolutionary development rather than fearing AI's dominance are rather intriguing to say the least.

While decrying the dehumanising deterministic mechanics of modern science, Tipler centers his views on its central error: that nothing not subject to empirical investigation and describable by physical law, can therefore exist. This causes him to pooh-pooh revelation (though milking theory derived from the contemplation of it for all it's worth, at any point where it supports his postulations), and dismiss the miraculous as &quot;a priori&quot; impossible.My own view: science and faith should not be dogmas that eliminate any phenomena outside of their own pervue. &quot;Faith&quot; is an attitude by which you access knowledge not empirically discoverable; science, a discipline for observation of and experimentation with the (ultimately) tangible, observable universe. (Miracles being reversals of physical law, about which science that does not directly witness one, can say nothing.)Where Tipler, albeit accidentally, hews to this regime, he produces worthwhile results:*The &quot;Kingdom (rule) of God&quot; over material, temporal reality is primarily eschatological--yet future.*Beyond the end of time, God and the physical world will be unified--&quot;that God may BE all (everything), IN all (every one)&quot;--making the &quot;Omega&quot; phase of God a legitimate subject for empirical investigation (via extrapolation, et al.)*Resurrection, not inherent personal immortal consciousness, is the mechanism of life after death.*The question of whether one is to be ressurrected is independent of the question whether eternal life will be granted as a result.*A &quot;perfect emulation&quot; (Heisenberg aside) of an organic or other universal Turing machine is, by definition of physical law, identical with the being it emulates.I might add: Tipler's dismissal of revelation, specifically Christianity, includes a rejection of Christ's harsh view of &quot;eternal punishment&quot;(i.e. eternal conscious torment in Hellfire). Problem being that the NT &amp; OT don't teach this! &quot;Eternal Punishment&quot; is grammatically and conceptually distinct from eternal &quot;punish-ING&quot;. The Scriptures merely speak of a &quot;day which shall burn as an oven...wherin all the proud... and they that do wickedly shall be BURNED UP (COMBUSTION)&quot;-Malachi 4-&quot;the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved..the earth and the works therein shall be burned up&quot;-II Peter 3-&quot;Whosoever was not found written in the book of life (password into higher level of implementation) was cast into the lake of fire...which is the SECOND DEATH (KILLED again, not tortured forever)&quot;-Rev. 20 All of this seems to naturally describe the intense heat at the final singularity--however it occurs.My view of Omega: immediate universal entropic collapse is being prevented by the universal wave function until &quot;the Kingdom&quot; is established: only then can the collapse be allowed to proceed. A collapse that will reclaim and permanently contain energies lost to entropy in the new cosmos genrated as a result of the collapse, and destroy any beings whose systems are too corrupted to be safely &quot;uploaded&quot; into the eternal existence of the permanent temporal-eternal unity of the New Creation.Michael S.

For that alone he is to be commended.No longer can scientists say that there is no scientific proof for God. Having said that, a believer will have to go a long way to stretch his traditional concept of theology to fit the Tipler model. He has invented a god only an atheist could love. The model is based on certain assumptions which Tipler embraces with glee but which are not necessarily true. The whole theory rests on the veracity of the assumptions, since the arguments proceeding from them are presented with mathematical precision. But at least you can point to it and say, here is one possible scientific scenario for the existence of God.The book is a mind bender, and barely qualifies as a layman's science book, even ignoring the Appendix for Scientists.

He's indefatigable in his literal quest for an endgame scenario in which he can believe.Still and all, Tipler is wonderfully bold in his theory.

Considered a brilliant modern astro-physicist Tipler offers some radical ideas such as the universal constructors using human DNA to build and seed the universe with human beings to form a universal consciousness that will become God."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"Tippler imagines a universe of ever-increasing computational ability as the universe approaches what he regards as its inevitable collapse or \\"big crunch\\" that is associated with the \\"Omega Point\\". Along with this increasingly rapid computation comes the ability to simulate every being who has ever existed and every possible variation of that being's life. This Omega Point era seems to Tippler to be something like a wonderful afterlife for those whose existences are simulated. Other interesting questions come to mind, such as if I were to die in my sleep, only to be reborn complete with my own memories the following morning, would I really be able to tell the difference? Would those beings who correspond to me in Tippler's Omega Point world be, therefore, true facets of myself?I think that this book should be regarded as a work of metaphysics rather than physics. Of course, today's metaphysics may evolve into tomorrow's physics--but let's not expect that to come to pass regarding Tippler's notions anytime soon! Perhaps metaphysics should be regarded as an envelope that defines the boundary between science and unbridled speculation--and that Tippler might have made that metaphysical envelope just a little too thick and meaty to be taken completely seriously! Still, I did enjoy reading this book and did glean a few new ideas in reading it.Tippler's approach brings to mind Bertrand Russell's observations about the philosophy of Leibniz (as discussed in Russell's wonderfulA History of Western Philosophy), in that Leibniz tried to imagine the world within the context of the most sophisticated technology of his day--that of mechanical clocks. Leibniz evidently imagined that all of the actions of both animate and inanimate entities were not traceable to cause and effect, but to something like internal clocks that the creator had synchronized to give the appearance of cause and effect! Certainly, this is understandable within the context of a completely deterministic universe 18th century universe. Today, however, such a model of the universe seems rather absurd, and does not provide useful insights that translate into engineering and technological innovations such as those provided by modern quantum physics, chemistry, and molecular biology. Perhaps the future will eventually reveal Tippler's eschatology, based on the technological paradigm of our day (the solid state electronics-based digital computer) to be as fanciful as Leibniz's comically deterministic universe based on the technological paradigm of his day (the mechanical clock). It is possible, however, that some (but not all) of Tippler's ideas (since such a complex mesh of lucky guesses would seem to be highly unlikely) might eventually be seen to have some merit."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"I read this book while I was in university in the late 1990's early 2000's. It's ideas made sense qualitatively and quantitatively. Many of the reviews on here were made prior to the discovery of Dark Flow, which may account for the questions of the speeding up of our Universe in a \\"closed\\" system. All matter/energy may not be saved in the end, but a good portion of it may seep into parallel universes, or Branes, via holes in the fabric of space and time. This energy could shoot into some other reality in essence feeding it. These areas of confluence may also be points which stay in this one universe yet eventually become so dense that they eject the energy once a critical mass is attained.For example, many galaxies have been shown to coalesce and swirl towards a point coined the Great Attractor:\\"The Dark Flow was determined to be flowing in the direction of the Centaurus and Hydra constellations.[5] This corresponds with the direction of the Great Attractor, which was a previous gravitational mystery originally discovered in 1973. However, the source of the Great Attractor's attraction was thought to originate from a massive cluster of galaxies called the Norma cluster, situated merely between 150-250 million light-years away. This may reveal that the source of that attraction might lie even further away, and which the Great Attractor itself is heading towards.In a study from March 2010, Kashlinsky extended his work from 2008, by using the 5-year WMAP results rather than the 3-year results, and doubling the number of galaxy clusters observed from 700. The team also sorted the cluster catalog into four \\"slices\\" representing different distance ranges. They then examined the preferred flow direction for the clusters within each slice. While the size and exact position of this direction display some variation, the overall trends among the slices exhibit remarkable agreement.[5]The team has so far catalogued the effect as far out as 2.5 billion light-years, and hope to expand their catalog out further still to twice the current distance.\\" -- WikipediaThe increased acceleration of the galaxies may be ascribed to this anomaly. As Super Massive Black Holes lie at the center of nearly every galaxy, it is quite possible that there are even larger \\"Black Holes\\" or even one gigantic \\"Universal Black Hole\\" which could be the Alpha/Omega Point postulated by Tipler. It has been proposed that our universe may even reside in one of these Universally Massive Wells, as I call it. His chapters on how sentience originally in human form may become something more synthetic and different with the passing of time and advancing of technology, being our realities best bet to be perpetuated/reincarnated in a sort of self-contained Cosmic Information Egg were fascinating. His idea that the universe with the help of advanced sentience is just \\"God\\" in embryonic form does make sense. Whether or not it is feasible, or necessary, remains to be seen.I hesitate to quote any religious doctrine, but one does stand out, \\"...as it was in the beginning, it shall be again in the end.\\" If you are a scientist and you don't believe in a Supreme Cause/Effect then you are as flawed as a Creationist. Nature abhors extremes.I hesitate to give this book a 5 star rating, because it is a lofty and egocentric prediction Tipler makes. It's aim, the race that's already ensued to realize it (albeit subconsciously), may not bode well for the majority of humanity in the short or long term.One of the best books on the melding of theoretical physics and metaphysics I've ever read. Lots of food for thought..."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"Dr. Tipler's book on the reality of life after death is curious, to say the least. He writes as a professor of mathematical physics who is trying to make mathematical theory intelligible to the average person. He is not that successful. Those thinking, from the title, that this work is an attempt on the part of a Christian believer to prove what the Bible says as about immortality, will not find comfort unless they are ready to redefine some terms and concepts. Tipler spends the greater part of the book setting out his case from the view of theoretical physics. He has an appendix to the book which is written for \\"the scientist,\\" but without some familiarity with physics the book may be hard to follow; especially, his material on quantum cosmology. Chapters 9 through 11 are easier to follow and have greater interest to the non-technical reader. Tipler's thesis seems to have grown out of Pierre Teilhard de Chardain's book, \\"The Phenomenon of Man,\\" in which he sees the human race as moving to an Omega Point in its evolutionary development. Tipler sees God as the Omega Point toward which humanity is moving, in which the whole of humanity is given new existence, having been regenerated from the data of their existence which has survived \\"in space\\" following the demise of the original body. Man will not be the original of himself but will be an exact recreation of himself, created out of the extant data of his original existence. The book does not make a claim of presenting absolute proof of the author's thesis, but is a presentation of what may be possible in terms of theoretical physics. Possibilities of what \\"may be\\" make up \\"the stuff\\" of theoretical physics. The book is well worth the reading. Maurice III"},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"While the mathematical speculation and logic in the beginning of this book is interesting, the idea that future humans would have any desire or reason to create machine emulations of all humans is unbelievable and unsupported by the book. I also have to agree with a previous reviewer: I fail to see how a programmed emulation of myself has anything to do with my immortality. How can a machine emulation be considered a resurrection of an individual? And why would anyone have a reason to create this emulation in the first place? Sadly, I am afraid this book argues for mortality rather than immortality."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"Tipler's thesis is that one day all that have ever lived will be resurrected. He argues this soley from a scientific point of view. A word of caution, this book is not for a first time reader of cosmology or quantum physics. (You may want to read A Brief History of Time by Steve Hawkings as a warm up.)Tipler's faith in what the average layperson can grasp is a little optimistic. In some parts the reader will have to stretch their brain to fathom the concepts presented. I encourage the reader to push on! Once past those parts, the summation of what Tipler's thesis means to all that have come before, and all those that willcome after us, is staggering. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"Tipler presents some intriguing ideas and tips his hat toscience (with a wide sweep across biology, physics, computerscience with a selective use of history and creative use ofmathematics.)

He goes on trying to prove mathematically the virginity of Mary, and her lack of the original sin!On another way, his divagations over the Quanta Theory are very sound and easy to understand, and his conclusion that GOD = the Holy Spirit, I couldn't be more in agreement, as I had arrived to this same conclusion in one of my books, several years ago, and that just by logical reasoning and intuition.The fact that the Many-Worlds Interpretation is a mandatory conclusion from the Quanta Theory, I agree also at 100%, and can't see how one can believe in one without the other.I like how absolute he is about the number of possible visible Universes! 10^10^123!In his book, I saw for the first time two notions since long I felt needed, but rarely mentioned. The measure of a quanta unit for time and a measure of a quanta unit for space, units needed to finally be able to understand the famous Zeno Paradox. His idea of the resurrection of the dead by a hipper computer leaves me some doubts. How can the computer which is a part of the world at the final time, include and regenerate the total?May be I am wrong and didn't full grab his reasoning's, but it felt to me as a kind of Urub&oacute;ro eating his own tail. I am unhappily more inclined to believe in the Indian and Buddhist fate of reincarnation. How much good it would be, to die and awake immediately in heavens, even if it takes some billions years to get there, but those billions years felt by one as just a second!It is a fascinating book to read and to follow the brilliant mind of Professor Tipler, even if one is not always in full agreement with his conclusions."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"I found this book such a fascinating read that I don't mind if is complete bunk as science. The author offers several testable predictions, some of which I believe have by now proven false. However, I greatly admire the author's imagination.

At times the smoke seems to be coming out of Tippler's ears, a top physics brain overheating, but the experience is worth it. Better than science fiction (assuming it is not such).

This is not what this book is. In the end, it is a scientific alternative to religion. It is a theory, and a highly speculative one, I find, about what may happen in the very distant future of the universe. And there are correlations, or perhaps only coincidences, of this possible future to the prophecies of many religions.I was disappointed in it, feeling that I had been tricked in what I bought. Being a lifelong Christian, I heartily disagree with Tiplers conclusion. But that is not to say that I did not enjoy the book. It has some great concepts and touches on a lot of interesting information about artificial intelligence and such like.Read it for the information, but if you're looking for something real to believe in, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"Tipler may be a fine physicist but he's not very good at science fiction and fantasy. As other reviewers have said, if you're interested in science, buy a science textbook, and if you're interested in fiction, there are lots of choices in that field as well. This book indeed fails to justify the effort of reading it, on all levels.In essence, Tipler strings together a fairly long sequence of highly improbable (if not outright impossible) events, and then reaches a conclusion which he tries to pass off as being at least more-than-likely, or even almost inevitable. Statistically speaking, that just doesn't cut it.Some of his individual dubious premises include: 1) life will transcend biology (that one's not *too* hard to swallow); 2) life will transcend all forms of matter (!); 3) life as a form of energy will expand to encompass all of the energy in the universe (!!); 4) this life form will desire to recreate, as a simulation, all humans who ever lived; 5) this life form will carry out this simulation; 6) such a simulation constitutes a full resurrection; 7) the life form in question is God.Most of these topics have been covered as science fiction ideas, by other authors, in a much more enjoyable fashion. And Tipler doesn't get into any of the really interesting questions such as: &quot;Why would this entity want to recreate past humans?&quot; or &quot;What would it be like to be 'resurrected' in this manner?&quot; or &quot;Just how is 'life' going to transcend all forms of material existence, anyway?&quot;The idea of a life form that exists as pure energy could be a fascinating topic, but Tipler doesn't really get into it. He merely presents the banal assertion that since our best current definition of life is &quot;information processing&quot; (which I'll buy), and information is just patterns of energy (which can certainly exist by itself), therefore information (and hence life) can also exist all by themselves. Never does he get into such fascinating (and potentially educational) details as the fact that energy, by itself, e.g. in the form of photons, does not interact with itself, and hence cannot perform information processing. But this doesn't stop Tipler. His head is so far into the clouds that he's forgotten all about the ground below.And for those with a theological bent, Tipler's idea of &quot;God&quot; doesn't match that of any previously known religions, not least because this &quot;God&quot; does not exist yet and will not exist until the end of the universe (while most religions have invented a god so that they can explain the *beginning* of the universe). So he's pulling a bait-and-switch with his book title, a very dishonest tactic. I can only conclude that his primary goal with this book was to make money. I guess he's doing pretty well at that."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"It would be difficult to have a sufficiently deep and comprehensive background in general relativity, particle physics and information theory to be able to evaluate the merits of Dr. Tipler's arguments. One of the things that makes this book so impressive is his complete mastery of all these areas, when mastery of a single one would be a real achievement for any one person. Even if I am not in a position to cogently critique the theory presented, I will tell you that many people will find reading this book a tremendously powerful experience, especially if you would like to believe (as I would) that death is not permanent."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"&quot; ... cannot be read without a feeling of suffocation, a gasping and flailing around for sense ... the greater part of it is nonsense, tricked out by a variety of tedious metaphysical conceits, and its author can be excused of dishonesty only on the grounds that before deceiving others, he had taken great pains to deceive himself.&quot;One will find this statement on page 111 of The Physics of Immortality. It is a bit of literary criticism concerning a 20th century work called The Phenomenon of Man by an American paleontologist and Jesuit named Teilhard de Chardin. What's notable - and ironic - is that this statement accurately describes Frank Tipler's The Physics of Immortality as well.This book is pseudoscientific flatulence that fails on multiple fronts. It begins with the gross mischaracterization that the main text should be understandable to anyone with a high school education - not true. That is not because the material is too daunting, but rather because of poor explanatory writing on Tipler's part (i.e., quantum mechanics is discussed without ever being adequately defined). Books by Hawking, Sagan, Kaku - and in particular Fritjof Capra's Tao of Physics -- are vastly more accessible to the layman.I found Tipler's thesis intriguing and was willing to afford the professor a long leash to explore his theories. I think he's in the ballpark with his ideas, and The Physics of Immortality does offer some compelling insights and provoke some worthwhile thoughts. He's to be credited with tackling this most formidable topic and for iconoclastic thought; the road to hell, alas, is paved with good intentions. One suspects that in more capable literary hands The Physics of Immortality would live up to its potential, but as it is, Tipler ends up chasing his teleological tail.The Physics of Immortality promises far more than it delivers, and most of what it does deliver is so offensively dogmatic, ill-reasoned, thinly supported and weakly written as to be maddening (i.e., Tipler's assertion that anyone opposed to racism must necessarily oppose restrictions on the creation of intelligent machines - huh?) Late in the book, Tipler reroutes his energies into theological discussions. He offers a description of life in heaven and addresses the problem of evil - not with supporting scientific correlations, but rather from his own imaginings, which are of no more value than yours or mine. Gasping for breath by the end, The Physics of Immortality concludes with a sort of Cliff's Notes on comparative religion - material one may cull from a standard college textbook on the subject, absent meaningful scientific correlation.After all this sound and fury, Tipler confesses that he is an atheist. He does not believe in his Omega Point Theory. After reading The Physics of Immortality, it is easy to see why."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"WOW! If nothing else, my hat is off to Tipler for assembling this great literary adventure. It was a fascinating read straight through. From the beginning, I opened this book with great anticipation of seeing how in thw world anyone was going to get from Physics to God without being hokey or insulting. Tipler did it. Sure, there is some speculation and a couple leaps in faith from one logical premise to another, but it was never enough to turn me off.I would recommend this to anyone and think it would be a great mind-opening book even if you didn't buy into to any of the arguments."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"I enjoy having my brain stretched, so, with that goal in mind, I picked up Dr. Frank J. Tipler's \\"Physics of Immortality.\\"There are a number of serious problems with this book, logical, scientific, philosophical, and theological, to wit:1. The argument is completely circular. (The main thrust is that life, broadly defined, will be able to manipulate the physics of a closed universe in the final moments of its existence in such a way that a form of subjective immortality is possible, for all conscious intelligences, including ourselves.) In order to get from point A to point B, Tipler assumes part of his conclusion. He assumes that life must exist forever, and then uses that assumption in his proof, a definite logical no-no.Similarly, Tipler includes a \\"proof\\" of his argument, saying, in essence that if certain facts about the Higgs boson and the top quark are true, he's right. His conclusions do not follow from his premises at all.2. Even if one can accept Tipler's main argument, his subsidiary argument is weak. Tipler assumes that his future god-like intelligences will be beings of infinite compassion, who will grant you and I resurrection and immortality, essentially because they're nice guys. This seems like a very slender reed to lean on. The history of intelligent life on this planet (the only intelligence we know anything about) suggests that greater intelligence is not necessarily correlated with greater compassion.3. Tipler goes off on a strange theological tangent when he attempts to equate his \\"omega point\\" being with the God of the Abrahamic faiths (Judaism, Christianity and Islam). While there are similarities between his concept and those of some theologians, there are very many more differences, the major one being that most theologians would assert that God transcends time and space, while Tipler's omega point is bounded by both. Whether God exists or not is usually not considered a scientific question; his attempt to make theology a branch of physics is somewhat embarrasing.4. Finally, even if we can assume that Tipler's argument is plausible, (a stretch), it looks as though the Universe is not cooperating with him. While some of the bounary conditions listed in his proof are as he predicted, the most recent observations seem to show that the Universe's expansion is increasing, not slowing down. Most cosmologists conclude from this evidence that the Universe is open, not closed...and unless the Universe is closed, the rest of Tipler's case falls apart. It's far too early to conclude that the Universe is open (the observations of supernovae in other galaxies which underly the current consensus can be explained in other ways), but at the same time, even without the latest observations, there doesn't seem to be anywhere near enough mass in the universe to allow gravity to eventually slow the expansion down.Frank Tipler was a well respected physicist before this book, and is still regarded as an expert in the field of quantum cosmology. He is not the first world-class scientist to take a flyer on an implausible idea. I think it's interesting that in the book he condemns Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, the French Jesuit paleantologist from whom he took the term \\"omega point\\" for doing precisely what Tipler does in this book. Teilhard did outstanding work investigating early hominid primates in Asia before he began working on his \\"omega point\\" speculations, which attempted to wed evolutionary biology and theology, and then began to believe that his speculations were scientific facts. Tipler has been caught in the same trap.I give the book two stars, not one, however, because I find the ideas fascinating, and I did spend a considerable amount of time grappling with the physics and philosophy, which is the precise reason I picked up the book. He shouldn't have attempted to present it as a scientific theory, though, at least in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"The thesis in this book is that God (aka \\"the Omega Point\\" - an omniscient entity reminiscent of \\"Vger\\" in Star Trek) does not currently exist (but will develop at some point in the future) and will choose to replicate (emulate) exact duplicates of every human who has ever lived, in a virtual-reality Heaven. I made a list of the \\"if's\\" mentioned in this book, that all have to happen for this to occur:IF*strong (indistinguishable from human) artificial intelligence is possibleAND IF*we can develop self-replicating interstellar probesAND IF*humans can be completely grown/raised/educated from stored DNAAND IF*on every planet, these seeded human colonists accept the destiny we assigned to themAND IF*nanotechnology is developedAND IF*250-gigwatt lasers are feasibleAND IF*cost of materials relative to wages drops exponentially every 50 yearsAND IF*antimatter exists, can be feasibly manufactured, and harnessed as a means of propulsionAND IF*the universe is closed (will eventually contract)AND IF*a virtual \\"emulation\\" of a person in a computer is the same \\"consciousness\\" as the original personAND IF*all information in the physical universe can be retrieved without loss or distortionAND IF*a simulation of a living being also recreates perfectly its unexpressed internal statesAND IF*emulations of every person in history can be made without also re-creating their diseases, conflicting ideologies, etc.AND IF*the cost of doing good is not significantly greater than the cost of doing evil, then an omniscient entity will choose the goodAND IF*intelligent beings in the far future will have the desire to resurrect us to a life we will enjoyTHENon this basis, we might have hope of eternal life, \\"heaven,\\" and a benevolent god.If the thesis of this book is true, it won't matter what you believed anyway - resurrection is inevitable/inescapable. But personally I'm not going to bank my eternal existence on all these dice rolling the right way, billions of millenia from now. In my view, this requires much more \\"faith\\" than simply trusting in the conventional claim of Christianity...In my opinion, \\"Pascal's Wager\\" is a much better bet."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"A book like this (and really there is just one) is bound to pique not just a few people, and for contrary reasons depending on their viewpoint. Some here have wondered if Tipler is trying to pull one over on them and others, but one can be assured that the physicalist arguments in this book are for real: Tipler's Omega Point Theory first appeared in book-form at the end of _The Anthropic Cosmological Principle_ (1986) co-written by cosmologist John D. Barrow and Tipler, of which said book received almost universally fawning praise by the science media; and while the implications of it there were clear enough to anyone paying very close attention, Tipler did not in that book mention the resurrection mechanism or equate it with God--but infinite computation by any other name would still be as Godly. A later book to come out after _The Physics of Immortality_ which in part presents and defends Tipler's Omega Point Theory is the excellent _Fabric of Reality_ (1997) by physicist David Deutsch (inventor of the quantum computer and winner of the Institute of Physics Paul Dirac Prize for his work in the field). Thus it cannot be very well maintained that Tipler is some sort of kook or fraud--he is by no means either, and this Theory demands to be taken seriously by anyone who is serious.Some have reported that not even Tipler believes in his own Theory, and it is true that Tipler did say this in the first part of the 12th chapter of _T.P.O.I._ (and in addition stating that he was still an atheist), but this just goes to show how intellectually honest Tipler was being in presenting his Theory--other than theoretical beauty he did not at that time (1994) have any confirming experimental evidence for it--but he also stated that if the Omega Point Theory is confirmed then he shall consider himself a theist. That was seven years ago, and things have progressed since then. For one, the top quark has been found (in 1995) with the mass as predicted it would be in the Omega Point Theory. Also, Deutsch derived the Omega Point using a completely different methodology (using the Turing principle) in the 14th chapter (&quot;The Ends of the Universe&quot;) of his book mentioned above--as a matter of fact, this chapter is available on-line at Tipler's homepage (and with Tipler's replies to it) for anyone willing to do a search for it (which I advise). But probably most convincing are the arguments on the physical restraints (e.g., the Bekenstein Bound, general relativity, and the Second Law of Thermodynamics) which seem to _require_ that the universe evolve into the Omega Point in order for some of the most basic laws of physics to be mutually consistent (such as unitarity not being violated)--of which arguments are a later development than Tipler's book, _T.P.O.I._, and so were not included in there (see the Wired article by Tipler called &quot;From 2100 to the End of Time,&quot; which is available on-line by doing a search; see also Tipler's homepage). &quot;I'm very encouraged by all these things. It's developing much more rapidly than I had expected,&quot; Tipler has told USA Today columnist Sam Meddis--&quot;I'm far more confident now.&quot; How much more confident? He's no longer an atheist. (The four-part USA Today series by Sam Meddis on Tipler's Omega Point Theory is available on-line; locate it by doing a search.)And some have claimed that the recent supernovae data suggesting that the universe's expansion seems to be speeding up shows that the universe is open, as opposed to closed, which would obviate the Omega Point (since it requires that the universe be closed). But as Michael Turner and Lawrence Krauss have demonstrated in a recent paper (_Geometry and Destiny_ [Apr. 1999]; astro-ph/9904020--also available on-line) the supernovae data do _not_ show this. But moreover, the laws of physics _require_ that the universe must end in a finite time, which is only possible in a closed universe. As Hawking has shown, black holes evaporate over time, but if black holes were to evaporate completely away before the universe ends then quantum information would be lost and unitarity would be violated! But unitarity is one of the central postulates of Quantum Mechanics, confirmed again and again by every experiment to date--and indeed, quantum computation would not be possible without it.In short, I highly recommend this book to any sapient person--along with David Deutsch's _The Fabric of Reality_. Both of these books are real mind benders, but in a good way. Any debate between atheism and theism which does not oft reference these books is still in the dark. Religion has now been subsumed by physics."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"A well-meaning relative saved this book from a box of books destined for a landfill, and she thought that as a physicist I might be interested in reading this book. I usually try to avoid books that try to justify faith through science since demanding proof is itself an insult to faith, but decided to give it a chance while waiting for my carpool one evening, I pulled it out and checked the table of contents. Two things caught my eye that I wanted to see his take on:The first was how he proposed that one solves the Halting problem. The gist of the argument is this: he proposes that one starts with a mechanical Turing machine, then adds energy to the parts until they travel at relativistic speed. He proposes then that one could perform an infinite number of calculations in a finite time, and avoid the halting problem entirely by checking to see if the program was finished.There are two problems obvious to someone with even an elementary understanding of physics and computation theory: One, this plan requires an infinite amount of energy. More energy than exists in the universe. Two, supposing one was able to do this, it would require one to go on a speed of light voyage and return to the computer later. The problem is that to do this would not actually solve the Halting problem. In fact, it would just allow one to conclude that the computer had or had not stopped for some extremely and possibly even asymptotically large period of time--even if this intractable voyage was possible, it still wouldn't solve the problem. To his credit, the author says that this is merely a proposal and does not say whether it is an actual solution to the Halting problem. However, if he had asked any of his students or peers they certainly could have told him that his understanding of computation theory, relativity, and the nature of mathematical infinities (namely, that all infinities are equal) are seriously questionable.The next proof of interest was his proof that a resurrection must occur in the future. Apparently, the universe wants to conserve all of the information in it (notwithstanding no satisfactory physical definition of information exists as of my writing this). The universe will run out of space to store said information as it nears its ultimate fate. Therefore, the universe must resurrect every human that ever lived in order to store its information.Some truly bold assumptions exist here: That the author has a suitable definition of information, that the universe actually seeks to somehow conserve it, that information can only be stored at an appropriate density in humans (I don't know about you, but my memory really isn't optimal or spectacular. The universe should try resurrecting some hard drives.), and that it should take exactly every human that ever lived to store said information.At this point I wasn't sure whether I should be laughing or should be concerned that the author intended people to take these bold, half-baked \\"proofs\\" seriously. The author makes undergraduate-level mistakes in subjects that he is ostensibly an expert of.If you want to learn about faith, may I recommend a popular book known as the Bible.If you want to deconstruct the arguments in the Physics of Immortality, I would recommend the undergraduate textbooks, Griffiths \\"Introduction to Electrodynamics\\", Griffiths \\"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics\\", or Sipser's \\"Introduction to the Theory of Computation\\".Myself, I hid this book behind a series on superconductors, and Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics in case I feel like another laugh when waiting for the carpool."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"I read The Physics of Immortality five years ago when it first came out and while I was studying in theological seminary. Recently observing the Amazon.com customer reviews, I was surprised at the number of poor and disfavorable critiques. Yes, it was a challenging book academically. Many people would find it daunting. And Tipler deals with topics about which people can be very sensitive. No one likes to have their sacred beliefs challenged or played around with. Especially by an authoritative and intimidating scientist. Yet for me, as a believer in God and Jesus Christ, The Physics of Immortality was illuminating and inspiring. Why? First of all, I did not expect a cosmological physicist, from his perspective, to confirm my beliefs on terms familiar to me. Second, I learned a lot about science, physics, and the way a scientific mind approaches its object of study. Third, the Omega Point theory was truly astounding. It added a whole new dimension to the way I perceive time, purpose, the universe, God as Creator, and Jesus Christ as the Alpha and Omega. Fourth, I was inspired to see that a scientist, studying the physical universe beginning from a totally scientific and atheistic point of view, was compelled to acknowledge the probability of God.Tipler not only acknowledged the likelihood of Higher Intelligence pulling the universe together teleologically, he compiled a logical proof for God&#65533;s existence and the resurrection of the dead, supported by laws of physics. I think it is notable that he had to consult other disciplines (philosophy, ethics, sociology, etc.) in order to develop such a comprehensive theory. In the process he deals with love, sex, altruism, genetics, machines, artificial intelligence, life beyond earth, and many other topics.Tipler&#65533;s conclusions and speculations are likely to perturb others&#65533; preconceptions and differing viewpoints. For instance, God is (probably) not a Trinity. Nor is He omnipotent in the traditional absolute sense, although He does possess all the powers that be. The likely existence of multiple, parallel universes. Machines are alive. Human beings (and biological entities in general) can be defined as complex computer programs. Religious visions as precocious contact with the future. Etc.A conspicuous point is the prominence Tipler awards to information, knowledge and intelligence. But shouldn&#65533;t we expect that from a non-theistically oriented scientist embroiled in the information age? Although God is a God of goodness and love, that appears to be subordinate to the fact of His being (or becoming) the aggregation of all knowledge.Whatever its drawbacks, Tipler&#65533;s vision provides much food for thought and can expand our perceptions of the unfathomable &#65533;I AM&#65533;. His ideas offer fertile ground for various religious traditions and scientific disciplines to pursue overlapping interests. For example, the Omega Point Theory should allow physics to join serious discussion with religious sentiments of mystical unity and the omnipresence of God.Hopefully, people of faith will embrace such scientific endeavors for the good that can come from genuine search for truth, and not blindly condemn new discoveries and new theories simply because they conflict with established world views.God is Who He is. And He will be what He will be. The perfect example of Christ&#65533;s love shines no less brilliantly because a talented man has written a startling book. But such a book can help scientists to sincerely and intelligently broach the question of God, and eventually open their hearts to His eternal message of love. Its fresh perspective for viewing the universe could allow both scientists and religious people to shed old prejudices. The myriad wonders and underlying unity of God&#65533;s creation can be examined and expressed in many ways. Let&#65533;s keep our minds and hearts open to all of them."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"Do NOT start reading this book until you have tackled &quot;The Anthropic Cosmological Principle&quot; by Tipler and his colleague John Barrows. &quot;The Physics of Immortality,&quot; which may seem merrily unhinged if you start without this preparation, flows sort of logically, perhaps inevitably, from the last chapter of the earlier work.The Anthropic Cosmological Principle is a contemplation of a collection of observations to the effect that life is very unlikely in any possible universe; in ours, it happened because a number of physical principles (fairly arbitrary) allow and in fact seem to promote it. Explanations range from a shrug -- in essence, life is amazing simply because you're here to be amazed, like the passenger in an airliner hurtling earthward to disaster who wonders what God has against him, when the alternative explanation is &quot;tough luck&quot; -- to a very strong interpretation that the universe was created FOR life.This opens all kinds of speculations, one of which Tipler pursues with amazing determination, despite the low likelihood that many readers will follow him. He tries to accomplish the journey without math, but fails because, in a real sense, the story is mathematical. The key point -- what Tipler calls the Omega function, a mathematical statement of a quantum wave function that encodes all possible timelines (as I understand it) -- like a cat with nine lives (and, to satisfy Schoedinger) nine deaths.The key issue is whether a universe can be purposeful. In this, he extrapolates Teilhard de Chardin, a contemplative Jesuit who conceived of a union of all human intellect racing towards the universal culmination and end, what he called the Omega Point.In essence, Tipler describes (and, I think, wishes for) an existence with a purpose, orchestrated across timelines, to create an eternal existence when subjective time becomes infinite at the &quot;big crunch.&quot;I'm no cosmologist, so I'll take his logic as reasonably sound piece by piece. However, he loses me when he tries to reconcile this quantum happy hunting ground with Biblical and Thomistic concepts of heaven -- to me, a questionable effort. Had it been my book, I would have tried to use Jung rather than Aquinas, aiming at universality (are Buddhists excluded from Virtual Valhalla?).Friends, this is a TOUGH READ. If you faint at the sight of an integral sign or have no preparation in physics, go to the SF shelf instead. If you're inquisitive, patient, and willing to follow a very complex road map, read the earlier work as preparation. And good luck."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"This was a mind-blowing book for me. Tipler lays out a testable hypothesis (The Omega Point Theory or OPT) about the end of the universe that shows how it would be possible for &quot;life&quot; to last forever in subjective time, even though the universe will end in a finite amount of &quot;proper&quot; time. Furthermore, based on projections of computing power available near the end of the universe, Tipler tries to show that the resurrection (via perfect emulation) of all humans who have ever lived is not only possible, but very likely.This &quot;Omega Point Theory&quot; comes across as extremely controversial because of Tipler's efforts to integrate religion into his physics. The Omega Point, which is a virtual computer that will have near-infinite computing power, is predicted to have many of the abilities of what most people think of as God. A lot of the book is taken up with passages from religious texts in an attempt to show the the Omega Point corresponds closely to the God referred to in many different religions. There are also discussions of free will, hell and heaven. The section on an Omega Point-created future heaven opens Tipler to easy ridicule by skeptics, since it discusses not only why there will be sex in heaven, but how it will be possible for a man to make love to, not only the most beautiful woman who ever lived, but the most beautiful woman that can theoretically exist!Tipler takes great pains to make sure that he is presenting a true scientific theory and not just some new age gobbledygook mixed in with particle physics and general relativity. To that end, he makes several testable predictions based on his theory, including a couple that might be resolved soon, the mass of the top quark and the Hubble constant. If recent calculations of the Hubble constant prove to be correct, the Omega Point Theory may have already been proven false.If you can wade through the math and physics, I highly recommend reading this book. It is a fascinating speculative look at the far flung future."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"I personally thought this was a wonderful book. However, many people on this review page have written that the book was fantastic and unbelievable. It should be mentioned that there is a lot of material in this book that, yes, does sound fantastic to a normal person. But the book is sound in the mathematics and physics it is based it - in other words, most people would find relativity and quantum mechanics weird, never mind a book that would attempt to assert on the basis of these two theories that the existence of an afterlife is a good possibility.Also, it is important to recognize that this is a theory, and like any other theory, the finer points are open to debate. If you do not mind being challenged, and are open minded, you will find this book interesting and thought provoking. However, if you pick up this book assuming that it will be an easy read, you will be severely disappointed. The author, Mr. Tipler, makes full use of his knowledge of physics, and - despite constant explanations of terminology - he will lose the less tenacious of his readers.In the end, if you're a mathematics/physics genius/savant you'll love this book. If you're a student - or at least have some background in math and physics - you'll have to work to get through the book, and may find the experience rewarding. But if you're unwilling - or unable - to try and understand the concepts Mr. Tipler puts forth you will absolutely hate this book."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"Tipler says that he used to be an unquestioning atheist, but his work in quantum cosmology has brought him to the conclusion that there is a physically justifiable theory of how \\"God\\" and \\"immortality after death\\" might make sense. I only skimmed the book, but I have to say that, as a physicist, I was surprised to find the quality of his arguments to be a lot better than I expected.(Talk about having \\"proved\\" the existence of God is greatly overstated. It would be more accurate to say that, if certain physical conditions could be shown to hold, then the existence of something vaguely like God might be remotely plausible based on his arguments. But see the end of this review.)The compressed version of the theory is... Tipler (as I do) subscribes to the \\"strong Artificial Intelligence\\" belief that if you translated the dynamics of what goes on in our brains into another medium (e.g., a futuristic computer), in a sense it wouldn't make any difference -- our \\"emulated\\" selves would be as conscious and real as we are. He outlines a scenario under which, in a closed universe, in the final moments of the universe, there could be an infinite amount of computing that occurs. So much in fact, that all the human lives that ever occurred (or ever could have occurred) could be emulated through infinite subjective time. The computing entities that exist at the end of the universe would get there via exponentially replicating intelligent machines that we (or conceivably another intelligent race) send out into the universe. Based on game theory and economic arguments, he makes it plausible that the intelligences at the end of the universe would be highly altruistic. And then based on quantum cosmology, he argues for bidirectional causality between here and the end of the universe (I haven't digested that argument).Not exactly something most traditionally religious folks would recognize. But, as a theory of how \\"God\\" and physics could be merged, to my mind it's pretty brilliant. (Doesn't mean it's right.)Note, however, that the book was written in the early 90's. Tipler provides some experimental tests one can do to assess whether or not we're in a universe where the conditions are right to make his scenario possible. One of the most important tests -- verification that we're in a closed universe -- has already been answered (we seem to be in a defiantly open universe) in a way that implies we are NOT in a universe where Tipler's scenario could hold true.Still, very interesting reading."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"I was not expecting a lot from this book. I figured it would have to be about as vague and suggestive as one usually finds in a book about physics and religion. I never expected the sort of specific and rigorous statements that Tipler makes (whether they are true or not). I was pleasantly suprised and found the book fascinating.Tipler may be generous in his view of how accessible this book is to the general public. To really follow the reasoning, one would need to be a physics major or fairly well versed in the popular physics literature. If phrases such as 'phase space', 'many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics', 'strong AI', 'Hawking's no boundary proposal', and so on, are foreign to the reader, they are likely to find the book hard to digest.The use of computer terminology and concepts to describe the increasing mental capacity of the universe and ultimately god, may put some people off. More etheral sounding terms could be substituted (perhaps a new age tilt could have widened his audience), but if you don't care much for strong AI, then you probably won't care much for god as the Omega point either.In understanding this book, it helps if you are somewhat familiar with the material in &quot;the cosmological anthropic priniple&quot; which is a previous book by Tipler (and Barrow). The basic idea is that it seems very difficult to dream up a universe in which intelligent life is possible. If you just start picking the number of dimensions, pick some forces and strengths of interaction, etc. one usually ends up with a model that doesn't have the variety or stabity or something to give rise to life and intelligence. Not all Physicists agree that this is a accurate assessment, but those who do often suggest that perhaps there is a selection principle of sorts. Perhaps the whole universe we see is just one tiny inflated bubble out of many. Most of these bubbles don't contain life, so no one is there to ask the questions. Only in the few bubbles that can support intelligent life are th"},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"This guy is seriously messed up.

What a nut! As if we are even going to last the next 100 years on this planet..."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"When people don't believe in God, they worship things they can see, taste, smell, and touch. In the belief of Christianity this is referred to as idolatry. It is the worshipping of something that takes the rightful place of God in a believer's life. Put down Five Stars, and that is what this will be for you: it is idolatry. You are putting your basis in something that is proven by scientific 'fact'; I will leave the scientific faults to those who have already stated the book's scientific faults. From the view as a layman and student of Scripture, this is my opinion that this is idolatry.Believeing the words of a former atheiest and trusting in mathematics proven only by speculation and the laws of Physics, which are all human inventions, can only lead to downfall. This book will make people believe in God for all the wrong reasons, paint the wrong picture of His future kingdom, and give everyone the idea that EVERYBODY is entitled to a piece of Heaven, repentence or no. Even blatant sinners who refuse God's promise of salvation will, in this book, get them in the gates.God loves everyone no matter what, and because He loves everyone and wants everyone to come to know Him, as a follower I want to do my part to help those who might be worshipping 21st century Ashtoreth.DO NOT FOLLOW THIS BOOK AS YOUR BIBLE AND THE SOLE BASIS FOR YOUR BELIEFS!For one thing, the Bible, the written record of the God Tipler talks of, is full of people who rebelled against God and didn't want to repent to Him to receive mercy. Will God give them a fair shot at Resurrection? It is said that the best way to have peace is to cast out the mockers who constantly bicker against the words of the wise.For an example, one cannot look farther than the very first book fo the Bible, in Genesis. Chapters 18 and 19 speak of how these cities were destroyed and how none there believed. The cities were destroyed and the area right where the cities used to be lie s the Dead Sea. God gave the people time to repent, they didn't, and He destroyed them.I do not want to destroy hopes that have been raised by this book. I cannot pass judgement, and those who think I have may rebuke me so that I know I have acted as such; still, God is also the God of Truth, and the truth must be known. In beliefs, no matter what your religion, there is always that leap of faith that makes people believe more so. If God could be identified with science, the whole Earth would be full of converts, because that would make believeing too easy.But it's not that easy.God wants people to believe in a way that can't be proven or denied. If we could see him like we see a rock on a beach, we would drop Him or not take Him seriously, for thinking Him to be only a rock and not the Rock in control of every single atom of the universe doesn't leave any room for doubt.Without doubt, there can be no leap of faith and thus a suspension of doubt.The leap of faith is a powerful cornerstone of every world religion.Without doubt, your belief isn't as strong as it would be with it. It is just like blind faith; no doubt, in this case of the Holy Word, causes people to believe everything that's told to them and they act like machines. The more doubt you possess, the more you must make blind leaps of faith, and thus, the stronger your faith will in turn be.Believeing God's there due to a mathematical equation isn't Christianity or Judaism. It's idolatry.Chuck it. Go read and believe the Bible for spiritual fulfillment. The fact it has had a print run of at least 2000 years ensures its readership will last longer than Tipler's book. And also there's C.S. Lewis's 'Mere Christianity' for those want to learn about the religion without the boundaries of denominations getting in the way.(Note: It is GOOD that there are those that now believe God does exist. However, it is NOT GOOD that these same people are believeing in a God that isn't what the Bible teaches about.)"},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"One enters this book with high expectations, but early one starts doubting about the real intentions of the writer. Pretending to justify everything by the use of undecifrable scientific formulas, he becames pompous and forces his own ideas. It is a tremendous lack of humility to pretend to be able to extrapolate 200 years of science, into the nexth 200 billion years! The Author minimises all other serious writers and tries to prove to us without doubt that machines can become more inteligent than Humans, and that the future Humanity will be made of Robots. He depreciates all arguments about the the impossibility of AI, forcing his own, and telling us to read his scientific proofs in the Anex. The book doesn't justify the effort of reading it, and I fully agree with the two other critics in the same sense as mine. Mr Tipler could use a bit more humility and sense of proportions. He says he is a Math specialist who studied by himself Physics and Relativity, but he must have misread most of his study books. He looks down into some arguments made by some real Nobel prices, as if he was God himself! His God, I don't want, his Robot God he can keep for himself.Jose Maia"},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"I was shocked and amazed to learn that Tipler has a college degree (any degree) and that some consider him to be an intelligent person.This book is absolute dreck, fantasies piled upon assumptions piled upon circular arguments. If you think this is a brilliant work please go immediately and take a course in logic, any course will do. Tipler has no acquaintance with logic at all. This book exhibits samples of virtually every logical fallacy that exists.If you are capable of logical thought and interested in these types of topics, read something by Peter Bros instead."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"I read this looking for a bridge between spirituality and physics (I have extensively studied physics at the University level) and I found the physics the painfully wrong at many different points, which in my mind discredits the entire book.If one is going to make arguments for immortality etc based on purely spiritual grounds, then God bless. But if you are going to use science, learn the science yourself, or hire an editor who can help. It is clear to anyone with a basic physics education that the author did neither.One example from the book of fundamentally incorrect physics- Tipler says (inexact quote) &quot;To jump to the moon from the earth, you need to go go faster than the earth's escape velocity.&quot; This is not true- escape velocity would be needed to jump to a point infinitely far away. To jump to the moon, one simply needs to attain an attitude such that the moon's gravity overcomes that of the earth. Given their relative sizes, this point will obviously be somewhat close to the moon, but certainly closer than the point infinitely far away that 'escape velocity' would take you to.Overall, this book is a painful example of spiritualists trying to justify themselves with at best a cocktail party understanding of physics. Ill make a deal- I'll stay out of spirituality if Tipler will stay out of physics."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"I cannot recomend it because I have not received this book since I bought it.

He reduces life, God and eternal life to the limited observations we can make and to the virtually unlimited speculations he is able to put forward. The critical reader should be able to distinguish present observations (none of which contradicts the Bible) from extrapolations about the unobserved past and future. After that first operation, the critical reader will be able to notice that Frank Tipler is a master of the art of extrapolation, imagination and speculation. He is also a victim of a confusion of categories. For him God is a naturalistic Omega Point, where all mater, time, space, energy and iunformation converge and colapse. My advice to Tipler is: don't bet your life on your fallible (as well as unsubstantiated and in many instances simply wrong) speculations. Jesus Christ is the Alpha, Omega without whom the origins, purpose and end of this Universe lose their possibility. The biblical creationist model of creation, fall, Flood, Babel, dispersion and rapid speciation, although it is as amazing as anything can be, is much more sound and coherent from a theological, philosophical, scientific and historical point of view. We should not try to find a place for God in our reason. Instead, we should try to find a place in God for our reason.

In my opinion this is a good start for a pseudoscientific work, but he fails it so completely, that I never understood why the book was even published. We want to be entertained, damn it! Not fall asleep while reading his mindless use of mathematics to obscure his faulty arguments (he even asks the reader to study mathematics for a few years to understand his cranky arguments).His argumentation is either completely non-existent (introducing &quot;axioms&quot; without any kind of proof or scientific basis), completely irrelevant to the discussion (lot's of the book is just filler material), or simply not understandable by someone without at least one or two degrees in mathematics or physics.I think the main problem with this book is that while most pseudoscientific works are written be people obviously feeble-minded, this one is written by someone who is actually smart, and uses every occation to intimidate you with his &quot;knowledge&quot;, thus making you feel bad about not understanding his arguments. I find it much more entertaining to read about pseudoscience from someone where I can refute every argument, instead of just those that I can understand."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"Tippler has managed to create a work that surpasses, CHARIOTS OF THE GODS.This work shows why scientists should not write on religious subjects.It is laughable."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"Tipler says many times \\"as I have proved\\".

I am intelligent enough to understand basic physics concepts, and Tipler just doesn't make any sense. His writing is so bad that anyone who reads this entire thing will have wasted a colossal ammount of time.

This has been one of the most infuential books I've ever read, even if the most recent cosmological measurements end up disproving Tipler's theory (if the universe is open, - that is, if it continues expanding forever instead of closing back in on itself, as recent measurements indicate - then, by his own admission, his theory is disproven). If nothing else, one should give Tipler credit for essentially being the first to put together a systemmatic Theory of Everything - with physical and mathematical proofs to boot! If you're one who feels the idea of undertaking such a task is impossible and that any attempt to do so can result only in the postulation of arrogance, then this book can only annoy you. At the outset of the book, he even says he will make no attempt to hide his arrogance (having been accused of it before).But as far as I'm concerned, the person who says that a Theory of Everything is impossible is as arrogant as the person who says such a theory is possible and goes about to find one. Kudos to Tipler for trying!Despite Tipler's announcement that it is for the layperson, before you read this book, you will want to AT LEAST read ONE popular book on quantum physics (&quot;In Search of Schroedinger's Cat&quot; is a good one - there are others - Paul Davies is good), but I would recommend reading at least two or three other science/cosmology books or articles in science mags. A general-interest book on infinite mathematics or the nature of numbers wouldn't hurt as well (&quot;Infinity and the Mind&quot; by Rudy Rucker will get you thinking in truely mind-bending terms, though some of his conclusions come out of thin air. Still, it would be good prep for this book). Finally, you'll have to read one of Eric Drexler's books on nanotechnology (or other books on nanotech) either before you read Tipler's or just afterwards to help you comprehend just how Tipler's scenario could come about.But just to give you a teaser, after you read Tipler and these other books, you'll learn (if even half of it all is true) that the computer you are reading this review on at this very moment has far more significance in the cosmic realm of things than you could ever imagine. In fact, your computer's descendants shall one day be your savior. Also, for you environmentalist-types, most of your efforts are (ultimately) futile, and all that technology and development happening in the world is for a darn good reason as well! (sorry to be so arrogant :)"},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"Before I praise Tipler's adventuresome theory, I have three quibbles. 1) He begins by saying he'll prove ... and ends by rejecting what he had 'proved' and placed his Omega Point theory on the shelf until there is experimental evidence for it (requiring gadzillions to build that super accelerator in Texas). 2) Tipler does not allow for the myriad intelligent life forms out there? Are they to be resurrected, too, in a separate Heaven? And what will our computer simulations do when confronting such beings? Go away? 3) Is God a part of or outside His/Her creation? And what was He/She doing before the Big Bang, and after, or is there no beginning, but an endless round of creations? Perhaps these conundrums were not within the purview of this title, or, more likely, they were covered and I missed them in all three of my readings. Yes, I'm now reading it for the 4th time in the hope I'm nearing the point of understanding it all. (Tipler has little understandfing of the laymen's understanding, else he wouldn't have said all the reader would need was a decent high school education. Mine must have been indecent, indeed.) Having said all that, I am in awe of his scientific chutzpah. (I can only imagine how he must be treated by his colleagues at scientific conferences!) One also wonders what Our Heavenly Father was up to during the 12 or so billion years before planet Earth became inhabitable, or what He/She and Jesus will be doing during the 100-billion or more years after the earth disappears into the Sun's red maw? If heat death is the Universe's destiny, how pray tell will our Creator will occupy Him/Herself ever after? Of course if this is just one of an infinite number of Universes (and probably not the original one), He/She was remain occupied forevermore. Such a scenario of course eliminates the Omega Point and my ressurrection. So for purely selfish reasons I prefer to go along with Tipler. But I wish he had accounted for an endless series of Big Bangs. Does each Genesis create a new Omega Point and another round of resurrections? Be that as it may, Tipler has recruited me to join the Deists. Don't let the Bastards beat you down, Frank."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"Tipler's imagination borders are probably further away than most people's. He nevertheless anticipates vigorous objection while explaining his theory, which indicates that he's not out of touch with reality. Most reviews ignore the fact that Tipler included an appendix to his general text. In this appendix he argues his contemplation. Any serious objection should really falsify the math in the appendix, because this is his research with which he verified his ideas. Not many scientists dare to go to such extremes out of fear to be excommunicated. Tipler had the guts to do so, because he probably thought history produces at least as many sceptics as visionaires. I think his choice is admirable, because mortals usually have no access to the kind of information scientists have. I myself thouroughly enjoyed reading this book (3 times) and ended up with an entirely different view on life and future. Expirienced men like Tipler take into account that new findings will damage their hypothesis. Nevertheless the expression of his views is very much worth reading."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"I have to say this is one of the most interesting books on theoretical science that i have come across so far.At first when i heard of the Omega Point theory, i thought it was highly absurd that the existence of a higher power (God, Allah or others) and the resurrection of the dead is compatible with modern physics. Once again, Tipler shows how absurd ideas can be proven to be true, despite common notions and beliefs stating otherwise.While of course, the Omega Point theory is speculative at present, it could be the best cosmological scenario we could ask for assuming the LHC at CERN finds evidence for it and other scientific experiments.Tipler also gives us hope for the future of life in the universe and how it could prove to be stronger than the blind laws of physics governing the physical universe. Finally, this book provides reason for hope that science and religion are not incompatible and they would work very well together in tackling life's big questions.I hope that anyone who reads this review agrees with my main points i've raised and finds meaning in life after reading this book."},{"Title":"The Physics of Immortality","review":"Most of the physics in here was accurate, with a few blunders, but not so serious.

Again, going from memory, Tipler stated that if, in fact, the universe does not recollapse at any time in the future, then his hypothesis will have failed.Current cosmological understanding is that the universe will not only continue expanding indefinitely into the future, but also the rate of expansion is increasing.

Well that's up to you. the Only thing I can say about the argument about the resurrection (accepting many argument not so easely) is :Even if this \\"God\\" would have all the information to revive you that doesn't mean that the revived thing is you.

I was reminded of Nabakov's PALE FIRE, one of the most exquisitely funny books you can find about the academic literary scene; but you have to be familiar with that scene before you can recognize what Nabakov was poking fun at. This book would be good entertinment for post-graduate students in physics on a rainy weekend, if they have the necessary background in the humanities, philosophy and comparative religion.

The author describes his experience living temporarily in Cuba, and the tango lessons and the cult ceremony are all part of that. However, my primary objection is that he writes in either an extremely British style, or in a haughty style (it might be a mixture of both). I read a lot in many genres, but many times I found myself saying \\"What is he talking about?!\\"Interesting subject; mediocre book."},{"Title":"Land of Miracles Hb","review":"Ok, so I may have approached this book from the wrong angle. I sort of expected a travel journal kind of book, covering the interesting corners of Cuba, but that's not what it is. Instead it's just a limited number of topics related a little bit to Cuba, but more to the author himself. (The author taking tango lessons, the author paying good money to participate in a religious cult ceremony, the author describing his lack of success in and nervousness of arranging an interview with Fidel Castro, the author seeking out places he's read about or seen in a movie, the author almost becoming romantically involved with his official guide, and so on.)At times the author approaches funniness, but he soon leaves that trail. A lot of his references have to do with obscure British personalities, maybe it would make more sense to an Englishman than to a Norwegian like me.Stephen Smith is no traveller, he is a reporter or a journalist who spent a long time in Cuba, but who seldom could be tempted to leave Havana. I wanted to read about Cuba, not about lazy people at the Cuban press centre or a bland piece about there being prostitutes in Cuba despite the official claim that there are none.For a travelogue, look elsewhere! For an introduction to life in Havana, maybe it's good enough, but I found it lacking in many respects."},{"Title":"Land of Miracles Hb","review":"This is a good book about life in Cuba in the mid-nineties, and not much has changed 6 years on, so most of the content is not out of date. He conveys a good sense of what Cuban daily life is. Smith is a careful observer, though not as careful a researcher of facts and figures; his analysis is a bit superficial and unsystematic.The main problem I have with the book is that the author is too egocentric. The word \\"I\\" must appear a million time, and the prose often reads more like a book about the author himself than about Cuba. Would have been better if he had taken a bit of a step back here and there."},{"Title":"Shooting lever guns of the old west","review":"I found this to be as fun to read and as useful as Shooting Buffalo Rifles of the Old West...the history, commentary on the guns, good illustrations, and the practical information on shooting various historic and obsolete calibers is well researched, honest, and very helpful in evaluating potential additions to my collection of antique arms. My only complaint is that the book is very Winchester heavy, and although Marlin is somewhat represented, there is little about other interesting lever guns such as Savage, Whitney, Burgess, etc. But Winchesters and Marlins are the most likely lever guns that the reader may have a chance to play with, so the coverage is appropriate.

At 300 pages, it's not necessarily big, but, there's a lot in it! I am of the opinion that the layout and art/photography is better than his early books, so kudos to his wife who I believe does that work for him.This book is one that I can heartily recommend to anyone who shoots old guns and wants reliable data, old west buffs, and gun nuts like me who love stuff that goes \\"Boom\\".

Each dialogue is presented in its entirety, followed by a sentence-by-sentence breakdown that permits listen-and-repeat. The other 4 cassettes follow the same 10 dialogues, but offer more traditional interactive drills, with useful explanations.

She's equal parts, poet, philosopher, psychiatrist and yet so much more than all of that. Most importantly she feels like the wise friend you wish you could talk to in your darkest hour. She quotes liberally from mostly obscure sources, but such gems, many of which have become part of my vocabulary. Then there's her observations and insights which are so beautiful and profound to me, especially because her wisdom and eloquence are so tempered with humility.There are some wonderful revelations in this book but much more importantly there are even more illuminating questions, which is what's missing in so many of the &quot;one size fits all&quot; answers to your problems fare that crowds the bookshelfs.Everybody wants answers but ultimately what they really want is a different answer than the one that's right in front of them.

Her life was forever changed as she discovered from this book that it was through the triumphant work of the indwelling Holy Spirit that she can live a life of victory over pride and selfishness. She then wanted to see this powerful teaching available to generations to come.This book declares that if Jesus lives in you then it is through the Holy Spirit that 'self' be dethroned. What is meant by 'self'? That part of you that says, \\"I am in control.

Using simply, practical easy to use techniques Rose VanSickle shows how it is possible to regain control of your life. The book is easy to read and is obviously written from the heart through the eyes of experience.From the beginning book gives a message of supreme hope. Reading this book will teach you how to change unconscious thinking with conscious thoughts. You will learn &quot; verbal tranquillisers&quot;, words to use as antidotes for fear and anger. It will show you the relationship between what you think and how you feel.The whole purpose of the book is to teach you how to feel and be more in control of the way you react. You may think, given the stress and strain of life today inner peace is not possible. This book will prove you wrong. It goes beyond teaching how to just cope with stress and strain by showing you how to eliminate the cause.Once you find inner peace you will feel better physically and mentally, you will have a sense of vitality. Life will take on a new lease you will experience Peace of Body Peace of Mind.Peace of Body Peace of Mind has definitely help me to improve my life and I thoroughly recommend it. For me one of the most powerful phrases is &quot;Distressing but not dangerous&quot;. These words can enable you to regain control when fear, anxiety or panic starts to take hold. Frequently these words have helped me to avert a panic attackThose of you that have experienced such problems will understand the progression. You feel hot; your pulse starts to race. You start to wonder what's wrong, fear what will happen. Other methods, I have found, teach you at this point to tell yourself that &quot;you are in control of your body&quot;. However, my mind says that, If you need to think that then YOU ARE NOT in control.Distressing but not dangerous however acknowledges that I don't feel right but reminds me that the way I feel is not dangerous to me. It's strange how once you realise that the situation is not dangerous how much easier it is to defuse it.It would not be possible to do this book justice in a short review; not possible to tell you how much help the book has been to me. I have read many books in an attempt to find my inner peace but this one stands out above the rest."},{"Title":"Peace of body, peace of mind: Practical, effective techniques for mental fitness","review":"Rose Van Sickle's Peace of Body, Peace of Mind, is a practical guide to emotional health. The author admits that she has suffered from depression and anxiety and found a way to heal her own life. In her book she shares her journey back to health. While reading the book, it literally changes your mood.I have personally experienced the mood-changing power of this book. While traveling to San Antonio recently I felt fatigued and, as Ms. Van Sickle would say, experienced \\"lowered feelings\\" (a phrase she uses for depression.) Within minutes of reading Peace of Body, my mood changed! I cannot explain how a book can produce this result. My hunch is that it happens because the spoke directly to me, as someone who had once had my experience.Peace of Body ranks well with such works as Albert Ellis' New Guide to Rational Living. I recommend it enthusiastically."},{"Title":"Peace of body, peace of mind: Practical, effective techniques for mental fitness","review":"In this book Rose gives a lot of great insight into her experience with recovery inc,, and how it helped her overcome her panic attacks and agoraphobia.

I keep this book on hand and read it all the time."},{"Title":"Peace of body, peace of mind: Practical, effective techniques for mental fitness","review":"I've struggled with anxiety most of my life. I'm also studying Christian counseling. I've read a lot lately about mental disorders like depression and anxiety and possible ways to \\"fix\\" them, but nothing has resonated with me quite like this book. It basically tells how the author applied the principles taught in the organization, Recovery, Inc., to overcome agoraphobia. This book has been like water to a thirsty soul for me, and all without any spiritual overtones at all, which I find amazing. While I wish I could attend Recovery, Inc. (RI) meetings, there are none nearby. I do intend to check out the online meetings offered at the RI website. Anyway, this book gives a wonderful overview of how the RI principles work.The \\"Method\\" has a lot of terms to learn, but I think that makes the ideas even more memorable. The main motto that RI leans on is to tell yourself, whenever you experience fear or anger, that the sensations you're feeling are \\"distressing, but not dangerous.\\" They theorize that you cannot control your feelings or your bodily sensations, but you can control your thoughts and \\"impulses\\" (or behaviors). So focus on what you CAN control, and as you practice these principles, the feelings and sensations will become less pronounced.I really believe this method can work for anyone who is willing to give it a serious go. They say to work at your mental health like a business, not a game. And really, what is there that makes life more satisfying than having your mental health? It's really more important even than your physical health. I'm reminded of a scripture in the book of Proverbs (18:14) that says, \\"The human spirit will endure sickness, but a broken spirit--who can bear?\\"As a Christian, I was intrigued by how many times the ideas in the book could be supported by something Jesus taught, such as to not judge others. Some of the ideas are things I've seen in the writing of people like Joyce Meyer, Norman Vincent Peale, and other Christian teachers. I think good ideas go across the board! They show up in other faith traditions, too. But the difference is that this book gives personal experience, and then gives you a practical way to act on these good ideas.No one really knows where the spiritual aspect of a person connects with the mental part, such as the will or the emotions. No one can define what is spiritual and what is psychological, can they? The two fields overlap a great deal. This book is a balanced, thorough look at what it takes to have a positive, peaceful attitude. If you suffer from nervous anxiety, phobias, depression, social anxiety, panic attacks, and the like, I think this book can really help you.

Chaucer's version dates from c.1380; almost a century later Caxton printed it (1477) from a now lost late manuscript. For those interested in early English printing but without access to original copies, this is a most useful reproduction (based on the copy in Cambridge University Library), and is handsomely produced. Being stark black on white, it does not attempt to give any impression of the actual texture of the original printed pages, but on the other hand is admirably clear for those not used to reading the black-letter type used by Caxton.

Andrew shares many traits with other Dick Francis heroes--he is honest, likeable, an all-around good guy who trumps the criminals and gets the girl in the end. In this novel, Andrew himself is not connected with horses or horse racing, but rather the connection comes from the fact that all of the kidnapping victims share a connection to the horse racing world, be it as a female jockey, a part-owner of a promising race horse, the owner of a race track, and the head of the Jockey Club. From these tenuous links, Andrew and his partners realize that the perpetrator is probably known to the horse racing world, and begin to try to trap him, but not before one more kidnapping takes place!Like his other novels, this one too is a very easy, fast read, and takes readers from Italy to England to America before winding up most satisfactorily.I also liked the other characters in the novel, particularly some of Andrew's partners (described and fleshed out thoughtfully and with humor) and his love-interest.Readers will also learn something about horse racing, this time mostly from the perspective of a trainer and a jockey, as well as come away from the novel with a good sense of what it is like to go to the races, even if they have never attended.If you have never read anything by Dick Francis, this novel is an excellent place to begin."},{"Title":"The Danger (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"One of the things I like about Dick Francis is that even though his stories involve horses and race courses, etc., you don't have to know anything about horses to understand and enjoy his books.I believe 'The Danger' is one of his best. It's amazing how this man capures so well the emotions of all the characters in this book: the kidnapped girl jockey, her grieving father, the insensitive father of the kidnapped child, and the mother who was made to feel guilty, even the sinister and very dangerous kidnapper. Everyone!I was on the edge of my seat the whole book. I tell you Dick Francis is superb."},{"Title":"The Danger (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Dick Francis' knows the horse racing industry well. Anyone who's read his mysteries knows that horses and money mean trouble and great stories. But for my money, Francis' true talent lies in seamlessly melding unusual mystery elements around horses. Such is the case with &quot;The Danger&quot;, a taut, sobering but enthralling look at the risk of being rich and associated with horse racing. The hero works as a &quot;consultant&quot; to families and employers of kidnap victims. And just how kipnapping and horse racing are related exhibits Dick Francis' genius at research. The hero weaves slowly through the chase - advising families on how to get their loved ones back unharmed, tightrope-walking between overly-aggressive police and exceptionally nervous kidnappers and counseling the victims as they adjust to the real world again. When the pieces finally fall together for our hero and the firm he represents, Francis' opens the starting gate and rushes the reader page after page through a frightening resolution - and a totally unexpected one. I've read a number of Dick Francis' mysteries. Sid Halley stories held the top place on my Dick Francis list - until I read &quot;The Danger&quot;. Be sure to read it when you have lots of time - put it down and you might get the creeps until you finish it and the villain(s) (I won't say how many) is/are caught."},{"Title":"The Danger (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"First Sentence: There was a God-awful cock-up in Bologna.Andrew Douglas works for a company specializing in returning kidnap victims to their families.

I reread this for mystery group. I was delighted to find I felt it was a well-written as I remembered.He does character development very well, but more, really gives a sense of who they are emotionally. Although you know horses are likely to be involved in the story, he takes what could have been a coincidence from another author, and makes it the crux of the plot.The international settings provide an excellent, and distinctive, sense of place. The information on kidnappings for profit, and the philosophy of those to deal in it, both on the right-and wrong-side of the law, as well as the impact on both the victims and their families, was fascinating.The research done by Francis' is evident, but not intrusive.

Though some call him Peter. He is warm, reassuring, courageous, and superb at his multi-million-dollar job. Once you meet him, you never forget the force of his presence, for he is a natural-born leader, with the temperament of an executive or top-level diplomat. But Giuseppe-Peter is neither of these. Giuseppe-Peter is Europe's most elusive and cold-blooded kidnapper.His name is Andrew Douglas. He is warm, reassuring, courageous, and superb at his vitally important job. Once you meet him, you like him immediately, for he is a sensitive and decent man, a bit reserved perhaps, the type of fellow who's more afraid, say, of falling in love than of putting his personal safety on the line in the cause of others. Although he has the brilliance and insight of a psychiatrist or a priest, Andrew Douglas is neither of these. He is Europe's most successful anti-kidnap operative on his toughest, most dangerous mission to date: stop Giuseppe-Peter.Following a treacherous trail that takes him from the medieval back streets of Bologna to the lavish grounds of a Washington, D.C. racetrack, Andrew stalks a mysterious master criminal who preys exclusively on the habitu&eacute;s of the racing world. Among his victims: a lovely young Italian heiress who is also Italy's most adored female jockey, and the three-year-old son of an English horse owner. As the trail loops and deepens and the hunter and the hunted draw ever closer to confrontation, Andrew will find himself assaulted by a barrage of dangers -- the danger of violence, the danger of romance, and, ultimately, the danger of almost certain death.In THE DANGER, perhaps his most compulsive page-turner to date, Dick Francis has created characters and situations so fascinating and so profoundly human that you will never forget them.

One of Dick Francis's best - it is as good as a holiday."},{"Title":"The Danger (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The 1980's were a much better period, quality-wise, for Dick Francis books than the '70's, and so I was eagerly looking forward to reading this, the only Francis book from that decade I hadn't read.After 20 pages, I was aghast. The book starts off VERY awkwardly; Francis almost throws us into the middle (without really setting the scene for the reader) of a kidnapping-in-progress in Italy, overseen by an English representative of a firm specializing in dealing with the aftermath of kidnappings. The writing in these pages is pedestrian, the characters are Italian authority-figure stereotypes with stilted dialogue, and there's no plot-building momentum to the introduction of the crime-in-progress.After this, in typical dogged Dick Francis style, the book improves enormously. The hero, following the template of most all Francis protagonists, is a loner, a man of high integrity and good at his work, liked by most, and intrepid when it comes to danger or people he cares about who are at risk. Francis gives us a good portrait of the post-traumatic stress of kidnapping victims and their lives in the immediate aftermath of being rescued, and he also gives us a proper Dick Francis nemesis, a scion of an Italian racing family who has been disowned for mysterious reasons and has turned his unscrupulous talents to high-profile kidnappings in the international racing community. And there's the usual love interest, an impossibly unspoiled and lovely young Italian female jockey, who is the first kidnap victim.While being nowhere near Francis's best, this is a solid, likeable and often exciting thriller (after that dubious start). Small flaw: the way Francis has some of the American kidnappers talk is laughably out-of-date, referring to money as \\"bread\\" like some 1950's b-movie gangsters."},{"Title":"The Danger (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was my first read of a Dick Francis novel (may he rest in peace). A friend recommended it as one of her favorites, and it didn't disappoint. The plot was exciting and the main character was especially engaging. I did giggle a bit at the prevalent use of telephone booths and running to \\"find a phone\\" in today's age of cell phones in every pocket, but other than that, the story was still timely.I would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Danger (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is Dick Francis at his best. The hero, Andrew Douglas, is a partner in a company that advises families and companies in cases of kidnapping.Andrew understands the psychology of both kidnappers and victims. He gets involved in ransom negotiations, recovery of the victim and helping the rescued victim reintegrate into ordinary everyday life.When we meet Andrew, he's working in Italy (his highly specialized profession takes him all over the world). Alessia Cenci, world-class champion girl jockey, has just been kidnapped. The daughter of a rich, devoted father, Alessia is young, beautiful and brilliant. (If you sense the potential for romance here, you are correct!)There are lots of things to love about this book. The hero is low-key, thoughtful, cool headed in a crisis and wonderfully compassionate - a rock with a soft heart. The methodology of dealing successfully with kidnappers is fascinating, and we see this unfold on more than one case. All the supporting characters are well drawn. And the plot has a symmetry about it that's truly elegant.In particular, Dick Francis does a tremendous job of portraying the emotional damage a victim of abduction suffers and the subsequent symptoms of posttraumatic stress.This is not a particularly horsy book, but rather a thriller that feels totally real - and a love story of ineffable charm. I recommended it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"The Danger (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The story of Dick Francis has a Cinderella quality. He was jockey for the Queen Mother of England when he was injured and turned to writing. All his novels have racing as a backdrop.This is my favorite of half a dozen Dick Francis suspense novels I have read. Andrew Douglas works for Liberty Market, a firm that specializes in advising family members or business associates of kidnap victims. Andrew is called to Bologna when Alessia Cenci, rising young jockey and daughter of a wealthy Italian businessman, is snatched and held for ransom. The case has been bungled by the carabinieri, who besieged the kidnapers at the drop site only to have one of them get away with the ransom, while Alessia remains a hostage. Her father pays a second ransom, and Alessia is dropped off, drugged and naked except for a plastic raincoat. She is in shock and decides to accompany Andrew back to London, where she will stay with a woman trainer she knows from the racing circuit.They have barely arrived in England when Andrew is called to a seaside resort where another kidnapping has taken place, this time a 3 year old boy, son of the owner of a famous racehorse (coincidence? No, thinks Andrew, and it turn out he is right). Alessia accompanies him and comforts the boy's mother, awash in guilt and the object of her husband's blame and anger. As Andrew and a colorful bunch of Liberty Market associates track down the kidnapers, a warm friendship grows between Andrew and Alessia, who is recovering slowly from the shock of her own kidnaping. The scene in which Andrew and a partner rescue the boy in the middle of the night is one of the most suspenseful I have read.Again the mastermind of the kidnaps eludes the authorities. As Andrew and his colleagues continue to search for clues, a third kidnap occurs in Washington, D.C. where the president of the Jockey Club has traveled for a race (Alessia meanwhile is there too to ride in the race). Hot on the trail of the kidnaper, Andrew himself is snatched and handcuffed to a tree in a lonely grove. He manages to escape, and along with a sympathetic D.C. cop, closes in on the kidnaper, whose identity is a surprise to everyone.The Danger is a great read with masterful writing, appealing characters (especially Alessia who starts off irresistibly tender and vulnerable in the wake of her ordeal, and gradually blossoms into the racing champ with style she was on her way to becoming when the story began). There is a low-key romance between Alessia and Andrew that apparently will be consummated after the book closes. Alessia's recovery as a jockey is a subplot that moves alongside the suspense story. The human beings in this novel are intensely alive and sympathetic (except for the hateful crooks and a few like the father of Dominic, the kidnapped boy, though we assume that he has learned a lesson or two by story's end). The racing demimonde provides a colorful and glamorous backdrop for the action. A five-star read."},{"Title":"The Danger (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"My brother is perhaps the world's biggest Dick Francis fan, butto date, I have read little by the author who builds horse racinginto all his stories . . . however after listening to THE DANGER,I may well change my thinking.As noted in the book:* Kidnapping is a fact of life. Always has been, always will be.Extorting a ransom is an age-old pastime, less risky and more lucrativethan robbing banks.This thrilling novel centers around the work of Andrew Douglas,a partner in the firm of Liberty Market Ltd. whose job is both toadvise people at risk how to avoid kidnapping and, also, to helpnegotiate with kidnappers once a grab has taken place . . . theultimate goal is to get the victim back at the least possible cost.What I liked about THE DANGER was that you didn't haveto be a horse racing fan to enjoy it . . . thought that sportfeatures prominently in each of the kidnappings, it didn'tmatter if you knew little about the subject . . . you'll still be infor an exciting ride (pun intended) that will take you fromItaly to England to the United States."},{"Title":"The Danger (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Andrew Douglas recovers kidnapped victims and desperately tries to educate his clients as to how they can protect themselves.

Wodehouse stories, the innocents and the not-so-innocents attempt to solve tricky family problems with feats of misdirection and partial truths. The result of these complicated ruses is usually a great deal of unexpected consequences that will tickle almost any funny bone. Heavy Weather is an unusually fine example of this type of story.Monty Bodkin, who's rolling in dough, must hold a job for a year to win the approval of his fiancee's father. Then the wedding bells can chime. Monty isn't the most helpful fellow, and makes a hash out of his writing for Tiny Tots. He soon uses his uncle's influence a second time to get a new job as private secretary to Clarence, ninth Earl of Emsworth, whose pride and joy is his prize-winning pig, the Empress of Blandings.This new employment creates much consternation for Sue Brown, who is engaged to marry the jealous Ronnie Fish. Monty and Sue had been engaged earlier, and Sue's afraid that Ronnie won't be able to handle having Monty around. Wedding bells for Sue and Ronnie depend on getting Clarence to release trust funds for Ronnie. There are a few other problems, as well. For example, Sue earns her living as a chorus girl. What will Ronnie's mother, Lady Julia, think?The key theme of the story is that true love will win out, if the lovers follow their hearts and seize opportunity when it arises. In that way, the end will charm almost anyone . . . much like Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream does.In most stories like this, you can anticipate how the obstacles will be overcome. Well, Heavy Weather will surprise you, if you are like me. The plot complications and resolution are delightfully adept, acrobatic, and subtle. I felt like I was watching the elephants do their ballet dance again in Fantasia. The contradictions between the messy moments and the final neatness are brilliantly handled!The conflict between the desire to have a good reputation and the willingness to do whatever it takes to succeed (including cutting all possible corners) is shown off to good effect in Heavy Weather. Developing this point creates questions about what real goodness is, versus assumed goodness from social position and family connections. In fact, inherited intelligence is also questioned for its morality. The more powerful minds in the story tend to use those capabilities to plot for self-advantage, rather than to accomplish anything meaningful for all involved. Those of limited intelligence, by contrast, tend to follow their hearts and try to do the right thing.Good results follow in this story whenever people are loyal and honor goodness.What can you accomplish by being loyal and honoring goodness today? And tomorrow?"},{"Title":"Heavy Weather.","review":"Heavy WeatherSome humor is timeless. My father loved Wodehouse. I'd hear him in the living room laughing out loud, and catch him reading Wodehouse. Now, I hear my husband in the living room laughing out loud, reading Wodehouse.So I read this book. It is set in a timeless England, somewhen between the wars. The people Wodehouse writes about are archetypes, and are as familiar as the faces around my table at Thanksgiving. The situations are pure farce. I ask myself, how does this work?I think it's the language. No one writes like Wodehouse. His timing and word choices are unique.I invite you to sample a timeless classic that will never be a book you are proud to be caught reading, but will always be a friend that can cheer you up in the bleakest of weather.

To protect her reputation, I suspect Meredith took a lot of the scandal out of Diana's story--really, to the detriment of the book, since Caroline Norton had an extremely fascinating life. As a result, Meredith manages to make Diana's story uninteresting, to the point where I just didn't care much about the story or characters. It's too bad, because George Meredith has a lot of material to work from.Instead, he spends a lot of time in this book dissecting his main character and the motives for her decisions. Meredith also extracts a lot from the writing of \\"Diana,\\" which got a bit tedious after a while; and the book is overtly feminist in a lot of places (for example, at one point Meredith--not Meredith writing as Diana--predicts that one day women will be encouraged to have professions, which is no big deal nowadays but back then must have seemed preposterous). However, the novel highlights the position that women had in Victorian society, which is sometimes interesting. On the other hand, George Meredith's writing style is very, very hard to read, which is probably why this novel, and why this kind of novel, has become deeply unfashionable."},{"Title":"A Knight Of Ghosts And Shadows","review":"Anderson's recurring hero, Dominic Flandry, is like Horatio Hornblower, shown at different points of his career. In this, he is middle-aged, with a grown son...and in his final battle with a mind-reading foe from an elder race he has fought many times before. It is their final battle, and in it Flandry is not only betrayed, but goes through a self-betrayal of many of the principles he believes in. In this one, Flandry ceases to be a pleasure-loving, decadent Simon Templer, and instead shows true depth of character, and indeed, true tragedy, on several fronts. Easily the best of all the Flandry books, which is high praise indeed"},{"Title":"A Knight Of Ghosts And Shadows","review":"In \\"A Knight of Ghosts and Shadows,\\" Poul Anderson did the nearly impossible and unthinkable before this book. He managed to get Dominic Flandry to grow up.Before this book, Flandry, while a brilliant secret agent for the Terran Empire, always was a bit juvenile, and reveled in it. He figured that if he was going to die soon anyway (as secret agents rarely live long lives), why not make the best of it? So, he slept with many lissome women, ate lots of good food, and drank lots of great liquor along the way.His other attributes, of loyalty, self-sacrifice, intelligence, a certain type of shifty honesty unusual in a secret agent -- well, they always were underplayed, partly because Flandry was an interstellar James Bond and that might not have been \\"sexy,\\" and partly because Flandry looked at them as bad qualities.Well, no wonder. The Terran Empire was in decay, and only people like him were holding it together, before the advent of this book. At the start of this book, Hans Molitor has seized the throne -- with Flandry's blessing, as at least he was a strong military man, and as he was better than any of the other contenders for the throne. And trouble's brewing all over the Empire . . . .Without the trouble, there's no way Flandry would have been able to go off on his own. He's now in his 40s, and although he's still an international bon vivant, he's not the same man he used to be. He's found out he has a son, Dominic Hazeltine, by Persis D'Io (the dancer in \\"Ensign Flandry), and he's starting to perhaps slow down a bit in his travels.But his mind is as keen as ever, so when an exotic, aristocratic slave girl from Dennitza shows up, his interest is piqued. The more he finds out, the more upset he gets. Then, he flits off with her, to find out the truth -- which is more shattering than he ever expected.He does run into Aycharaych again, but it's almost more of an afterthought. Because before this book is done, his life stands in ruin, and about all he has left is his honor, pride, and a job well done -- rather than the life he'd briefly glimpsed in the eyes of Kossara, the Dennitzan slave girl (who never should have been sold for slavery).As he destroys Aycharaych, he realizes that nothing, but nothing, can bring back love -- and wonders what's next for him. These are astonishingly adult thoughts for Flandry, and extremely moving.This book deserves over five stars because of how moving and heart-wrenching it is for Flandry to go through all this. I truly believed in his pain, while enjoying his witty repartee with Chives (his Shalmuan body-servant/cook/batman/everything), Kossara, and son Dominic. Flandry is no intellectual lightweight, and he really does have a heart. Excellent book; truly one of Anderson's best (and I've read most of his output).Btw, \\"A Stone in Heaven\\" is also another great book about Flandry in his age -- I recommend that one, too, extremely highly."},{"Title":"A Knight Of Ghosts And Shadows","review":"It's amazing what a slight shift in venue can do. For those who have been following the Flandry adventures in their rough order, there's not a huge amount of difference between the very first one and the ones that make up the middle sequences. In his first story we get to watch him learn how to be Flandry, and then once he hits his stride he tends to coast on that in all the subsequent stories. He wants to wine and dine, the Long Night is constantly looming and Mersians are around every corner trying to make the Empire cave in on itself. What's a man to do when all he wants to do is wear some stylin' clothes? Despite all the serious espionaging going on, there's sometimes an oddly frivolous sense to these affairs, that both he and the Mersians are just going through their paces, confronting each other with bizarre death traps and scenarios to see who can blink first. Flandry schemes his way about of just another one and with a sigh heads off to find the next lovely woman or delicious meal.But sometimes the stories cut a little bit deeper. It's that heavier philosophical foundation, a little more self-reflection, that mark the very good Flandry stories from the merely decent ones. \\"Ensign Flandry\\" is one, if only because its the innovator. \\"The Rebel Worlds\\" is another, showing what happens when Flandry decides to get as serious as the universe around him, and quits playing around. The stark inevitability of it all feels realer, the stakes slightly higher.This is one of the better ones. We have an abrupt shift into the Latter Days of Flandry, where suddenly our old friend has a son (probably more than one, the book realistically admits, as Flandry is a fan of the ladies and there's rarely time to ponder about birth control . . . fortunately the future doesn't seem to have a way to compel child support) and a weight about him as he tries to avoid going on more missions, convinced that he's done all he can and further action isn't going to save anyone, the Long Night is coming and he's going to enjoy himself. Pity that duty is such a strong concept for him.And so he's dragged on again, caught in yet another attempt by the Mersians to craft a revolution on another world and thus destabilize things further. All this would seem so routine if Anderson didn't make it seem all so final. Flandry seems to know going in that this is going to be his last major adventure and not only is there a sense of tidying up and clearing out loose ends, but Anderson is willing to push his character further than he has before. If this means making Flandry fall in love, then so be it, but the consequences wind up being high, and for once Flandry isn't playing around. A lot of the previous Flandry tales centered around the same status quo, where Flandry was unable to change anything but managed to hold off the Long Night for just one more day. Here, the Long Night may still be coming but he's going to make sure that some people aren't going to be around to see it.That's where this one works for me. It may be slightly gimmicky in that sense, The One Where All the Big Stuff Happens, but after reading story after entertaining story with limited progression in the character or the setting, to have reached that stage where we can watch Anderson clear out the stuff that has outlived its usefulness is bracing in its way. Flandry crosses a line we didn't think he would cross and he does it so coldly that you almost miss how brutal it is. Then he follows up that act with one equally shocking, with the air of a man who's realized that he's devolved to the point where he's starting to derive personal satisfaction from what he can inflict, while simultaneously understanding that there's nothing to enjoy in this anymore. That's where Anderson succeeds, taking the scenario to its logical conclusion. We've seen arch-enemy Aycharaych and Flandry circle each other numerous times now, with neither gaining any ground. Here's ground gained forever.Interestingly, I wonder if Anderson would have drawn parallels to today with Flandry. In their actions, the Mersians are often very polite terrorists, wanting to bring everything crashing down in the name of expansion, while the decadent Empire blunders on heedless, left to men like Flandry to keep the edges together. Anderson wrote this in the mid-seventies. Published today, it could be commentary, but back then it was merely paperback entertainment.Yet, and this is where the book gains a lot of its power . . . for all the Big Stuff that occurs here, it means nothing in the long run. If the Flandry books have any magic for us in the annals of SF, it's that simultaneous ability to focus on both the long run and the personal. We feel for Flandry both as a man all too human in its delights and failings and pains, and we also feel for him as a man born in the wrong time, destined not to enjoy the fruits of exploration like David Falkayn, or even the Empire at its glorious height. Through no one's fault but fate, he gets to see just enough of the Empire to know how awesome it was, and clutch what he can of its rotting fruit before the whole artifice crumbles into oblivion. It's a rare skill for a series to combine both, even series that attempt to define that sweep require multiple characters and volumes (or just go for the big cosmic picture a la every Olaf Stapleton book, \\"Star Maker\\" especially), reminding how glorious it is to be alive but also never letting us forget that history is not on our side. It's that intersection that comes right at the end, doing what needs to be done even though you're fully aware it won't stop what's coming, but too angry to care. He acts with vengeance, and if such things are often lost in the tumble of history, that doesn't make those moments any less visceral when they happen, for Flandry or us. In here lies a man who lives in the moment, with an eye toward where we're all heading, and beyond. It's at this point that I think I finally appreciated how rare he is, and how necessary."},{"Title":"A Knight Of Ghosts And Shadows","review":"Part of the Imperial Terra series, which takes place after thePolysotechnic League, Dominic Flandry is an agent of Naval Intelligenceduring the last days of the Empire.

Your leadership team is sitting in all day meeting discussing the vision of the future for your company or a new initiative. By the end of the day, everybody is in agreement and consensus about the direction or plan. Everybody nods his or her head and expresses how valuable the day has been. And then you all go home, and think what a waste of time that day really was. Sound familiar? In When You Say Yes But Mean No Leslie Perlow, in her role of corporate culture anthropologist, examines the reasons behind this and other similar situations when the true source of differences in opinion is never expressed. This lack of understanding is highly detrimental to both the company and its employees.Perlow's empirical research for the book is focused on companies that were born in the high growth, high stakes games of the dot com era, where corporate culture formation and working relationships are accelerated, and is reminiscent of the way a scientist uses fruit flies to study lifecycles. Her findings are directly applicable to larger, mature corporations, and ManyWorlds, in its work with large clients has often seen the scenarios presented.The \`Silent Spiral' is the term given to the systematic silencing of differences that people feel is appropriate. Voicing differences is often felt to be wrong, not being a \`teamplayer' or not playing by the rules of the game. Not speaking up, though Perlow argues, sends us on a spiral of destructive emotions, making employees feel their opinions are not valued, killing their creativity and not giving feedback that is direly needed for the good of the company.In part, this spiraling is due to the sense of urgency that pervades today's society and corporations. The author says we often bite our tongue, thinking to ourselves, \`we just need to get on with it. We don't have time to worry about it now.' A \`lack of input and hasty deliberations that can lead to an inferior decision-making process and to less potential for creativity and learning.'So how to escape the silent spiral? Perlow suggests the approach of \`seeking mutual understanding' and illustrates this through copious scenarios to demonstrate the nuances to what might seem an easily dismissable technique. By seeking the reasons why another person may have a different opinion, it is possible to uncover \`the core issues in important relationships.' In the words of Steven Covey, \`seek first to understand and then to be understood.' If you can fully appreciate the gravitas and implications of these words, then you have the knowledge to stop the spiral. But the best way to defeat the silent spiral is to understand why, how and where it occurs, which Leslie Perlow deftly demonstrates in this articulate and clear work. Recommended reading for all managers and executives who recognize the importance of subtext in meetings and cultures, and this book would be an excellent starting and talking point on the journey to establishing mutual understanding."},{"Title":"When You Say Yes but Mean No: How Silencing Conflict Wrecks Relationships and Companies... and What You Can Do About It","review":"Leslie Perlow s When You Say Yes but Mean No is that rarest of breeds: a business book that not only sheds light on a critical management problem, but proposes concrete and workable solutions while being engaging and readable to boot.She loads her text with sharp anecdotes perfectly illustrating her thesis on the value of constructive conflict and the importance of dissenting opinion. Her examination of the rise and eventual downfall of a startup provides a clear and comprehensive illustration of the problem of silenced conversation which, in the next section, she lays out a plan for fixing. Regardless of industry or function, every businessperson will find themselves and their own experiences in these pages and nod enthusiastically in agreement with its conclusions.A first-rate examination of a problem all managers experience but few have the insight much less the tools to go about solving. A must-read for anyone willing to create effective communications within their organization once and for all and move From Good to Great ."},{"Title":"Early Christian art in Ireland,","review":"This work is somewhat dated but still interesting for those interested in an introduction to early Irish Christian art. All the art work in the book are pencil drawings from Mrs. Stokes herself. Some of them are quite excellent. For a better (though more expensive) introduction the OUP New History of Ireland Volume 1 is a better option.

Then, that which does focuses on African-American men, and sometimes Latino men. Thus, Chan's book is a direly needed intervention. The book focuses upon Chinese-American men, but it is applicable to Asian-Ams of many ethnicities. This book would be a wonderful edition to any collection of Asian-American studies texts or works on men of color. Chan has two projects. First, he discusses the history and racist underpinnings of four Chinese-Am men in popular culture of this century: Fu Manchu, Charlie Chan, Bruce Lee, and Shiang-Chi. Second, Chan is trying to formulate a Chinese-American masculinity that is neither sexist nor homophobic. He thus encourages &quot;ambi-sexuality&quot; and borrows the idea of &quot;democratic manhood&quot; from Michael Kimmel. My only critique of this text is that it did not have photos of the characters Chan examines. (I mean, I have heard of Charlie Chan, but I've never seen any of the decades-old films that use him.) In brief, if you enjoyed what Lisa Lowe said about Asian-American women in &quot;Immigrant Acts&quot;, you will really love what Chan says about male counterparts in this book. Many readers may be turned off by the deeply academic, and some might say overly &quot;PC&quot; lingo that the author employs. Still, I think every Chinese-American man should own this book. I am very pleased that I bought and read this book; it's brilliant!"},{"Title":"Chinese American Masculinities: From Fu Manchu to Bruce Lee (Studies in Asian Americans)","review":"Let me preface my review by stating my interest in this book was the author's interpetation of the Fu Manchu character. Overall, this was a good book on an important topic that receives scant attention: prejudice against Asians. The Fu Manchu character, like most fiction from Colonial Britain, has racist elements. However, the author is not sufficiently familiar with the work of the character's creator, Sax Rohmer. Rohmer loved what was then called the Orient. His heroines are Oriental. Fu Manchu is depicted as a genius and a man of integrity at all times. Later books in the series (Rohmer wrote of the character from 1912 to 1959) depict him not as evil, but as devoted to a cause often (but not always) at odds to the West. The rise of Communism in China is at cross-purposes to Fu Manchu's ambitions and the last few books see the character more on the side of the Western protagonists in defeating their common enemy. What is more, Fu Manchu was part of a tradition (owing much to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Professor Moriarity and Sherlock Holmes) of villains and heroes with veiled admiration for one another and who would clearly unite if not for their divisive principles. The author seems to be reacting more to the hackneyed portrayal of the character in film and television adaptations (which are far from faithful to Rohmer's text). Case-in-point, the infamous Fu Manchu moustache which the author emphasizes as a racial stereotype is not the invention of the character's creator who described Fu Manchu as devoid of facial hair in all thirteen novels and four shorter works that he appeared in. Even in the earliest, most racially insensitive books, Rohmer was quick to note that most Chinese immigrants were law-abiding citizens. The harmful stereotype that sprung from the character developed seperately from the writer who loved all things Eastern and wanted to share that love with his readers the world over."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"The author manages to evoke gut wrenching emotions she tellsthe tale of a young Alaskan woman,Kate, who seems to attract ill fortune wherever she goes.Filled with baited suspense, a hint of humour, some actionand a touch of romance, Dana has you &quot;eating out of her hand&quot; beforelong."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"On page 260 you mention one of the most beloved pastors I have ever known, casting him in a bad light for saying abortion is murder. I have not seen him for years, but he was always a person of real intelligence, grace, integrity, and compassion. Does the unborn have intrinsic value? Does the unborn child deserve rights of protection? Does human life have value??? Pastor Prevo would say it does. Why? Because we are created in God's image. Also the abortionist is a person of value made in God's image and Pastor Prevo would never endorse in any way killing an abortionist...and he makes that clear. This excerpt in your book which I read here online does not give enough context for me to know how you will resolve the situations in your book. I hope it is not just a rant against religion...that the character on page 260 is not speaking for your own views. Since I don't know and am not going to buy it and read it I will end my comments."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"I received this item promptly and in good condition. Dana Stabenow is a good mystery writer."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"This is one of the best in Dana Stabenow's Kate Shugak series. The intrepid Aleut detective, while looking for wild mushrooms in a recently burned-out forest, stumbles upon the body of a man who proves to be the son of an ultrafundamentalist preacher whose sect has pretty much taken over an isolated local community. Kate discovers that the dead man, a teacher, had been teaching the schoolchildren about such &quot;evil&quot; subjects as dinosaurs, woolly mammoths and evolution. &quot;Play With Fire&quot; is an engrossing mystery that deals with the perils of fanaticism. It's enlivened by vividly portrayed characters, interesting and thought-provoking dialogue, evocative descriptions of Alaskan landscapes and cultures, and plenty of humor."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"I don't like this author much but this particular book was not too bad. It deals with censorship and fanatics in a wilderness community."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"I'm a big fan of the Kate Shugak series and thought Hunter's Moon was one of the best page turners in a long while. It inspired me to go back to some of her earlier novels. The good news is that Stabenow gets better with time. The bad news is that some of the early stuff is pretty weak. The basic problem with this book is that there isn't much mystery. A man goes missing for ten months and no one reports it? When found, his body is naked and he's died from mosquito bites. He's the son of the local fundamentalist minister. 300 pages later we find out who killed him.The basic problem with this book is that for every page that moves the plot forward, Stabenow includes ten essentially irrelevant pages. The ramblings range from entertaining (does musak justify homicide?) to tedious (an encyclopedia excerpt on mushrooms) to touching (Kate's memories of going to college). There's much discussion on religion and education. These are two topics of interest to me so I didn't mind that they were mostly off topic. Other readers may be justifiably less tolerant.Bottom-line: Many musings and not much mystery. Stabenow can do(and has done)better."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"In this book, Kate Shugak finds a body while picking mushrooms. It turns out to be the body of a person who has been missing for quite awhile, but whose father never reported him missing.Kate is always arrogant with her beliefs, but this book really goes too far. I fully agree with Dana Stabenow's views on religious fundamental extremists. However, she goes too far when she starts trashing all religion and people who believe in them.I really liked Kate's remembrances of her first year of college and of the professor who turned her on to literature. But none of this makes up for all her preaching against religion, people from other states, people who listen to different music, etc.The mystery itself is unsatisfying, too. I agree with the other reviewer who lamented the lack of suspects, red herrings, etc."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"Before reading this book I'd read several others in her Kate Shugak series and loved most of them (\\"A Grave Denied\\" being my favorite so far). Although from time to time I'd pick up on the author's own evident biases, I was able to overlook them because the characters were interesting and the plots often riveting. However, I was quite taken aback by the unabashed proselytizing in this book. According to the author, you'd think all Christians are fanatics, all midwesterners rednecks (in its most sterotyped form), and all people living below the Mason-Dixon line intellectually challenged racists. You can find any of these types of people anywhere in the world, but Ms. Stabenow would seem to harbor some deep psychological hatred against these particular groups. I found myself rushing through these particular passages (of which there are WAY too many) to try to get back to the plot, such as it was. Honestly, at times I nearly forgot what the actual plot was. I'm hoping whatever demons Ms. Stabenow had were purged in this book and she gets back to doing what she does best -- development of strong and interesting characters and fast-paced plots, interwoven with fascinating segues into Alaskan history, culture and geography. And Mutt the Superdog, one of the most endearing canines in all of current fiction! Everyone needs a Mutt of their very own!"},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"I have enjoyed several of the Kate Shugak mysteries. This isn't one of them. This seemed less of a mystery novel and more of an attempt to promote her ideas on religion in general and strict biblical faiths in particular. It isn't that I don't support Dana Stabenow's opinions on fanatical religions. However, her views are as distorted as are those of whom she describes. As a previous reviewer stated, you might consider skipping this particular novel in the series."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"Dana Stabenow writes good mysteries so this book was a surprising disappointment. There is no mystery, barely even an attempt to write one. There is only one suspect, a group of people the author doesn't like, and that's who did it. No red herrings, no other suspects. What kind of a mystery is that? If you do read it, be prepared to be beaten over the head with the author's prejudices on nearly every page. Skip this book and read some of her actual mysteries. I've read four others so far and liked them all."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"Ordinarily I very much enjoy the Kate Shugak series for its beautiful and detailed descriptions of Alaska's geography and culture. Usually these books are populated with quirky people, all of whom have interesting secrets and almost all of whom the reader cheers on. The mysteries themselves may not always be deep, but generally they are intriguing and somehow linked to Alaska's traditions.But Play With Fire was a major disappointment. The bashing of Christianity was peurile, offensive, and stereotypical with not an ounce of nuance to moderate a viewpoint that seems to come straight from today's headlines. In these books, Shugak is always depicted as a thoughtful and intelligent woman who thinks for herself and appreciates many viewpoints. Not so in this book. After she has her conversation with the aging university professor about evangelical Christianity, she thinks to herself that she is \\"so glad she had this conversation\\". But there is no nothing in that conversation that we haven't seen untutored TV pundits scream at each other! After reading that chapter I said to myself \\"That's it? Christians are haters, think only of themselves, and want to kill you if you don't agree with them?\\"Interesting writing about mushrooms, and Jack is a dreamboat, but this is one Shugak book that is headed for the recycling bin."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"If you like Stabenow and you like Kate Shugak, don't let the reviews scare you off! Yes -- Stabenow takes on creationism and fanatical christians. Do you really think that an Alaska Native, like Kate, would find such beliefs appealing?The story is interesting and the glimpses into what makes Kate tick will please devoted Stabenow fans."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"Like other reveiwers, I actually like Stabenow. Her Kate Shugak series, which I am currently reading through, is fun and inviting and gives you a glimpse of the last frontier from a insider perspective. While the main antagonist, Kate Shugak can be a bit preachy and opinionated, she did seem mostly fair, and the plots usually revolve around her solving some murder with that being the main focus of the story. This story was awful. It started out odd, what with all the quotes about mushrooms and having Kate and Bobby pick up a stray who is constantly quoting the bible for no apparent reason. The murder itself was a not very interesting plot device for the unabashed proselytizing that hijacks the rest of the book.It struck me as really odd that this book celebrates the religion of the Native population while sterotyping almost everyone else in the lower 48 - city dwellers, rednecks and Christians all get heavy-handed treatments that read like caricatures of Americans from some Communist country during cold war. There was no mystery in the mystery, the characters were all one-dimensional cutouts and the preaching had me skipping ahead on my Kindle. DRIVEL."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"Dana Stabenow takes her religious predjudices and slaps the reader in the face with them in \\"Play With Fire\\". I have read, and enjoyed, her other books. This book has very little plot and is poorly written. Maybe instead of bashing religion, Dana should have focused on writing a readable story. This book has already been deleted off of my IPad."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"The plot in this fifth entry in the wonderful Kate Shugak series is light on mystery, but as with every book so far, provides the most fascinating glimpses into Native Alaskan lore.Kate has forayed into the remains of a massive forest fire to pick mushrooms, which are springing up everywhere in the lush loam left behind by the charred trees and undergrowth. It's back-breaking work, but highly lucrative, and Kate is joined by her paraplegic Vietnam Vet friend Bobby, and his new lover, a bright-eyed young photographer named Dinah, whose enthusiasm wins Kate over.It is while Kate and Dinah are hard at work at picking (Kate) and snapping (Dinah) that Kate makes a nauseating and horrific discovery: Under a particularly lush growth of mushrooms lies a badly decomposing body. Kate's subsequent inquiry into the identity of the victim and the manner of his death leads her into a mosquitos' nest (literally) of dangerously unstable religious fanatics. It's a situation that doesn't sit well with Kate as a professional PI, or with Kate as a native Aleut, with religious views quite different than those espoused by the narrow-minded group who are opposing her investigation.Another fine, fast read in the series; highly recommended, as always."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"I started reading Dana Stabenow in a short story. Thought she was interesing, read two more novels then came to Play with Fire. Man I almost couldn't stomach this drivel. I had three other books in her series but didn't even touch them. They went straight back to the library. We as Americans are allowed to have our own views of religion but this really goes to far. But then again I could do just exactly what I did and not read them. So if you are reading this and even remotely believe in God (how could you not if you have ever been to Alaska) then don't read this book or it will really piss you off. All she came across is narrow minded, simple minded and hateful."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"I have read most, maybe all, of Dana Stabenow's Kate Shugak books, and this one was just as good as all the rest.

Her characters point out how many people have been murdered in the name of religion, a fact for sure, but she doesn't mention how many more millions are killed in the name of non-religion, communists like Mao and Stalin, not to mention Hitler. It's not even a close comparison at all, but again I guess Stabenow is too lazy to look at the facts.All in all I like her writing although of course it's all fantasy what Kate gets herself out of but then this book was boring throughout, from start to finish with a dud of an ending."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"I have liked all in this series up to this one. The subject matter (fanatic religionists) wasn't my cup of tea. And then the fact that in the end nothing was done about it was strange. I say skip this one and go on to the next. I haven't yet but it will most likely be better than Play With Fire."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"This is a great series, I have looked forward to each book,I've learned so much about alaska. Lots of little things you do not find in travel books."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"I have read all the previous Kate Shugak mysteries and enjoyed them very much. I read the reviews for this one before I bought it. The reviews caused me to think it might be boring because it held little mystery.I was not bored at all. Although I guessed the solution early on it didn't interfere with my enjoyment of following Kate's interactions with the other characters - friends and family that we met in previous books as well as the new people and situations occurring here. We learn more about Kate's past and more about Bobby, Jack, and Chopper Jim. We meet Kate's Auntie Joy for the first time. I was thoroughly captivated and more than once kept reading longer than I meant to at bedtime.The setting of this book is potentially a difficult one to read about. It involves fundamentalist Christians who are Creationists, issues raised about the teaching of Evolution in school, sex education and several other fundamentalist beliefs. This particular sect seems to be more extreme than some. If these issues do bother you, from either a yea or nay viewpoint, you might want to pass on this book unless you really care about the backstory of Kate and her friends and family."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"Another chilling story of life in a harsh, beautiful environment. The plot is intriguing, but what really beguiles is the gritty, intelligent, wild Kate Shugak and Dana Stabenow's talent in bringing us right into the landscape, letting us all become Alaskans for a time. The writing is visual and clips along, the supporting cast memorable and empathetic. Kate's world stays in my mind long after the book is finished. Stabenow can't write fast enough for me."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"I enjoyed Play with Fire from the start to the finish. Her discription of mushroom picking in a burned over area is right on! Also, I fully agree with stand on religions, and think she made some very good points about persons who decided they know what beliefs everyone else should hold to. In my humble opinion she has taken a brave stand against the zealots."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"It is unfortunate that Ms. Stabenow has written a polemic instead of a novel. Her assault on religion, particularly Christianity, overtakes any plot or character development. This is truly a shame since some of her novels are actually quite good. But not this one."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"Kate Shugak is getting more and more arrogant and more dislikable. The mystery seems insignificant in comparison to Stabenow's seeming need to preach. The book is about 100 pages longer than her previous books and most of it can be attributed the preaching arrogance of the main character, Kate Shugak. Her arrogance and high-mindness are a real turnoff. For example, she disses all people in organized religion as not being able to think for themselves, declares all states that end in a vowel to be redneck states, disses all music that she doesn't like, and if someone isn't enjoying the outdoors in the manner that she doesn't see fit they really don't deserve to be outside. It is all just a little too much for me! This will be my last Kate Shugak mystery. (As an aside, the love angles are just a little 8th-grade for me."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"Dana Stabenow takes you right into the Alaskan Bush and makes you feel the mosquitos and gaze in awe at the scenery.

She has to be, as much as she chooses to go it alone. And, usually, that makes the character more interesting. In this book, however, it's just BORING! Reading an actual treatise on picking mushrooms might have been more interesting. The reader is certainly clear as to Kate's (the author's?) views on religion and education. Unfortunately, the mystery doesn't just take a backseat -- it was left by the side of the road somewhere. My advice, FWIW, is to read any other book in this or the Liam Campbell series."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I read some of the other Dana Stabenow's books and they weren't bad but this one was very unlikable. Most of the book was spent talking badly about religion. I have many friends that love God and they are the people I would go to in times of trouble. I hope Dana Stabenow gets back to writing mysteries."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"I'm a great admirer of Dana Stabenow's and was pleased when some of these earlier books in the Kate Shugak series became available for the Kindle at such attractive prices. Her works generally combine a lively, intriguing and fast-paced plot line with interesting characters, all set against the amazing backdrop of America's last true wilderness. The land itself becomes almost one of the characters in each story.Unfortunately, none of this praise seems to be applicable to \\"Play With Fire.\\"If you are just beginning to explore this author's work, please consider starting with another book. This one is more of a \\"bully pulpit\\" for the author's opinions about religion (she's against it), visitors to the North (we are all uniformly stupid, drunk, and devoid of any sense), and even small dogs (they are yipping rats). Scene after heavy-handed scene explores these--well, I'll call them prejudices--and we are only occasionally afforded a glimpse of the unfolding story, which centers around a missing father, a dead body found a year after a major forest fire, a young child, and an isolated community of religious cult members. The pieces and parts are all there, but they're tough to discern between the boring, poorly executed sermonettes.If you happen not to be a resident of Alaska (and I am not), or if you adhere to any of the planet's organized religions, or if you happen to live in an apartment where only small dogs are permitted and so have forged ties of affection with your Yorkie, I urge you not to be insulted by the author's poor regard for you. You will undoubtedly enjoy any number of her other works. Just overlook this one."},{"Title":"Play With Fire","review":"Stabenow has an interesting setting to write about, the main reason to read the books. I was annoyed with Kate when she profited from the bear gall bladders in an earlier book, and almost did not go back to read more. This book, with its lack of resolution, and the weight of death loaded onto a child's shoulders, the failure to make an attempt to bring justice (though it may seem pointless), the failure to close the door when two men she is close to are aware of what she is doing (Jack and the Trooper) and will expect closure all lead one to feel that she could not find an ending that was satisfactory.I will keep trying though.

The same qualities that marked him as a correspondent--courtesy, graciousness, and gentle humor--illuminate this lovely memoir of a great historian.Catton grew up in Benzonia, Michigan, &quot;a city upon a hill,&quot; as he correctly notes, very close to Lake Michigan, where the old certitudes held seemingly invincible sway over virtually every aspect of one's daily life. Catton's father was the superintendent of Benzonia Academy, whose main building is now Benzonia's library.The memoir, which recalls the years between the author's birth and his graduation from high school, is a series of reflections on what it was like to be a boy just as Michigan's logging era was drawing to a close, when sleepy Benzonia, along with the rest of the nation, was about to drift into the maw of the violent twentieth century. Catton writes of boyhood ambitions and boyish pranks, of the rich history that made Michigan's Lower Peninsula what it was, and especially of the Civil War veterans whose stories would later prompt Catton to devote years of his life to recording the history of that great conflict in rich anecdotal detail.Though unabashedly nostalgic, &quot;Waiting for the Morning Train&quot; is neither saccharine nor bitter. Catton was far too experienced a writer and historian to let his emotions get the better of him. This is, nonetheless, a rich and moving memoir of a time which, though it may seem virtually within reach, we will never see again.I recommend this book highly as a gift for yourself and, perhaps, for that reflective friend who can appreciate personal history told with universal appeal. Bruce Catton was, quite simply, one of the greatest writers and historians this country has produced, and in many ways this deceptively modest little volume represents the zenith of his literary achievement."},{"Title":"Waiting for the morning train : an American boyhood","review":"My interest in Waiting for the Morning Train lay not so much with Bruce Catton's being a giant of Civil War literature, but rather with his subject: Benzonia, Michigan, the place at which my family has taken vacation for decades (and where several family members now permanently reside). I could see the waters of Crystal Lake, the snow-covered hills of Beulah and Benzonia, and the lush birch, maple and pine forests of Northern Michigan as Catton knew them in his youth. Readers of Waiting for the Morning train will not only catch a glimpse of the spark that ignited Catton's pasion for the Civil War, but more importantly the story of a land that, if one tries hard enough, one will still find. Catton's boyhood stomping grounds come alive with tales of logging, weary travel by train and the fits of small towns being brought into a more modern era. The subtitle is An American Boyhood, and in Catton's childhood memoirs the reader will not only witness Catton's growth to manhood, but also the nation's emergence from adolecence to adulthood."},{"Title":"Waiting for the morning train : an American boyhood","review":"Bruce Catton, winner of the Pulitzer, National Book Award and Presidential Medal of Freedom writes a little know memoir of his childhood of listening to the Civil War veterans tell tales of their Battery from Michigan that fought in the most famous battles in the War Between the States. How he was able to develop an almost transendent ability the listen and record in the far reaches of his sub conciousness the words and deeds that were told to him is remarkable. He would use the stories when he finally decided to put them down in his famous books that he didn't start until he was nearly at the age of fifty. But the book is also a statement on how the world has become a bunch of &quot;Babbits&quot; who put the motorcar above everything else. The metaphor he uses is the Mackinaw Bridge which was built in the late 50s to connect the Upper Penninsula to the lower so people would not have to wait in line for the ferry. Kafka said, &quot;Because of impatience we were tossed out of Eden and because of impatience we can never return.&quot; Ironically Mackinac Island allows no cars and gets half a million plus tourists in the summer, where Maui has the finest weather in the world but no public transportation because people can't deal with the inconvience. Catton was very presient on this. The world finds itself in a place where we can't roll back to a slower time and now people want to drive tanks in the form of off road Vans. This book is also very readable and fun and in the intro his brother calls it his best book."},{"Title":"Waiting for the morning train : an American boyhood","review":"Bruce Catton made a name for himself writing some of the most comprehensive books on the Civil War. As an educator and writer, his career will forever be viewed by formal academic standards. However, in Waiting for the Morning Train, the formalities and objectivity are swept away, and we are left with a wonderful story of a boy growing up in rural Northern Michigan. He captures a moment in time, not only in the historical sense, but also from the perspective of a young man coming of age. He substitutes facts and discipline with observations and thoughts, and along the way, creates what is my favorite piece of his work."},{"Title":"Waiting for the morning train : an American boyhood","review":"The author's most famous work is the landmark Civil War book: \\"A Stillness at Appomattox\\". But this relatively unknown little book is unquestionably his very Best work.If you are a teenager who suspects there are some things the \\"grown-ups\\" aren't telling you... if you are a 40-something who is starting to wonder if the World has lost its' mind... if you are a 60-something who KNOWS the World has lost its' mind... if you are a 90-something who thinks you have been kidnapped to a different planet... you will enjoy this book.If you are a city person or a country person...if you were educated in college or at work... if you like dogs, or money, or music, or ice cream... if you are a boy or a girl, a man or a woman... you will enjoy this book.It is an excellent seven page \\"Forward\\" by the author's son and then two hundred and fifty-three pages - each of which will reach inside you all the way to your very essence.I can think of no better book to read especially in these strange and frightful times."},{"Title":"Waiting for the morning train : an American boyhood","review":"I found this book on the coffee table of a friend in northern Michigan. I started to read a few pages of it, and within an hour I knew that I was going to buy it when I got home. The author tells the tale in a way thatyou don't hear your own voice as you read, but the author himself. He tellsa story with some political commentary, but you understand the issues from his perspective as he proceeds. He begins at about 1900 and moves to about World War 1. Many anecdotes about the Civil War as well. I perceived some current event relevance that are note worthy, (he who does not remember the past is doomed to repeat it). All in all a very pleasant book to sit down and read to relax."},{"Title":"Waiting for the morning train : an American boyhood","review":"This book is generally considered a memoir of growing up in rural northern Michigan in the early 1900's, and it is; but it is also a lament for the 20th century. Catton contrasts the optimism of the America of his youth--its faith in progress and in the future, its belief that Americans could solve any problem with hard work, right thinking, and the guidance of Divine Providence--with the reality of national and world events that transpired from World War I through the Viet Nam era.The mood of the book is reflective and even melancholy at times. I felt Catton was a concerned and discouraged man as he wrote this. He saw unlimited technological power as a frightening development and he had little faith in the ability of America or humankind in general to exhibit self-discipline in the use of such power.It's a very thought-provoking book, and extremely relevant to today's world even 35 years after publication."},{"Title":"Waiting for the morning train : an American boyhood","review":"I'd been trying to locate this book for some time and was pleased to find it since it's been out of print since 1987 (This was the only new copy I could find, which was important because it was a gift)...Delivery was in a timely manner & book was reasonably priced all things considered.I'd recommend this seller to all!"},{"Title":"Waiting for the morning train : an American boyhood","review":"Bruce Catton was born in 1899 in Bezonia, Mich., a town of about 300 people then and now.

The book ends when Catton goes to college. It is a pleasant book to read, since Catton is a fine writer.

Granted, you have to be a true fan of Jaguar racing cars, Le Mans, but it is a rich publication. As a lifelong model car builder, this is a wonderful source of photos and details that I use regularly."},{"Title":"Jaguar at LeMans 1950-1995","review":"To any lifelong Jaguar buff, the name LeMans has magical connotations and Paul Parker's book is quite simply the best that is currently available on Jaguar's legendary association with that hallowed race.One particularly welcome feature of the book is how each year and it's events have their own individual chapters, from 1950 all the way to 1995. The two appendixes listing Jaguar's drivers and the second listing the cars and their drivers by year are also most welcome.My only regret about \\"Jaguar at Le Mans\\" is that there were not any more color photos to illustrate the 1850s and 60s, instead of just the 80s and 90s races, this however is only a minor complaint in an otherwise superlative book. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate it an 8 or 9 and only the lack of more color photography keeps it from being a 10. Despite this, \\"Jaguar at Le Mans\\" is a must -have for any Jguar racing buff. I heartily recomend it. Peter A.

I'm a minister and use it as a resource for sermon ideas or brief readings within a sermon. I'm so glad I was able to get a copy."},{"Title":"Worldwords: Global Reflections to Awaken the Spirit","review":"Words are those independent sounds expressing meaning. Worldwide, humanity has developed its own unique set of words to convey the deepest meaning expressed in their souls as well as the external world. Language is the vehicle or system by which humanity communicates with one another through words. Worldwords are collections of the human family's words that awaken us to consciousness and responsibility for ourselves and our neighbors.Language like anything else goes through periods of becoming extinct like many of the world's animal species and plants. Loss of these words means loss of meaning that can no longer be easily recovered. In appreciation for the beauty and meaning of words' expressions, Worldwords was formed as a celebration of humanity's vehicle to strengthen their lives.Each day of the month has a word from a different culture. A pronunciation guide is given, its origins and a brief meaning followed by a commentary regarding the use of the word for our lives. At the very end is a brief inspirational sentence. Included is a list of the words and a lovely bibliography. Each word calls us to reflect upon it. Many express concepts that are not easy to translate in English but carry profound meanings for our lives. Through meditating on these diverse words, you will become inspired and energized."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Japan","review":"A History Of Modern Japan dates back to 1960, but taken in the context of a 1,500 year-old civilization and culture fifty years is a negligible interlude. Nevertheless, some of the grammar and expressions in the book are somewhat anachronistic. Some twenty pages into the book though it turns into smooth sailing and from there author Richard Storry offers a compelling, interesting and improbably comprehensive digest of the history of the \`Land Of The Rising Sun' from the earliest fables right up to the 1960s.The story begins when a god and goddess give birth to what is Japan. Many Manchurian, Korean and Malay immigrants arrived and displaced the original inhabitants, known as the Ainu, from the Southwest of Japan. After much attempt to conquer and hold Korea and parts of modern China fail - as did the Mongols' two attempted invasions of Japan courtesy of \`divine winds' - Japan turns inwards gradually with the Western and Eastern customs increasingly being considered offensive. The local Shogun controlled local feudal fiefdoms reducing the Emperor to a ceremonial, albeit semi-divine, status with periods of increased and subsequently decreased Western influence. The emperor to this day claims a 1,500-year unbroken lineage, but most accept that as mere fiction. Still, much can be deduced from the Japanese' need to hold on to this steadfast belief. As early as 500 years ago the friars and Jesuits would attempt to bring Jesus and the West to Japan, which not unexpectedly resulted in increased tensions and schism in a land where once rice traded as a currency. With feudalism, mercantile classes, Christianity, Buddhism turning into Shintoism via Confucianism and inconspicuous affluence of the merchant class versus the austerism of the Samurai class all playing a part Japan of today grew through a maze of new versus old; traditional versus the inquisitive. Indeed, the social classes were in order (from bottom to the top) warrior (Samurai), peasant, artisan and the merchants. Explicitly, money and the hording of wealth were seen as unseemly for ages even as Japan (once more) proved itself paradoxical when the Samurai would have to serve the mercantile classes for money on occasions when the latter's wealth would not be expropriated. Simultaneously, the practice of mabiki or infanticide would cull the rural population when the peasants were unable to feed their very young. And while the Shogun ruled without mercy and with only formal deference to the Emperor one like Yedo's Tsunayoshi, as early as 1680, would stipulate that all animals and especially dogs were to be treated with kindness and great courtesy.The consistent paradox is further evident when in 1850 an increasingly cut off Japan salvages itself from Russian and American commercial and evangelical pressure by obtaining help from the Dutch. The rulers realizing how Japan's isolation has held the nation back embark on a program of modernization in a bout of pragmatism designed to secure the future of the nation by contravening its present convictions. The early signs of religious fervour and racism and their overtones, which were to reverberate in the Pacific War and World War II among the officer class, were to be manifested here as a reaction.While the Western influence from 1870 and on is partly responsible for the diminishment of the Shogunate and the power of the Emperor, ironically, it is the remnants of the former's power with imperial assertion that rubbed against the confrontational and colonial ambitions of the Japanese army that would bring death and destruction to not only much of Asia, but eventually to much of Japan courtesy of an unrelenting and inhumane bombing campaign by the allied at the end of World War II. The Emperor, and civilian politicians, were often ignored or left in the dark regarding war matters even as Japan sought to conquer and hold much of China, Philippines, Dutch colonies and Korea.Storry recounts this in a contextual manner that evokes the Japanese sense of sacred convention against its need to improve and explore.It is impressive how much information Storry has packed into a book of 275 pages. He speaks as a soldier, diplomat and scholar who had lived and taught in Japan. Surely, much has been omitted, even if the reader is left not wanting and with the assumption that exclusions are infrequent and that by the history book's end the island's history is covered chronologically with the exception of some apparent storytelling and editorializing courtesy of the tale of a modern day Saiko family through whose prism the author analyses the impact of Japan's history both to start and to end the book.A History of Modern Japan is both detailed and narrative in scope as well as a wholly interesting look at the history country, which despite its modern appearance and economy lies on a bed of tradition and customs."},{"Title":"Adorno on Popular Culture (International Library of Sociology)","review":"A layer of scholarship is antibody to liberation. The bonafide purpose of an introduction to a first rate thinker is to give the student a precis of the first rate.But the obvious question, one raised by Adorno in his lectures on Kant, is why the student needs a mentor to explain the guru.Adorno's answer was that Kantianism exists in partial independence from Kant and even from Kant's thought, in the sense that Kant raised concerns that Kant did not have the time to think through.There is nothing mystical about this. It may result in part from the fact that Kant himself, in Keyne's image, heard &quot;voices in the air&quot; in the form of thoughts that arose out of material struggles during Kant's epoch.Unfortunately, Witkin seems unaware of this possibility and provides instead a precis of &quot;Adorno on Popular Culture&quot; which reduces Adorno's thought to a biographical series of complaints about the way in which popular culture moronizes its consumer.This biographical approach forces Witken unconsciously and by default into the role of answering Adorno, and laying Adorno to rest; Witkin becomes an Adorno antibody in the manner of antibodies to the HIV virus which are the diagnosis of AIDs.In Adorno's own words and Adorno's own theory (which is almost never self-applied by texts in the Adorno industry) the thing represented is conquered by its representation in a way that has the Tedster, probably, spinning in his grave.Witkin's Adorno machine is constructed by a scholar who is tone deaf to the music of the dialectic.Witkin's Adorno machine emits racist music about jazz and Witkin seems to fail to realize that in the 1930s and 1940s, the word &quot;jazz&quot; was coterminous with popular music in an era before Coltrane. Adorno should not be forgiven, in writing about American music, for his apparently complete failure to inform himself about country blues and Scott Joplin but when asked to write about Jazz, he used the word in the same way ordinary GI's of occupied Germany used the word.Witkin's major case against his Adorno machine is Woody Allen, a filmmaker who probably knows about Adorno: an Adorno figure appears in Woody's Hannah and Her Sisters.Allen's films considered as a static *oeuvre* are thought by Witkin to constitute a riposte or counterexample to Adorno, for they are films with mass appeal that do not reject &quot;inwardness and erudition.&quot;The problem is the failure to apply Adorno's deep methodology. When he appeared in the 1920s in Weimar Germany, his colleagues were struck by the thoroughgoing influence of dialectical thinking on Adorno's details of thought and for better or worse, this makes a thinker unlikely to think in terms of a closure, which Witkin is seeking in raising the case of Woody Allen.Witkin fails both the appreciate Hegel, and read Variety: for in fact, ever since the 1980s, Allen's personal and professional reputation have been under continual attack beginning with accusations about his relationships with his step-daughter.The horror was based on the failure, of a large number of moviegoers, to connect with a Manhattan island of inwardness and erudition that was, in this period, diminishing both in Manhattan, and, at a rapid rate, elsewhere.During Reagan's presidency, universities in self-defense conducted a *kulturkampf* on universites, and inwardness and erudition, in the form of commodified education, the replacement of tenured faculty with adjunct faculty, and student moronization.The modal Allen clone became in this period a figure under increasing suspicion, and Allen himself expresses his rather bitter reaction to this in Deconstructing Harry.The dialectic was not suspended, and a frozen, hypostatized Adorno not counter-exampled and demolished by Allen's now very retro oeuvre. Instead the gradual brutalization of the Allen &quot;type&quot; becomes a confirmation of Adorno's critique and more interesting than old Woody Allen films.University faculty too often survive by pretending to celebrate liberation while in fact performing an older ideological function: thought control, and ensuring that things don't get outa hand. The reassurance, however, that popular culture is in any way a medium by means of which ordinary people can express their needs or find satisfaction is malarkey.The reassurance requires Witkin's nonsensical theory of transparency of communication (something predemolished by Adorno in The Jargon of Authenticity) in which the mechanisms of popular culture provide a way for fellow spirits to communicate in Buber's mode, and eliminates a &quot;third&quot; term consisting of a shared set of ideals, considered unnecessary and indeed Quixotic.The problem is that for Cervantes as for Adorno, humanity is the reverse of a brutalized, face-to-face, &quot;I and thou&quot; humanity which in fact is the face of one-on-one authority. Don Quixote was able to escape this exhausting struggle not by reification but by integrating an ontology into his praxis in a redemptory way..It is dehumanizing to so erase the possibility of shared ideals and Witkin fails to show how this creates anything but twilight struggle in the name of &quot;authenticity.&quot;As I write, abstract ideals labeled Quixotic a year ago are proving to have weight, like the physicist's light. The Bush administration finds itself today in front of an obsidian wall, carved with serpent shapes, expressing abstract Enlightenment ideals and although it may circumvent this barrier it will be perceived, world-wide, as untrue to its own professed ideals. This will have enormous consequences for the United States in the real world of economics and diplomacy.American media uses a jargon of authenticity and indeed, a debased, confrontational I and thou ethical style to REDUCE the hard work of arms inspectors to a series of completely misleading sound bytes. It is an anti-Quixote in that it refuses to test its results against any texts, whether chivalric novels or the Charter of the UN.In this context, we do not need to exorcise Adorno but instead to channel him."},{"Title":"Vault.com Guide to Case Interviews, 3rd Edition","review":"This is an excellent book for undergraduates who are looking to prepare themselves for an interview in consulting or finance. I took account a couple years ago and didn't remember everything about it. But this book gives a good review of all the necessary topics that would be needed during an interview. It covers business strategy technics, marketing strategies, and finance related topics. While the review covers half of the book, another tenth is focused on some real interviews from MBA students or other companies. Another quarter is actual case interviews. The author does go through on how to answer these cases. However, the maximum length give to each case was 2 pages. To me, that was not nearly enough for a case. And also, there are only about 15 real cases, there are about 15 practice ones. The last 15 percent is dedicated to guesstimates and brainteasers.So overall, it's a good book; however, I wish there were more cases."},{"Title":"For The Love Of Money: The 411 To Taking Control Of Your Taxes and Building Your Net Worth","review":"While other books tend to get wrapped up in technical jargon leaving readers with unanswered questions, this book does the exact opposite.

The book contains an introduction and 13 articles, arranged under three different subject headings:Part I. Conceptual and Thematic Issues1. Roger Silverstone, Eric Hirsch, and David Morely, \\"Information and Communication Technologies and the Moral Economy of the Household\\"2. Cynthia Cockburn, \\"The Circuit of Technology: Gender, Identity and Power\\"3.

Eric Hirsch, \\"The Long Term and the Short Term of Domestic Consumption: An Ethnographic Case Study\\"As some of the titles in the second section might suggest, these are by now very dated articles that will have very limited use to most media studies, consumption, or technology scholars. The more conceptual pieces that make up the first section, though not dated in the same way as those pieces on the personal computer, suffer from grossly under-theorized accounts of domesticity (not a single one offers a working definition). Better is Tim Putnam's piece--strangely placed in the third section--which complicates the concept of domesticity by characterizing it more as process than place. Perhaps the most disappointing piece in the collection, however, is Colin Campbell's essay on fashion. Like much of his work, his piece here simply recapitulates many of the observations presented in his admittedly groundbreakingThe Romantic Ethic And The Spirit Of Modern Consumerism. He proposes a theoretical question about consumption and then answers it (using virtually no empirical research and drawing on very little scholarship by others) with an overly-general and troublingly unified conception of Romanticism.Unless you're specifically interested in how scholars studied (or imagined studying) the relationship between technology and domesticity in the late 1980s and early 1990s, you'll likely find this book unhelpful."},{"Title":"The Fat Baby","review":"It is a deeply moving photojournalistic record of the highest probe.

She reawakens remembrances of things past, such as: the milkman; the Dugan pastry man; the family-owned soda shop, butcher shop, and drug store; James Dean; transistor radios; the introduction of television, and more. All of this is sewn together by the 1949-56 seasons of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the ardent fans' belief that one day (&quot;Wait till next year!) their beloved team will win the World Series. Even if you are not a baseball fan (and I am not) Goodwin will have you rooting for her team, suffering their losses and sharing her exultation at their wins.

I only had stories to live on. Mrs. Goodwin's books allowed me to vicariously live through her experiences as an avid baseball fan. The closeness of her family, and of her friends, neighbors, local merchants, seems to epitomize the stereotypical suburban life of the decade. Certainly her mother's ill health was an ever-present cloud shading all circumstances of her life, but I had the feeling, all through the book, that I certainly hoped Mrs. Goodwin has a clear realization of how good her life was, how fortunate and how privileged. Those of us who did not escape Brooklyn, in fact were stuck in public housing (more along the lines of what was depicted in the film &quot;Radiant City&quot;) would have given anything for her modest home in Rockville Centre and all its trappings.

There can be little doubt that the American experiment, the great melting pot, could never have worked without it. Where else in the world do you find team affiliations overcoming ethic and racial differences. Whether you frequent a mosque, church or synagogue, you can find at least nine good reasons to worship at the shrines of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Philadelphia Phillies, Boston Red Sox or Chicago Cubs.

As a fan, you get to pick your team, no matter where you are, everywhere in the world; no matter where your parents came from, no matter your religion, color, gender, size, shape; rich or poor, you get to choose your colors, your heroes, your hat and logo. Freedom to choose your very own baseball team. It is our Fifth Freedom. Like the other four freedoms, baseball must not be taken lightly, nor, should Doris Kearns Goodwin. Sure, her memoir carefully leaves out the really bad stuff. Like a Norman Rockwell painting, her characters have no warts. And, like Rockwell, her message never lacks for poignancy.

After dinner on long summer nights, he would sit beside me in our small enclosed porch to hear my account of that day's Brooklyn Dodger game....By the time I had mastered the art of scorekeeping, a lasting bond had been forged among my father, baseball, and me.So begins Doris Kearns Goodwin's enchanting memoir of growing up in Rockville Centre, L.I. and the relationship she forged with her bank examiner father, Michael Francis Aloysius Kearns, through baseball. As she continues, she explains how this experience contributed to her becoming a historian:Through my knowledge, I commanded my father's undivided attention, the sign of his love. It would instill in me an early awareness of the power of narrative, which would introduce a lifetime of storytelling, fueled by the naive confidence that others would find me as entertaining as my father did.Goodwin is, of course, best known for her hagiographies of democrat Presidents &amp; her frequent appearances on The Newshour, Imus and Hardball, but when Ken Burns tabbed her as a talking head for his Baseball series, she found that people at her talks were more interested in reminiscing about the Dodgers than in hearing about the Roosevelts. The result is &quot;Wait Till Next Year&quot;, wherein she has interwoven her baseball memories with her recollections of growing up Catholic in post-War suburban America.I especially liked several of her anecdotes:(1) She tells about her first confession, where she tearfully confesses to praying that Allie Reynolds, Robin Roberts and others will be injured, though not seriously, just enough so they won't be able to play against the Dodgers(2) After winning a St. Christopher's medal (blessed by the Pope) in a catechism contest, she presents it to a slumping Gil Hodges, who accepts it reverently &amp; tells her how he had one just like it growing up but gave it to his coal miner father to protect him.At a time when each memoir is more sensational than the next, fueling a descending spiral of confessional aberrance, it was a real pleasure to read the story of a nice normal American upbringing in a loving family &amp; one can't help but feel that we lost something valuable with the passing of the world she describes.GRADE: B+"},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"With this fine memior, Doris Kearns captures the innocence of childhood and the connection of America to baseball. It is the prefect summer read, and it makes me wish I lived in times long past, when following a team from year to year, you would know the players on the rouster would remain the same. Written in the prose of a true baseball fan, the game sets a larger framework for a changing times. Five stars. A great story."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin was the only woman, with whom I therefore identified, who was interviewed and gave commentary during Ken Burns' magnificent nine &quot;inning&quot; series on PBS called, &quot;Baseball&quot;. As a young girl growing up in the fifties in Brooklyn, not too far from Ebbits Field, she became a great Brooklyn Dodgers fan at a tender age. As a way to spend precious time with her father after his work each day on Wall Street (as a bank examiner), she quickly moved from accurate scorekeeper to the kind of fan who fights with her best friends about which team is better, and has to leave the room during clinched plays because she couldn't bear to hear what would happen next. Not only a sweet memoir of a wonderful family, an infirmed but steadfast mother, a loving father (plagued by the inner ghosts of his orphan childhood), and a neighborhood of caring, somewhat heterogeneous families and townspeople, all of whom feed into the &quot;you can't go home again&quot; feel of this book. A fast read, and a must for anyone, man or woman who enjoys baseball and can appreciate the angst, tears, elation, and madness of being a loyal ball fan. When I asked my mother what she thought, she exclaimed, &quot;oh yes, my god, it was like reading about my own childhood.&quot; (Apparently the fifties where more generally like Donna Reed than those of us who missed it, think)."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy &quot;Wait Till Next Year&quot;, a gentle tale of growing up in the 50's. Author Doris Kearns Goodwin paints a nostalgic portrait of a time when children lived out a &quot;Huck Finn&quot; existence between the breakfast hour and the supper bell on sultry summer days. School days were a crazy mix of idealism and naivety, interrupted by occasional dives under the desks for nuclear bomb drills. I suspect that if the author had not been a white, middle-class baby boomer, this would have been an entirely different story. Indeed, Goodwin does touch on the beginnings of the Civil Rights struggles as she entered her high school years. Love baseball? There are enough first-hand accounts of some of the great names in the sport's history to hold your interest. Teens, want to understand your middle-aged mother better? Read this book! All in all, &quot;Wait till Next Year&quot; is a welcome escape from school shootings, Kosovo, and all the other tragedies of today."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Wait Till Next Year is a fabulous book. Even though I am only a kid, I loved this book. Her feelings toward the Brooklyn Dodgers are exactly the same as mine toards the Orioles. Also, I thought it was extremely well written. I admire her father a lot."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"I purchased this book for my mother-in-law who is a retired history teacher. Here's what she had to say:&#34;A wonderful recollection of the author's chilhood growing up in Brroklyn during the mid 40s & through the 50s. A great glimpse of Culture in the U.S. It radiates out from neighborhood to city to the country as a whole...important issues for all of us & expressed by Goodwin's love of family and baseball.&#34;"},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Goodwin has a taken a beating from some of the other reviewers here, due to revelations of borrowing the work of others. Not being intimately familar with that controversy, I read this book with an open mind. I knew Goodwin from her many TV pundit jobs and her wonderful memories in Ken Burns' \\"Baseball\\" (an unparalleled work of genius by the way). Anyway, I loved the book. It is another a long line of wonderful Dodger books. However, this one has a special touch of being the memories of a young girl (a perspective one still does not hear enough about sports) and her homelife. Goodwin's father and mother were wonderful people. Her memories of her growning in the '50s reminded of the emotions evoked by the seminal TV series The Wonder Years a decade or so later. She writes beautifully of how the world (her world really) lost it's innocence when the Dodgers left. How she lost her mother, friends, etc. She talks briefly of her wonderful transformation from Brooklyn to Boston fan and her own family. The story left me in tears. A beautiful piece of personal history. As a history teacher and Cubs fan (with Brooklyn Dodger blood from my ancestors), I was moved and this is indeed history at it's best. Detailed, filled with awe and honor, and always personal."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"if any writer could make me into a fan, DKG could.I was watching David Letterman one night post Sept 11th and was so captivated by this woman he was interviewing -- I didn't know who she was until after the interview but she was discussing presidents and history and New York with such enthusiasm and excitement that I found myself wanting to know more about her. Seriously, how many times do you hear a person talking about Winston Churchill with any great feeling of wonder and excitement? She was so cool that I just had to know more about her.Realizing that she was an author, I picked up this book and was not disappointed. At one point in her book, she says her dad had a nickname for her - I can't recall exactly what that nickname was but it described her perfectly (bubbles maybe?) -- curious and enthusiastic and this comes through in both her personality and her writing.If all students could have someone like DKG as a teacher -- we'd all catch her enthusiasm for history AND baseball and would be able to tell our own stories just as well as she tells hers."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Wait Till Next Year is about baseball and life. It is the title of Doris Kearns Goodwin's memoir of childhood. Set in suburban New York in the \`50s, and lived before the backdrop of baseball, the account follows Goodwin through her childhood ending when she is fifteen at the death of her mother Helen, and the move from the family home. The opening line: \\"When I was six, my father gave me a bright-red scorebook that opened my heart to the game of baseball.\\"When Thomas Kearns teaches his daughter to keep a scorecard on each Brooklyn Dodger game he initiates her love for baseball, as well as for telling a compelling narrative. Baseball bonds their relationship. With careful records Doris relives each game with her father after he comes home from work. Baseball permeates other relationships. Doris listens to games on the radio after school with her mother. Her first boyfriend shares her love for baseball; her best girlfriend Elaine does too, although she was a rabid Giant's fan. The repetitive disappointment about the team's poor results demanded optimistic philosophy. Ever hopeful of winning a pennant, \\"wait till next year\\" became the family theme at the close of a season of defeat.Defeat overwhelms the Kearns' family when Helen dies. For a time Thomas' grief was inconsolable. Doris threw herself into activity and study. One of the final scenes in the book takes place in the attic. Doris and her father are looking at a box of old scorebooks. Thomas admits he cannot live in the house anymore without his wife. It is time to move on. Baseball continues, as does their family. Cycles repeat. In the final pages of the memoir Doris initiates her own sons into the culture of baseball teaching them, like her father had taught her, how to keep a scorebook. Like her father she opens her sons' hearts to the game of baseball. \\"Wait till next year\\" prevails."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"In &quot;Summer of 98,&quot; Mike Lupica's remembrance of that classic baseball season, he describes parents and children's shared enjoyment of the game as &quot;a love inside a greater love.&quot; In Lupica's case, the season's home run and pennnant races bonded Lupica to his children and to his father, with whom he shared Roger Maris' chase of Babe Ruth's home run record years earlier. In &quot;Wait 'Till Next Year,&quot; what to Lupica was a daily generational journal becomes a bittersweet coming-of-age story to writer/historian Doris Kearns Goodwin.Goodwin wraps her memoir around her family's shared love of the Brooklyn Dodgers: years of dissapointment (including 1951's infamous playoff loss to the New York Giants) to their 1955 championship season (recalled sweetly and vividly as the neighborhood celebration it was), and their treasonous 1958 move to Los Angeles. Goodwin grows to know and love the game, learning statistics, meeting legendary ballplayers like Roy Campanella, Gil Hodges, and Jackie Robinson, sharing her passion for the game with friends and family.Goodwin's story rings more powerful for its evocation, wistfulness, and sweeping sadness. She details the human face to the classic 1950s family image: successful, loving father, doting mother, precocious children, friendly (and cantankerous) neighbors, friends, shopkeepers. She shares the summer warmth of Jones Beach, nights at Brooklyn's Ebbets Field or by the radio with Red Barber, Sundays in church loving and learning her Catholicism.(not to mention schooldays listening to the World Series, which we may never see again). Security rested in tradition: the Dodgers' starting nine, clear answers to her Cathecism, friends and family there for her and each other.The young Goodwin dreams and believes greater things, enabled by parents allowing her self-expression and growth unusual for young girls then. Her vivid imagination wins a Dodger pennant by breaking the limbs of players on rival teams, her cajoling saves the Dodgers for Brooklyn, her care helps a potentially polio-stricken boyfriend, her beauty and wiles win Rhett Butler and allow her to read every book in her public library. Throughout, Goodwin also feels the requisite Catholic guilt; her confession after attending a Campanella speech strikes you with humor and pathos. (You wish you could know more about her love for the then-new rock and roll, and how that differentiated her and her friends from their parents.)The 1950s' seismic events (Julius and Ethel Rosenberg's treason, the McCarthy hearings and her friends' eerie re-creations of them, the 1956 Arkansas school integration, Sputnik) erode her security and faith. But in Chapter Seven, Goodwin chronicles losing what she valued most: friends and a team who moved, her mother dying in her sleep, her beloved home. These permanent changes left her and her father, who endured loss throughout his life, grieving but stronger for their shared experience. (Goodwin's descriptions of her mother were particularly moving; like her, my mother was sickly, had endured loss in her past, loved to read books and passed away at an early age.)The book's title refers to the Dodgers' end-of-season mantra after years losing the World Series to the hated New York Yankees. To Goodwin and her surviving family, it is also a slogan of resilience, that through preserving the past we keep those we love -- relatives, friends, heroes, neighborhoods, eras -- close. This is consistent with Goodwin's subsequent life and career choices, from her marriage and new love of the (equally heartbreaking) Boston Red Sox, to her passing baseball tradition to her children, to her becoming a full-time historian. In &quot;Wait Till Next Year,&quot; Doris Kearns Goodwin did in a meticulous, personal way what &quot;Forest Gump&quot; did as Hollywood spectatcle: insert her life and aspirations into some of history's most important events. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"In 1949, when Doris Kearns was six and living in Rockville Center, NY, her father taught her how to chart and score a baseball game, the primary (radio) entertainment of her community. In these years, it was baseball that unified the local community, though whether one was loyal to the Brooklyn Dodgers, as Kearns was, the NY Yankees, or the NY Giants was a different matter. For Kearns Goodwin, the youngest in the family, it was baseball which served as her ritual connection to her father, since she sat with him after dinner each night and related the scoring of that day's game.It is to these baseball narratives that she attributes her early interest in data collection and in story-telling (since she discovered her father stayed interested when she could keep him in suspense), traits which she believes helped make her the world-renowned historian she has become. As she describes her life during 1949 - 1956, when either the Dodgers or the Giants played in the World Series, usually against the NY Yankees, she connects her life at home and in the community with her fierce love of the Dodgers, and especially her hero, Jackie Robinson.Showing how team loyalties were related to the social structure of her town, Kearns Goodwin characterizes the friendly rivalries within the community. Becoming the official \\"window\\" scorekeeper one summer for the local butcher shop, in which the two butchers, Giants fans, kept the neighbors up to date re the Giants record, Kearns Goodwin (\\"Ragmop\\"), then eight, was the \\"official\\" scorekeeper for the Dodgers. The high point of her baseball \\"fan-dom\\" was the Dodgers win over the Yankees in 1955 for the World Series championship, when she was twelve.Throughout this remarkable memoir, Kearns Goodwin connects her family life to baseball. Her father's sad life before his marriage, in which he was orphaned at a young age; his love for her mother, always ill as a result of childhood rheumatic fever; her devotion to her older sisters; and her interest in family history are all connected in her mind (and in this memoir) with baseball. Her trips to Ebbets Field, where she sought autographs; her adolescence, in which her interest in baseball competed with her interest in boys; and the importance of baseball in her life following the death of her mother, attest to the cultural allure of the \\"all-American pastime.\\"Capturing a moment of social history, Kearns Goodwin puts the early fifties into perspective, and shows the lasting importance of baseball on her professional and personal development. A remarkable memoir by one of the all-time great baseball fans. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"I finished reading,\\"Wait Till Next Year\\", last evening and I would like anyone who enjoys memoirs or simply appreciates beautiful writing, to run out and grab Ms. Goodwin's charming book. A recollection of the life she led in Long Island N.Y. and the journey she made with the Brooklyn Dodgers. It is not just about baseball, it's about growing up in the late forties and fifties, about family life, a coming of age story for Doris and \\"Dem Bums\\".This past summer was the 50th anniversery of the Dodgers first world championship in 1955 and it seemed an appropriate time to read Ms. Goodwin's memoir and I'm so very happy I did."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"I wanted to read this book because I so enjoyed the author's participation in Ken Burns's baseball documentary. It was interesting to learn that she actually wrote the book AFTER that project, because so many people started asking her about her baseball memories. The book tells the story of her own life - family experiences, Catholic upbringing, etc. - interwoven with her love of baseball and esp. the Brooklyn Dodgers."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Wait Till Next Year, by Doris Kearns Goodwin, is a stunning autobiography about the connections between her hometown, her school, and her team. The book, based in the 1950's, gives tremendously reliable and accurate information on baseball, predominantly her favorite team the Brooklyn Dodgers. Goodwin's collection of beaten red scorebooks served as a diary of her whole life. At age six Goodwin's father taught her to keep score and \\"a lasting bond had been forged among my father, baseball, and me\\" (Wait Till Next Year. Goodwin. 13). Goodwin had a passion for Jackie Robinson's career as the second baseman for the Dodgers and the first black player in the major leagues. Goodwin documents the careers of other favorite Dodger players: Don Newcombe and Roy Campanella (two other black players playing for the Dodgers), Gil Hodges, Pee Wee Reese, and rookie pitcher Clem Labine. The book is about her childhood and her keen interest in the Brooklyn Dodgers, their games, players, and box scores. Growing up in an intimate bedroom community of New York City, all the neighbors were close. Goodwin lived a sheltered, storybook life. At the end of the book, as Goodwin gets older, her perfect unravels. First, her neighborhood disintegrated, neighbors moved to cities all over the country. The Brooklyn Dodgers moved to the West Coast, along with another New York baseball team, the Giants. One baseball team remained in New York, the Yankees. Her best friend Elaine moved to Albany. Goodwin's mother, who had been suffering from a failing heart condition, died leaving her father incredibly distraught. Goodwin's father sold the only home his children had ever known, because it was tainted with memories of his late wife.I would recommend this book to anyone with a love and a passion for baseball. The thrill of hearing every detail makes the games easily imaginable. For a baseball-lover like me, remembering some of the greatest players in history and reliving some of the most exciting games ever played is a major thriller. Goodwin does an incredible job transcribing these games and players from her red scorebook memories with meticulous detail; one can easily live in every moment. This book reads easily, but slowly. If you love to live in your books, Wait Till Next Year is a good choice for you.Goodwin writes in very scrupulous detail, thus, the book reads very slowly. Her meticulous dwelling on some subjects can be dull and provide an excuse to skip a page or two. While Wait Till Next Year is an easy read, the multiple pages of detail on each subject make the book a very slow read. It is a long book, and her extensive points slow your speed of reading. Wait Till Next Year is an intriguing story that provides its readers with insight into baseball. The passion that the author shared with her father provides the backdrop for learning about this riveting game, which truly is a Great American Pass-time."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Wait Till Next Year is a poignant autobiography and a gentle, charming read. I've read segments of it to my children at bedtime -- they're six -- and they've identified easily with the little girl described in its earliest chapters. I find some of the obligatory social studies material a little less riveting -- the depiction of McCarthyism seems heavily colored by hindsight, for example -- but the book as a whole won me over.It would be a mistake to think of this purely as a sendup of 1950s baseball. Doris Kearns Goodwin does describe her fascination with the Dodgers in doting detail, but she's doing so partly to reveal her relationship with her father, her fellow fan. My kids and I would agree that the early childhood here rings true, and only one of us understands box scores. Don't let the cover throw you off.A fine, loving book (and a pleasure to read aloud)."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Anyone who's seen Ken Burns's BASEBALL will know Doris Kearns Goodwin.

I, too, grew up a Catholic and a baseball fan (the Cleveland Indians) and lived in a neighborhood with a butcher shop, a fruit and vegetable market, and two drug stores with soda fountains.

The amazing thing is that the author is so brazen that she even tries to repesent she is responsible for anything she writes. When I taught I always impressed upon my composition students that they project their own feelings and ideas. I question whether the author has an idea of her own.

Goodwin masterfully weaves her love for the Brooklyn Dodgers into a poignant tale of growing up in the 1950s. The Dodgers' eventual move to Los Angeles becomes a metaphor not only for the transformation of baseball, but a young girl's coming of age and the sea change that began to affect all of society.

It's about much more than baseball."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Whether you are a baseball fan or not, forty-somethings and older will love this book, which so movingly evokes a simpler, truly more innocent time. Goodwin has put her skills as a historian to great use as she details some of the most important events of the '50's, including the McCarthy hearings, the Cold War buildup, and of course the Dodger-Yankee rivalries of those days. Most poignant, perhaps, is her sweet, childlike admiration of Jackie Robinson. At some level, she understood his role in lowering racism's barriers just a little, but mostly she saw only a superior athlete. Further, her ability to convey to the reader just how her love of baseball, a wonderful gift from her father, contributed to her abilities as a historian was a real bonus."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"into woman-hood may be a bit tedious to some, nontheless Ms Kearns-Goodwin is one of the premier story tellers of our time. I wouldn't think of buying the audio version of her book if she didn't narrate it herself.

This book/tape could reassure any young lady that is quite alright to be a baseball fan. Unless you really hate baseball, this is a book suitable for everyone."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"I was very disappointed.

I am just three years younger than the author, and I hoped for some interesting reading about a time and place that defined my childhood but that I was too young to notice at the time. Memoirs must serve at least one of three purposes. They either describe an interesting life, or they offer insights into a time and place, or they are simply well written and stand on literary merit alone. This book fails all three tests. The life is not interesting, the time and place are merely touched upon and poorly understoof, and the writing has no literary merit.

It seemed a bit trite, like an extended \\"Father Knows Best\\" episode, domesticity in the 50s. Ho hum.Then Doris started to draw me in. I especially like how she filtered historic events through the prism of a young girl's perception - the Army-McCarthy congressional hearings for example, and the trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.The most fun, however, was her re-telling of the trials and triumphs of Dem Bums, the Brooklyn Dodgers. An enjoyable and poignant read."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"My God, what a load of crap this book is. She grew up loving the Brooklyn Dodgers, because her Daddy loved the Dodgers. After the Dodgers moved to California, she ''discovered'' the Boston Red Sox, and effected a purportedly natural move from rooting for a New York City team, to a Boston team. Any true New York sports fan knows what kind of person this is. This woman is weak and flighty. Her sports loyalties are as confused and baseless as her political observations [comparing the current President to Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, et al.] The true tragedy is she has become rich and famous by troweling this drivel. There are at least a thousand baseball books far better than this trash. I bought it for 25 cents at a yard sale, and spent too much. Ignore the syrupy pretenders, and save your hard earned money. If you have not read them already, start with Roger Kahn's ''The Boys of Summer'', Eliot Asinof's ''Eight Men Out'', and Daniel Okrent's ''Nine Innings''.

I grew up a few years later than Mrs. Kearns; however, I grew up along the Hudson River about 120 miles north of NYC. I loved all the descriptions about her growing up and learning about baseball. I remember the time of the Dodgers, Giants, and Yankees. The information about caring for her Mother was truly heartwarming. I especially loved the part about her standing in line to give the rookie baseball player her St. Christopher's medal that she had won from a catechism contest. This book brought back a great deal of memories."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"This book touched me on many different levels. I bought it as a baseball fan but learned a lot about New York, the Catholic Church, and the 1950's in addition to baseball.Goodwin's portrayal of early New York suburbanites is very well written and reminded me of my own experience of moving to the suburbs of Washington, D.C. a generation later.Ultimately, I was moved by the way she caringly described each of the relationships in her life during that time, particularly with her father.Goodwin could work for MLB, the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, and the Catholic church and improve each of those entities public image. Her book made me nostalgic about things I have never experienced, if that is possible."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin's story is a memoir of growing up on Long Island and rooting for the Dodgers with a father who had no sons. If you were a Brooklyn Dodger fan in the 1950s your team was decidedly first division, but your hopes would always die with the Yankees in the World Series. Wait Until Next Year!The descriptions of her father's sad upbringing and the loss of her mother make this a coming of age tale as much as a baseball one. Baseball was a way for Doris to relate to her father and have identity in her neighborhood of Giants and Yankees fans. As a young girl she would listen to the Brooklyn Dodger games and keep score to show her father later. She would hang out at the Butcher Shop and gloat to the butcher when her Dodgers beat his Giants.As she grew up, she would see baseball change mirrored in social change. Baseball allowed her favorite player Jackie Robinson to play in 1947, and some years later President Eisenhower ensured the schools of Little Rock would also be colorblind. Like a good novel, the Dodgers did eventually win the World Series in 1955. And, of course, the Dodgers would leave Brooklyn as young Doris Kearns shed childhood for adolescence.In some ways I wish the book was more about baseball and less a memoir, but I was thrilled that a young girl in the 1950s would have the same experiences and excitement growing up with baseball as I did in the 1970s. For those who truly understand and love America's game, this book is worth your time."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"....WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR is a story about a girl growing up in the suburbs on Long Island. What could be a boring life story, Doris Kearns Goodwin makes everything exciting, and a story worth telling. The book is an autobiography of her life. One story of hers that I especially liked is the author explaining her plan for her neighborhood to be safe if they got bombed by Russia. She explained that underneath the local stores were connected basements, large enough to fit her whole neighborhood to fit it. She would bring Monopoly, so she wouldn't be bored, and most importantly, her baseball cards.The main character, the author, was a girl who thought differently than most young girls. She had many questions on religion, current events, and her family history, all at a young age. She explained things with comparisons like how when the Dogers left Brooklyn and Jackie Robinson retired, a chapter in her life closed.I would recomend this book to almost anyone. Many people can relate to it. If you either grew up in the suburbs, lived with a sick loved one, or had a love for baseball, you should read WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"To appreciate the quality of this work, consider for a moment the many ways it could have been manhandled. Too much emphasis upon the Dodgers-Yankees-Giants rivalry of the 1950's would have produced a superficial sketch of 1950's baseball, already more than adequately recounted by David Halberstam, among others. Worse, the author might have adopted an \\"Angela's Ashes\\" style of dramatizing a childhood that was in fact comfortable middle class living in post-War Long Island. Or much worse, we might have gotten yet another \\"growing up Catholic\\" Gothic tale of terror.Doris Kearns Goodwin found the proper balance, so that the uniqueness of this work rests not upon her description of baseball, the Eisenhower administration, or American Catholicism, but upon a surprisingly intimate portrait of her childhood that reveals more of her personal mysteries than perhaps she herself realizes. The cultural institutions she highlights-particularly baseball-are in reality the metaphors by which she discovers herself and invites us to share in those discoveries. That the author is an American public treasure-an author of note, the congenial presidential scholar who shares titillating historical gossip on national TV with the likes of Tim Russert and Don Imus-gives us more motivation to follow her psychological musings.\\"Wait Till Next Year\\" is a memoir of the author's childhood between the ages of five and twelve, roughly 1949 through 1956. Doris Kearns was the last of three daughters of Michael and Helen Kearns. Michael Kearns commuted to New York on the Long Island Railroad and made very decent money as a middle level bank officer; he owned a home in Rockville Center, and poverty was never a factor in the author's upbringing. Doris Kearns did well in school, had lots of friends, and objectively speaking, enjoyed the benefits of robust American prosperity.All the same, her childhood was marked with sadness, fear, and trauma. Some of these features were cultural: the author recalls recoiling from a televised picture of Joe McCarthy, crouching on the floor during an atomic bomb drill, and avoiding public places for fear of polio. But her major crosses were within the family, and specifically involving her mother. Helen Kearns, we learn gradually, is wasting away. In many understated ways the author chronicles her decline-her mother's need for silence and naps, her pallor and angina attacks, her inability to do strenuous things that other mothers did with and for their daughters. Young Doris Kearns confesses to a very natural ambivalence-worry about her mother's life coupled with resentment over her mother's limitations.Those who do not follow baseball do not have an appreciation for the psychological grounding it provides its followers in times of stress. Doris was introduced to radio broadcasts of timeless baseball by the time she was five, and soon after she mastered the art of official scoring in a red score book purchased for her by her father, who kindly shielded from his daughter the fact that all of New York's many newspapers carried the box scores for public consumption. Doris thus enjoyed the satisfaction of replaying each afternoon's games for her father as he sipped his evening cocktail. She attributes this experience with implanting the basic skills of research and story telling, the prerequisites for an up-and-coming historian of note. The author's substantive emotional involvement with \\"Dem Bums,\\" the Brooklyn Dodgers, was in fact the tonic that helped her weather the cultural and familial storms of her youth. And the bonds established between father and daughter through the medium of baseball helped her to forgive him in her later teen years when her father's grief led him into a period of gross insensitivity to his daughter's needs.I found myself more than a little envious when I learned in the epilogue that the author, by now the famous Dr. Kearns-Goodwin, literally reconstructed her old neighborhood in middle age through a meticulous search of records for her old Rockville Centre chums, whose interviews enrich the telling of this very personal tale. I understand her motivation as I progress through middle age. We are always in dialogue with the child within us, or at least the child we think were. What hinders us most often is a lack of information, and what we desire is a pilgrimage backward to legitimate past experience. This work at hand is Doris Kearns Goodwin's journey into her past. It was certainly not a painless adventure. But in turning the final page, the reader is pleased that at least one child-adult was able to cross to the other side and go home again."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Ms. Goodwin captures what it meant to be a baseball fan before the era of free agency and player self-promotion. The book beckons to a time when fans became emotionally attached to teams and players, and baseball was seen as the embodiment of Americana. The slow pace of the game, the time between pitches to analyze situations and plan strategy, all the aspects of the game which make it America's first sport. Equally, the book captures the traditions and the heartbreak of being a Dodgers fan in the 1940's and 1950's, when they were continually the second-best team, behind, of course, only the hated Yankees. On a more personal level, the book brought back for me the memories of just sitting around on a warm summer night, in the house, on the steps, or for the best reception, in the driveway listening to the game on the radio with my dad, my brother and some friends. No ESPN, no cable, only &quot;rabbit ears&quot;, and a black-and-white TV."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"I have had the wonderful opportunity of hearing her speak in person and if you ever get the chance, go hear her. This was a fun book for me because my parents are the same age as DKG and while they grew up in small midwestern towns, many of the stories she shares ring very true.While very different from her presidential books, her easy to read style will allow you the devour this book in only a couple of sittings. The pictures are a joy as well as the reader is allowed a look back into yesteryear when Catholics, Jews and Protestants lived next door to each other without conflict and without a sense of separation.DKG's ability to weave her storied life around baseball shows her gift for writing and provides an excellent vehicle for the myriad emotions caused by the ups and downs of a 154 game season as well as growing up, the move to the suburbs and the loss of a parent. How many times do sports reflect life in a good way? Lately not so often, yet this book reminds us of a different era; before the designated hitter, astroturf and free agency, before a 50% divorce rate, AIDS, and 500 cable tv channels. It was a simpler time, yet DKG is not afraid to point out the sunken logs that would arise in the following decade.I am sure each reader will find their own favorite story in this book and no doubt many of you will have your heart warmed by this feel good book. DKG provides a gentle voice and reminds us all that for many folks the 50's were the calm before the storm."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"If you want a book all about the Brooklyn Dodgers, read Peter Golenbock's &quot;Bums&quot; or Roger Kahn's &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; or &quot;The Era&quot;. Doris Goodwin has woven the Dodgers into her memoir in just the right amount. Well-written and evocative of a much different time than the '90s, it's well worth reading."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"and even if you know nothing about baseball like me, Kearns Goodwin has hit a home run with \\"Wait till Next Year.\\" You will learn all about the rivalry between the Mets and the Yankees and the history of Goodwin's beloved Brooklyn Dodgers. She tells all about her heroes Jackie Robinson, Gil Hodges and Roy Campanella. All of these great baseball nuggets are woven into her story of growing up in Brooklyn in the '50s, and is so evocative of a time and place that was quintessentially American. This book will make you long for a town like Rockville Centre, sometime between 1949 and 1957."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin seems to have written a book about her growing up in the NY suburbs for her own pleasure of simply remembering the \\"simpler\\" days before free agency, adulthood and the pressures that come to all of us as we move along in years. Her storytelling is at times pure magic, when it was the Dodgers of Brooklyn, the Yankees of The Bronx and the Giants of Manhattan and the Polo Grounds. The hope of a baseball fan shows beautifully and reminds us all that we needn't lose all of our childish passion simply because the years pass. One is reminded of the past couple of years with the Red Sox ending \\"the Curse\\" and the White Sox winning in style in the South Side of Chicago. It leaves Cubs Nation truly understanding this concept - Next Year.While the book is clearly a pleasant read one cannot help but wonder if any author by Dr. Goodwin would have gotten this published. That doesn't mean it should not have been; rather she had the ability, through her name as a writer of history, to make this book happen. A wonderful summer read."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin is truly one of the best writers of our time. Wait Till Next Year took me from a tale about baseball to the wonders of growing up in what seemed a simpler, family and home-centered life. Dad worked, Mom tended to us post-war kids at home, and our neighbors were our best friends and playmates. I broke into tears when Doris described the departure of her best friend, Elaine, with whom she'd shared so much of her youth. We, too, moved away at about the same time and age, and life was never the same for us. Our friends were gone, my Mom, too, became ill. And baseball, it was at the center of our lives as well. I'll never forget hearing that Roy Campenella had been in an accident that would confine him for life to a wheelchair. How could that be possible? Just as Doris is baffled by the disintegration of her beloved Dodgers. Thank you, Doris, for showing us--liberal, caring, family-centered Catholics--that someone as gifted as you could put into words what we felt, who we were; who we are today. Your book is a jewel; I highly recommend it to every caring person. And to those who seem hardened by life, please read this book. You'll come away with a tear in your eye and warmth in your heart."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"As a Brooklyn-born boy who came late into his true inheritance, love of the Brooklyn Dodgers, this book was recommended to me by a friend who appreciates my passion despite the fact that he is a NY Yankees and NY Giants fan.I've read and enjoyed several of Doris Kearns Goodwin's books, among themTeam of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys : An American Saga, andNo Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II, so I assumed I was going to enjoy WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR. And there are things I enjoyed very much.Kearns Goodwin's recollections of growing up in the Long Island town of Rockville Centre, New York predate mine by twenty years; but certain landmarks were familiar. References to Sunrise Highway, Wolf's Sport Shop, and the Cathedral of St. Agnes, Kearns Goodwin's church, connected us. Although Kearns Goodwin grew up several towns cityward from my own post-Brooklyn home in Massapequa, her compass was mine as seen from the train or through the car window as I commuted to or from home. And her reminiscences of playing in the streets and backyards of a less-crowded 1940s-50s Nassau County resonated with me. Kearns Goodwin can remember when there were 7000 televisions in America. I can't. But her descriptions of the quiet suburban streets and the general tenor of life on Long Island rang true.Raised in a religiously diverse environment, I could smile at her memories of her First Communion, her first Confession, and what passed for sin in the mind of a very Catholic and properly brought-up young lady of her time, which was pre- Vatican II. After a while, and even with this awareness however, I had to check the spine of the book to see if it had not been co-written by St. Augustine of Hippo. So much of WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR is filled with page after page of recitative of votives lit, novenas said, Hosts swallowed, Hail Marys repeated, and Acts of Contrition uttered that the middle of the book became a tedious slog.It was sweet to read of Kearns Goodwin's personal gift to fellow Catholic Gil Hodges of a St. Christopher's Medal blessed by the Pope, handed over at an autograph signing, and it was even more satisfactory to read that this gift broke Hodges out of a legendarily long and awful batting slump the next day. God bless!It was infuriating, however, to read about Kearns Goodwin's childhood fear of the eternal damnation of her immortal soul for the transgression of having visited the social center of an Episcopal Church to take part in an ecumenical, interracial event, a speaking engagement by Roy Campanella on tolerance and diversity. Kearns Goodwin never remarks on the irony of the situation. To be fair, I wasn't angry at Kearns Goodwin (who was only a child), nor at her parents (who to their credit let her attend), nor at the clergy (who reassured her of the harmlessness of such an act), but at the stultifying atmosphere of that form of 1950s white suburban American Roman Catholicism that could imbue a child with such terror.Kearns Goodwin did NOT attend parochial school. She went to public school, and her neighbors were not all Catholic, so her fixation---near obsession---on religion was unexpected (at least to this reviewer). At least she did not go so far as to say that some of her best friends were Jewish (even though some of them were).In part, this repressiveness was due to the inflexibility of Catholic dogma at the time, and it was also part and parcel of a world which was suffering from a polio pandemic, Cold War paranoia, McCarthyism, Rosenberg Spy Trial Mania, and fixed and seemingly immutable rules regarding the roles of women and men, the place of blacks and whites, the superiority of one belief system over another, and the rightness and wrongness of Right versus Left. People dealt with these issues differently. Kearns Goodwin's neighbors the Greenes (nee Greenbergs) converted to some branch of Protestantism and hid their previous identity; Jewish neighbors avowed their hatred of the Rosenbergs' presumed treason; her best friend found her personal ambitions frustrated by her family in favor of their son; Kearns Goodwin's father encouraged his family of daughters to investigate nontraditional roles; as she grew older Kearns Goodwin began questioning her received ideas about ethics and morality (as an example, in regard to the Legion of Decency's ban onBlackboard Jungle); and over all, the Brooklyn Dodgers integrated baseball, changing America forever. 1957 saw the integration of Central High School in Little Rock, and Kearns Goodwin came of age just as, and just in time for, the start of the social ferment that was the 1960s.Kearns Goodwin had the pleasure of meeting not only Gil Hodges and Roy Campanella and Clem Labine in person, but also her favorite player, Jackie Robinson. Her love of the Dodgers bound her to her father, a lifelong fan. Her heartbreak at the Dodgers' annual loss of the World Series to the Yankees is palpable. Her joy at their World Series win in 1955 is an event shared by millions.It seems to be a hallmark of this genre of memoir that the departure of the Brooklyn Dodgers is linked to, and becomes a metaphor for, life-altering change and loss in the lives of the authors. Kearns Goodwin's mother died in 1958, when she was fifteen. Roger Kahn's (The Boys of Summer) father passed away in 1956, just as Jackie Robinson left the team; Thomas Oliphant's (Praying for Gil Hodges: A Memoir of the 1955 World Series and One Family's Love of the Brooklyn Dodgers) father survived a severe bout with a long chronic illness in 1957 and his family relocated to California in 1959, literally following the Dodgers; Maury Allen (Brooklyn Remembered: The 1955 Days of the Dodgers) was just beginning his overseas military service as the Dodgers won the Series; Michael Shapiro (The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together) was a child just coming into his first awareness of the outside world as the Dodgers departed at the end of the 1957 season; and Bob McGee (Greatest Ballpark Ever: Ebbets Field And the Story of the Brooklyn Dodgers), links the departure of the Dodgers to priceless memories of time with his father: \\"He said it would matter to me someday, I would value the time we spent, and he was right.\\"So right."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Great book.

I would give it more than five stars if I could."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Wait Till Next Year is Doris Kearns Goodwin's wonderful memoir of her childhood in the suburbs of New York in the 1950's. It tells about growing up, and Doris's love for her family, friends, and the Brooklyn Dodgers.Living in that time was somewhat different. All the kids on the block played together, shopkeepers knew all of their customers, and friendly rivalries between Giant, Yankee, and Dodger fans were all over the neighborhood.In her life, the most important thing to her was baseball. She was a big Brooklyn Dodgers fan, and kept score of nearly every game. When she was six, her father gave her a scorebook, and they became very close through their love for baseball. After all the times that the Dodgers got so close to winning the World Series, Doris was heartbroken. When the Dodgers finally won, her amazed family joined in the celebration with the other fans.Doris also enjoyed other things. She inherited her love for reading from her mother, and was very dedicated to her Catholic religion. Another pastime was going with her sister to Jones Beach.As she got older, the end of an era was approaching. The Dodgers moved to Los Angeles and small stores went out of business. For her personally, neighbors and her best friend moved away, and her mother died from illness.\\"Wait till next year\\" was the saying used after the times that the Dodgers lost in the World Series, but it also symbolizes Doris and her family's healing from her mother's death.Although a lot of the book talks about the Dodgers, you don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this touching story of growing up."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"From Ken Burns series on baseball, I knew this lady was the real deal - at least as a baseball fan.

I highly recommend Dr. Kearns Goodwin's book to all who love baseball ... and life."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Considering that Doris Kearns Goodwin is one of the women I most admire and respect in America today, I was curious about what her book would be like recounting her childhood. What I came away with was a sense that a girl, or boy for that matter, growing up in an ordinary home, doing &quot;ordinary&quot; routine things, could go on in life to accomplish great things. Rituals,having simple fun,setting aside time to daydream, being passionate about something - anything - will lay the groundwork for confidance, curiosity,and passion in a child that will stay with them into adulthood. From a very early age, perhaps three, my son has had a passion for history and the era of his grandfather, World War II. I have tried to nuture that passion for the last 14 years. One can only hope as he goes on to college this fall that he turns out half as accomplished and as much a contributing member of society as Doris Kearns Goodwin. Thank you for the reassurance Doris!"},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"We were sometimes called tom-boys, and often given dolls by Santa when what we really wanted was a catchers mitt. Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote a memoir for all the little girls out there who grew up loving the game. Her beautifully written tale of how her parents equally influenced her life is a touching testament to them, and to a seemingly simpler time when teams were the same year after year, and a little girl (or boy) could give Gil Hodges a good luck totem before the big game. This novel is about so much more than baseball, adn it was a pleasure to visit that much-talked about era with someone who made it come alive.I'll think of Doris fondly when I buy my season tickets this year. And this Yankee fan will even silently pull for the Red Sox, her modern day answer to the Broklyn Dodgers, to make a run (for the wild card.)"},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"A very engaging and humourous book with poignant moments. My favorite: her meeting Jackie Robinson and his clever autograph to her. This book provides an interesting contrast for today's baseball fan between the teams of the 1950's and the teams of the 80's and 90's. The love of the game continues for fans, but in a different economic atmosphere, team loyalty is more difficult. I have passed this book on to my mother who is also enjoying it immensely, and her having grown up listening to the Yankees of the 1950's on the radio, this book rings more true. One more thing, what I found truly memorable about this book was the author being female and presenting her love of the game and telling how that love was instilled in her by her father. As a woman, I have throughout my life been looked upon as different because I love baseball and can spend hours reading stats and boxscores. It was heartening to read of another woman's love of the game."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Don't wait till next year to read this book.

The book is marred, if only slightly, by her mistaken reference to Don Newcombe as &quot;the third black player to join the Dodgers after [Jackie] Robinson's debut in 1947 and [Roy] Campanella's arrival the following year...&quot; In 1947, Negro Leaguer Dan Bankhead, a 27-year-old right handed pitcher was brought up by the Dodgers. He had an undistinguished record in four games. But Bankhead, not Campanella, was the second black player on the Dodgers. That historian Goodwin would make such an obvious error (at least obvious to veteran Dodger fans) is disappointing."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Ms. Kearns has given a wonderful review of the Dogers of the later 40's and the 1950's. Her descriptions of the highs and lows of those Dodger years made it seem as if I were reading them for the first time..

Alou, Nen, maybe Leiter, Sheffield and Brown all gone. A Kingfish gutted so the trophy weighs in on the scales of the new baseball &quot;economy.&quot; The contrast to a time when a young Doris Kearns Goodwin could pencil in a line-up by heart, year after year after year.Doris Kearns Goodwin speaks to these long gone times, when life - on the surface - seemed a whole lot simpler. But the beauty of this look back is its 20/20 hindsight. She owns no rose-colored glasses.For every Norman Rockwell glimpse into her Long Island suburban neighborhood, there's a story of the chilling McCarthy-style inquisitions she and her friends would stage to cut to the core of their young phyches. For every heart warming tale of the corner butchers who knew her by a pet nickname, there's the very real horror of planning a community bomb shelter in the butcher shop's basement in, case someone dropped The Big One. She combines the warmest of memories for Carl Furillo's cannon arm with the looming nuclear shadow of Nikita Khruschev.Get it straight. This is far more than another baseball memoir. Baseball is the backdrop, the metaphor for life with the Baltimore Catechism, a mother with a bad heart, and a school divided into teams of Red and Blue, not black and white.It's particularly appropriate in this anniversary year honoring Jackie Robinson. The wonderful innocence of hero worshiping a black man in an era of clearly unequal rights. For me, it was the massive Luke Easter, as powerful in his 40s as Robinson was fleet in his prime. We were too young to understand bigotry. Again, Goodwin can retell the coming of age simultaneously at a time when discrimination was still a way of life for so many.Finally, the weaving together of a family's story with the threads of baseball's twists and turns resonated with me. If you grew up in the 50s, you'll find a very familiar world in Goodwin's Long Island. You'll see the issues we still deal with today, just beginning to surface. The Dodgers were about to move to LA. And yesterday, Florida peddled one more piece of its championship puzzle. After all, it's all about business. If you're looking for a photo albums filled with snapshots of the 50's, warts and all, this book is a great place to start."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Though I haven't quite finished it yet, I looooove Wait Till Next Year. I'm 11 years old, and didn't think I would like this book, since Goodwin is mostly a grownup author, but I love it. It is a welcome change from X-rated memoirs from earlier this year. The old &quot;Life-In-The-Post-War-Era, oh the horrors&quot; stuff has nothing on on this book.If you're an adult, pass this on to your kids when you finish. If you're a kid, vis-versa!

The book just doesn't talk about the way baseball is played it talks about the way the fans listened to the games. It also talks about the way of life for the fans. The author Doris Keans Goodwin made it special by telling her life story and introduced all the people in her life. She also talked about the rivals inside the little suburban area. She discussed how most of the people were Dodger fans in the area and in another area were the Yankee fans. The author also talked about how people conducted themselves when their teams won and lost. She tells you how you never should think of the past but always think of the future. Doris explains what families went through during the era when you didn't have T.V. or you had to go to the beach to swim and other places to have fun. The book really tells you the story from the viewpoint of the little kid growing up in that time period. This book was very good and you should take the opportunity to read the book.

They are not usually very well written. I was given this book by a friend who lives in the same town as Doris and thought my wife and I would like it. We both loved it and give as gifts to our baseball fan friends.This book is both personal and historical. Doris recalls her childhood relationship with her team, the Brooklyn Dodgers, her local team of her youth. This is a book for a real fan who has a team and sticks with them. Her relationships with her family unfolds subtlely as she tells the story of her team and how she got sucked into a relationship with a &quot;loser&quot; but not really.This book will keep your head above the dug out as you wait for spring training to start up again."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"I recieved this book as a gift for Christmas 2000 and read it almost as non-stop as I could. I'm not a baseball fan, but this was one of the most moving and well written stories I have ever read. Ms. Goodwin writes about an admittedly idyllic and innocent childhood but with such honesty and clarity of recollection that it does not come across as &quot;Leave it to Beaver.&quot; I am ordinarily only captivated by Tom Clancy or John Grisham and was a little let down when I first unwrapped this gift, however after completing my first reading, I know that this book will be a cherished possession that I will continue to pull off the shelf for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"You don't have to be a baseball fan to appreciate this excellent story of growing up in the 1950's. Goodwin captures the aroma of that time: A child laying on her front lawn, waiting for her father to come home from the train, communicating with her best friend next door via a string on a pulley, going to the beach and deciding who is the best center fielder in New York, and watching your childhood friends move away as the neighborhood changs. I've been there, as I'm sure many of my early baby boomers have. I still carry the book in my briefcase even after I've finished it. I don't want to put my past down."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Stirring delivery by the author, a touching account of the author's relationship with her father before and after the loss of her mother. I bought this audiobook because I had become a fan of Doris Kearns-Goodwin based on her appearances on ABC and Imus in the Morning. I enjoyed it because with this book, Doris shows that she has other talents at her disposal beyond historical analysis. If you liked her before, you'll want to buy her dinner after experiencing this story."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"The author weaves two of my favorite subjects, childhood and baseball, in a marvelous memoir. It's easy to see why Ms. Goodwin became a historian. Only in grade school, she used to listen to Red Barber broadcast the ups and downs of the Brooklyn Dodgers and keep an accurate scorebook on their games for her father. When he returned home from work each day, they would sit down together, and she would recite the games' histories, batter by batter. But it's not all comfy and cozy. Goodwin's mother suffers long bouts of illness, and it's tragic to read about them. Goodwin intricately weaves her own personal history with those of the families in her neighborhood and with those of the Giants, Yankees and Dodgers. Jackie Robinson, Bobby Thompson, Leo Durocher - they all come alive through the eyes of an avid young baseball fan. A great book, filled with a rare combination of warmth and intelligence."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Even as a die-hard Yankees fan, I loved this book.

First of all, this is not a tell-all memoir, it is simply the story of a young Long Island girl growing up in the 1950's as a Brooklyn Dodgers fan. Second, Ms. Goodwin is such a beautiful writer one could read this book in one sitting. This book is not about how salacious her life was growing up, it is simply a beautiful tale of growing up and witnessing many important events of the 1950's, such as McCarthyism, the Civil Rights Movement, and, of course, the Brooklyn Dodgers moving west. Ms. Goodwin does as brilliant a job of telling her own story, as she has down with Lyndon Johnson and the Roosevelts. This is definitely a must-read!"},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Doris Goodwin is a Pulitzer Prize winning author. She is a democrat and mostly she writes about politics. However several years back she took part in Ken Burns documentary film on baseball and portrayed her memories and love of the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s and later as an adult in Massachusetts, the Boston Red Sox.This stimulated her to reflect on her childhood days as a Dodger fan and she decided to write a book about it. But as she carefully researched her memory and her past she found that it was all intertwined with her life groing up as an impresionable girl on Long Island in the 1950s. Her parents her friends and her future wriing career were all tied togehter. So this delightful book is a memoir of her childhood growing up and living and dying for the Brooklyn Dodgers.I am 55 years old, slightly younger than Goodwin but I too grew up in the 1950s on Long Island and can relate to many of her experiences. She discusses how she started learning about baseball and the Dodgers when her father taught her how to fill out a scorecard. In the evenings during their quiet time together she would use the scorecard like a cue to narrate the game she listened to on the radio that day. This brought the game to life for her father and created an interest in her in narration that carried on into a career of writing.The book flows marvelously and you see the world from the eyes of an impressionable grammar school girl. Goodwin is somehow able to go back and put herself back in the mind of that little naive child. We see her devotion to the Catholic church, the fear of polio in the ealry 1950s before the vaccines. I know this so well as I contracted polio in the summer of 1953 though I never got it so bad as to need an iron lung. We here of her confessions as she admitted to her priest that she wished harm on the Dodger opponents. We learn about the kids in the neighborhood, all Dodger, Giant or Yankee fans. I was a Yankee fan but my brother and all my friend that I played ball with as a kid were Dodger fans. The Dodgers were the most popular team in New York. They were the underdogs and the team for the common working man.Goodwin's first boyfriend was a boy she got to know because he was a Dodger fan and they could talk so comfortably about the Dodgers. This is a story about the Dodger players she admired; Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, Duke Snider, Don Newcombe and Carl Furillo and the Yankees and Giants that she dispised, Mays, Mantle, Martin, Berra and others. It is a story about devotion and heartbreak; Bobby Thomson's home run, the story of Mickey Owens' dropped third strike. Billy Martin's heroics is 52 and 53. But it is also the thrill of 1955 when Dodger fans finally didn't have to say wait till next year.As all this goes on we also hear about her mother's health problems and her childhood girlfriends, the beginning years of television, the Army - McCarthy hearings, the cold war, the civil defense drills and the fallout shelters, memorable events for those growing up in the 1950s."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"As a genre, baseball books are of two general types- the rarely interesting memoirs of a jock or coach, or the baseball writer/enthusiast's dissection of the game in general, or of a season or team in particular.&quot;Wait Until Next Year&quot; by Doris Kearns Goodwin is of the latter genre. A lifelong baseball fan who grew up in a Long Island suburb of New York City, Goodwin grew up rooting for her father's favorite team- the Brooklyn Dodgers in what many regard as the golden age of baseball, the late 1940s and early 1950s.It was an era where the Dodgers went to six World Series in ten years (1947, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1955, and 1956) and won the title over the hated Yankess in 1955. It was an era that saw baseball integrated by Jackie Robinson, and some of the best players in history (Robinson, Duke Snider, Willie Mays, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Billy Martin) wowed the fans time and again with their spectacular play. And Goodwin watched it all while growing up. &quot;Wait Until Next Year&quot; is as much a memoir of growing up in suburban Long Island in the 1950s as it is a remembrance of what baseball was like in that long-gone era.Anyone who followed sports as a kid can remember what it was like to watch their heroes on the television, fervently hoping they may emerge victorious (this baseball fan was crushed to watch the big, bad Oakland A's slaughter his heroes, the San Francisco Giants, in the 1989 World Series) or being so fortunate to actually attend a game in the flesh. This reader smiled as he read Goodwin's memories of attending a game at Ebbets Field, her horror at Robby Thomson's miracle home run in the 1951 playoffs that lifted the Giants over the Dodgers, her satisfaction with the Dodgers triumph in the 1955 World Series, and finally her sadness at the Dodgers decision to depart for Los Angeles in 1957.A very good book that even non-baseball fans will find hard to put down."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"I have read that authors read reviews by readers. I hope Ms. Goodwin reads this. This is simply a wonderful bookThis is the second time I read this book. I read this for a book club. I had remembered the portions about baseball and the wonderful relationship between Ms. Goodwin and her father. The rereading does not diminish the pleasure of this portion of the book.The second reading permitted me to think about the the insightful description of growing up in the 50's--an experience I share with Ms Goodwin. It was a simpler time when fathers came home the same time and mothers stayed home and raised the children. Children owned the streets and everyone was growing together. Ms. Goodwin also points out that it also was a time when woman could not work. A simpler time is not always the better time.The most interesting portion of the book on the second reading is the foreshadowing of what is required to be a historian. Joining her ability to recreate a ball game as the beginning of her career as a historian, which she points out depends upon the ability to tell a story. SEcond when historical events such as the integration of Little Rock we see her mastery of history.I used to think that No Ordinary Times was my favorite book. I will reread that as well but right now it has taken second place."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"It goes without saying that Ms. Goodwin is among America's finest writers; her Pulitzer prizes prove that. Yet Ms. Goodwin herself has said in interviews that of all the books she has written, WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR seems to strike the strongest emotional chord among her readers.This book is writing at its best and, therefore, it's good reading. It will be of special interest to anyone with a passion for baseball, particularly the Dodgers, especially before the team left Brooklyn.Yet this memoir is more than just a baseball story, though that part is fascinating. It offers a good picture of the energy found in the States during those years immediately following World War II, and an excellent history of the expansion of New York City and the immediately adjacent suburbs at that same moment in time.My father and his brothers, like all little boys born in Brooklyn in the first decades of the 20th Century, were avid Dodgers fans. By 1986, three of the four brothers had died. My bachelor uncle remained alone, 85 years old, though I phoned him every day and visited him frequently. During the '86 World Series, I was trying to engage his attention; his mind was clear, but his enthusiasms had abated.So I tried to instigate a conversation. &quot;What do you think of the Mets? Can you believe that they won the Series?&quot;He responded, &quot;I have to tell you, sweetheart, that after the Dodgers left Brooklyn, we never again cared that much about baseball.&quot; I understood that when he said &quot;we,&quot; it wasn't meant in the royal sense--he was referring to three brothers who had predeceased him.My uncle died in 1994, at the age of 93. He remained a voracious reader until the day he died. The highest compliment I can pay Ms. Goodwin is that I am sorry that he did not live long enough to read WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR. It's a wonderful book, and he would have reveled in it."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"There isn't much of a plot to \\"Wait Till Next Year\\"--Brooklyn girl and rabid Dodger fan grows up very Catholic in the late '40s and early '50s, while her mother slowly wastes away and dies. The title is a catch phrase that Brooklyn Dodgers fans used over and over again when their team was eliminated from the pennant race for yet another year. Dodgers trivia jostles against family history, and wonderful set-pieces on, for instance what it was like to own the first television on the block.If you were a city girl who grew up during this same period in America, many of the author's stories will resonate with you: not being able to play in the water on a hot summer's day, not even a wading pool, because of your parent's fear of polio; ducking under your desk or filing down into the furnace room during your school's air-raid drills; the book-and-brick smell of the local public library, where each of the books had a date-stamped sheet glued to its back cover.Is that really me and my sister in the photograph on the back cover, or did all little girls wear bangs and plaid back then?The most angst-filled stories in the book were about the author's father, who raised his young sister after being orphaned at an early age. His brother died of tetanus, his mother in child-birth, and his father, of grief. His one remaining sister died a few years later in a freak accident, but he managed to pull himself together after all of those untimely deaths, educated himself, got married, had children, became a Brooklyn Dodgers fan--all of this without self-pity or rancor. Maybe he really did belong to 'The Greatest Generation.'This is a sweet coming-of-age story, guilelessly told--an excellent read for a nostalgic baby-boomer or a rabid baseball fan."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"So many people recommended Doris Kearns Goodwin's charming memoir, \\"Wait Till Next Year,\\" that I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.Experiencing her youth in the forties and fifties as I and many of my reading friends did, Goodwin struck chords that reverberated movingly with us. Though the story takes place in Rockville Centre, New York, a suburb just a train ride away from Brooklyn, her pictures of herself and her friends in front yards and back yards, her schools and churches, drug store and neighborhood could have been taken in any American suburb of those distant days.These memories make up a different kind of \\"fan's notes,\\" as she tracks the ups and downs and near misses of her beloved Brooklyn Dodgers, the team she followed faithfully as a six-year-old in 1949, until \\"dem bums\\" finally delivered a World Series championship in 1956. Her team, with Gil Hodges and Roy Campanella, and even their radio announcer, Vin Scully, moved to Los Angeles in 1958 and became my wife's favorite team. My \\"Whiz Kids,\\" the Philadelphia Phillies of the fifties, with Robin Roberts and Ritchie Ashburn and Eddie Waitkus received mention and reminded my wife and me of the days when you could count on the same players returning loyally to play year after year for the same team.In addition to the thread of baseball running through the book, Goodwin touches on national events that characterized the times for anyone who lived through them: the death of FDR, the Korean War, the Rosenberg spy case, McCarthyism, and forced school integration in Little Rock. She remembers Elvis and James Dean and covers faithfully the rituals of growing up in the Catholic Church. There is something here to touch the heart of anyone who grew up in those naive times of the 1940s and 1950s."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"\\"Wait Till Next Year\\"Doris Kearns GoodwinISBN 0-684-84795-7This memoir of Doris Kearns Goodwin's childhood on Long Island brings back memories of growing up the 1950's. She tells how all the neighbors in her subdivision knew one another, how their children played together through all the houses, and how the first neighbor to get a television set in 1946 invited all the others over to watch, at a time when there were only 7,000 sets in the entire country. Mrs. Goodwin's story of following the ill-starred Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team along with her family and most of her community of Rockville Center evokes a melancholy for an America that slipped imperceptibly away from those of us who lived through the time.I long ago ceased to care about major league baseball and the millionaires who play it. They go where the money is, but the players of the fifties mainly stayed with the same team for most of their careers. Reading the names of the 1950's Brooklyn lineups in this book -- names like Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese, Roy Campanella, Gil Hodges, Don Newcombe, Duke Snyder, Preacher Roe, and Johnny Podres - re-acquainted me with my long lost knowledge of the teams and players of those days.It was charming to read about how the young Doris Kearns schemed to break Gil Hodges out of a hitting slump one year by giving him her St. Christopher's medal and how much she treasured a long-sought autograph finally obtained from Jackie Robinson, major league baseball's first black player.The portraits that Mrs. Goodwin paints of her mother, who died when the author was fifteen, and her father are created with fine strokes. Her frail mother taught her to respect people, such as a poor, elderly Ukrainian woman in a rundown house whom the neighborhood children thought was a witch. Her father gave her a guide for the struggles of life through a love of baseball and loyalty to the long-suffering Dodgers.From 1941 through 1953, six times the Dodgers won the National League championship and six times they faced the New York Yankees in the World Series and lost. But in 1955, the Brooklyn Dodgers played the Yankees a final time in the Series and won, four games to three. In a fifteen-minute period that followed the game more phone calls were made in the immediate area than at any time since VJ day. Trading on the New York Stock Exchange pretty much came to a standstill. Thousands of people converged on Brooklyn to dance in the streets.The headline the next morning in \\"The New York Daily News\\", with a twist on the hopeful slogan that had been the watchword of Dodger fans for years, read, \\"This is Next Year!\\"It is fitting that Mrs. Goodwin, a well-known presidential historian, endowed her own sons with a love of the game of baseball. After all, one of the better things that one learns from sports, as this book affirms, is to take pride in the accomplishments of the past and to look forward optimistically to the future."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"I concur with the many who gave an outstanding review of this book. Those who panned it dismissed it as boring or ordinary. They are missing what is best about this book. As an historian Ms. Goodwin is telling the history of an ordinary childhood -- a childhood many of us can relate to. It is a celebration of being 'ordinary' -- and the fond memories it brings back for so many of us. It is the enthusaism she brings to her story that makes this book so wonderful. My childhood too, on the surface, was 'ordinary' -- but, like the author, it is a story near and dear to my heart. Few of us can relate to the events in a biography of JFK or FDR -- but many of us can relate to these events. It is the way she describes these events that makes this such a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin captures the essence of the post WWII era, when many New York City families were finally able to move from the city and have their own homes in the suburbs. As I was one of those families, we also brought our love for baseball. If you came from the Bronx, you remained a Yankee fan and if you came from Brookln, as Doris did, you loved the Dodgers. This book was sweet and poignant especially for me. And that is because I spent part of my childhood in the same town that she did...Rockville Centre, NY.. I graduated the same High School , South Side, that she did ...just a few years ahead of her. We shared some of the same teachers and memories. It brought me back to time 50 years ago when we faced some different and yet some of the same problems that we face today. This was a story told with tenderness and love and I loved all of it.Steve Bank , SouthSide '54"},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin is famous for her biographies, especially the Pulitzer Prize winning, NO ORDINARY TIME. Her new book, though, is not about someone else's life, it's about her own. &quot;When I was six, my father gave me a bright-red score book that opened my heart to the game of baseball.&quot; Goodwin begins to recall the game that was her childhood into this &quot;score book&quot;. Although the cover of her memoir, WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR, is not bright-red, it serves it's purpose well. Goodwin writes a &quot;play by play&quot; account of her life from the time she first recieved that score book till the end of her childhood at age fifteen. Underlying it all is her passion for baseball and the New York Dodgers and her hope that they will win the World Series. The author attributes her love of narration to baseball. Every day, Goodwin would recount to her father, using the system he taught her, that day's game as he got her ready for bed. As well as a sign of her father's love, this ritual introduced her to the art of storytelling. &quot;It would instill me in an early awareness of the power of the narrative, which would introduce me to a lifetime of storytelling...&quot; This book is filled with poignant stories about the relationships between the author and her family and friends. It also draws on the many experiences of Goodwin's from her first trip to Ebbet's Field, to her hero, Jackie Robinson. There are stories about her religious experiences as a Catholic, her obsession with James Dean and how, at first, television brought her neighborhood together. The significance of the era is portrayed well. For me, this book was particularly interesting because of my own love of baseball. Just reading it made me long for those hot summer days when major league baseball is played. I can also simpathize with Goodwin over how many times her team came close to winning the World Series. As a Cleveland Indian fan, I have been waiting my whole life for the Indians to be crowned champions. They have not one a World Series since my Dad was born, in 1948. This theme of resulted in the title of her book, a popular saying among Dodgers fans,&quot;Wait till next year&quot;. Not only did the story amaze me, Goodwin is an extraordinary writer. Her writing clearly and smoothly tells her story. I could almost hear her narrate the book while once in a while two characters would have a conversation. I could visualize it all too. WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR is a passionate, well written, captivating book. A must read for all!"},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I bought this one as a gift for one of my sons as I lost my own copy because I have given it out several times to friends to read and, somehow, it went astray.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"I have seen Presedential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin appear many times on TV political talk shows. I have also heard her speak on several occasions about her love for the Brooklyn Dodgers. You can imagine mydelight when I came across a copy of her 1997 book Wait Till Next Year: A Memoir at a used book sale. A favorite topic of mine--The Brooklyn Dodgers-- by a favorite writer. This memoir recounts Doris' childhood in the 40s and 50s in Brooklyn and later in Rockville Center, NY.Goodwin uses the season-to-season rhythms of baseball to create the arch of her formative years. She uses this baseball canvass to weave several distinct plot lines, involving family, community, catholicism, and world events. The book is about baseball, but baseball is not its central theme, far from it.Doris has nothing but wonderful memories of her parents; each somewhat flawed, her mother dying at the age of 51 and being sick for most of Doris&iexcl; early life. Her father had experienced the death of two siblings and both parents, the last from suicide as a boy and was shipped off to a foster home. Neither parents' situation seemed to negatively impact Doris' relationship with her parents. On the contrary, it helped broaden her appreciation of her parents; an unusual trait for a youngster.Doris grew up the youngest of three sisters by a number of years which thrust her into adult-type conversations. This experience gave her the traits of inquisitiveness and precociousness. This familial experience also seemed to have left her with an indomitably positive personCa trait which comes across throughout her book.Even during the apparent idyllic time of the 50s, many unsettling historical events took place, the polio epidemic, McCarthyism, Little Rock School integration, and nuclear air raid drills being among them.Doris writes about both the Dodgers and the Giants leaving New York city for the West Coast and uses that incident to talk about how the old neighborhood had changed as well, many families moved out to further their careers and status in life as well as the demise of the corner drug store and local butcher shop--both closed down. It seems the end of her childhood perfectly coincided with this dramatic move of two of NYC's homegrown treasures and the disappearance of her beloved neighborhood.Wait contains many wonderful stories from her childhood.--How she and best friend Elaine shared a blanket during the Summer with dueling radios, Doris&iexcl; with Red Barber announcing for the Dodgers while Elaine's radio was tuned to Mel Allen broadcasting for the arch enemies, the Yankees.--Doris had a running friendly rivalry with a local butcher shop who owners were rabid fans of the Giants. After Bobby Thomson's historic home run in 1951, Doris couldn&iexcl;t get herself to visit the butcher shop until they sent her a bouquet of flowers.--How Doris was nervous during her first Catholic confession because she had to admit to the Priest that she wished ill of the opposing teams' players.Priest: And what else my child?\\"Doris: \\"I wished harm to Allie Reynolds.\\"Priest: The Yankee pitcher?&iexcl; he asked, surprise and concern in his voice. &iexcl;And how did you wish to harm him?\\"Doris: \\"I wanted him to break his arm.\\"Priest: \\"And were there others\\"Doris: \\"Oh , yes,\\" I admitted. \\"I wished that Robin Roberts of the Philies would fall down the steps of his stoop, and that Richie Ashburn would break his hand.\\"Priest: \\"For your pennance, say two Hail Marys, three Our Fathers, and, &iexcl; he added, with a chuckle, \\"say a special prayer for the Dodgers. Now say the Act of Contrition.\\"Excerpted from pp 107-108 Wait Till Next Year 1997 Harcover edition.Kearns Goodwin is a gifted storyteller.

Will continue to use your services."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"My son gave me this book for Christmas knowing that I grew up in the 50's and loved the Dodgers. As I read it I was thinking it was as if it was my life story . . . well, except I'm just bit older, grew up in Oklahoma, I'm not Catholic, my mother is still alive at age 91, I've never seen a Dodger's game in person, I'm the oldest in my family, I'm not a Democrat, my relationship with my dad was not as close (he worked all the time and didn't care for \\"games\\") . . . well, except for all that my story is almost the same as Doris Kearns Goodwin's. We lived in a small town where MLB was only a voice on the radio. Still, we kids had our favorite teams. I was in about the fourth grade when my best friend announced she was a Yankee fan and since the Yankees were playing the Dodgers, just to be contentious I suppose, I became a Dodger fan. I learned what \\"bleeding Dodger blue\\" meant and began to learn the names of the players. Gil Hodges was my favorite. I read the sports page and soon figured out how to understand the box scores. Then, lo and behold, our town got a D class minor league team which was part of the Dodgers farm system. They even wore cast-off Dodger uniforms and eventually a couple even made it to the \\"bigs.\\" So while, unlike Doris who actually interacted with the \\"real\\" Dodgers I did have a taste of the boys in blue all the way out here in the southwest. My life also wasn't as touched by the political atmosphere of the 50s as Doris's was, probably because of where we live, but as she related the events it did bring back memories. Our school had already integrated before the Little Rock incident. And I had a boyfriend who wanted us to go out and look for Sputnik, too. And although I was confused when the Dodgers moved to California I wasn't as personally distressed as Doris. But the bringing in of TV, the playing with the kids in the neighborhood, moms who were always home, teachers who taught instead of filling out government forms, all those beautiful memories . . . thanks, I was a wonderful life"},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"In Wait Till Next Year, Doris Kearns Goodwin revisits her own childhood in 1950s Brooklyn. There are eight chapters, each more or less dedicated to one year of her youth. Because of the growing nature of childhood, each year also addresses its own themes--even though the underlying theme of this memoir is her relationship to the Brooklyn Dodgers. I rarely find myself visualizing any written work particularly clearly, and so it is a great compliment I pay to Doris Kearns Goodwin when I say that I lost myself in a vivid, nearly tangible, recreation of her childhood.From her mother (ailing with \\"the heart of a seventy year old woman\\") to next door neighbor Elaine, from Jackie Robinson to the local Giants fan butchers who called her \\"Ragmop,\\" no one is simply background for her life. I am still in awe of how, at six years of age, she would listen to every radio broadcast of every game and keep score throughout all nine innings so she could recreate the games in their entirety for her father at night. There are heartbreaking passages of loss; I literally teared up during the epilogue.I came of age forty years after Kearns Goodwin in a small town outside Louisville, Kentucky and yet her vivid portrayal of so many universal themes made this one of the most accessible memoirs I have yet read. Do not Wait Till Next Year; put this at the top of your reading queue."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"This moving story appeals at multiple levels. Baseball fans will, of course, enjoy it, and Ms. Kearns Goodwin's ability to intertwine her personal tale with the events of the times make the book well worth the time for anyone who enjoys looking into our country's past, or, quite simply, anyone who enjoys a good story. She makes the reader laugh on one page, and before the end of the next, they're crying."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"More than just a story about baseball - a story about growing up in the fifties.

Her characters have a poignant humanity with all its heroic and fallible qualities. The book is a long one, but if you're interested in the subject matter, there's no one better than Doris Kearns Goodwin to hear it from."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin, more popularly known as an historian, has written a moving memoir of her childhood in Long Island as a Brooklyn Dodgers fan. Admittedly insular, her upbringing in Rockville Center was one filled mostly with joy, but with a dark shadow cast by her mothers ailing health. Her father, a New York State bank examiner (boy could we use him now), was a great Dodgers fan, as was Kearns. They enjoyed the game together and had great moments of bonding via the Dodgers' trials and tribulations. Their story mirrors the story of many readers who deepen their bonds with their children via following their favorite teams.The reader gets a detailed view of the tight knit community from a secular perspective, but also from Kearn's Catholic upbringing. As Anne Rice does inCalled Out of Darkness: A Spiritual Confession, Kearns evokes the visceral power of pre-Vatican II Catholicism, in its rites and rituals, as well as in its daily living.Kearns acknowledges the shortcomings and anxieties of the era: the de facto segregation in her community's housing and schools, the threat of nuclear war during the Cold War, as well as the impact of McCarthyism. These are the backdrops of her baseball stories, from her detailed scorecard keeping, to her meeting Jackie Robinson and Gil Hodges, to the perennial loses in the World Series to Yankees, the rivalry with the Giants, and the Dodgers' series win in 1955.This is obvioulsy more than just a baseball fans memoir; it is also a moving memoir about life in the 1950's, and specially about the relationship between a father and his daughter."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"In Doris Goodwin's memoir, we have a more detailed about the effect t.v. had in the Fifties and the harm it may have caused worldwide. Television came to the masses with Howdy Doody Time, Milton Berle, Superman, and early soap operas. \\"You Are There\\" was a series of historical dramas of selected important moments such as the capture of John Wilkes Booth. Using re-enactments and \\"eyewitness\\" accounts, the aim was to provide viewers with a sense that they were actually present.As all the neighborhood acquired sets with larger screens, everyone had an opinion about the guilt of the Rosenbergs (photos of them and another of their two sons was included) case in 1953. A year later, Senator Joe McCarthy accused a multitude of professionals in varied fields as communists, ruining careers far and wide. His reckless arrogance and political aspirations showed to the entire nation that he was a \\"self-aggrandizing bully\\" (such are still active).So often in life, it is our desire to be loved and we tend to fall victim to our own making. Because we believe it is what is expected in order to have the love of someone else, we compromise who we truly are. We create a false image. We have given our power and a piece of ourselves to the person loved. We have left our centeredness and given away a part of our self-wholeness. We can never be truly happy until we live our own lives. The children's game of McCarthyism was a version of accusation, personal attack, and bitter dispute. \\"Our game created rifts between us, dividing into rival camps, until we finally grew tired and a little afraid, of the anxiety and the nastiness.\\"Her memoir shows vividly the genteel way of life in the 50s as researched and lived by an experienced historian. Using the tools acquired in investigating the biographies of famous Americans, she proves the innocent lifestyle back then and shows the good ways young girls lived relatively without worry, when talent was more important more than wealth. She also touches on some of the bad, like polio, communism (and names those involved), and the atom bomb and its consequences."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"I love the way Doris Kearns Goodwin writes.

It was particularlypoignant to read about her own life. I shared her love for the good old Dodgers, and especially Jackie Robinson, so it was personal for me.

I am a Doris Kearns Goodwin fan and this gave me insight not only into her childhood, the Dodgers, the history of the time, but also into what made her the amazing historian she is!"},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin, a noted journalist, changes gears with this memoir of growing up on Long Island in the 50s. Her dad taught her how to score a Dodgers baseball game when she was six; she believed that he would miss out on the game if she didn't keep an accurate scorecard and narrate the action when he returned from his job each day. The longer and more entertaining her narration was, the longer she was able to spend in his company; she credits him with giving her confidence in her story-telling abilities. As she recounts the golden era of baseball (3 teams, remember--Giants, Yankees, and her fave, the Dodgers), the reader also learns the history of a special time. The 1950s were not idyllic in any way--polio epidemic, Cold War, McCarthyism--yet her neighborhood and her country were united through the love of baseball. A fabulous read, even if you're not a baseball fan."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"A great job a sharing her life experiences from a time not so long ago, but seemingly so far away. Brilliant recollection and observations of life in the 50's."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"I enjoyed parts of this book. The parts I enjoyed were the parts that did not go into detail about baseball. The story of her life was well written and interesting and baseball was a part of her life. There was just too much information about individual games, pennant races etc for me. What the author included about growing up in the 50's and 60's was the reason I gave it 3 stars."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"I once asked my parents whether the 1950s were as idyllic as that era is depicted today, and they answered no. I couldn't get them to explain their assessment any further, but I've always wanted someone to tell me more.Well, Doris Kearns Goodwin falls cleanly in the camp of those who idealize the era, as a girl growing up in the 1950s amid the tight-knit Brooklyn community of Rockville Centre. Her obsessive love of the Brooklyn Dodgers informs her days, creates a lasting bond with her father and even opens her path as a writer, as she learns about the power of narrative from keeping baseball stats.I'm someone who normally wants fact over fantasy, but I was willing to go along with Ms. Kearns Goodwin, because she is painting a picture of her childhood either as she lived it or as she remembers it. While reading, I was actually jealous that someone got to live this sort of innocent and carefree childhood, protected from the ills of the larger world, cocooned in the loving arms of adults who nurture and love but do not hover.Growing up as I did in a family that never once discussed current events or even seemed the least bit interested in the wider world, I was eager to hear how the monumental events of the day affected the author's family and neighborhood: the McCarthy hearings, the Cold War, Sputnik and the civil rights movement, even a deadly train crash whose horror both attracts and repels Ms. Kearns Goodwin.I'm a baseball fan myself, so I appreciated the author's narrative driven as it is by the fortunes (or not) of her beloved Dodgers. I can't imagine any child today being so wholly devoted to a baseball team; it's a different game today. But even for the fan, there can be too much play-by-play. I skipped large portions of the book, as I really don't see the point of rehashing old games to the extent the author does.All in all, though, Ms. Kearns Goodwin writes evocatively about a gentle childhood that doesn't seem possible in an America we can hardly even imagine today. That's an impressive feat, as Tolstoy's famous observation inAnna Kareninathat \\"happy families are all alike\\" could doom a narrative of an era that millions shared."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"The first time I heard of Doris Kearns Goodwin was in 1994 when she was interviewed for the Ken Burns' baseball documentary. When I bought the DVD set a few years back, I again enjoyed Goodwin's interviews for the series. When I saw this book awhile back in a used bookstore, I bought it. This book was a wonderful read, one of the best baseball books that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin has written an endearing book on her growing up in the fifties. My 10 plus rating certainly has been effected by the fact that I too grew up in the fifties, was a Brooklyn Dodger fan, and was raised Catholic. Her relationship with her father and mother stand out to me. Prospective parents would benefit from reading about how she received love from both her mother and her father despite past and present family difficulties. During the early fifties it seemed like the Dodgers were never going to win a World Series. But in 1955 it finally happened. Ms. Goodwin writes so vividly about the day of the Brooklyn victory in October of that year. The agony of the Bobby Thompson homer, the scare of polio, her innocent and diverse neighborhood, the fear of nuclear attack, the beauty of non-free-agent, non-exhorbitant salary baseball are all deftly written about. Her first confession and first communion stories will be enjoyed whether or not you know much about the pre-Vatican II Catholic church. I found myself laughing and crying a lot as walked through Doris' childhood. I really regretted reaching the last page knowing the journey and the joy had come to an end."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Ms. Goodwin knows how to tell a good story. In addition to telling us about her childhood in a New York City suburb in the 1950s, she also talks about the changes America was going through in this time period: economic development and the impact on the family, the beginnings of the civil rights movement, the \\"end\\" of baseball as the American pasttime. The book is well-written and very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Just re-read this book. Wonderful story about growing up in the sweetness of the 1950's, but also about overcoming childhood loss, to become a very successful person--author, wife and mother."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"It's been a while for me since I read this one, but one impression clearly stuck, happy bright childhood in the 1950's and, yes, baseball.It was overall well written memoir, very optimistic, full of childhood memories of a neighborhoodly and cozy streets and people.I think that besides being a well written woman's memoir a baseball fan should find the book to be a treat as well."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"I enjoyed this book the first and second time I read it. Doris Kerns Goodwin writes about her early years in post-war Long Island with grace.This memoir reads like a charming novel - the details are wonderful, the characters are people we come to care about, and young Doris is someone you will smile with and cry with.I've recommended this book to friends and students (I teach adult ed creative writing workshops). Everyone thanks me. If you want a good book by a good author check this one out. If you're considering writing your own memoir study WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR to see how it should be done!"},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"The book sent me back to a time I only heard about growing up. What leasons we all can learn from that simpler time. Doris truly admired her parents - what a rare find these days. Her father was an endearing man - I loved the way he hid from Doris the fact that the box scores were available in the newspaper every day strictly to allow Doris her time with his undivided attention. What self-esteem and pride he instilled with such ease. The fond memories Doris has of her mother and how she helped her with her studies with the box of oreo cookies jogged some old memories, too! The impressions that her parents left on Doris are those that I can only hope to leave with my children.Doris' account of her First Penance is priceless. As a Catholic, it brought back such memories of the lessons and memorization we all went through! As a baseball fan, it truly relayed the excitement of the time and how baseball was meant to be played &amp; followed.Thank you, Doris, for sending me into a time about which I have only heard. With both of my parents gone, it gave me an opportunity to re-visit the stories of their young adulthood. I only wish that they were alive to encourage them to read it. They would then be able to thank you themselves."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"I found this book difficult to put down. Doris tells her story with great humor and also with great love and tears. When she speaks of her love of baseball and of sharing this love with her Father, I can only think of growing up the same way with my own Dad. I am already sharing this same love with my own daughter. I would encourage anyone to read this charming story. Oh but for those simpler, sweeter days."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Wait Till Next Year is an incredible book, and one of my favorites if not my absolute favorite.When I read this book I almost felt like I was in the fifties in Rockville County. She talked about how her mother was a housewife, her father a banker coming home in the evening and how she and her friends played games in the streets.It is very descriptive about her relationship with her father and how she made scorecards and talked about baseball to her father when he came home from work.It told about baseball and the many downfalls in the World Series and the Dodger fan's famous call \\"Wait till next year.\\" The book told about Jackie Robinson and the racism going on in baseball and the United States. And in 1955 when Brooklyn won their only championship, and the sadness and Robinson going 2 the Giants.Another part of this book was about the politics during the time. In the time of the Cold War, McCarthyism, Nixon, and new televisions in homes.I recommend this book strongly even though it is based on a period way before my time."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"I, too, grew up on Long Island in the 50s and early 60s (two years in Queens and ten years out on \\"duh oyland\\".) I'm a few years younger; the Dodgers were already in Hollywood and I rooted for the hated Jankees. But the images of this beautiful memoir were so resonant with my childhood, from soothing sound of Red Barber's voice coming from the tinny transistor radio to the edicts from the diocese of Rockville Centre, read periodically in lieu of a Sunday sermon, mostly asking for more money.I have only occasionally returned to Long Island since we moved away when I was 14, and like everywhere else, it is just not the same. Ms. Goodwin's experiences are just about as close as I have ever come to going back home. For those of our generation who grew up in parts of the country other than Long Island, I believe, at least I hope, that these recollections can return you to that wonderful time the way they did for me."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"As a college drop out I am not what many people might consider well read. While school was never my strong suit, and studying was an event that rarely ever happened, I did manage to read a few great books along the way. My first and best semester of college I read Wait 'til Next Year. While I am not a fan of sports and am not competitive at all, this book was beautifully written and takes the reader on a tour through the author's life, all in the language of baseball. Using the sport as a way to framework the personal story was a wise choice as it gives great metaphors and context to the tale. I suppose I also have good memories tied into the novel as well, considering that I did really well grade-wise that semester and I remember really enjoying this book when I read it at that time."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"This is a poignant, amusing, very readable memoire that blurs the line between social history, baseball history, and story-telling. One entertaining account follows another as the author talks about growing up as a woman, as a baseball fan, and a Brooklynite. Great stuff."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"This book was really a great book. I understood what she was going through an dhow she felt about baseball because I have felt the same emotions even though I am a Yankee fan. I couldn't help but think &quot;Go Yankees&quot; even though I felt compassion for her wanting her team to win."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"This book was enjoyable on so many levels. Having grown up in the NY area the neighborhood described in this lovely book was very similar to my own right down to the butcher shop staffed by diehard Giant fans. I loved every minute that I spent reminiscing with Ms. Kearns Goodwin. Highly rcommended."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin does a delightful job of writing of those days which seemed so much simpler; when neighborhoods were safer, when baseball was played on grass. This is not just a baseball book, but a documentary of Americana and a young girl's journey to adulthood. Within that autobiography is the story of the sometimes rocky, yet magical path of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Very smartly written."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin took my hand and lead me back through my own recollection of a very special time. I was back to my own family, buddies, neighbors, barber, school, and corner store -- where an entire neighborhood and store owner helped me collect the 1,000 Ted's Rootbeer bottle caps needed for a baseball autographed by Ted Williams. Her description of her first visit to Ebbets Field put me right back to my my first visit to Fenway Park. Yes, the first sight of that green grass struck me too. She blended history, a child's perspective, nostalgia and a tribute to the 50's with one remarkable, fascinating book. Thank you, Doris!"},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Only rarely does a book strike a chord with such resonance. Ms Goodwin engages us with the deftness of a master as we consider her childhood feats and fears in the context of community (a richly textured neighborhood), diversity (accommodating her friends and neighbors of varying religious backgrounds and baseball team devotions), and family (where father stimulates her intellectual development by teaching her the intricacies of baseball scoring -- and uses her prowress to create some special times for sharing)."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Being a male baseball fan who has lost both parents and is exactly 10 days younger than Doris Kearns Goodwin, I read &quot;Wait Till Next Year-A Memoir&quot; with smiles and tears. Reading this touching account of growing up in a era of innocence and simplicity that will never again be experienced, I was reminded that true emotion has no gender. Although written from a female perspective, I found myself sharing many of her concerns, fears, and reflections just as though we had grown up on the same block. This is a great, quick read, and serves as a reminder of the time, traditions, and love that is so important to share with our children and grand-children. Thanks Doris!"},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Like the author, memories of my childhood are also mingled with baseball. I could no more separate my childhood from George Brett and the Royals than I could from my family. Even though her story took place 30 years before mine, just by reading the book I could feel the ebb and flow of how the game pulled us as young women through our adolescence and how we returned to it in adulthood. This is a wonderful book that is written simply and beautifully."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"This book brought me to a place I have never been, but have always admired in the few generations that preceed me. Having lost my parents at a young age, Ms. Kearns-Goodwin recount of her own childhood in NY in the company of wonderment and baseball made me long for a parent to sit by, who would continue to tell me tales of the 40's and 50's, so that I could re-live what it was like to be an American then. I picked this book up at an airport bookstore, and never put it down until it was over, which was, in my opinion, much too soon. Thank you, Ms. Kearns- Goodwin, for writing about your life. Perhaps I could relate because my mother grew up in NYC under similar circumstances, or because I spent a great deal of my life attending grad school near Ms. Kearns-Goodwin's hometown of Rockville Center, but regardless of why I liked it these memoirs will remain in my library for years to come, and will, no doubt, be bringing tears to my eyes with each subseqent reading. I only hope my own children can appreciate it someday, as a substitute for the stories their own grandmother might have told them, about baseball, childhood, love of family and loss."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Within the pages of Doris Goodwin's affectionate, poignant, and nostalgic memoir of growing up in the 50's, the notion that &quot;you can never go back again&quot; is proved false. Though I'm 6 years younger than the author, and was a childhood resident of the West Coast rather than the East, her memories transported me back to a time when life was as carefree and golden as it would ever be. If only we'd known. Her Fantasy Theater was my Bay Theater, her St. Agnes my Corpus Christi, her Bryn Mawr Meat Market my Slutzky's, her Dugan's Bakery man my Helm's truck, and her Dodger heroes Robinson, Campanella, Snyder, Hodges, Reese and Roe my Koufax, Drysdale, Howard, Wills, Fairly and Davis. Forty years have since past, and life has been , and is, very good. However, the Bay Theater is closed, Big D is dead, the Helm's Building is a shopping mall, and Corpus Christi has lost its relevance. I'm weary of the media's assault on my senses with endless accounts of drive-by shootings, excesses of political correctness, presidential peccadilloes, OJ and his ilk, and the deeds of strident, ofttimes violent, true believers of every sort.Thank you, Doris, for taking me &quot;home&quot; again."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"I completely enjyed every page of Wait Till Next Year. I must admit that I am a baseball fan who grew up on Long Island and that made this book very endearing to me. I am also a huge fan of Goodwin's other works. I am a child of the seventies though and not the fifities. Ms. Goodwin's prose, while simple, did suceed in bringing Southward Avenue to life for me. One can almost feel the excitement at Ebbetts field. It held my attention from start to finish ( I actually read the whole book on a very long plane trip) I do admit that I felt that Ms. Goodwin could have probed a bit deeper into the break up of her town as a community. I also felt a bit like the book came to an abrupt end - I wanted to find out more about the changes that took place in Rockville Center. All in all I loved the book. She truly captured an era and intertwined it with some great baseball stories. If you are at all a lover of the game it is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Memoir of Doris Kearns' younger years, as an avid Brooklyn Dodgers fan. Although baseball was her obsession, the story is about much more than baseball - it's about life in the 50's, childhood spent outside or at the corner soda shop, the importance the community had at that time, and the troubles and changes that adolescence brings.Great memoir, and incredibly well written and told. I thought the book was excellent, even though I glossed over the baseball parts of it! Read this for my library book group, I never would've picked this one up on my own."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"One of the best things about reading is getting to share lives very different from the reader's own. In the hands of a truly gifted writer the reader can experience people, places and events that would never have touched him/her otherwise. Such is true of WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR.In the New York of the 1950s when summer meant lazy days and baseball, and everyone met at the corner drugstore for ice cream sodas and egg creams, the entire world seemed to be either Yankee fans or Dodger fans. Goodwin's skillful portrayal of that world charms and fascinates. Hers was a happy and lively childhood filled with love of family and friends and The Brooklyn Dodgers.Time must pass, though, and children must become adults. The end of Goodwin's childhood is marked by the death of her Mother and the removal of the Dodgers to Los Angeles in the late 1950s. She has captured the charm of the period, a period that looks innocent enough to us now but was fraught with danger and fear of the unknown at the time.Although times change and the world evolves, memories keep a joyous past alive in the hearts that experienced it. What a blessing it is to us all that Goodwin can wield a mighty pen to bring her personal history along with the story of the gilded age of baseball alive for those of us who were blessed with other stories.Sunnye Tiedemann (aka Ruth F.

What could be a boring life story, Doris Kearns Goodwin makes everything exciting, and a story worth telling. The book is an autobiography of her life. One story of hers that I especially liked is the author explaining her plan for her neighborhood to be safe if they got bombed by Russia. She explained that underneath the local stores were connected basements, large enough to fit her whole neighborhood to fit it. She would bring Monopoly, so she wouldn't be bored, and most importantly, her baseball cards.The main character, the author, was a girl who thought differently than most young girls. She had many questions on religion, current events, and her family history, all at a young age. She explained things with comparisons like how when the Dogers left Brooklyn and Jackie Robinson retired, a chapter in her life closed.I would recomend this book to almost anyone.

More than that, it is one of the outstanding books of any sort that you're likely to find. To me, this is not a baseball book.

Has anyone ever been better at using small stories to state great truths?"},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It took me back to my childhood and brought back good feelings of growing up in the late 50s. Goodwin descriptions of life in suburbia were charming and right on. She is a very good writer and I was held captive to her story throughout the book. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys baseball trivia and the game or anyone who remembers the good old baseball era. It was short and interesting."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Goodwin grew up in New York in the 40's, and this memoir tracks her Brooklyn Dodgers through their World Series win in 1956."},{"Title":"Wait till next year","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin took a break from national history to get personal in this 1997 memoir of her experiences growing up a Long Island girl in the 1940s and 1950s rooting for the hard-luck Brooklyn Dodgers. Like Bob and Ray used to say, her loss is your gain.I admit approaching this book with some trepidation. Clearly the book was inspired by Goodwin's participation as one of many talking pinheads on Ken Burns' self-important 1994 TV documentary \\"Baseball.\\" On that show, where various hoi pollois traded their mortarboards for Yankee caps and extolled the Wagnerian ideal of a Whitey Ford fastball, Goodwin was a frequent, annoying presence, obviously trotted in to water down the testosterone as if George Will wasn't enough to accomplish that.And for the first hundred pages of this not-big book, I felt justified in my prejudices, as Goodwin fills her pages with pat descriptions of suburban life loosely connected to a baseball team she writes about her enthusiasm for without any evident enthusiasm.But once the book got going, my opinion changed. That happened when little Catholic Doris enters a confessional before her first Holy Communion. With wholesome piety, she tells the priest her darkest, most sinful secret: A wish that Yankee pitcher Allie Reynolds would break his arm.That's not all. \\"I wished that Enos Slaughter of the Cards would break his ankle, that Phil Rizzuto of the Yanks would fracture a rib, and that Alvin Dark of the Giants would hurt his knee.\\"The priest is put out, not at her fantasies of carnage but because he's a Dodgers fan, too: \\"I believe they will win the World Series someday fairly and squarely,\\" he tells her. \\"You don't need to wish harm on others to make it happen.\\"But it's easy to imagine Doris thinking otherwise, especially after Bobby Thomson slams a Ralph Branca fastball along with the Dodgers' hopes for making the Series in 1951. As Goodwin writes about that and later seasons, her account takes on a riveting poignancy that reminds one why Goodwin's books are so celebrated in the first place, not for her originality as a historian but for her synthesizing skill as a writer.She even gets the chance to see her heroes close up, and unlike the baseball stars of today, they don't disappoint. Gil Hodges accepts her gift of a St. Christopher medal to help him out of a batting slump with gentle affection. Jackie Robinson signs her autograph book with a bit of hard-earned wisdom: \\"Keep your smile a long, long while.\\"No, the book's not perfect. It starts slow, and her attempts to tie her childhood in with big stories of the day like the Army-McCarthy hearings and the integration standoff in Little Rock feel like strained, politically correct cocktail chatter rather than a real accounting of a young life amid confusing times.But most of the way through, you get a really sweet and sharp picture of what it was like to care about baseball when it was worth caring about. Goodwin has a gift for making history live again in the pages of her books, and like Ebbets Field, presents her readers here with a real diamond in the rough."},{"Title":"Shirobamba: A Childhood in Old Japan","review":"This classic is a moving portrait of a Japanese childhood. The main character, Kasuko, (the young Yashushi Inoue) is skilfully drawn and sympathetic. The book focusses on his confusions growing up in a complicated family atmosphere and his feelings towards various female members of that family, notably his adopted grandmother, with whom he lives, his absent mother and his aunt (whom he sees as an older sister). The book is readable, beautifully written and well-translated. The only shortcoming is that this is a translation only of Volume One. Volume Two appears not to have been translated at all."},{"Title":"Psychology: Themes and Variations (with Concept Charts and InfoTrac)","review":"Although books were provided for us in my AP Psychology class, I opted to buy my own in order to take notes and annotate throughout the book.

It's merely volume five, The Middle Ages, and the TOC is not active. Since the complete set is fifteen volumes, it's more than a little bizarre that only volume 5 is included."},{"Title":"MO Burdekin","review":"The wet came that year with a cock-eye-bob; loud thunder, ragged streams of lightning and a wind of awful fury ... Now there was nothing in the whole wide river but tossing water, uprooted trees, a few bandicoots and kangaroo rats feebly struggling still, and an old wooden cradle carved with grapes and acanthus leaves in which a dirty brown baby sat drooling with bubbles at his mouth, snatching at the twigs and floating grassheads as he floated onwards, southwards, on the broad tossing breast of the Burdekin.So begins the life of Mo Burdekin, washed ashore into the arms of the riverside storekeeper, Reuben Abraham. Reuben, in all Hebraic honesty, can name the waif nothing but Moses Burdekin.Sarah Campion's novel evokes the struggling lives of North Queensland in the late nineteenth century. In a fever for gold, Mo moves irrepressibly from one mining site to another. But like his childhood home, Lucy's Gold, he chases fool's gold and fails to see the riches around him. Only Lucy Bates can make him open his eyes to see."},{"Title":"SmartStart Guitar: A Fun, Easy Approach to Beginning Guitar for Kids","review":"I bought this book for children who have some experience on piano and also have other guitar books. This book does not use standard tuning so the chords and other fingering learned are different than normal. Children cannot use this method with any other guitar book or chord reference book. It is good if you want to get very young children to be able to do something. However, it is limited in that you cannot carry the fingering knowledge beyond the book. You would be able to carry the strum patterns beyond this book."},{"Title":"SmartStart Guitar: A Fun, Easy Approach to Beginning Guitar for Kids","review":"It may be a SmartStart for kids, but I love it too. I don't play the guitar so I bought this book to start working with my 6 year old. He thinks it is great but now I'm hooked and finding myself learning to play! I love the CD that comes with the book. I put the kids to bed at night and sneak away with the book and my son's guitar. I didn't stick with lessons when I was a child. Jessica Baron Turner's method is more fun because you are playing traditional(fun to sing) songs right away...day one. The CD helps you tune the guitar and make sure your chords and songs sound correct. You can also rewind and rewind and not feel embarrassed. It's a great bargain for (...) bucks and both my son and I are very happy with it."},{"Title":"SmartStart Guitar: A Fun, Easy Approach to Beginning Guitar for Kids","review":"This book looks fine enough for kids learning to play the guitar. I bought it for my son for Christmas, to accompany his recently new guitar. However, I was counting on the compact disc being included as stated in the title, but there was none. The book was still shrink wrapped, so I don't think it could have been taken out prior to the sale. Inquire with seller prior to purchasing."},{"Title":"SmartStart Guitar: A Fun, Easy Approach to Beginning Guitar for Kids","review":"This book's approach to teaching music is essentially on the mark. I believe it to be crucially important for students (young & old) to begin music making doing just that - playing as much as possible first without being encumbered too much by reading lots of notation. The CD recording is very good in that it starts students playing using a G tuning thereby allowing music making to be virtually immediate. However, as matters progress to standard tuning, the recording provides notes that are 1/2 flat of concert pitch (Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, Bb, Eb instead of E, A, D, G, B, E)! Odd, especially considering that the G tuning IS at correct pitch. Publisher needs to correct this ASAP!"},{"Title":"SmartStart Guitar: A Fun, Easy Approach to Beginning Guitar for Kids","review":"I'm very happy with the purchase.

Its focus is on the three levels of influence on a state's behavior: the interstate system, intrastate politics, and individual. It is one of the few entry-level IA books to discuss the effect of personality on the actions of a state. Even in my graduate-level seminars and papers, I found it to be useful."},{"Title":"Understanding International Conflicts: An Introduction to Theory and History","review":"First, it is vital for prospective buyers to understand that the existing reviews are three years out of date--this is a five-star tutorial on international relations that has been most recently updated after 9-11. If I were to recommend only two books on international relations, for any adult including nominally sophisticated world travelers, this would be the first book; the second would be Shultz, Godson, & Quester's wonderful edited work, \\"Security Studies for the 21st Century.\\"I really want to stress the utility of this work to adults, including those like myself who earned a couple of graduate degrees in the last century (smile). I was surprised to find no mention of the author's stellar service as Chairman of the National Intelligence Council--not only has he had full access to everything that can be known by secret as well as non-secret means, but he has kept current, and this undergraduate and affordable paperback was a great way for me--despite the 400+ books I've read (most of them reviewed on Amazon.com) in the past four plus years--to come up to speed on the rigorous methodical scholarly understanding of both historical and current theories and practices in international relations. This book is worth anyone's time, no matter how experienced or educated.Each chapter has a very satisfactory mix of figures, maps, chronologies, and photos--a special value is a block chart showing the causes for major wars or periods of conflict at the three levels of analysis--international system, national, and key individual personalities, and I found these quite original and helpful.Excellent reference and orientation work. Took five hours to read, with annotation--this is not a mind-glazer, it's a mind-exerciser."},{"Title":"Understanding International Conflicts: An Introduction to Theory and History","review":"The basis for \\"Understanding International Conflicts: An Introduction to Theory and History\\" is, as the author explains in the preface, a course on international conflicts in the modern world he taught for a long time in Harvard. Nye says that the aim of the book is \\"to introduce students to the complexities of international politics by giving them a good grounding in the traditional realist theory before turning to liberal and constructivist approaches that became more prominent after the Cold War\\". I believe he excels at doing exactly that...I found the book very interesting, and full of examples taken from history that made the concepts easier to grasp. Moreover, it takes into account the three levels of causation: the individual, the state and the international system. It also includes suggested reading material, that allows the reader to delve deeper in those subjects she/he finds more interesting...The book is very well organized. It was a foreword, a preface, 9 chapters and an index. Each chapter deals with a main theme, and some related topics. The themes of the chapters are:chapter 1:\\"Is there an enduring logic of conflict in world politics?\\";chapter 2: \\"Origins of the great 20th century conflicts\\";chapter 3: \\"Balance of power and World War I\\";chapter 4: \\"The failure of collective security and World War II\\";chapter 5: \\"The Cold War\\";chapter 6: \\"Intervention, institutions and regional and ethnic conflicts\\";chapter 7: \\"Globalization and interdependence\\";chapter 8: \\"The information revolution, transnational actors, and the diffusion of power\\";chapter 9: \\"A new world order?\\".All in all, I strongly recommend this book to those interested in international relations... I think the author was successful in doing what he set out to do: he didn't want to give all the answers, he merely tried to help the readers to look for them. In his own words: \\"provide our students with conceptual tools that will help them shape their own answers as the future unfolds\\".On the whole, a keeper :) Enjoy it !!!"},{"Title":"Understanding International Conflicts: An Introduction to Theory and History","review":"An interesting book indeed, written by an excellent writer who took me in a journey through history beginning with the Peloponnesian war and passing through world war one and two and the cold war after that, and ending with the new world order.The book starts with the two views of the anarchic politics ( Realism &amp; Liberalism ) and a very wise explanation for both of them, and I liked the way the writer analyzed the two world wars and their reasons and I agree with him about the inevitability part as I believe that the war wasn't inevitable but I quote him by saying \\"Ironically the belief that war is inevitable played a major role in causing it\\", and also the part about ethics and morality is very interesting and I liked what the French diplomat said when he was asked about what's moral and his answer was \\"what's moral is whatever is good for France\\", and also the part about counterfactuals was very exciting.I don't agree with the writer about some points concerning the Arab-Israeli conflict but the book as a whole is a very good one.I agree with the \\"back to the future\\" theory in some points as all I see now is \\"the strong do what they have the power to do and the weak accepts what they have to accept\\".I'll quote him again to end my review by saying \\"Has global society made war socially and morally unthinkable? We have to hope so, because the next hegemonic war would probably be the last\\"."},{"Title":"Understanding International Conflicts: An Introduction to Theory and History","review":"International Relations study without history is like cold cereal without milk; course, dry and empty. Nye does not present a history lesson outright but does give the reader a good sense of theory in context; theory from context. The first parts of the book demonstrate the dynamic approaches to the balance of power, the levels of IR analysis and the suggestions of inter-war idealism. Eventually Nye takes you to the bi-polar world, post WWII and with a little faith in his own work, promotes the effects of soft power.Just because Nye comes across as presenting history in terms of power and the balance of power the book isn't a billboard for realism. Nye describes the logic behind IR's three different moral views: amoral, international law, cosmopolitan morality. He explains why the state is the focus of the 'top' paradigms while not discounting the role of society and the individual. History is not pre-determined and neither was WWII. Individuals can shape history's trajectory as can the global economy, technology and population dynamics.Nye is not the only scholar to suggest that strategies like appeasement should be re-considered. There are positive examples of appeasement in history, Hitler's Germany is the outlier for many IR staples... and also the rule. As a result, the balance of power will not leave the IR lexicon. Finally, Nye examines ethnic conflict, international law and the claims of liberal internationalism. What role does the UN have and what role can it have? Nationalism and the sporadic bursts of self-determination continue to affect the world system. In the end, what is international law besides being a steering wheel for the powerful?One thing the world cannot avoid is global interdependency. Nye is not calling it a cure-all by any means but a force to be recognized. It contains within its expanse the potential for soft power approaches. Every theory has its legitimate points. But there will always be something to be said for power. I liked the book for its contextual reading of IR theory. It is descriptive, so don't look too hard for prescriptive analysis.A good basic look at IR theory."},{"Title":"Understanding International Conflicts: An Introduction to Theory and History","review":"I had to purchase this book as a second book for a class I had taken.

What I particularly like about the book, which I have used in my race relations classes, arre two things. First, it is comparative, allowing the reader to understand the significance of race and ethnicity precisely because we can directly compare the experience faced by minorities in three societies at once. Secondly, it is historical. Rather than giving us just a bunch of statistics about what racial groups earn more than others (which is there), it explains WHY and HOW racism emerged differently in each society beginning with the process of colonialism. (The title refers to the belief of the Aztecs (in Mexico) that the world had lived through four suns, after having been destroyed by the Gods three times. They expected a last destruction before the arrival of the fifth sun, and many believed that the Spanish conquest with its ordeals of pestilence and slavery was that destruction.) What is certain is that racism does exist in all three, but in very different ways. The rigid color bar of the United States is completely absent in Mexico and rarely applied in Canada. Russell shows how the economic and historical peculiarities of each society led to very different definitions of the significance of race. On the down side the book is somewhat expensive, since it was written as a textbook. It is also a bit too textbooky. It is very short for a textbook, however, which is both good and bad. Sometimes I find myself wanting more details, but there are relatively few places where I am bored. I feel it is better to leave a reader wanting more information than less, so this isn't too bad. Overall, I would rate it a great introduction to these topics. Its comparative basis makes it interesting to students of any one of the three nations covered while also giving its subject matter (race and class) greater significance."},{"Title":"After the Fifth Sun: Class and Race in North America","review":"Russell puts together a wounderful analysis of class and race in a cross-national perspective.

Though a bit outdated today this book would still serve well in that capacity, and in some ways is superior to books in use today.The primary area in which Billings might be considered outdated is in detailed strain analysis as elucidated by John Ramsay and others (\\"Folding and Fracturing of Rocks\\", \\"The Techniques of Modern Structural Geology: Vol. 1 'Strain Analysis' and Vol. 2 'Folds and Fractures'.\\"). While strain analysis is increasingly important, and indeed should be introduced even in a first course in structural geology, it is more important to acquaint the student to a broad range of structural phenomena and Billings does this quite well. Billings, both explicitly and via numerous examples implicitly, makes the connection between the study of structures and the necessary field work.Bilings defines the objectives of structural geology as: (1) What is the structure? (2) When did it develop? and (3) Under what physical conditions did it form? And as one reads his discussion of each topic the methods required to achieve these objectives are clearly stated. This is perhaps most impressive in the chapters on \\"granite tectonics\\", a topic largely ignored in some of the more recently written books.The clear lucid writing, focus on the objectives as defined above, and attention to geologic detail would open this book for consideration as a text today if it were to be republished. I recommend it (3rd edition) without reservation for anyone seriously interested in structural geology. Fortunately used copies can be obtained rather inexpensively from various Internet vendors."},{"Title":"The Rise And Fall of World Orders","review":"By examining the rise and fall of the Spanish, Dutch, British, French, and lastly the United States Knutsen, in my opinion, refutes some of the claims that have been directed toward the eventual fall of the United States as a world power. Knutsen shows that some of the theorectical claims in dealing with why major powers have fallen, and there is a solid basis as to why the theories are not entirely applicable.I do think and wish that to some degree, while he refutes the various theories and points out why they are not applicable in all of the situations that were addressed, that he had proposed a theory that might fit the various situations that were examined. Overall however, Knutsen's book is well written and even though it does address a serious topic in the realm of political science and international relations, he does make it so that the average person can read it and understand it. I recommend this book as a good overview as to some of the reasons great empires of the past have fallen and what maybe, we might expect in the future."},{"Title":"South from Hell-fer-Sartin: Kentucky Mountain Folk Tales.","review":"I believe this book was written by an anthropologist, who went into the Ozarks and interviewed the local folks, collecting their folk legands, stories, and jokes. He recorded each story word-for-word as they were told to him by people of all ages - young kids to senior citizens - trying to preserve the dialect in his word spellings.It's a good study of folklore, and makes for fun reading. I got a lot of laughs from it.By the way, the book gets its name from the area south of a creek called &quot;Hell-for-Certain,&quot; pronounced in the local dialect as &quot;Hell-fer-Sartin.&quot;I'd recommend it for cultural study, and especially for stress management. (A good laugh is excellent stress relief!)"},{"Title":"South from Hell-fer-Sartin: Kentucky Mountain Folk Tales.","review":"This book has many tales in it. Some are a lot better then others.

We change cars long before they are work out, and our thrift shops are filled with clothes showing almost no wear. And we are overweight.The complaints about American consumer habits have grown just about as fast. This book examines that critism from the end of the depression until 1979. The book has five broad themes:. the persistence of highly charged, moralistic attitudes to consumer culture. how certain writers embraceed psychology as an explanation for and a solution to social problems. the factors that determined the power of books to set the terms of public discussion. the role of intellectuals in shaping social movements, public conversations and policy considerations. the hegemony of the of the cold war consentsus was replaced by new events and ideas challenged its legitimacy.The book ends in 1979 with the energy crisis and the thought that the 'good life' was over. After that came the longest period of growth in our history, various recessions, booms and bust on Wall Street, the dot.coms, SUVs and a lot more critism."},{"Title":"From Sabbath to Lord's Day: A Biblical, Historical and Theological Investigation","review":"This book is pricey, but invaluable. It will make you think about the relationship betweenthe New Testament and the Old Testamentthe law of Moses and the law of Christthe Jewish sabbath and Christian worshipand many other important issues.The various authors, who were Cambridge post-graduate students, worked together on their book, and have come to quite a close agreement on the issues involved.Table of ContentsIntroduction by D A CarsonThe Sabbath in the Old Testament by Harold DresslerA Summary of Sabbath Observance in Judaism at the beginning of the Christian Era by C RowlandJesus and the Sabbath in the Four GospelsThe Sabbath, Sunday, and the Law in Luke/Acts by Max TurnerThe Sabbath/Sunday Question and the Law in the Pauline Corpus by D R de LaceySabbath, Rest, and Eschatology in the New Testament by A T LincolnThe Lord's Day by R J BauckhamSabbath and Sunday in the Post-Apostolic Church by R J BauckhamSabbath and Sunday in the Medieval Church in the West by R J BauckhamSabbath and Sunday in the Protestant Tradition by R J BauckhamFrom Sabbath to Lord's Day: a Biblical and Theological Perspective by A T LincolnThe stance of the book is close to New Covenant Theology. The authors do not regard the sabbath as a creation ordinance or as binding for Christians, either as the seventh or first day of the week.The book is available new, or second-hand from Amazon partners [but sometimes the used copies are even more expensive!] But it is a most stimulating book, and well worth your time.Highly recommended"},{"Title":"From Sabbath to Lord's Day: A Biblical, Historical and Theological Investigation","review":"Though Carson contributes to this work, it contains a number of other contributions from excellent authors. In my opinion A.T. Lincoln does a masterful job of honing in on key issues in an evenhanded exegetical manner. If you want a top of the line scholarly work on the Sabbath issue, this is it. Unfortunately, two of the other reviews are very misleading. First, though I can see his passion, one reviewer either failed to read the book, or didn't understand it. He attempts to post a defense of the Sabbath (seventh-day) view in his review. Sadly, it contains many less than convincing points that are thoroughly dealt with in lessor works such as Perspectives on the Sabbath - 4 views, which actually does have a good defense of the seventh-day view by Skip MacCarty. The second review suggests that one must first read Samuele Bacchiocchi before reading this work. Though he is referenced over 50 times, let's put it in perspective. These authors reference close to 1000 works according to their Bibliography, not including Scripture. So, to say one must read Bacchiocchi is very much untrue, however helpful it might be to read his title and others.Lastly, the title of this work is could be somewhat confusing. This book is NOT an argument for transferring the Sabbath to Sunday. It fact it refutes such a transference theology.Overall, this is a very solid book written by outstanding scholars who do an excellent job of handling the Biblical text in an evenhanded, exegetical manner. It's a must have."},{"Title":"From Sabbath to Lord's Day: A Biblical, Historical and Theological Investigation","review":"Authors of this volume repeatedly contrast their opinion with Bacchicchi's, so reader have to know Bacchiocchi's \\"From Sabbath to Sunday\\" for better understanding this investigation. Carson takes evangelical stand in sabbath/sunday question, but Bacchiocchi presents the Seventh-day adventists view. Both works are valuable and scolarly deep.Bacchiocchi got golden medal from Pope Paul VI for his dissertation \\"From Sabbath to Sunday\\", he made in the Pontifical Gregorian University of Rome, and his work has an Imprimatur of Roman Catholic Church.Carson in this book try to refute theses of Bacchiocchi, but conclusions there sometimes seems foggy.So I give four stars.Each one personally have to evaluate both these books and make own conclusions about meaning of Sabbath today."},{"Title":"From Sabbath to Lord's Day: A Biblical, Historical and Theological Investigation","review":"It gives great insight to the initial responses and interpretations to the finished work of Christ and then how things would ebb an flow during later periods of time. It was done in a spirit of relating observations for what substantiated their evaluation and not trying to prove another understanding wrong. However, it did a good job of presenting their observations that made it clear what the differences were and why. It has been very helpful for me in that it provided solid reasoning for what I thought I believed, yet i would not have been able to articulate it even to my self.Unless you have the time, the gift/skill, and motivation for research into the depths and you want to understand why anyone could possibly say that there is a difference about how one commandments requirement could change, then it is a great resource."},{"Title":"From Sabbath to Lord's Day: A Biblical, Historical and Theological Investigation","review":"Well written and scholarly work, but just doesn't explain convincingly from a Biblical standpoint, or justify for that matter why Christians shouldn't still be worshiping on the seventh day. As with most writers in defense of Sunday as the Christian day of worship, too much dependence upon the \\"early fathers,\\" and ignoring volumes of texts from the New Testament. Texts that most won't even admit exist in favor of continued Christian observance of the sabbath. As Christ often warned in the gospels, there would be false prophets and false doctrines coming, in an attempt to betray believers. Even during the days of the apostles, these things were already in evidence. 1 John 4:1. And if these things were already creeping into the Apostolic Age, then it's not too hard to believe there were many false practices by the 2nd, 3rd and 4th centuries, during the times of these \\"Church Fathers\\" often quoted by scholars. Some as if these non-Biblical figures were the final word on Christianity.And herein lies my disappointment with this book's explainations. So I counter with these arguments for why I am not convinced to abstain from seventh day sabbath worship, in favor of the so called \\"Lord's day\\" Sunday.Reason 1: The Ten CommandmentsIt seems everyone in Christiandom is concerned about the lack of their presence in public schools and government offices. But when a good old Seventh-day Adventist like myself discusses the observance of all of them, including the 4th concerning the seventh day sabbath found in Exodus 20: 8-11, we're told \\"the law was nailed to the cross,\\" and instantly branded \\"legalists!\\" Read for yourself, God doesn't leave room for \\"one-day-in-seven,\\" he specificly states \\"the seventh day\\" and then refers us back to the creation. That \\"one-day-in-seven\\" approach is very popular today, but doesn't have a \\"thus saith the Lord\\" to stand on. See Genesis 2:2-3. And James 2:2-3 and Ecclesiates 12:13-14 says we're even going to be judged by those very commandments in the end.Reason 2: Jesus And His Attitude Towards The SabbathMany quote from John 5 and proclaim that a sinless Jesus actually broke all the requirements of the 4th commandment. And yes, it does state that he broke it, but in its context along with other Bible passages, He only broke the traditional burdens that the Jews had tacked on to God's requirements. Read John 5:5-18, then compare his true thinking of what the sabbath is suppose to be for mankind. A devine rest. Matthew 11:28-30 and 12:1-13. In His own words, \\"it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.\\" Matthew 12:12. It was never God's purpose to make the sabbath a burden upon us. And being God the Son and Creator of all things, He was the very I Am in the Old Testament. 1 Corinthian 10:1-4, John 1:1-3 and Hebrews 1:1-2. In Luke 4:16 it was his \\"custom\\" not only to seek out worship on the sabbath, but also to participate in the worship service. And if that was His \\"custom\\" then, would it be any different if He were walking with us today? Where, and on what day would He seek to worship? Is He not the one mentioned in Hebrews 13:8 as \\"the same, yesterday, and to day, and forever.\\"Reason 3: The Disciples And New Testament BelieversSunday keepers often quote Acts 20:7 and 1 Corinthians 16:1, as final evidence that 1st century Christians like the apostle Paul and Luke, were already observing Sunday as a day of worship, along with Peter, James and John. But you have only mention of these days as, \\"the first day of the week.\\" Nothing sacred but simply certain things taking place on that particular day. In Acts 20, Paul preached until it was dark, brother Eutychus fell asleep and fell from the window dead, and Paul was able to miraculously bring him back to life. Verses 8-12. And the fact that they broke bread has no significance either, seeing they did this on a daily basis, Acts 2:46. 1 Corinthians 16:1-2 is \\"laying up in store\\" or literally at home in the Greek, on the 1st day of the week. A common work day in Biblical times. Paul was taking up collections for the poor, as in Romans 15:25-26, the poor saints in Jerusalem. He wanted the collections put aside at the beginning of the work week, after the sabbath, so gathering them would be orderly when he arrived. Anything else is reading into the text. No worship day mention whatsoever. And if you want to know how Paul really felt about which day was holy, read his own examples found in the book of Acts. In chapter 13:14-16 he was asked by the gentiles at Antioch to preach these things to them on the \\"next sabbath.\\" Why not Sunday the following day? After all, these weren't Jews. But he waited till the following sabbath to give them the gospel. See verses 42-47 for a real eye opener. Has your Sunday keeping minister ever gone over these passages with you before? And Acts 11:26 tells us Antioch is where believers were first called Christians! Stunning coincidence or God's providence? For more of Paul's attitude on sabbath worship read chapters 17:1-5 and 18 verses 4 and 11. But going back to those who literally walked with Jesus and witnessed His crucifixion, we find in Luke 23:53-56 thru 24:1-3, they rested on the sabbath \\"according to the commandment.\\" Didn't Jesus tell them of the change in days of worship before His crucifixion? Where? Passage and verse please.Reason 4: The Claim That Revelation 1:10 refers to Sunday(The Lord's Day)But where does John ever mention the day he's refering to? Once again, reading into the text something the rest of the Bible is silent on. But God does have a lot to say about which day He considers His. Remember in Matthew 12:8 Jesus said He was \\"Lord of the sabbath,\\" so He had the perfect right to say what was good for that day. He was the one resting on and blessing it back in Genesis. John 1:1-3, Hebrew 1:1-2. And since He stated back in John 5 that He and His Father were \\"one,\\" something the Jews wanted to stone Him for, He is also the one speaking of His(Lord's day) in Isaiah 58:12-14 and 56:1-7. Even pronouncing blessings upon those who were not Jews that keep the sabbath. And at creation, the Genesis account, there were no Jews yet. Was not Abraham the father of the Jews? But as born again believers, we are now spiritual Israelites and Abraham's Seed. See Galatians 3:27-29, Roman 2:26-29 and 3:28-31.Reason 5: Confusion Over What Is The New CovenantWe are all in agreement that a covenant is an agreement, are we not? So what's the fuss about old and new? We all know that Christ is the vine and we are the branches. That without Him we can do nothing. See John 15:5. And that's what makes the difference between the old and new covenants. Christ living the life, doing His will through us and not we on our own. The new covenant doesn't nullify the Ten Commandments, his Grace fulfills the law through us. \\"I can do all things through Christ...\\" Philippians 4:13. In Exodus 19:3-8, where we find the first or old covenant being made, notice the children of Israel agreeing with God; \\"we will do.\\" Keeping the law of God cannot be done through our own strength. God then writes out His moral law of Ten Commandments in chapter 20 of Exodus. Now read Hebrews 10:15-17 and you'll plainly see the new does not abolish the law of God, but He writes them on the heart. He comes in through the Holy Spirit, and changes the carnal nature. See Paul's delimma concerning keeping a holy law, and the solution in Romans 7:7,12 and 8:1-4. Notice it wasn't abolishing the keeping of the law, but having his carnal nature changed to a Spiritual one. It's called the rebirth. In Romans 7:7 Paul says the law is not sin, it tells us the definition of sin. Even naming the 10th \\"thou shall not covet\\" so there would be no doubt as to which law he's referring to. 1 John 3:4-6 goes even deeper saying \\"sin is the trangression of the law.\\" Jesus came to save us from our \\"sins.\\" In Sunday churches throughout the world, isn't it a goal to save lost sinners from their \\"sins\\" through the preaching of the Gospel? We don't keep the law to be saved, we can now keep it because we are saved. That is why so many misunderstand the words of James 2:26, \\"...faith without works is dead.\\"Reason 6: There Are Two Distinct Laws, One Moral The Other CeremonialAnd both laws even have sabbaths. God's eternal moral law of Ten Commandments includes the 4th in Exodus 20:8-11, the seventh day sabbath, a memorial to His creation. Take the time to read it. While the Mosaic or ceremonial considers all Jewish holy days, including Passover and The Day of Atonement as sabbaths, Leviticus 23. Read the entire chapter to get the full context of ceremonial sabbaths, which from year-to-year can fall on any day of the week. Another reason so many confuse what \\"sabbath days\\" were nailed to the cross in Colossians 2:16-17. Or the argument about the keeping of certain days, which Paul refered to as \\"doubtful disputations\\" in Romans 14. They were shadows of the true Lamb of God to come. Where as the seventh day sabbath existed after God made and blessed a perfect world, before sin and any need of shadows and blood sacrifices. Genesis 1:31-2:1-3. See also Hebrews 10:1. And one of the most important distinctions that most want to gloss over, is that God wrote the moral Ten Commandments on 2 tables of stone with His very own finger, as found in Exodus 31:17-18. The ceremonial law of Moses was written by Moses in a book or scrolls. Deuteronomy 31:24-26 and Joshua 8:31.Reason 7: The Sabbath Will Be Kept In The New Heaven And EarthIsaiah 66:23-24 tells us that from one new moon(or month), and from one sabbath to another \\"all flesh\\" will come to worship before God. Though some have even proposed that this text refers to the ceremonial law, due to the mention of \\"new moons,\\" we know that a new moon represents the change of months. Something Revelation 22:2 mentions concerning new fruit appearing every month on the tree of life throughout eternity.In conclusion, Is it any wonder God put the words \\"remember the sabbath day to keep it holy\\" right in the middle of the Ten, being all knowing, and foreseeing man's forgetfulness of that commandment? The only one of the Ten most Christian groups seemingly want to forget."},{"Title":"Politics in the Republic of Ireland","review":"Politics in the Republic of Ireland is the most up-to-date and comprehensive text for both students and academics interested in Irish politics.Now in its third edition, Gallagher and Coakley take the unusual step of adding substantially to their original text, bringing some of the most able commentators in the Irish field of political science together in the same volume."},{"Title":"Miss Flora McFlimsey's Christmas Eve","review":"What a wonderful suprise! At last I have found Miss Flora McFlimsey, a special doll, after nearly forty years.

Well, Miss Flora McFlimsey, there's a new generation out there just waiting to rediscover you again, and I plan to start with my nieces. That is, after I have bought copies for my sisters and all our middle-aged friends!! A definite recommendation for any little girl, no matter how young or old"},{"Title":"Miss Flora McFlimsey's Christmas Eve","review":"The story of Flora McFlimsey, the old doll who travels down from the attic on Christmas Eve, is too precious for words. Flora finds that she has the magic ability to move and goes to look at the Christmas tree. Once there, she finds herself unable to move and is put with the other toys by Santa as a gift for one of the children in the house. She realizes that she is old and shabby, and feels quite worthless when she gets a little angelic help.... and ends up being the most beautiful and beloved of all the Christmas toys. The pictures look water-colored and are so soft-looking and sweet.My mom got this book at a library sale when we were little and it quickly became a family classic. She still has the book, but I wanted a copy of my own at my house to read to my 3yo daughter. I was pleasantly surprised in that the book I ordered was a reprint and was in PERFECT condition with a dust jacket (I didn't know there was ever a reprint so I just figured it was an old version since it didn't specify). Even though I love old things and old books, I was really glad that this was newer because this way it will last longer for my child, and even her children one day. When I read it to her for the first time I almost could not finish the book because all of my own childhood memories came back and I couldn't believe I was reading the same story to my daughter that my mom read to me so many times. It really got me choked up!Anyway, like you wanted to hear my personal story.... But you will love this book and it is a great tradition to start reading it at Christmas time (especially on Christmas Eve)!!!"},{"Title":"HENRY FORD'S OWN STORY","review":"Ordered this book for my son's National History Day project.

The book's opening sentence sets the stage: \\"Body shape is the closest thing we have to a medical crystal ball.\\" And those that follow offer a great look into the future of your health. Fantastic book!"},{"Title":"Apples & Pears : The Body Shape Solution for Weight Loss and Wellness","review":"I must say that out of all of the diet books I've purchased over the years; this one is definitely one of my top reads. This is the type of book that you don't simply read and then discard. The information inside will have you coming back repeatedly for assurance and guidance.The very base of the information is that we truly only have 2 shapes, Apple or Pear and its determined by your waist-to-hip ratio. She goes into the health concerns for each body type and provides a lot of photographs to help you determine which shape you are. Afterwards she lays out simple diets for each type stating 5-6 small meals a day and rates foods from best to worst. She even makes allowances stating you can have a few foods that are \\"better\\" or \\"good\\" each day. Even though a lot of the information is in other books I like the way she presents it. She has a positive attitude for the most part and simplifies the diet for each shape. She doesn't shy away from healthy fats or carbs(shocking.) The nutrition information was my favorite part from the way it was organized. She doesn't make it daunting and it seems manageable and even enjoyable for long-term.The only reason I did not rate this with five stars is because as several other reviewers have noted, she tends to favor the pear shape. Yes apple shapes are at a higher risk for major diseases but she's not as much of a cheerleader as she should be. The message basically states that even if you get down to a healthy weight as an apple shape you're still at a greater risk for heart disease than a pear shape. While that may be true and I don't think it was her intention to scare readers she could have done it in a way that was more positive. I also found it a little confusing to determine which shape you are. For example, I have a pear shape but due to my thyroid I tend to carry a little more weight around my midsection which makes me an apple by waist-to-hip ratio. She doesn't clarify whether I am truly an apple shape or not. With proper diet and medication my ratio would be less than .80 which would make me a pear shape. With that aside I think the overall information and message presented is excellent and I plan to hang onto this book and work to get myself back into pear perfection ;)"}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],W={key:0},E={key:1};function P(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",x,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",E,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",W,"See more"))],8,H)):p("",!0)])}const D=d(C,[["render",P],["__scopeId","data-v-15b77323"]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/62.md","filePath":"quotes/62.md"}'),B={name:"quotes/62.md"},q=Object.assign(B,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(D)]))}});export{F as __pageData,q as default};
