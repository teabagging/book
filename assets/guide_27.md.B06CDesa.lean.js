Lowery's latest novel, MAD PURSUIT, finds herself uprooted from her beloved home in the Hollywood Hills and transported to England, where her handsome and relentlessly ambitious husband, Gerald, has accepted a position at Lloyd's. Maggie's &quot;new&quot; house, a gloomy, ancient pile in the English countryside, has been chosen and furnished in execrable taste by her husband's secretary, the ubiquitous Miss Always. Imagining that she and Gerald will laugh about it, Maggie soon realizes that blonde and breasty Miss Always is not to be laughed away. Maggie decides to follow her husband and Miss Always; her&quot;mad pursuit&quot; takes her (disguised in a wonderful variety of hats) all over London, into Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, to a Dickensian law office, to another man's bed, and even into other dimensions of time. This wonderful book is witty, both sweet and sour, full of surprises, written in an elegant, rollicking style, with an eye to personal foibles as well as sorrows -- and with a generous bonus of social idiocies. I couldn't put it down and I couldn't guess what Maggie's decision would be until the very end, when the author told me, and I said, &quot;Yes!&quot;"},{"Title":"Mad Pursuit","review":"I read Mad Pursuit in two sitting, thoroughly enjoying Maggie Featherstone who did not let herself sink into the position of agrieved wife.

I do recommend it!"},{"Title":"Journey of the Software Professional: The Sociology of Software Development","review":"Journey of the Software Professional is an impressive work. It begins with a Forward by noted author Gerald Weinberg (The Psychology of Computer Programming, etc.) where Weinberg says &quot;In many ways, it opened my eyes. If you are a software professional, I think it will open yours as well.&quot; I couldn't have said it better.This book should be read by software development managers before their first assignments. Hohmann not only provides software engineering guidance and wisdom in real-world context but also, where possible, backs up his thinking with published works, all carefully annotated.What separates this work from most software engineering texts is Hohmann's ability to keep the work meaningful and relevant to real-world development environments. Many other texts note that most shops are at an SEI Level I maturity yet those same books delve into COCOMO II or McCabe's cyclomatic complexity--concepts and practices foreign in those same shops. It is easy to fill books with details of these and other software engineering tools and techniques but unless these things are placed in a meaningful context, they are simply tools absent of purpose.What Hohmann offers is much more: a way to think about the real problem to be solved by engineering management: the maturation of the software development department. It is along these lines that Hohmann shines. For example, in one section discussing conflict, Hohmann asks &quot;How much time, if any should be allocated to the schedule to allow programmers to rework their code?&quot; Refactoring (Fowler) is a new spin on how to accomplish this but acknowledging, at a management level, that such activities go on is not widely discussed in most texts. Hohmann challenges readers to think about problems such as these.Throughout the book are sections entitled &quot;Advice to Managers&quot; and &quot;Advice to Developers&quot;. Most of the advice is rock solid and could apply anywhere for the same reason The Mythical Man Month (Brooks) is still relevant and should be required reading by all software managers: software development is (and always has been) about people! While tools and techniques evolve quickly, people have not.Because every author wants to bring something new and fresh they'll introduce some spin on their particular approach. Hohmann offers SPO: Structure-Process-Outcome to fulfill this pension. While I think it doesn't add much, neither does it detract. There is plenty in this book to let it stand on its own merit.I didn't agree with everything in this book. There are few books I can give blanket and unreserved approval to, in fact. But this book did do what Weinberg promised in his Forward: it made me THINK. The book's subtitle is &quot;A Sociology of Software Development&quot; and that description fits well. It is not a substitute for a solid book on software engineering techniques. But, I believe this book would greatly supplement anyone's library whose quest is to better understand the discipline."},{"Title":"Journey of the Software Professional: The Sociology of Software Development","review":"I found it crowded with good advice and ideas. I also found myself skipping and jumping around in it after a while, and putting it down altogether, because it was getting a bit tedious. But I would leave it lying in a visible place and pick it up again some evenings later. And every time I picked it up I found good and valuable advice in it. There are headings and subheadings on just about every page and the text under them is more or less self-contained: so it's amenable to browsing (chapter 1 excepted). And believe me, it has a huge amount of content. One of the things I like is its stated intention to make you a happier developer, not just a better developer. The causes of developer suffering and confusion are predominantly management and human issues, needless to say, since the machine and machine tools continue to be on their best behavior. The book has helped me avoid some suffering and confusion. It is not B.S."},{"Title":"Journey of the Software Professional: The Sociology of Software Development","review":"This book has an interesting outlook on software development. Beware it is 'the sociology of computer programming' as it says in the title - only read it if this is of interest to you. For this reason it delves into the reasons why people build software the way they do and provides the framework into which all the engineering methods and methodologies fit.However, it's too tedious in places and contains too many hollow platitiudes despite parts being built on what appears to be a sound academically researched foundation. Pick it up if you have room for a book to round out your engineering expertise but don't expect the kind of experience as in reading 'Design Patterns' for the first time, for example."},{"Title":"Journey of the Software Professional: The Sociology of Software Development","review":"\\"The integrated framwork provides a complete theory of human problem solving.\\" (p.41)There's a lot of good in this book. For example, back in \`97, Hohmann was already exhorting managers to allow refactoring (called reworking back then), in anticipation of current eXtreme/agile practice (p.73). There's a lot of conditional good here too: \\"[having] determined your coding values, use them consistently...\\" (p.93) In other words, figure out what matters in your code, outside of getting the nominal job done: performance, maintainability, portability, or whatever. Something about a foolish consistency springs to mind, though. In any complex program, one part might be critical to performance, another might be memory-limited, reliability might be an absolute demand in another section, and so on, requiring a flexible attitude that doesn't fit well with dogmatic dicta. Hohmann has also chosen a presentation format, with explicit asides to both managers and developers, that summarizes his advice clearly, without descending to sound bites - at least, not descending all the way.Things like that quote I started with bother me, though. Yes, I appreciate self-assurance and enthusiasm, but not when they turn into hype and hyperbole. That must be the cheerleader part of the aerobics instructor in him coming through. (He's very proud of that achievement, and reminds us of it repeatedly - as if this will impress an uber-geek.) Then there's the tired trotting out of pop-psych standards: personality quizzes, the Johari window, and the rest.There are some nuggets here. They're wrapped up in so much fluff that they're hard to find, though. Maybe this book will help someone, especially a techie being turned into a manger, but that reader will have to wade through feel-good fuzzies and partial truths to find that help.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Journey of the Software Professional: The Sociology of Software Development","review":"I first discovered this book thanks to the happy confluence of serendipity, perpetual bookstore browsing, and two decades of white-knuckling it as a software programmer.

Cognitive models, values, personality, goals, culture, strategy, rituals, future perfect thinking, domain experience, competency frameworks, learning styles, training plans, the Johari Window, organizational cohesion and coupling, topology, and roles are discussed in the context of software engineering.

It is packed full of information.

People issues are important in team development of software, and most of us will have to work in teams for a large part of our careers.

There are some stunning pieces of wisdom--&quot;To handle a complex problem you must be a complex person&quot;, &quot;Be reliable&quot;, &quot;Be Honest&quot;, and my favourite, &quot;During lunch, keep your overall consumption of food to a reasonable amount.&quot; Of course, there are numerous n-step solutions offered, that, by the very virtue of being n-step, are guaranteed to be a success. N-step recipes are supported by numerous charts. There are some good passages: &quot;...Ruthlessly identify those aspects...&quot; (How do you &quot;identify&quot; something &quot;ruthlessly&quot;?)

Dr. Buzzanco's main thesis that he is trying to convey is divided into two parts, the Vietnam War and the issues of the 1960's. His first theme on the Vietnam War subject is the United States after World War II tried to become the world leader during their foreign affairs in the Indochina region but failed. The second theme, which deals with the domestic problems in America during this time period, is how the people of the United States erupted into its domestic problems and how they are linked with the war in Vietnam. In the first half of the book, Buzzanco announces his thesis statement, letting the reader know that the first half was all the details of the war. Then he comes back in the second half of the book and describes what was happening at home on American soil. In essence, he has written two documentaries and combined them quite well. He has two points that he is trying to convey, broken up into two halves. Dr. Buzzanco did an astounding job in proving his points. He clearly and strongly showed examples that lead people to believe him. In every major point in both parts of his book, he used clear and precise examples to prove his words correct. He used all second hand information due to the fact that he was born too late to participate in the actual war. But his information was all very accurate and strong. He really did not use any points that criticized anything he was trying to convey in his book. But there could be some rival opinions on various subjects throughout the book. For example in the second part of the book, on page 202 he is trying to blame much of the domestic uprisings on Martin Luther King and the march on Washington. He claims that the march got the African-Americans to strongly disapprove of the war. But the march was more or less strictly on the civil rights issues, not on the war. He was, however, extremely successful at effectively using his sources in a convincing manner. Starting on page 104 and continuing, he shows how American foreign policy on the countries surrounding Vietnam essentially escalated the conflict even further. He does not however; use any examples of others that would give evidence that his points are not true or inaccurate. Some of his issues are controversial and he leads the reader to think that they are not. For example on page 68, he makes it clear to the reader that the war was inevitable even in the early 1960's under JFK's policy. But in reality much could have been done to prevent the conflict from escalating. More or less he is trying to convince the reader that his points are one sided and are not controversial. He seems biased on the fact that he offers nothing on the opposite side of him. All good writers usually give points to satisfy both for and against. All of his points, especially the first half of the book, help to prove his thesis. He pretty much uses strong logical reasoning and uses evidence to support that. Due to Dr. Buzzanco's education level and his astounding credibility and awards his information can be trustworthy. He uses strong examples to prove his thesis and also uses several other points throughout the book."},{"Title":"Vietnam and the Transformation of American Life (Problems in American History)","review":"The author is clearly biased in some cases. Moreover, there's some shoddy history going on with \\"maybe\\" this and referring to Ho Chi Minh as a \\"nationalist\\" over and over but never as Communist, which he was. Sure, he was both but the failure to ever refer to him or the VC as communist simply strikes me as an attempt to sway his readers into a belief that they were harmless. They weren't. And while I don't think Vietnam was the right course of action for the US to take, I fail to understand why the author would refer to troops in Vietnam as \\"stoned\\" and \\"demoralized\\" implying they were always so. Yes, this is true after about '68, but to imply that it was the case for all troops is dangerous and disrespectful.It's also faulty his assertion that the majority of the US was against US intervention in Vietnam. The majority of Americans were in favor of the US's policy of containment.Read Stanley Karnow's _Vietnam_ or Michael Hunt's _Lyndon Johnson's War_. This book is pretty biased and seems to be an exercise in language to make Ho Chi Minh an Asian Abe Lincoln."},{"Title":"Vietnam and the Transformation of American Life (Problems in American History)","review":"Vietnam and the Transformation of American Life is an intelligent and informative look into the Vietnam War and how it influenced American life.

It starts off with a brief explanation for the war, which was to &quot;...preserve an anticommunist government in Southern half of Vietnam.&quot; Buzzanco does a great job of telling both sides of the war in great detail. He spends a lot of time explaining to the reader how Ho Chi Minh emerged into a great war and political leader of the DRVN and maintained his popular support from most of the Vietnamese society. He also tells of the events which led up to the Vietnam War from the US point of view starting with WWII to the unrevealing exception to defeat. Buzzanco also does an exceptional job of telling why the US felt the need to be involved with the Vietnam conflict. He also talks about the US supporting the French, who were against Vietnam. He further explains that the US did this in order to maintain French support in the European Cold War, to contain Communism in Asia, and to encourage economic development in the US. Throughout his book, he does the same thing, which is to give an extensive informational explanation of the events, and then get to the main point at the end with just a simple sentence or two. Buzzanco also goes into Vietnam's communities and the people's aspect of the war. He lets the reader know that the Vietnamese people were for the most part on Ho's side, letting the truth of the matter shine through. The truth being that the DRVN was corrupt, and the Vietamese people knew it, thus they mainly supported the DRVN. Among the best aspects of the book was the detailed explanation of military moves and decisions on both sides. He explains why each side made each move in the long war, as well as the political moves. Which brings us to the second part of the book, &quot;The Movements of the 1960's.&quot; Buzzanco uses several sources throughout his book. He lists them all at the end, far too many to list. He used books as well as papers. He even used comic strips that were published during that period of the war. He also lists his sources in a bibliography as well as a notes section. Buzzanco does not choose sides in his book. He merely tells the story and the events how they happened. He does not skip around either, and it was easy to follow as well as to understand. For every point in the book, he marks it with a source, which only enhances what he has already said."},{"Title":"Vietnam and the Transformation of American Life (Problems in American History)","review":"Vietnam and the Transformation of American Life, is very interesting and informative.

The book itself helped the audience, especially those of who are of Vietnamese decent, understand how their ancestors survived and what they went through during the course of the war."},{"Title":"Coding Techniques for Microsoft Visual Basic .NET","review":"Throw a dart in a bookstore and I guarantee you'll hit a book about .NET.

However, I would not recommend it to someone learning to program for the first time, because the editing is simply atrocious.For example, figures displaying the code sample for how to do task X sometimes vary widely: in other words, figures supposedly referring to the same sample of code sometimes contain very different code, and there is nothing in the text of the chapter explaining why or even acknowledging the discrepancy.An experienced developer can recognize these as failures of the editing process during revisions of the examples (perhaps caused by releases of subsequent beta versions and then the RTM, perhaps just the result of the author changing his mind about how he wants to demonstrate a topic), but someone brand new to programming will be thrown for an awful loop as they try to make their code exactly match the author's.There are other problems with the writing and editing that also would be serious problems for a new programmer, so I would recommend this as a quite useful book, but only for experienced developers."},{"Title":"Coding Techniques for Microsoft Visual Basic .NET","review":"Thats the name of one of the chapter headings in the book.

Because of these issues I would not recommend this to a brand new programmer."},{"Title":"Coding Techniques for Microsoft Visual Basic .NET","review":"The book is well written and the author has done a great job to keep everything simple to understand even though he's talking about OOP! You'll get a good overview of things you can do with VB.NET, illustrated with good examples.Unfortunately, there is also many little technical mistakes in this book. Most of them might have been caused by the changes between the beta and release version of VB.NET but I have been disapointed to find so many of them! I thought that a book with the name Microsoft on it would be more accurate... It's not the case!"},{"Title":"Coding Techniques for Microsoft Visual Basic .NET","review":"Connell's work here does an okay job at introducing VB.Net to developers. One problem I had is that it is unclear who the intended audience is. In some parts the explanations he gives are very basic and helpful with a significant of &quot;hand-holding&quot;, in other ares they are cryptic. Additionally, the chapter on ASP.NET and Web Services was far too brief relative to their usefulness - hence I only give it 3 stars."},{"Title":"Coding Techniques for Microsoft Visual Basic .NET","review":"Bought the book over a month ago and totally disagree with a lot of the reviews online; book is almost totally unreadable as it takes even the most simple pieces of code and over complicates them to the point where you just end up closing the cover and say what a waste of money."},{"Title":"Coding Techniques for Microsoft Visual Basic .NET","review":"&quot;However, in the mid-1980s, most computers were still running on only Intel 286, 16-bit chips.&quot; -- Chapter 1, page 3While a typo here and there occasionally make their way into books, they do tend to make us poke deeper into the book, esp. the assumptions. The 80s theme (when the events happened in the 90s) rears it ugly head quite a few times.For example, in Chapter 1, the assumption is that web services provide a web-enabled user interface. This is, of course, incorrect. Web services provide a new interface, certainly, but the UI still has to be built on top of the service. In all reality, a web service is a business tier component interface, and not UI at all. The fact that .NET provides a UI to test services does not make it a UI.While I may be a bit heavy handed on specifics, mistakes in specifics makes one wonder if the generalizations are flawed as well.Now, to the good points. If you are a VB programmer, this book will certainly get you up to speed very quickly. The book tends to lean towards using Visual Studio .NET. This is not a negative point, as the code will work both inside or outside the VS.NET IDE, but it is something that should be noted. If you work with Visual Studio .NET, you will find the screenshots to be very helpful as you progress through the chapters.There is also an ample bit of code in this book. While much of it is learning based, rather than real world applications, it is nice to have plenty of samples, none-the-less. I am particularly fond of the Eliza program, but it shows my geekness.For as thick as this book is, there is a lot missing. .NET is a very large subject, however, so it would be hard to include everything, even in a book as thick as this one.Coverage?The OO section is a bit thin, but it does cover inheritance in forms, which I have not seen covered elsewhere. The ADO.NET section is excellent, considering the perceived audience. THe debugging section is quite nice, but I would recommend &quot;debugging ASP.NET&quot;, if you have full understanding that ASP.NET is a technology using VB.NET, and the debugging techniques are fully applicable in all VB.NET projects.This book also has one of the best sections on the file system I have seen anywhere. In some ways, it may be a bit too heavy here, but that is not all bad.Audience?I believe those with a background in Visual Basic will find this to be a good starting book in VB .NET. The same for those with other languages under their belt. A complete beginner to programming may also find some gems in this work, but I would not recommend it as the first book."},{"Title":"Coding Techniques for Microsoft Visual Basic .NET","review":"I would not be surprised if this book is destined to become 'The book' to learn Visual Basic.Net. I completely agree with the other reviewers. John Connell leads the reader through .Net in such a clear and enjoyable way that you don't realize just how much you learned. After finishing a chapter, I close the book and reflect on all the ground that has been covered. The book logically leads the reader through assemblies, interned strings, structured error handling (i.e., try, catch, finally), classes, how to understand and quickly use the massive framework, OOP techniques, Web Services, Windows Services, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, XML, disconnected datasets, and much more. For me, these were pretty much completely new concepts - yet this book makes them crystal clear. I wish more books could be writting with this style of clearity and razer sharp examples. If you are trying to learn VB.Net, in my humble opinion you just can't go wrong with this book."},{"Title":"Coding Techniques for Microsoft Visual Basic .NET","review":"As a consultant that uses VB and C++, I have to keep technically current. This book takes you through OO, deriving classes, new data types and tips, managing collections and arrays, covers new (for VB) structured error handling and debugging, deploying pubic and private assemblies, ADO.NET and ASP.NET and WEb Services. Each chapter builds on the next, so the reader can easily see how the pieces fit together. The fairly complete coverage of ADO.NET (3 chapters) shows how to deploy disconnected recordsets. Next, Connell moves into ASP.NET and shows how to use what was just learned in ASP - very logical progression. There is some good coverage of file management, logical and visual inheritance, and XML. In the final chapter, a desktop app (Sticky Yellow Note) is built using OO, static procedures, context menues, filestreams, and XML. Then the app is deployed - you can give this to people that don't have the .NEt framework installed yet. All in all, a very conprehensive and readable book. I found this useful. I think if you are already proficient in VB or C++ you will really enjoy this."},{"Title":"Coding Techniques for Microsoft Visual Basic .NET","review":"I'm a pretty decent VB programmer, and have been reading various articles about VB.Net. Most were a bit cryptic and expected that the reader was already familiar with .Net. So when I picked up VB.Net Coding Techniques I was very pleasantly surprised. Mr. Connell eases the reader into OO VB.Net using real programs.The book provides all sorts of tips on what Vb.Net programmers will find the most challenging - finding the right object in the amazingly expansive .Net Framework. Connell's guidance and tips makes it almost trivial now. The book provides seasoned guidance on how namespaces are layed out. Best of all, how to use various tools and more to immediately find, instantiate, and use the correct framework class. Not only is there crystal clear coverage of XML, Web Services, assemblies, inheritance, ASP.NET and more, but it ties these together seamlessly. Anyway, that's my 2 cents worth. If you need to learn VB.Net right now - you can't go wrong with Coding Techniques."},{"Title":"Coding Techniques for Microsoft Visual Basic .NET","review":"As Mr. Connell points out, VB.Net is front loaded with what might be new concepts to some of us not steeped in classical computer science training - such as Object Orientation, structured error handling, and so forth. He **very clearly** describes what are totally new concepts such as assemblies. I like the approach of learning the language by example - Mr. Connell's approach is crystal clear. While VB.Net is very differnt that Classical VB, I quickly learned - **and understood** how to use the huge framework, inherit objects and put them to use, build my own objects, use error handling, and use all the changes in strings and arrays, etc. The main point I want to emphasize is that VB.Net is not something to be scared of - but to master. The writing and teaching style is good and he really hit his audience with me. Since my company is not paying for me to learn .Net, I need to keep my skills up. For me, this was an excellent investment.I also was wondering about XML and web services, as well as what's new in ASP.NET. Connell covers all of these, while at the same time adding humor and examples that make sense. In fact, in my mind the tour de force is an example at the end where you build an electronic yellow sticky note program. This example uses the new framework File.IO capabilities, XML, static methods, classes, inheritance, character arrays, various graphical concepts, a pop up context menu from the task bar, and all sorts of other concepts that are elegantly put together in a single .Net program. This cool example ties together much of what was learned in previous chapters. He even shows how to build and distribute the app to your friends - even if they dont ahve the Common Language Runtime on their computer. When you finish this book - you will have a firm grasp of .Net. Yes, I know I need to learn more - but this book got me .Net jump started."},{"Title":"Coding Techniques for Microsoft Visual Basic .NET","review":"This is not a book for a novice programmer. It is geared towards the meeting the needs of professional system programmers. You won't find anything here on MDI, GDI+ or a host of other VB features. For example, the steps behind attaching buttons to code could have been illustrated much more explicitly. So if you are still coming to terms with the core of VB, this book could produce a rather serious challenge. Consequently, the text is not a substitute for other broader overviews of VB.Net.That being said, one of the exceptional strengths of the book is its efficient working through of the tool side of VB - which is huge. Whether you want to create a form, a class, a module, an ASP project, the author has the way picked out pretty cleanly. The CLR and Assembly sections are very written and really worth the effort. The section of ADO.NET is good, but tends to rehash a lot of Microsoft technical information. Inevitable probably. The ELIZA program design gives a good insight into using collections efficiently. However, files and streams are treated too abruptly for my liking.One of the other attractive aspects of the book is the lack of navel gazing about types and their cousins. Types are dealt with very practically (might not satisfy everyone).Unfortunately, the style is at times a bit too terse. For instance, I don't think this is a useful book from which to pick up OO skills. It covers class creation with a few very specific examples and then moves on. Theoretical digressions are noticeable by their absence. Again, a supplementary text will help here.Overall, however, I am very keen on this book. I learnt a lot more from it than I expected, and it is very well written. It is certainly a very valuable reference text."},{"Title":"Coding Techniques for Microsoft Visual Basic .NET","review":"I started reading VB.Net books when they started flooding the market with beta 1 last year. Most of them are me-too and a rehash of documentation. I saw this in a well known book store, paged through it, and purchased it on line. Mr. Connell's book is different in that he leads the reader through each chapter to show how each builds on the next using crafted code. Armed with what you just learned, you move to the next area - building on the previous knowledge. For example, he starts with Object Orientation -&gt; Data Types -&gt; Class Framework -&gt; Error Handling -&gt; Assemblies -&gt; Windows Services -&gt; ADO -&gt; Datasets -&gt; ASP -&gt; Web Services -&gt; Virtual Inheritance, etc. I have recommended this to my friends. IMHO iff you are going to buy a VB.Net book, you absoultely can't go wrong with Techniques."},{"Title":"Coding Techniques for Microsoft Visual Basic .NET","review":"I have been promoting this book to my friends because it's the best .Net book I have found. While the other .Net books (and Ive read several for the past yr including C#) tend to repeat or say the same things in a differnet way - Connell sheds new light on .Net for the professional developer. For example, he discusses how to find things in the Framework using WinCV. Or not to use a short int (16 bit) because its actually slower because of current 32 bit CPU registers. Or how to use Option correctly. Or how to use .Net error messages to help find the data type you need. While this might not be a beginners first .Net book, clearly everyone will learn techniques and how to find your way around the framework. Oh, and it's simply the best explaination of ADO.NET and ASP.NET around. All in all, if you have to purchase one book - this is it. My copy is dog eared. There is even a cool .Net Artificial Intelligence program used to illustrate key concepts. And a Magic 8 Ball Web Service that I got up and running - and completely understand that new concept. It's not only well written and informative - but very fun to read. I hope Mr. Connell comes up with another .Net book soon."},{"Title":"Coding Techniques for Microsoft Visual Basic .NET","review":"I've been programming in VB from version 3 through 6 and really haven't done much with objects, so was a bit concerned about learning VB.Net (where everything is an object). I had difficulty with C++ in this regard. I just received Coding Techniques for VB.Net and can't put it down. While the book provides all sorts of expert techniques, it conveys the information in a clear and easy to follow manner. After two days I've already built several .Net programs and have all sorts of ideas for many more. The section on Artifical Intelligence using the .Net Eliza program is fantastic.

Some areas are covered more in depth than others, but this contains the best explaination of object oriented programming to the VB'er that I've ever seen. The expansive framework is then examined showing clearly how to find and use this powerful tool. File IO and Web Services are also very nicely covered, with a full 3 chapters on the new ADO.NET. I think what I like most is that it's clear this book was layed out in an expert fashion. Each chapt builds on the next, and before I knew it VB.Net seemed like an old friend. The writing style is crisp, and ancellary pieces of info are presented to show how each new element of .Net not only fits into the whole, but how each is used in real world examples. He provides gems such as why never to use the new short integer (16 bit) because the cpu registers are 32 bit. Most professional programmers automatically try to use the smallest data type for the job, but in this case selecting a short would actually add cycles to pad the other 16 bits. I have not seen pro tips like this anywhere else. I did read Connell's previous database book (which is dog eared on my shelf), and was also pleasantly surprised with this one.

For example, he states that a variable declared AS NEW isn't actually instantiated until it is used. This is true. But any VB programmer worth his pay knows that you don't use AS NEW, but instead instantiate the object later in your code when you actually need the variable.While it does a decent job providing an overview of VB.NET, I am left wondering if the techniques I am learning are really the best, or even acceptable, given the fact that this supposed \\"expert\\" on VB6 does not display expert knowledge of it."},{"Title":"Coding Techniques for Microsoft Visual Basic .NET","review":"Programming is like sex.

It opened up new worlds for me. The author is undoubtedly some remarkable intellect."},{"Title":"Tennessee Williams: Four Plays Summer and Smoke/Orpheus Descending/Suddenly Last Summer/Period of Adjustment","review":"Tennessee Williams is so well-known for other plays like \\"The Glass Menagerie\\" and \\"Streetcar Named Desire\\" that one like me not terribly familiar with him, except via his reputation for overwrought Southern Gothic drama, approaches this collection of Williams' lesser-known plays from his major period with trepidation.\\"Four Plays\\" is pretty Gothic, and sometimes overwrought, but it makes for a pretty immersive read, not to mention a tough-love rollercoaster for the human condition.Up first is \\"Summer And Smoke\\" (1948), a tale of a raucous young medical student and the girl next door who has pined for him since childhood. Right away you get that you are in the hands of an unusual playwright in Williams, who gives very detailed instructions on dressing the set, including which constellations should be projected on the overhead cyclorama during evening scenes and what colors the actors should wear.Williams is just as controlling with his characterizations. Alma is a sincere, spiritually-inclined woman who tries to bring order to her household, hostage to a crazy mama who spitefully embarrasses Alma and her minister father. John also teases Alma, with talk of sex, yet a curious qualm holds him back from the ravishment he knows could be his at his pleasure: \\"Many's the time I've looked across at the Rectory and wondered if it would be worth trying, you and me...\\" That yard's worth of distance is the substance and the tragedy of this curious, arresting play.The other three plays develop similar dialogues between intimacy and loss. Nowhere in this book does that come out more hot and heavy than \\"Orpheus Descending\\" (1957), a play which Williams in an introduction explains was a decades-long labor of love which he never gave up on. In a small southern town, gossip travels quickly, especially when a mysterious man takes a job at a general store owned by a dying man and his wife, who suspects her husband had something to do with the long-ago murder of her father. It all boils up rather quickly and unconvincingly, even for Williams where a certain suspension of disbelief is helpful. Still, you keep reading.\\"Suddenly Last Summer\\" (1958) is the most recognized title, though more for me from the Motels' hit song in 1983. It's a more subtle but just as ripping dramatic piece as \\"Orpheus\\". A batty rich widow tries to have her niece lobotomized to destroy her memory of how the widow's son died in Mexico. \\"My son, Sebastian, was chaste,\\" she declares. \\"I was the only one in his life who satisfied the demands he made of people.\\"Sebastian wasn't exactly Ivory Snow-pure, of course, and in the widow's many daiquiri-fueled discursions there's both poignancy and hilarity. Definitely surreal, \\"Suddenly Last Summer\\" probably plays better on the page than the stage, as the major plot comes entirely in eyewitness narrative.\\"Period Of Adjustment\\" (1960), the final and last-written of these plays, is my favorite in the crowd, a Christmas tale of domestic dysfunction that plays out as a subdued comedy of manners. A newlywed couple shows up at the door of the groom's Air Force buddy. The honeymoon, it turns out, was over before it started.Williams sets up a rich satire of middle-class life. The groom fantasizes about raising Texas longhorn cattle, not for beef, but for herding on television. His pal is on the outs with his own wife for a variety of reasons, including the fact he fears she is raising their son to be a sissy by buying him dolls. Williams plays against his M.O. by showcasing a talent for lower-register exposition, realistic dialogue instead of soliloquy, and gentle, effective comedy throughout.There may not really be a Williams M.O. Sure, there's neurotic women and beefy satyr-like men on display here, but reading these four plays reveals a master of multiple facets, too virtuosic for easy stereotyping. Flawed as they may be, \\"Four Plays\\" presents a pretty strong argument for people like me to take Tennessee more seriously."},{"Title":"Tennessee Williams: Four Plays Summer and Smoke/Orpheus Descending/Suddenly Last Summer/Period of Adjustment","review":"How beautiful is Tennessee Williams? Consider his affections for his characters. Consider his appreciative and sensuous representations of his Southerness. Consider his status as a male writer whose female characters are the ambitions of American actresses. Arthur Miller, David Mamet and Sam Shepard, all members of the select American Giants Canon, cannot say so much. Edward Albee and Eugene O'Neill also gift wonderful women's parts, but nobody shares the trauma of fagility in a bruising world like Tennessee Williams.This collection of some of his lesser known works serves as a wonderful entr&eacute;e to his milieu and brilliance.Summer and Smoke is a classic of his lesser known plays; a lifetime's changes for Alma and John takes place over a year, where the longings and passions of two people diametrically driven by the spirit and the flesh are danced about: bad timing, self-hatred, the tasks of responsibilities to one's parents, all serve as a foil for something marvelous, and in so doing illuminate the simple and monumental difficulties of love and hope.Orpheus Descending is the tale of Val Xavier's perilous trip into the fiery heart of a Southern small town, where outsiders are not welcome and sexuality will be burned by the fears of a violent community. Val's stimulation of the hatred and passion inside Lady and the sensuous inspiration of Carol spark the town's leading \\"citizens\\" to attack and subdue the whimsy of youth and the hopefulness of true connections. Highlighted by a very expressionistic set design, Williams offers his characters up as martyrs to the truth and the risk of emotional attachment.Suddenly Last Summer is a shorter piece, a long lone-act that proves a swift example of everything Williamsian. Essentially an expositional exercise in suspense, its tale is of a young doctor's visit to the estate of a wealthy Southern matron (Aunt Venable), who wants to endow the doctor's experiments with lobotomies. Her niece has been acting out and spreading a horrible story about Aunt Venable's son Sebastian and the trauma of the tale is enough to propose a lobotomy for Catherine, her erratic niece. Ultimately the horrific story is revealed, and presents Williams' penchant for extreme people in extreme circumstances and the volatility of being openly and actively indifferent to society's norms and codes of silence.Period of Adjustment is an odd piece, even for Williams. Of all the plays of his I've read (which is not all of them), it's the only full length piece that has a happy ending. Ironic too as it is about two married couples (never a sub-cultural group to fare well in his work) and the crossing dialogues of a husband from one and a wife from another, frequently about the loathing they feel for their mates. It is subtitled ;or, High Point over a Cavern, no doubt a metaphor for the nature of romance and relationships, marriage and fidelity. It would be a treat to see this performed, as it features a smaller cast than a usual Williams play and has an air of mild charm infused with the banter of tense marriages, and doesn't have the frequent emotionally broken, clipped-wing dreamers associated with the mighty Tennessee.This publication's plays are not necessarily the same as the Dramatists Plays or Samuel French series, as those represent productions scripts, are usually cut and feature stage directions and set designs that may be specific to that rendering.Also included in the collection are essays on Summer and Smoke's evolution from Eccentricities of a Nightingale to it's final version. There is also an essay on Williams and another on Battle of Angels becoming Orpheus Descending.Essential reading for actors, directors and lover of great American literature. Williams is a giant and needs to be read, if one cannot see his art live on stage."},{"Title":"Tennessee Williams: Four Plays Summer and Smoke/Orpheus Descending/Suddenly Last Summer/Period of Adjustment","review":"Tennesse Williams has become of my favorite authors, partially due to this book. I have long been a fan of the movie adaptations of his work, but they come nowhere near to the superb quality of the written word. In all of his plays you can get a sense of what the characters are feeling. In most cases those feelings are angst and despair. &quot;Suddenly Last Summer&quot; is by far the best play in this book, but the others are not far behind. The characters in these plays are easy to &quot;see&quot;, thanks to Williams' wonderful development. As with every Williams' play, these have surprising twists and revelations throughout.

In the introduction to &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth,&quot; he says that he only wrote &quot;two violent plays&quot;: &quot;Suddenly, and &quot;Sweet Bird...&quot; If you read it (PLEAE do), be prepared- Williams' style is like an extremely complex poem.

The book is just as much about, for example, a 43 year old American photographer, a 56 year old teacher from France, a 36 year old cigarette vendor from Morocco, a 47 year old civil servant from Germany, a 59 year old events coordinator, a 49 year old Norwegian health councilor, a 37 year old Israeli philosopher, as it is about the few women -- a filmmaker, age 30, from the States, or a 53 year old Israeli sex educator or a 25 year old Moroccan belly dancer -- who you might call sex workers in the broadest sense.The authors, who themselves appear in the book, asked various women four questions:- What does the word \\"erotic\\" mean to you?- Do you remember your first erotic feeling and could you show it to the camera?- Can you remember your strongest erotic feeling and show it to the camera?- Do you have a certain fantasy and could you show it to the camera?The answers are sometimes earthy, and sometimes lack what we used to call critical consciousness, but they're vivid, varied, and honest.The most innocent reply is from a Moroccan woman who says after being bartered away as a wife to a nomad, \\"It was only after my divorce that I got to know erotic feelings. It was when I felt love for a man whom I still see today. With him I am free to express myself. I can love now in more than only the one or two positions which we traditionally know in nomad life. Sleeping together in one big bed the whole night long is exciting for me. I am free to praise Allah for these feelings.\\"Her photos show her lifting the bottom of her headdress to show... the full-length dress she's wearing underneath.Some of the other interviews are wilder or more explicit, but each woman's story offers similar insight both into the breadth and the limits of eroticism in everyday life.I bring this up because I just bought it in a bookstore.

We have visited Trinidad and Tobago many times and have learned to cook the local food. I can tell you that the recipes and the discussion in the book are genuine.

I'll recomend this book to everyone. BUY IT FROM AMAZON YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"I went through my cookbooks, to see if I could weed some out, because I have too many to mention. It's hard getting rid of a cookbook, especially one with a few recipes in it that you've come to love. But I've scanned the recipes I need to keep forever into my MacBook. However, there were an even dozen I couldn't part with. These are books I turn to time and time again, even though I consider myself somewhat of a gourmet chef.SWEET HANDS is one of those books I had to keep, not only because I've spent so much time in Trinidad (and a little in Tobago), but because of all the cookbooks I've seen there, I believe this one is the best. Even though I consider myself somewhat of a gourmet cook, I never really mastered the art of doubles, and I'd seen them made hundred of times, until I used the recipe on page 190 in this book. I think maybe it's the kuchela. I just never could seem to get the flavor I was after with the kind I bought at the High Lo Supermarket, but then a friend of a friend named Nazir had his wife make me up some and WOW do my doubles taste extra special now. Still, if you can't get Nazir's wife's kuchila you can probably find something that will do in a local West India Market. Basically, kuchela is made of mangoes and peppers, so you maybe could even try something else. Anyway, I'm digressing. This is a great cookbook, one which should belong to anybody who wants to call herself a Caribbean chef."},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"I am so bummed that this book is out of stock!! I just returned from my first trip to Trinidad & Tobago four days ago. I must say that I can not get the awesome flavors out of my mind - mango chow, Richard's bake & shark, doubles... Please restock!"},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"My husband is from Trinidad and for 11 years I have been looking for a good book that has all the recipes he loves rather than having to go online and looking for recipes all the time or having to call his mom! This book is awesome. It has everything from appetizers,soups, breads, meats and beverages! It has some beautiful food pictures too! I love this book. I got it at the library so i could check out the recipes, but now I will buy it. It will be great to pass it on to my daughter when she gets older! Great find!!

Many of the recipes I have learned from my mom and aunts, but there are a few that I have always wanted to master. Making Dhalpuri Roti has been a real challenge for me so I was interested in the roti recipes contained in the book and have to say overall the book is divided well and shares some good Trini recipes.As with any culinary backgrounds, I found that the recipes I learned from my family might be a little different, but that's the beauty of cooking.The reason the book did not get 5 stars from me is that I felt there could have been more colorful photos and nutritional information. Now I now many old time Trini;s might gasp at the concept, but for those of us watching our waistline because we are health fanatics or due to health reasons nutritional information is highly important.I found the book useful and a good learning to for those new to Trini cooking as well as the more intermediate and advance cooks. There is plenty recipes for rum cake, pastelles, and rum punch."},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"Good TrinBago recipes, but there are still many good traditional recipes missing. I also remembered so many of my mums recipes from my childhood. Apart from that the book is OK for a newcomer to Trinidadian and Tobagoian cooking. How lucky we are as a nation, to have such an infusion of different cultural influences of cooking skills.Unfortunately, (now I am being fussy), the photographs don't depict the true ethnicity of Trinidad and Tobago, those of us from these twin islands will look at these photos and agree with me.But hey! all books will always be bias in some way or the other. Happy cooking!!"},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"I recently purchased this Lovely Book....I cook from many different regions my love began as a child as my parents cooked foods from their homeland as well...I was drawn by the cover of the \\"sweet Hands\\" and found myself turning the pages..Island cooking with the flavors of it's bounty...Kudos, to the Author not only for the recipes....but the love and care and pride she shows in her family and childhood, as the fondation for this masterpiece..it truly is two books in one....The photos make you feel you are there....DELICIOUS!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"So I grew up with the original Naparima cookbookThe Multi-Cultural Cuisine of Trinidad & Tobago & the Caribbeanwhich got straight to the point on the recipes and was laid out like your typical high school Home Economics course. This book is another way to write a good cookbook for authentic Trinidad & Tobago cuisine, but also give it some real-world validation. Unlike the Nap book which was written by a Trinidadian, this one was written by an American who didn't actually live in Trinidad. Me, being born and raised in Trinidad and having my son spend summers in Trinidad with his grandparents know that the food experience is different for each situation. This author is not a chef, nor a cook but a journalist, so given that she has been brave enough to compete with the Naparima cookbook is enough to give her 5 stars.I like cookbooks with pictures, and both books lack in that department. This book is very narrative also compared to the Naparima cookbook which I don't really care for. I like simple and direct instructions, which the former maybe better for someone who is not familiar with these dishes. I grew up eating the majority of these dishes, and I learnt to make most of them from the Naparima cookbook since my mother didn't really teach me how to cook.What people need to understand that there is a street/store version of each dish and then there is your mother/grandmother's version (with that extra touch) which you are use to. The recipes are pretty standard and if you don't have that authentic Trini-food experience then your reviews of each recipe will be skewed by what you want to expect. For example, there is a recipe for \\"Pastelles with Eggs\\" which I have never ever had before. The author tells you that is is her fathers version which is heavily influenced by his experience living in Venezuela. This would be a recipe that I would not see as authentic Trinidadian food, since she already admits that it basically is not. Another example is a recipe for Avocado soup, which I have no idea was even a dish in Trinidad. I am not sure if this is a Trinidadian cookbook or a book about foods she and her family ate in Trinidad. The Naparima book doe not claim to be a Trinidadian & Tobago indigenous food cookbook, but a Home Economic cookbook of foods that we usually cook and eat in Trinidad which are not all entirely accredited to being from Trinidad nor Tobago.As a foodie and someone who collects cookbooks from other countries, it is very difficult for me to give this four or five stars because I believe the author started with the intention of giving a history of the country, and gave the reader the impression that it would a book about the cuisine of Trinidad & Tobago which cannot be found anywhere else which is really not the case for a good bit of these dishes. Yes, I know Trinidad cuisines has influences from many different countries, including South American countries, but a cookbook for a country should be those that can be solely accredited to that country.I didn't want to be too harsh, but I would still recommend this book because there aren't may other options for authentic Trinidad cuisine in cookbooks."},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"I enjoyed the book very much. It had very traditional recipes that I have been looking for, for years like pammie and dhal. I have tried a few recipes in the book and they came out great. I was not big on such a long intro in the front of the book but it's a good introduction for someone who is not too familiar with Trinidadian cooking"},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"This is the best kind of cookbook- one that contains both stories and history behind the recipes and recipes that are well-tested and sometimes adapted for what ingredients can be found in America. I love it!"},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"I love this book! The recipes are so different and interesting and it's such a pleasure to read. The short reviews before each recipe are so informative that they made me feel good reading them, even before I got to the recipe itself. It felt like each piece was reaching out to me and pulling me in. I can't wait to try the fried bread called \\"Bake\\" which reminds me of when my own mother used to make homemade bread and my (Irish) grandfather would take pieces from that and make us fried dough; it was so delicious as I'm sure this will be. I also have a sweet tooth so will be making some of the sweets and desserts, and will be impressing my relatives with these treats at our next family gathering! I also want to add that the author's dedication of this book to her brother and late parents was so heartfelt that it brought tears to my eyes. What a wonderful find this book was!"},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"The recipes were refreshingly different, unlike a lot of culinary books which essentially tend to re-hash stuff that you can find in Larousse Gastronomic and other classics. I was first interested in the influences of island cuisine after eating at Aki, an amazing Japanese restaurant in NYC whose chef is the former chef for the Japanese embassy in the Bahamas. His Caribbean variations on traditional Japanese cuisine were really delicious! In a similar vein, this book does a good job of presenting similar concepts while packaging them in personal stories which give some cultural background as well. If you are interested in recipes which go a bit beyond traditional French cuisine, then this is a refreshing book."},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"I am a native Trini and I was thrilled to see this book in print.

Instant recognition that the recipes were following through on the traditional culinary treats in T & T. Plan to start cooking during my Summer hols. Sweet Trini food!"},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"I can see where the author is coming from in her love of Trini food. My mom is from Trinidad and only my grandma would make the traditional dishes for us, but I've always loved them since I was a child. My grandma never used recipes, she just knew what was in the dishes but never exactly how much and she never measured anything so I wasn't able to learn how to cook traditionally from her. The recipes in this book are great and easy to follow. It also reminded me that sometimes you just need to make do with what you have (try the doubles recipe with a can of diced potatoes instead of chickpeas and serve over rice). I still struggle a bit with the roti, but I've never made bread before. A rolling pin has helped a lot. This book covers all different aspects of cooking, from blending your own spices, to making full dishes, soups, and desserts. Truly a great value!"},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"I was born in Trinidad but live in the US. Sometimes it's hard to find comparable spices, veggies, etc. to help make our dishes more like we remember. The author did a great job helping us determine which things to buy in the US to help in this area. She left nothing out, I found all my favorites. I actually ordered it as a wedding gift to my cousin, but I will be ordering one for myself as well! Really a great book!"},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"This book is a pure delight.

However, being placed on the grand stage that amazon allows, requires greater care in the information that is actually put out to the world.Trinidad was discovered on Columbus' 3rd voyage to the New World and NOT his 2nd. Also, the Dutch nor French ever held control over Trinidad. It was the Spanish (who allowed French planters to own plantations via the Cedula of population) who first controlled Trinidad and then the British who wrested control in 1797. Those missteps about the history of the country whose name this book is in is a huge turnoff.Apart from that, ok recipes."},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"Growing up in trinidad and tobago is a unique experience and the foods there are definitely #1 compared to a lot of other islands. When I first moved to the USA, I was not all that concerned with trying to find the foods since there was a place for roti near our house, and you can find most of those ingredients in Miami. It was not until after college when i moved to the Northwest States that I felt \\"homesick\\" for dahlpuri and callaloo and other such things. I have purchased and tested several books that are a generalized Caribbean cookbook, as well as hunted down the Naparima Girls Guide to Cooking. It was not until I found Sweet Hands and read through it that I found what I needed.The pictures of Trinidad and the stories bring that element of history and home and passion to the recipes. And I LOVE that she offers substitutions for some of the ingredients. I made a callaloo stew with swiss chard and spinach as suggested, and while the taste was slightly less sweet, it carried such a good flavour that I felt I was home again. Those other cookbooks maybe going to the second hand store."},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"I am the first generation as a US citizen, both parents from Trinidad. So the food I grew up eating and buying from our neighborhood trini spots...it's all I really know. Now that I am an adult I want my children to know trini food as well and this book does the trick.

Great book, great history...GREAT BUY!!!"},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"This is the only Caribbean book I have seen that includes recipes for the more unusual items you will get while visiting Trinidad.

Even the picky people who were afraid of curry."},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"This is definitely much better than your average cookbook. Many cookbooks I own just have recipes, and maybe units of measuring in the indexes. This book not only gives a bit of background for each food item, but a descriptive history of Trinidad and Tobago through it's culture- food, and family. You can actually sit down and read it- I didn't realize I was doing that until halfway through the main dishes! The pictures are amazing, and really depicts life on these beautiful islands.This is a must-have book for anyone who loves to cook, anyone who loves to travel, or anyone who enjoys food!"},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"In a time where it seems like so many cookbooks published are these repetitive celebrity chef vehicles that repackage the same 15 recipes, it's really great to get ahold of one with a fresh perspective. Not only are the recipes pretty exciting and new to me (going to see if this New Yorker can sweeten her hands up!), but the author prefaces each one with a blurb or personal experience that makes it a really fun read."},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"First of all this Amazon entry neglects to inform you that the actual author of the book is Ramin Ganeshram. Jean-Paul Vellotti (named above)is the talented photographer for the book (and the author's husband). This book of recipes is full of genuine authentic family history, documented with beautiful photos of the region and people, and particularly--the food. This cuisine is very flavorful and appealing. I recently made the \\"Dad's Curried Chicken\\" recipe, and it was absolutely delicious. The recipes are very accessible, and sharp storytelling (in words and pictures) give the actual book a wonderful \\"flavor\\", that is both sensuous and tantalizing for the reader. I know that as soon as I was able to put the book down I was craving \\"home food\\". Next stop Trinidad. This is a cookbook of wonderful quality and value. It belongs on the bookshelf with one's best-loved recipes."},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"Since, I left the caribbean I have being looking for real West Indians recipes and this book did the trick .

Excellent book."},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"It's okay. I tried her recepies on basics like breads and it was bland. I think she's mixing Trini with some other culture's recepie and it's just not working too well. The way she describes ponche crema is not the simple, delicious way a Trini makes it-- We don't add cream of coconut!I should have put the money towards the Naparima Girls book. Never heard one complaint about that book from any die-hard Trini."},{"Title":"Sweet Hands: Island Cooking From Trinidad And Tobago (Hippocrene Cookbook Library)","review":"What a trip back in time.

A GREAT BOOK!!"},{"Title":"Jewel Cave Adventure: Fifty Miles of Discovery in South Dakota","review":"I normally don't write reviews on books. But this on is worth the exception. I first read this book back in the mid to late 80's., when I first started to become interested in caving. I found this book to be both informative as well as entertaining. I've done cave exploration in Minnesota Wisconsin Iowa and South Dakota. In 1988 I attended the annual convention of the National Speleological Society. It took place that Black Hills of South Dakota that year. I then had a chance to do some spelunking in Jewel Cave. This is by far on of the most exciting caves I have ever explored. While in the cave our group crossed paths with Dwight Deal. He caved with the Conn's during the time period written about in this book. He regaled us with some amusing stories about Jewel Cave.(Quite a interesting person.) As one of the evenings line up for the convention we had a presentation from Herb and Jan. They talk about there adventures in Jewel Cave. And pulled out there personal map from their exploration over the years. Then Jan gave a demonstration on filling and lighting a carbide lamp blindfolded. Herb and Jan are truly amazing. If your interested in caves, this is one you'll not want to put down. This one lives up to its name. It's quite an adventure."},{"Title":"Jewel Cave Adventure: Fifty Miles of Discovery in South Dakota","review":"Almost fifty years ago, two rock climbers entered a 'nice little cave' to survey it. They had never gone caving before, and wanted to try it out. Because of their efforts, that cave, Jewel Cave, is today the second longest cave in the US. This book tells the tale in a fluent, easy style that is sure to delight and enjoy. Next to 'The Longest Cave' it is possibly the most enjoyable exploration story about caving around. you will be amazed at the amount of work a small group of people was able to do, from the sometimes tortuous mapping of the cave, to the hard backbreaking labor involved in making a portion of their discovery open for public viewing, as part of Jewel Cave Natl. Monument. A large map comes with the book so you can follow them as they explore the ever expanding labyrynth. The 'Jewel Cave Adventure' is a great book for everyone, whether you are seriously interested in the undergorund or just looking for a darn good read."},{"Title":"Jewel Cave Adventure: Fifty Miles of Discovery in South Dakota","review":"Herb and Jan Conn were amateur climbers in the 1930s who fell in love with the Black Hills of South Dakota. At a friend's suggestion, the Conns began moonlighting as spelunkers in winter. When they first visited Jewel Cave, it was a tiny cavern with an intriguing unexplored passage. Luckily for the Conns, that passage led to a mile of unexplored cave passages, then two miles... and exploring Jewel Cave became the Conns' life's work. They describe the exciting exploration (which is still ongoing, with more than 100 miles of passages mapped) with just the right balance of action/adventure, science, and humor. This book is a pioneer of the outdoor/geography genre and is readable, fun and fascinating.-Review by David Bezanson"},{"Title":"Jewel Cave Adventure: Fifty Miles of Discovery in South Dakota","review":"What an adventure Jan and Herb Conn experienced! I have had the great experience of actually meeting the Conns in person and they are as delightful to visit with as they are in the book. Anyone who is into speleology should buy this book and relish the fun and science occuring through-out it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"How is it possible that out of all the different literature classes I've taken (including a few American and a women's lit classes) that I have never heard of Betty Smith? This is one of the best novels I've ever read. The characters were so real, and the way Smith described the neighborhood and the culture made it seem as real to me as the world outside my door. This is the book that when you finish you hesitate to read another book, because it's really not possible to measure up to it. I admit that I was put off by the whole &quot;coming of age&quot; title this book seems to get, but it's so much more than that. It's a beautiful piece of literature and Betty Smith is an important American and woman author. I hope her other novels come back in print."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"You know those books you continually read over and over? The ones that grab you with their honesty, their utter beauty? This is one of those. This book is by far my favorite book--and considering how much I read, that is saying quite a bit. The writing is simple and elegant in that simplicity. Betty Smith has a way with words that pulls you in and lets you experience everything as if it were entirely firsthand. Because of that, this is not a book to read through quickly, but to savor at length. It paints pictures in your mind that settle into the crevices of your imagination, to be brought out later and enjoyed. They just don't write them like this, anymore."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"25 years after reading this book for the first time, I STILL love this book as much as I did the first time I read it. The characters are warm and real and the story still inspires me. I have given a copy of this book to every young girl in my life and everyone of them has been thrilled once they have read it. I re-read this book at least once a year and it has a treasured place of honor among my collection of girlhood favorites."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's quite sad that someone with limited spelling and vocabulary felt the need to write three separate reviews against this book, merely changing the order of the complaint. Clearly, s/he didn't understand it. This book does not merely discuss the fact that Francie had a rough life that she managed to overcome; remember, as she and Neeley discussed the future after their mother remarried, they reminded each other how much fun it had all been along the way. Francie's struggles, analogous to the tree of the title, are what stimulated her young mind. Smith's writing so crisply describes tenement life, but she also gives Francie the credit for making crucial decisions along the way (changing schools, for example), rather than depending on others to think for her. My mother tried to get me to read this book for years, but it is not a book for young children--it took adulthood for me to truly appreciate this wonderful, heartfelt book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book quickly became my favorite book of all time! It was filled with fantastic detail and wonderful discription. I cried, I laughed, I was depressed I was extatic! This book was really amazing!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When i first bought the book, i had heard what a great book it was and how it was one the best books out there. As i began to read i wasnt sure if i was gonna like it as much as others had but i read on anyway. After the starting the second chapter, the book had literally absorbed almost all of my attention. While reading it i felt as though the characters were living next door and i knew them for my whole life. Its a complicated book about a girl living in brooklyn scrounching for money, learning about life, and basically growing up. I would have to say that no words i write can describe the book to its best. It is one of the best books i've ever read in my life and i recommend it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A deeply moving and all around great book. Smith captivates the spirit of a young girl in full. One of the best pound for pound books of our time. Being 13 years old and just getting into classical reading I would say this book is very easy to understand and read. It compares easily with To Kill A Mockingbird and Diary of Anne Frank."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is a bittersweet novel about a girl growing up in Brooklyn in the early 1900s. Even though her family is poor they still know what is important in life. All the characters come to life in this book. Francie is described from ages 11-16. I like her character better as a child than a teenager. This is a very well written book. I would recommend that every American should read it for a taste of a different life style."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book wa like reading a collage. Ms. Smith gives the reader many 'snapshots' of what life is like for Francie. We learn about her mother and her father and how Francie is like (and unlike) them. We learn about her setting and how Brooklyn makes her who she is. We learn about how poverty shaped her character. It's really a marvelous book, the kind I read at least twice a year just to releran the lessons it teaches me. What are those lessons? Here are a few: children pay attention to more than we think they do; poor people aren't always lazy; you can love somebody but also occasionally hate them...Bottom line? READ THE BOOK! (Then read it again.)"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn for a school assignment. I had over a week to read the first 80 pages. In three days, I finished it. This book is wonderful. It tells a full complete story of Francie Nolan's life of growing up. I truly enjoyed it. It is one of thise books that you positivly love, and HAVE to read over and over again. It truthfully tells the story of a poor, working class family in the early 1900s. It has characters that you will absolutely love, and the book is one to be treasured for many, many years to come."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I'm so glad that I decided to read this book. I'd initially purchased it because it was on sale (and I really needed something new to read). Nonetheless, this book has become one of my, if not all time, favorite novels. The characters and situations are so real, and I'm a firm believer that ANYONE (male or female, young or old) can somehow relate to Francie Nolan. In this day and age where the youth seldomly read and are exposed to terrible mediums of entertainment (reality tv--Paris Hilton??) we need books such as \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.\\" It's so genuine and full of spirit and heart, despite the characters' dismal situations. This book has the ability to inspire readers to live their lives with integrity and to persevere--especially in seemingly hopeless situations."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"After reading this book, I looked at the negative reviews to see what people could have possibly said was wrong with this book. A few found it boring, some found it depressing. I think these people did not give this book the proper attention it deserved. Though \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is about the life of a poor girl in a poor neighborhood and a poor life, this is not what the book focuses on. As you read the book, you are constantly reading about the beauty of the world around Francie Nolan, not the squalor. Through most of the book, you see the world through the eyes of a young, imaginative, smart, innocent girl who does not have the \\"education\\" and \\"knowledge\\" to realize how terribly she has it. You see the true love bonds between brother and sister, father and daughter, and between a mother and daughter who love each other despite their inability to understand one another. Although it is true that there is some sorrow in this story, I found myself laughing much more often than I found myself crying. The sad parts are not fun, but pain is in every good and realistic story. The humor in everyday people and everyday life is what makes this book so enjoyable. Each character has a specific personality with humorous and lovable quirks. And the ending is worth the entire book. I finished this book feeling so wonderful about every aspect of my life. It is not a completely happy ending, but it is a very satisfying one. I would recommend this book to any girl or woman and I would recommend that everyone else should give it an honest chance too."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I loved this book. I would honestly suggest this book to anyone and everyone I know.. even though the book was written so long ago, and takes place during the turn of the last century, the story is so timeless, and I could relate all of it. This was a great read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Wow - this one has been on my \\"must read\\" list for a long time, and I am so glad I finally picked it up. I read it in 2 sittings, and could barely put it down. The coming-of-age story of Francie Nolan is apparently based on Betty Smith's own life - and she is a magician with the written word. Her descriptions of the deepest poverty of Brooklyn during WWI and insights into the minds and souls of fragile yet incredibly strong people are stunning. Her observations about the human condition are timeless. Tree is a real treasure of American literature..."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is a beautiful story in so many ways - the strong, complex characters, and the history of a legendary part of the United States being just two of them. The world through the main character's eyes is a world seen anew. The reader truly can feel raw intensity of early 20th century Brooklyn, the challenge and joy of immigrant communities living together. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an enriching and enchanting story."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is timeless. I've read it a couple of times and so has my mom. Nothing dull in these pages. When friends and I discuss books, I always suggest this book first, second, and last!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It broke my heart during parts though, I had never realized how different times were then. It is a bit long, but I found that in the end, the extra length was worth it. Francie is by far one of my favorite characters I have come upon in any book. Those looking for an exciting book may want to back away from this one, but those wishing to read a wonderful piece of literature definitely need to pick this up."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is one of my favorite books. Everything I like to find in a book is in it: honesty, depth of character, some sadness and also happiness. I love how this book shows all the different aspects of Francie's life through her own experiences and the experiences and lives of the people around her. On the last page, when I read the last paragraph, I almost felt like crying, and believe me, I'm not the type of person who starts to cry in romantic movies. Anyway, another great thing about this book is that you can see how Francie changes as she grows older. Again, another thing I like is how some of the characters who lead rather unconventional lives (take Sissy or Johnny)are described as the people who they really are and not labled as we tend to do in our society. This is an excellent book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was a very good book. It was about a little girl, Francie, who grew up poor and became successful when she got older. She went to school and did part-time jobs. She went on to college with the support of her mother and with a lot of obstacles in her way. She also met a great guy. You have to read the book to really understand it. This book has foreshadowing and rising action in it. The author played out the book well. It keeps you interested and it makes you want to keep on reading. You want to know what happens at the end. It really is that interesting. I can't give this book any bad critique's, because it is a good book overall. It's a good book to learn about life. Life gets better and the saying, \\"there's always a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" is a good saying to describe this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I just wanted to add to the review lists that I really really enjoyed this book and am saddened that I didn't read it earlier in life. I think there is a bit of Francie Nolan in all of us."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is one I highly recommend. Anyone who has ever wanted to be a little bit better, a little bit more dignified, this is the story of yourself. It may be a bit long, but it is truly a jewel of a novel. Inspiring and heartfelt!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I felt that A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN really expressed the life of a poor, struggling family growing up in the ghettos of Brooklyn. Betty Smith worked hard to enable the readers to understand this young child's perspective of life. The readers were able to focus in on the real problems and hardships that a child faced, when she was poor, and living in an unfair society, with uncaring people. The three children learn to deal with things and take them as they are, although they are having a very troublesome childhood. The novel goes on to tell about the parents, especially the father who seemed lost in the world. The father, spends all of his money buying alcohol, and getting drunk, where as the mother tries to cover up for his behaviors, and tries to make life seem normal. But of course, life isn't normal for this family. An even though the children's schools don't offer much of an education, the children discover how much they want to learn about life, and it's interesting ways. With only their mother to boost their self esteem, the children go on to collage, and the daughter has an editing job, where she earns a large amount of money to keep the family going. I enjoyed this book whole-heartedly and found it to be a suspense-holding novel with very good ideas. The author really made each character different, but loving towards each other. I hope all of the young readers in this world have a chance to read this wonderful novel."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"There are a few books that I always, always return to (Gone With The Wind, Rebecca, and others) and &quot;Tree&quot; goes into this category without a doubt. I don't know how many times I've read it in the 15 years since the first time I read it, but every time I pick it up, it's like coming home again. I have read Betty Smith's other books, and I was disappointed with them. Nothing could compare with the richness of &quot;Tree&quot;. I wish a more recent film were made of this book. Ignore the reviews here that insult &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,&quot; because this book is like sinking into a big comfortable sofa for a long talk with a friend you haven't seen in years."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I had to read &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;A Separate Peace&quot; for sophmore English. I read &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; first because it was longer and I wanted to get it over with. It is my favorite book now (and I don't read that often). I didn't even read &quot;A Separate Peace&quot; because I reread &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; so many times."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was a great novel. Francie Noloan's description of her life filled with heartache, alcoholism, and poverty was extremely touching. Francie describes her life set in the early 1900's in the poor neighborhoods of Brooklyn. Her family and their lives of poverty, are the main focus of the novel. &quot;It grew in boarded up lots and out of neglected rubbish heaps and it was the only tree that grew out of cement. It grew lavishly but in tenement districts.&quot; Smith's words capture a central theme of the book. It describes a young girl struggling to survive compared with the tree struggling to grow out of cement. Not only do they both survive, they both flauresh. Betty Smith captures the time perfectly and makes it seem real. She portrays each character in a distinct way. For example, Johnny, Francie's father leaves the reader angry and sad because of his drinking. This novel is especially geared women both young and old. I was disappointed with the ending because I was looking for a conclusion of Francie's life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Three years ago, when I was in the 9th grade, my English teacher introduced this book to my class. When my teacher explained how this would be a wonderful book, I found myself looking at her and thinking: &quot;Yeah, right. Whatever.&quot; Since I usually read books that were written by Asian authors, I did not think that this book would appeal to me in any way. The title sounded boring, and the book just SEEMED to be a boring one. However, I was proven wrong. Once I started reading the first page, I became completely absorbed into the story and couldn't put it down. The story about Francie Nolan and her family living in dire poverty touched my heart in a way few books ever have. I found myself immediately feeling for this young girl named Francie as she grew older and more mature with each page. By the time I finished the story, I had completely fallen in love with this book and read it all over again. I loved this book so much that I decided to keep the school copy ! (and pay for it) as I wanted to keep THIS particular copy of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Three years have now passed and I still treasure my first copy of The Tree and read it over and over again. Betty Smith has a simple, &quot;flowing&quot; writing style which enables one to become absorbed into the story very quickly. Needless to say, this has become one of my favorite books. I hope that one day, I will be able to introduce this wonderful book to someone else as my English teacher did to me 3 years before. Anyone who misses this book IS indeed denying themselves a truly rich experience. I heartily recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book has the eloquence, interest, and truth of history's greatest stories. By reading this novel, we also find an introspective view at a pivotal point in American history. I am deeply curious as to why Betty Smith's classic story of Francie Nolan has not been named the Great American Novel, for surely it qualifies."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It was 1962. I was 15. My life paralleled Francie's in so many ways I couldn't stand it. I desperately wanted a copy of the book but my family, like Francie's was very poor and we couldn't afford it. I was a student librarian at my high school and one of my jobs was to repair the books that had broken spines, and torn pages. As luck (fate?) would have it, one of the books in my pile of repairs was the &quot;Tree.&quot; It was so torn and tattered, the spine broken beyond repair (at least that was my juicy rationalization in my desperate, grasping teenage mind). The pages were like onion skin and spilled on to the floor when I picked the book up. I remember the decision vividly. Without hesitation I slipped the book into my large purse. I read, reread, the book and read it some more. My ritual was to read it at least once a year. It touched me in so many ways. Now it's 1998. I still have the book. I've moved cross country and back numerous times. I have lost more books and possessions in moving than I care to remember. But you know how when you move you always take your most precious things with you so nothing happens to them? This is what I have always done with &quot;Tree.&quot; It is my most treasured possesion. Yes, I made good on my theft. Some years ago I wrote a letter to the school and explained what I had done and enclosed a check so they could buy many, many more books. It's wonderful to read the reviews and know that this work of art has touched others lives as deeply as it has mine."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"c'mon-this is at least an eleven...I found this book in my grandparents basement, copywrite -like, 1920 or something. Anyway, this book is just so freakin' good."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"My 9th grade teacher introduced this book to me and I thought it was going to be very boring and dull because it was such a long book.I was wrong it was so intresting, and so descriptive I felt as though I was Francie.It was so good (and the longest book I had ever read) I read it 3 times in 1 and a half years.The more I read it the more I loved the book.I recommend this book for anyone who refuses to read because reading this will surely get them to change their minds about reading.My whole class read it and even the guys could'nt put the book down.I am very thankful I was able to read this book because I will never forget how great the story was.Thank God we have an author as wonderful as Betty Smith to inspire us with her beautiful stories."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I love this book! I found my new favorite novel. I recently read this book and fell in love with the story. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs to be entertained and inspired!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"There are no words to describe how wonderful this book is. I've read many books in my life and this is the #1, all time favorite, desert island pick. I've read it four times and it always touches me. I can't imagine a person with a heart who wouldn't find a friend in Francie. Read this book. If you buy a one cent used copy or check it out from the library, read it. You will not be sorry."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, written by Betty Smith, is a fabulous novel, which is about a young girl growing up poor in Williamsburg, Brooklyn with her family and neighbors. This novel was published in 1943 by Harper and Brothers Publishing and was selected as one of the Books of the Century by the New York Public Library. Francie Nolan, the protagonist of this story, is a delightful young child with such great determination to succeed and to get an education. This novel is so interesting, because it shows how the hardship of daily life was like back in the 1900s. Francie Nolan has a very tough time growing up in Brooklyn at age 11. Part of this reason is because her father is an alcoholic, who struggles tremendously, therefore not being able to be a good father. This comes down to Francie having an empty stomach continuously. Francie is such a gentle and obedient young girl who is a mix of both the Nolan family and the Rommely family, though she is more of her own person. She acquires her own personality and own traits through her observations and readings, which really makes Francie a live and brilliant character.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was written very methodically, with the chapters going through Francie's life year by year, consisting with times when you can just about break out into tears, and times when you are just angry with a specific character. The conflicts, in which take place in Francie Nolan's life, are so realistic and entertaining that any reader will fall in love with the protagonist, Francie Nolan.Betty definitely achieved her purpose in writing this novel, for she intended for readers both young and mature to realize how fortunate they are to have up to three meals a day, while Francie considered it a blessing to eat only a slice of stale bread. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn strongly emphasizes the value of reading and education very clearly, but more significant, the importance of family and friends who will do anything to keep you safe from the real world."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"There's nothing I can add to the many fine detailed plot summaries already here, so I'll just say that I agree with countless critics more learned than I who put this on the very short list of Great American Novels.I have given it to every young girl I care about, starting with my four daughters and eight granddaughters, and I felt like a real sexist when one of my nine grandsons told me he borrowed his sister's copy and thought it the best book he'd ever read.The Dorothy McGuire/Peggy Ann Garner movie, by the way, is one of those very rare movies that almost do justice to a great book. Don't miss it, either."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have to admit that it took a long time for me to get into the story. If I hadn't enjoyed the film and didn't know the story as well as I did from my grandmother, I probably would have stopped around page 100 or so. The first third of the story is centered around the struggles and the shame of being poor. The second third allows the characters some time to blossom and shows the sacrifices families are willing to make to give the children a better chance. The final third shows the first tenous results of those years of sacrifice and at last the characters come into their own. Of course there are also the themes of life lessons learned, family tragedies, and family joy."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith (1896-1972) wrote an American classic which became a huge bestseller in World War II America. The book was later made into a fine film.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a novel dealing with the coming of age of a young Irish girl Francie Nolan. Francie grows up in poverty in Brooklyn. Her mother is hardworking and favors Francie's brother Neely, Her Irish father is a singing waiter who drinks himself to death in his early 30s. Francie's school is grim and life in Brooklyn in the early 1900s is a constant struggle for survival to the impoverished residents of this most colorful of New York's boroughs.Smith takes these ingredients and mixes them into a potent stew of heartwarming tales concerning Francie, her friends and her family,The book is no sentimental slow boat to a halcyon past of childhood memories. Smith tells her tale in a matter of factnon-maudlin way. Her style is simple but profound. Author Smith uses simple words to convey the joys and sorrows, tragedies and small triumphs experienced by a poor family in a poor locale.Everyone who wants to read a very accessible touching classic should read this excellent novel of a young girl and her dreams and daily life.I devoured this book in two days as I was transported back in time to the Brooklyn of the early 20th century entering into the tenement home of the Nolans. It is a trip I recommend for you to read!The Perennial edition contains a short biography of Betty Smith including a reminiscence by her daughter.A beautiful, enduring classic of American prose!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am having a hard time believing someone would give this book a bad review. I must have read it 10 times over my life and I love it! I am about to purchase a new copy for my almost 9 year old daughter, as my copy is obviously well worn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I spent a very happy new years eve a few years ago with a bottle of champage and this book, and since then it has become a friend in times of need.There is always hope, so long as you have the strength to survive."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book based on the reviews here and I wasn't disappointed. I felt a part of the Nolan family throughout, longed to help them (thought they wouldn't have accepted it), and enjoyed their company. The many characters are quite well depicted as is life in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn. It's a glorious tale of family ties, neighborhoods, loyalty and strength. While long, it is a fairly fast read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book about five years ago while I was still in high school and I still find myself loving it just as much today. This is a great example of a coming of age book. Its a short read which makes it great for younger readers. But just because its short doesnt mean that there are not so many messages to take from this book. You see Francie grow from a nieve child to an educated adult. You sit with her as she suffers the heart ache that often hits us all at some point in life and show that life must go on. With so many books becoming a staple in high school education I find myself wondering how this book is not one of them. Showing that we all have it inside us to make it even under the worst of circumstances. A prime example of how the smallest seed can still manage to bloom into one of the greatest flowers."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I shared this book with my father, we talked about the caracters as if they were friends, and they were. When my father died I took our beat up copy to a bookbinder and had it rebond in leather with gold lettering. He couldn't believe I wanted to spend that kind of money on a 40 year old book club addition. It means that much to me. I reread it at least yearly, it is an old friend."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I recieved A Tree Grows in Brooklyn as a gift for my eleventh birthday, from my dad. I knew it was a classic, and wanted to read it, even if just to impress my dad. However, I didn't get around to it until I was about twelve and a half. It was one of those books where I would pick it up, read a few pages, then toss it aside, until reading and falling madly in love. I have read this book about four times, and each time I read it, I feel so.... alive, I guess. Being a teenager (14 now) like Francie, when I read the book I feel as if my emotions have been validated. Once, after reading it on vacation, I had finished it and wandered around the empty cabin, sighing and crying. This is one extremely powerful, beautiful, and emotional book, and -this is a command- you MUST read it. It will send you on an emotional journey, and leave you changed forever."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I'll admit, I was hesitant when my teacher told me we were going to begin reading this 430 page book. I thought to myself, &quot;Oh no, another book that drags on and on...&quot; I could not have been more wrong about this book. This book is extremely touching, as well as interesting. I found myself engrossed in this book to the point where I didn' t want to do anything else but read, which for me, doesn' t happen very often. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone, and I hope that whoever reads it will enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book stirred my heart as a teenager, Francie's age. Her expeirences with love and being wanted are so like mine it is amazing. I had to read this for a summer reading assignment. And I have a horrible time reading something required. It takes away from the book. But I could hardly put this down. I suggest this to EVERYONE!!!!!! Especially for younger girls, this has so many wonderfully, independent and strong women as role modles! Everyone from 2 to 102 needs to read this."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"AFTER REVIEWING ALL THE GREAT COMMENTS ABOUT THE&quot;TREE&quot; I FIND THAT EVERYTHING I FELT WAS ALREADY EXPRESSED A THOUSAND DIFFERENT WAYS. THE LOVE I FEEL FOR THIS BOOK IS IMEASURABLE. I DISCOVERED IT WHEN I WAS 10 YRS. OLD. I WAS READING A FICTION STORY IN A MAGAZINE, AND THEY MADE REFERENCE TO THAT BK. I AM A VORACIOUS READER AND AT THAT TIME I DID NOT KNOW WHAT BOOKS I WOULD LIKE SO I WAS ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR TITLES OF BKS. I HADN'T HEARD BEFORE, AND RUSH TO THE LIBRARY TO CHECK IT OUT. FROM THAT MOMENT ON MY LIFE WAS NEVER THE SAME. FRANCIE TOUCHED MY HEART LIKE NO OTHER CHARACTER HAS. SADLY, THE WOMAN WHO GAVE ME THIS WONDERFUL GIFT HAS LONG BEEN DEAD. GOD BLESS YOU BETTY SMITH FOREVER AND EVER."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"First of all I would like to say that this book deserves A LOT more than just 5 stars. It deserves the whole sky full of stars,.... and then some!I started reading this book for an assignment in 7th grade and had one week to read it. I didn't get it done though but I loved it very much. Two years later I found it at a library and decided to start reading it again. I got finished with the whole thing and I don't think I'll ever find a book better than it! It just touched the bottom of my heart and it made me cry when I got to the last chapter of it and I would recomend this book to anyone especially people who don't like reading because this would teach them that there really are totally AWESOME books out there and I would say that this is the #1 book in the world!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book for an English project.

I love it!!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I'm 14 years old and I really don't like reading, but I fell in love with this book. I'm from Norway, a small country in north Europe, and a lot of norwegian people went to Brooklyn, in hope for a better life, in the early 1900. So that's what made me read it in the first place.

It's a lesson for life!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I saw the movie A tree Grows in Brooklyn, I didn't know much about it, but I loved the film so my mom bought me the book.

YOU HAVE TO READ THIS!!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book when I had just turned 14. Before that time, I was not an overly emotional person - didn't cry at movies, etc. Let me tell you, if you wish to be involved in the characters you are reading about, to have a touching story stick with you through life or to just have a classic read that is very enjoyable, read this book. Since I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I have better learned to stay in touch with my compassionate, nurturing and sensitive side. I am 24 now and have been known to cry on subway rides because I am so involved in the novels I am reading. This book will surely do that to you."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have seen the video twice for this story and did not realize how much was not included until reading the book!This is a timeless classic. It reminded me of Angela's Ashes butwith greater sensitivity.Do not let this one pass you by."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was assigned reading for a book club that I'm in, and I am glad it was or I may have overlooked it. The reflections of the main character, Francie, create what for me is a whole other world; kind of a real-life science fiction. This is better than sci-fi or fantasy, though, because it is a glimpse of a real time &amp; place that existed nearly a century ago. Betty Smith writes from the heart about a place that, while holding no appearant beauty to outsiders, is glorious in the author's recollections. It also reminds readers of what the &quot;American Dream&quot; is really made of. The situations are wrought with love, and the characters are very real, multi-dimensional people. I would especially recommend this book to women of all ages."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When i began reading the novel A tree grows in Brooklyn i immediatly realted to the characters and felt their suffering and joys just as they did. From Johnny to Francie i began to love these characters and the story they were a part of. Betty Smith creates a world in this book in which the reader gets to feel what it was like to be poor and what it was like to not always have what you wanted and needed. This story also brought out so many emotions and was it truly became a heart-wrenching and tear-jerking moment for me whenever i sat down with this heavy hardcover in my lap. I didn't ever stop and think to be grateful for what i had but after reading this i see how it is to have to suffer and work and not have money and now i am much more apreciative for what i am so lucky to have been given.

I absolutly loved this book and will treasure what it has given me passionatly for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a touching and realistic portrait of a young girl, living in the slums of New York at the turn-of-the-century.

A Tree Grows in Brooklyn put you in the place of Francie Nolan and takes you through a life that you never thought you could live. I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book I read as a child as well as seeing the movie. For anyone who loved Anne of Green Gables, this book is as beautiful in a different way. It teaches morals, values, and the practical versus the emotional (and how each has its own value.) If you are searching for the perfect book for a daughter, grandaughter, or niece--10 and up, you just can't go wrong. It also provides a glimpse backward into America's history, when things were harder to come by and appreciated more."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This story has been very close to my heart ever since I first read it in junior high. I have read it dozens of times since and its meaning, honesty and authetic descrition of this young Brooklyn girl and her family still effect me in the same way. Don't miss your chance to enjoy this keeper--&quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; deserves a spot on your shelf next to all the great literary classics that you enjoy."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was a pretty good book. It was about a girl named Francie and she grew up in Brooklyn with her parents and her little brother, Neeley. It was a pretty good book because it showed you steps of growing up; it started out when she was around six or seven years old and all the way up to college. I would probably recommend this book to someone else to read because it was pretty interesting."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A tree grows in Brooklyn is a heartfelt story about a young girl and her lower class family in Brooklyn, New York. Author Betty Smith tells the stories of Francie, her brother Neely and the rest of the Nolans and their lives between 1912-1920. Betty using comfortable,descriptive writing,tells of the triumphs and sorrows Francie faces as she grows. She talks about the exciting events that happen in the lives of their family including the marriage of Francie's sister Katie and the reactions it caused. Betty often speaks of a special tree,&quot;The Tree of Heaven,&quot; as it is called in Brooklyn; Francie tells that it is beautiful and it &quot;reaches the sky.&quot; I really enjoyed the story and I would reccommend it to any sappy person who enjoys curling up to the fire with a good emotional novel."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is an amazing story of a young girl growing up in poverty in New York City. The vividness of the images, the developing of the characters, Betty Smith is a master at her art. Francie and her family come alive in this book. I've read it over and over and I still love it. I would recommend it for anyone from high level 4th grade readers to elderly people.

The story is told through the eyes of a young girl growing up in a very poor family. It tells of her life from grade school to adulthood. The family experiences many tragedies along the way to eventual happiness. I got this book because it was the most read book by GI's during WWII. I did not know what it was about. It has great characters, stories and a upbeat ending. I would recommend it to teenagers who want I look at life from a different perspective."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have read maybe over three or four thousand books in my lifetime (I am thirteen now) and still none of them surpass A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. I have read every single one of Smith's books and this one grabs my heart each time I read it. I read this first in third grade, again in sixth and again in eighth.

It goes on and on about what is happening in Francie Nolan's life, and the whole time I think \\"What does this have to do with anything? I really don't care that Francie saw old men when she was buying bread. Does this have to do with some sort of ending that might happen after 550 pages of boring writing?\\" I appreciate and respect that this book is a classic, and it isn't really written in the style as most books are now - a - days, but I just didn't like it AT ALL."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I loved this book the first time I read it, and when I first picked it up I had trouble putting it down.

I would recommend it to any one"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"My school English group had to read this book for a project. This book is a classic literature book about a girl named Francie growing up in the Brooklyn slums in the early 20th century. The novel provides a really shocking view of hardships that grip the lower class, even today. From a suburban middle-class teenager point of view, it was a really in depth and profound story. But, everybody including myself in the group, had a difficult time reading this. Though we were allowed to choose from a wide variety of novels, we were drawn to this particular one. But, we found the story too long, not interesting enough for our age group, and it had too many dry spells without really appealing action. Until you get to the 22nd chapter, events don't seem to move along quickly enough. Though there are quite a bit of attention-grabbing scenes that some parents might call inappropriate (mention of condoms, vulgar language, etc.), those were the most interesting to my group. For parents or adults that are considering giving this book to a young adult, make sure that they like history, long novels, and are interested in social problems effecting the world. More forward-thinking teens that are interested in more &quot;sociable&quot; subjects may not like this particular book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am writing a review on the book, Maggie-Now, by Betty Smith. I have yet to read A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, but I am excited to do so. I could not stop thinking of the Moore family characters and how real they seemed. The values and the traditions of the day were so important then, I feel sad that there is a lack of tradition and heritage in America today. It grieves me so that I really do not know much about my family history and wonder if others feel as I do. This book made me laugh, cry and wonder. It truly deserves the time and effort to read. I looked at my own children differently and dreamed their dreams through their eyes. Wondering if that spunk of my middle child was the Irish in her, or thinking of my maiden name and wondering what my English ancestors were like and how they came to America, what did they do for work, were they poor like the Moores, having to take in laundry or sweep a street? So many questions I have now, because I picked this old book out of a closet, dusted off the cover and opened my mind to the past of all of us. The characters are believable, the vivid detail of the late 1800,s and early 1900,s was depicted effortlessly, and humor and pain will engulf you. The flavor of heritage and tradition flows throughout the book and takes you back to a time you may have never lived in, but one in which you are strangely familiar. The characters felt like family. Already I was lonely and missing them when I read the last page and had to close the book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's been two or three years since I've read this book, but what's prompting me to write a review on it, is that I've just read Joy in the Morning by Betty Smith and I could remember all to well, how much I loved her first book, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.I remember first hearing about the book and thinking, \\"Well, this probably wont be interesting to me since it's not like the books I read,\\" but I was wrong...after reading the first twenty pages, I was hooked!!

It is an amazing body of work, by Betty Smith. It was her first novel and was written in 1943. It is the story of a young girl growing up in Brooklyn, learning the tough lessons in life under the most difficult of circumstances. It is about living life and learning the lessons that are thrown in your path. One of the aspects of this book is that the characters hold themselves responsible for the choices they make, good and bad, and rarely do those that love them throw their mistakes in their face. It is about facing life in the worst situations with dignity and pride and trying to improve your situation through hardwork, education, determination and an ability to continue on and not give in, no matter what may come. It is about a time when self reliability, hard work and family were highly valued, as opposed to an entitlement mentality, by those families like the Nolan's. This is a classic American tale that will be appreciated by discerning readers."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I was assigned to read this book for school, and thought it would be dull, despite its good reviews. As it turns out, it really interested me about New York during the time of World War I, and it was really hard for me to put it down. I reccomend it to any one of any age."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn has a depth of themes and characterisation sufficient for composition of a thesis on the topic, cleverly hidden in the depiction of banal, every day happenings. In the relationships depicted, one gains a deep picture of every form of love, with no minimising of the joy, pain, sacrifice, or strength which each presents. Heroine Francie is an intriguing character - both a dreamer, who always is looking for the happy ending, and a creature of habit in the midst of an otherwise individualistic family. She is a curious lonely child who realises, always after the fact, that her isolation was entirely her own doing. One can practically feel Francie's conflicts, for example in that, where she knows she should think her mother is noble and her father &quot;no good,&quot; she so favours Papa (and the reader can certainly see why.) I shall admit that one prominent theme kept me wondering - and this perhaps was the author's intention. There is much excessive patriotism in this book, as if everything is best just by being American (particularly if one was born in the States rather than an immigrant.) Francie's mother, Katie, is the sort of &quot;noble&quot; poor woman who would be acceptable to those believing in the American dream - totally hard-working, and ultimately rewarded by a marriage to a wealthy politician. Yet it is all too clear that Katie, the tolerable poor lady who insists she'll kill herself and her children before she'll take a basket from the Catholic Charities, is often the very source of her children's sufferings. Her pride has a very dark side which her dedication to hard work does not lessen - she would let her children starve, or leave a pleasant home for a dismal one, entirely because she needs to be superior, not equal to, those of her own class and background. Without giving away the ending to new readers, I must add that it has its paradoxical elements. The supposedly immense good fortune of the conclusion concurrently makes it clear that these people will be isolated from people and places which they had loved and enjoyed. In fact, the single poor point in the book's development is the trite rags to riches theme. These are only a few of many examples of the sort of gritty realism, countered by warmth and humour, which make this book so fascinating. It is easy and engaging reading on one level, but enormousely insightful and complex. There is no stock &quot;good and evil&quot; or &quot;right and wrong,&quot; nor are situations resolved in any fashion neater than that of &quot;true life.&quot; It is true that there is no actual plot, but I believe that this is key. Betty Smith is giving us much truth about life and love, which never fits into a clean story line. Even the minor characters provide strong depictions of the beauty, weakness, and complexity of human nature."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's a slow read for me so far.

The next page was missing and was clearly printed that way, not torn out. I flipped through the next few pages and realized that pages were put together all mixed up, so I've had to flip around to keep reading. It's very annoying and confusing. The publisher is Harper Collins. They should be ashamed of themselves. This book is a classic. Get the book, just not this printing."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Engrossing and timeless, if you want to time travel for a few days into Brooklyn a hundred years ago, read this book. My only caveat is that, like most coming-of-age novels, the character goes through a period where she is struggling to decide what she believes about God. She decides that she doesn't believe, and the scene where she decides is compelling... In fact, it's as if the entire book, her entire life, leads up to the point where she decides that there really is no God, but \\"life\\" and \\"beauty\\" and \\"education\\" and \\"love\\" are all good enough for her. It's anti-climactic when you know that those things really AREN'T worth it. Those things disappoint. Those things fail. Those things vanish away... Too sad, really to know that there are plenty of people who also have come to that same conclusion in life, and the beautiful stories that could have been told end in darkness and as much hopelessness as they began.Sorry for completely ruining the novel for you. I enjoyed it while I was reading it. ;-)"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was one of my best reads of the year. I didn't want it to end.

I was practically untouched. What an unbelievable product for an amazing price. Thanks again.Eddie O"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Oh my what a trip into the past this was. I read this book several times as a child. In fact, I was about Francie's age when I first read it. My only memory was of a girl in a window and a tree. For some reason that image stayed with me more than the story.I can't say that the story came back to me as I read, it did not. This was good, in that it was like reading and discovering it all over again. No wonder I read it time after time. In so many ways my own life mirrored Francie's.Even to the picking up of trash ( bottles) along the roads ( alleys) and turning them in for money for treats.We, too were less than wealthy, but such is life. Better times came for us. As for Francie? Life is what you make it, don't you think? And Francie was a strong young girl, who grew into a strong and intelligent young woman. She came form a family of strong women, who knew how to keep family together and how to do whatever needed to be done. The poor can't afford much, and being squeamish is one of those things.I'd like to lift a glass to the Francie the woman, and the women around her who taught her how to be the best she could be. We can overcome a lot if we put our minds to it. This story was dated in some ways, but oh so current in others. After all these years there are still children who don't know where their next meal will come from, men who just don't have it in them to stand strong and do what is needed and women who make up the difference and stand with their shoulders against the door to keep out the wolf called hunger and keep in the warm called love.highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have wanted to read \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" for some time and I finally did so. This is a heartwarming story about a little 11 year old girl called Francie and her truly wonderful family. The book covers about 4 years (from age 11- 16) with quite a few flashbacks to Francie's earlier life. It is set in Brooklyn in the early 1900's (about 1915-1918) and the story is about living in Brooklyn at this time of the 20 century. Francie lives with her mother and father and her one year younger brother in a poor tenement in the Williamsburg neighbourhood of Brooklyn. The family is poor but they do manage to eke out a living for themselves with lots of hard work and sacrifice. Francie is an imaginative 11 year old who finds beauty in the simplest things. She loves her family while at the same time being quite aware of their failings. But these failings only make her and her family stronger and the bond between them tighter. Francie loves to read and to learn and she gains a maturity far beyond her years because of her insatiable quest for knowledge, her effective observation skills, and because of the hard life she lives. When I looked at Ms. Smith's bio it appears that she herself lived in Brooklyn as a young girl at the time of the setting of this book. I am sure that she has put a lot of herself into the story, and her love of Brooklyn comes through on every page. And she obviously loved her characters as her writing makes them appear to live and breathe on the pages. It is easy to see why this book is considered an American classic. The writing and the characterizations are very well done indeed. It is a wonderful story about a precocious little girl as she grows up in a big American city at the beginning of the 20 century. I will miss Francie and her brother Nealey very much now that I've finished the book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Ive always loved this book, so now I love having it conveniently on my iPad so I can take it anywhere with me"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I grew up loving this movie and was worried the book would deminish my fond memories of the movie.

The book was INCREDIBLY well written and detailed with out being verbose, repetative, or boring. This should be a required read in school for YA readers."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn the summer I turned 16. At the time, it was just a book I saw on a clearance rack at Barnes and Noble. I knew it was a classic and I just wanted to read it quick and cross it off on the book list I was building. I didn't know that when I began reading it that I would finish it in less than a week, and then go back and re-read passages.The book tells the story of Francie Nolan, a girl growing up in early 1900's Brooklyn. Francie's story weaves through themes of poverty, pride, family, and just the wonders, heartbreak, and humor of childhood and teen years. There's great dialogue and colorful characters to love and hate. It's amazing to be able to relate to a character, when the time gap between is about 100 years.This book is awesome, wondrous, beautiful... I just finished re-reading it again after years of not touching it, and I was reminded why it is one of my favorite books, it still resonates with me today.

The book is different from the movie in some of the character portrayals and chronology. The character portrayals are excellent because the poverty mentality is so real to life - some thrive, some overachieve, and some grow bitter. There is an alcoholic father. The reader gets to see him differently through the eyes of each character. Very well written. No sex or violence. No unpleasant graphic detail. For a real experience of the beauty of this story, read the book AND watch the movie. Can't say enough!!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is all about achieving the American dream through determination, imagination, and education. Life for the Nolans was very harsh in the sense that they didn't have much in the sense of money. The father, an alcoholic who at best brought occasional income was a charming lad who was very well loved by his family, up until the bitter end, when he died, leaving a posthumous child. The mother is a strong woman, steady, responsible, and caring. The heroine in this book, however, is Francie Nolan, who loves to write. In the end, she doesn't become a published writer, but she did keep her stories real, describing how life in poverty really is, and stands for herself when an ignorant teacher tells her that her writings are sad and ugly."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Loved this book the characters are like an extented family.

I had read the book many times when I was Francie's age, but had never seen the movie. Seeing the movie led me back to the book, which I had not read in twenty years.What a wonderful experience I had in meeting the Nolans all over again. There were parts of the book that had been tucked in my memory, i.e. the part where Francie decides to read all the books in the library in alphabetical order. Every time I go to the library, I have that same idea. I just had forgotten where I first got the idea. It was like a light bulb illuminating a dusty part of my brain.Katie Nolan has become an even more important part of the story to me now. I think this was helped by Dorothy McGuire's exquisite performance as practical Katie. Being a mother of two myself, I appreciate the way Smith captured the gradations of Katie's feeling towards each child and her inability to express them to the children themselves.Goota go; my copy of MAGGIE-NOW is calling to me."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"it's a touching story of a girl named francie who live in a pauperous family .

The main plot follows an Irish-Austrian-American girl as she grows up in a slum in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Subplots focus on her family members. There is a lot of nostalgic detail on life at the beginning of the twentieth century, and I imagine that this book would appeal to people who grew up at that time... but there are few such people alive. Other themes include the cruelty of people to one another, the rapaciousness of private enterprise, and female strength and resilience. This wasn't a bad book but there wasn't enough of a plot to keep my interest, and eventually it became a chore to read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN came with such rave reviews that i just had to read it and see what i was missing. i cannot say that i find myself any more enriched by this story. it is the early 1900's in brooklyn, NY and francie and her family are forever struggling to make ends meet. it is interesting to see what things the family had to endure and i stuck with it only because i was curious to see how francie's life would unfold. but the story was extremely slow paced and not one of my favorites."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Overall the book is a worthwhile read, especially if you are interested in beautifully presented American history. The main character, Francie, born at the beginning of the twentieth century, shares the story of her Brooklyn childhood in vivid and realistic detail. You can just tell, from reading this work, that the main character bore more than a hefty overlap with the author. The book is just too emotionally connected and detailed to be anything else. This is a book that is strongly, perhaps almost entirely, character driven -- and the sympathetic nature of the main character is what makes the book so endearing. I admit, I was sad when it ended. I would have kept on reading this fictional girl's life story -- probably to her death. I had a grandmother born less than ten years after Francie, and although I spent a lot of time with my grandmother over the 35 years I knew her, I feel I knew Francie better. To me, this speaks volumes about the author's gift.I did, however, have a few gripes. Allow me to list them.1) At times some of the characters or scenarios came across as cheesy. For instance, when Sissy (Francie's aunt) kept naming her new husbands John, regardless of their real names, it quickly got old, especially when the author reminded us of the renaming about ten times. Although this book detail may have been based on a real character, and probably was, to me it failed to translate well into the novel.2) There were some internal inconsistencies in the book, and that is a pet peeve of mine. For instance, on page 42 (first paragraph of chapter 5) the narrator tells about Sissy having given birth to ten children who all died shortly after birth. Then, on page 64-65 (a few pages into chapter 7), the narrator tells about Sissy's first child having been stillborn (as opposed to dying after birth), and the following three born dead as well. So which was it? Although you might consider me picky, a good editor wouldn't, and nor would a young mother who just lost her baby -- a stillbirth and a baby who lived an hour or two and then died are profoundly different things.3) Too much idealization of Francie's rotten parents. Yes, there was some criticism of them, but almost all of it, even from the author's perspective, was couched in a parent-protecting attitude. I personally felt enraged when Francie's mother put Francie to work and sent the younger brother to high school -- while she herself popped out another baby by her loser, alcoholic non-father of a husband, who, incidentally, had just died. I get tired of narrators or authors who side too much with awful parents.4) The author had a sort of proto-feminist attitude that too often (to tie it in with my last criticism) equated to siding with women who displayed awful or very disappointing behavior.And one final point, not exactly a criticism: I was surprised the book never mentioned that the hardy \\"tree of heaven,\\" upon which this book was based, and to which the main character was compared, actually has a horrible odor. If you crush one of its leaves in your hand you'll find this out quickly. The fact that this was never mentioned suggested to me that the author didn't know this tree as well as she might have let on. I used to love these trees for all the reasons the author did mention, until I actually smelled one. Hard to idealize them then.But all this said, overall still a powerful book -- brought to life an important time and place in such a special way."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book provided an authentic look at life in turn of the century New York city, among the working poor immigrant class. The descriptions of school, home, family life and relationships among the neighborhood were wonderful, rich and colorful. I highly recommend this book to anyone 12 years and older."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I liked the story about an poor, Irish family living in New York in the early part of this century.

Wow!A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (P.S.)If you like to reminisce read it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The Book A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, by Betty Smith is a very interesting and loveable story to read about a young girl who has to endure many hardships throughout her life. The story takes place in brooklyn, New York. It starts in the year 1912 and goes through many years till 1919 with the Nolan family. The family is a very fun and loveing even if they have money problems. I loved the book. Once I started reading it I fell in love with the little girl Francie and I just wanted to see what the family would do next. I though this book really captured what it was like for them. It helps you really imaging what was going on almost as if you were there. During the happy parts I felt all warm inside and was so happy foe the characters that I wanted to smile, and during the sad parts I felt like I was going to cry. During the scary parts my heart almost skipped a beat and during the funny parts I couldn't help but let out a laugh. This story really let me connect with the charters and though me how to really enjoy life more. I believe that everyone should read this book. Reading the book was an experience that I knbow everyone would enjoy. The book though me that you don't need all the martial things to make you happy all you need is the people that you love, and the people who love you."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book twice in my early teens. I'm 41 now and decided to re-read it when a friend told me she was doing the same. What a treat! It is just as absorbing for me today as it was nearly thirty years ago. In this latest reading I picked up on more of the adult themes of the novel and could more appreciate Smith's writing style. Francie is among the most fully drawn characters of any book I've read. Smith's attention to detail is exquisite as is her ability to convey the conflicts and longings inside so many of the characters. I was also struck by how many of the passages depicted food--which makes sense, since when there isn't enough of it, it is bound to be a focal point. The ending is so touching that I wept, just as I had as a young girl. This is a wonderful story with universal and timeless themes of loneliness, love, poverty and hope."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was just my summer reading book. I picked up the 483-page book and dreaded to begin reading it. In one afternoon i had read 203 pages after being completely captivated by Smith's marvelous story. She presents a life in which every single penny is looked upon as a huge amount of money. I have walked past pennies and haven't bother to pick them up thinking \\"its just a penny who cares\\". Smith creates the setting with a poor district in Brooklyn where a dollar is worth so much. We nowadays spend that much on a King Size Hershey's. I have a fresh outlook on life and on money and its value. Also, on how the Nolan family with so little find joys in the darkest of corners. Truly an amazing story. Highly reccommended."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Some books that are hailed as \\"classics\\" are very much a product of their own time and seem confounding and dated to modern readers. Betty Smith's 1940 novel A Tree Grows in Brooklyn isn't one of those books.. It touches on timeless topics like family ties, loss, and poverty, making it accessible to a large number of readers. It also helps that the characters are endearing, and above all, honest. Everyone has their flaws, and some are even self-destructive, but none are unlikable. None of the characters are sugarcoated in the least, and feel like real people with very real problems.The story of this novel revolves around the Nolan family, and in particular Francie. The family includes a mother, Katie; a father, Johnny; and a son, Neeley, in addition to Francie. As the title indicates, they live in Brooklyn, in a typical immigrant tenement building. The Nolan family is staggeringly poor, along with all the other families that live around them. Their poverty is evident in the first few pages when Francie and Neeley go around collecting junk with all of the other neighborhood children for a few cents. Even this meager amount of money is split in half so that part of it can be placed in a bank on a closet door in the apartment in Katie's hopes that someday the money can be used to buy a little land. Katie is a janitor in the apartment buildings and is still pretty despite the toll of years of hard work. Johnny Nolan is an alcoholic, but is still charming and loving to his family despite this. His small pay as a singing waiter, alas, is not enough to feed his family. The book starts out when Francie is a preteen and gets to where she is in her late teens. In that time, the family has to deal with hard times, has had some small triumphs, and Johnny's alcoholism is a fact that can no longer be denied. The children all lose their innocence pretty quickly as living in poverty is a fact of life that has to be dealt with, as they find out.I guess you could say that A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is largely plotless and doesn't follow the conventions of any type of genre literature, and you would basically be right, but a lot does happen in the book. Basically, the plot of the book is life itself, with no convenient twists or last-minute saves. What happens, happens--and none of the characters can change that fact. That makes the book seem too bleak, though; while it is never explicitly \\"happy\\" (how can you ever be truly happy when you sometimes don't even have enough food?) it never loses that glowing feeling of hope. Enormous sympathy goes to the main characters, who seem like hard-working, honest, good people who seem to deserve more in life than what they've got. Even Johnny's alcoholism is easy to understand, though of course not condoned. When he begins to spin further into the abyss of self-destruction, you don't think \\"well, that's what happens\\" or \\"Good riddance\\" but rather sadness for him, and for his family, because he is so likable. This feeling of hope does occasionally dim because of various things that happen, but you never stop hoping for the best.Betty Smith's writing style is thoughtful, and meditative, and occasionally even witty. She also has a commanding use of metaphors that is impressive. Her no-frills, butstill expressive, writing carries the reader through the nearly 500 pages with ease, and while the story naturally lags occasionally, it is never \\"boring,\\" just slow sometimes. She also stops from the main story into flashbacks that recall how Katie and Johnny have previously spent their lives, and she also fully fleshes out the many fascinating supporting characters, who get their own back stories. The most interest supporting character is Katie's sister Sissy, who is regarded as some kind of cheap floozy who sleeps around who is hopelessly in love with children despite the fact that she has miscarried over ten children. Her story is heartbreaking, but ultimately bittersweet by the end. Francie is always the anchor of the novel, though. Sometimes headstrong, sometimes weak-willed, she experiences a lot of life for her young years by the end of the book.I would recommend A Tree Grows in Brooklyn to anyone looking for a good coming-of-age story that is always interesting to read with fully developed characters."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book thirty years ago and have since read it many times over. It is a rare classic that will stay in your heart long after the pages have been read. You will become deeply and emotionally attached to Francie Nolan, a young girl who overcomes many obstacles and challenges beyond her control in order to survive. Taking place in the slums of Brooklyn, Francie is part of a family who dotes on her brother. Her parents are not without their own set of problems, and Francie is faced with growing up in a world that is not kind to her. She understands only too well the meaning of hunger, doing without, leaving school and not having enough money to go around.&quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; takes place in the early part of the century and was written over fifty years ago. With this in mind, it may be difficult for today's generation, particularly if financial stability was never a problem, to fully understand and appreciate Francie's life. Unless, of course, the reader also experienced poverty - &quot;no money&quot; means no money, no matter what year you are living in. You will marvel at Francie's determination, strength and courage, smile at her resourcefulness, and feel compassion for a girl who, by necessity, is far more mature than her years.One other excellent book by the same author that I also treasure among my collection is &quot;Joy in the Morning.&quot; It is written with the same grace, style and emotion as this one. Both classics are highly recommended and would make a cherished part of your library."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This story is basically about the struggle to overcome adversity.It chronicles the childhood of Francie Nolan, a very wise girl, mature past her years, who grows up in the mean slums of turn-of-the-century Brooklyn, New York.In spite of quite a terrible childhood, filled with indignities, unfairness, and pain, Francie is determined to succeed, so that she may rise up above her surroundings. Although she must leave school before getting to high school, to work in a factory, she fights her way back to an education, eventually making it to college and out of Brooklyn.Francie's fight out of the slums is truly inspiring--like the &quot;Tree of Heaven&quot; that grows out the broken cement of the sidewalk, she fights through setbacks and never gives up. What I found to be especially wonderful was the fact that Betty Smith made no character all good or all bad. This enables the reader to feel what the character is feeling, and understand their motive in doing what they do. Thus the story is felt and experienced on many different levels and in many different ways.I really love this book and I would recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Author Betty Smith was a one hit wonder. Although she wrote other novels, her work after &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; never came close to capturing the characterizations and sense of time and place exhibited in this fine, even extraordinary, piece of writing that was released in 1943.But so what? Who needs an encore when the first performance has readers standing in the aisles? &quot;A Tree Grows In Brooklyn&quot; is as readable today as it was fifty years ago. It has stood the test of time to become one of America's most beloved and enduring novels.The story evolved from Ms. Smith's experiences growing up in Brooklyn in the very early 1900s. Although it is a novel, it's obvious that the core experiences are autobiographical. The main character in the book, Francie Nolan, is Betty Smith.The book carries us through a little more than ten years of life with the poor but proud Nolan family. The Nolans face numerous hardships - the heartbreak of losing a warm-hearted but alcoholic father, the attempted rape of Francie, the shame of being poor - but they are held together by the steely determination of Francie's mother, Katie.There are unique characters, perhaps the most unforgettable is the promiscuous and colorful Aunt Sissy who worked in a condom factory, had the habit of marrying time and time again without getting a divorce, and had ten babies stillborn, until a fake pregnancy brings her first healthy child (how? I won't give that away.)But the book's strongest point is its ability to capture a place and a time: Brooklyn in turn-of-the-century America. Not since Charles Dickens has a writer so skillfully described an era and a physical setting. Betty Smith harpooned with a pen the details and nuances that made Brooklyn the true melting pot of America, a rugged and confused place that bore more genius than anywhere else in the world. Ms. Smith is gone. Her tree is still growing."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I was thirteen I read this book and loved it. I was Francie in my mind. We lived not far from Brooklyn and while not as poor, shared many of the same problems. The book has always been a fond memory for me. This month it was chosen as a group read for my reading group. Although I rarely re read, I decided to see if the book was as good as my memory said it was. To my delight it was still as wonderful as I remembered. Only this time I had a bit more sympathy for the mother Katie, then I did the first time. Seeing the book through the eyes of a mother, I admired more of the qualities I saw as harsh those many years ago. Betty Smith writes with such detail, that one can see the streets of Williamsburg as seen through Francie's eyes. The Nolan's are a family that literally lives the American dream. They start the book in dire poverty, yet each generation accomplishing more than the one before. And they have the most important gift of all, the love and support of family. Today this would no doubt be labeled a dysfunctional family, with an alcoholic father, a mother leaving her children unattended, an aunt who is a little too free with her favors. Yet we love the Nolans, and root for them through thick and thin. Francie Nolan loved reading and the library above all else. I am now the grown up Francie, still trying to read every book in the library. I am glad I took the time to re read this one. Francie Nolan will be a part of me forever."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's no wonder that this book is truly loved by practically everyone who reads it: it's a story of growing up and innocence, life and love, caring and the way things go. You might not have a lot of money, but you can do one thing that's free, and that's to love. Francie Nolan is inside of all of us, the eleven year old girl who has her life set out for her: flowers in a brown bowl, read a book every day in alphabetical order until you reach the Z's, have a lot of children. She wants to win everything on a board that she spends a bit at every Saturday; right down to the skates and the doll with real hair: she yearns for what she may never get. Her family is poor and lives in the tenements of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She and her brother Neeley do not know to be ashamed of their father and Francie has scant knowledge that her father has a bad reputation. Her mother works hard and her aunt &quot;gets around&quot;, as the writer calls it. She may be poor, but she has a loving family. She wants to be an author when she grows up and pay attention to children; she is upset with the librarian at the Brooklyn library who does not even look up at the poor little girl who comes in every day to check out a book that is good for an eleven year old. Francie is pleased when a book she loves is chosen; she symbolizes an everyday, American girl. We grow up with Francie; book one chronicles the life of an eleven year old girl that is so everyday, repetitive, that it shows everything is all right. The customs and the traditions prove that Francie's life has a rhythm to it, nothing bad happens. Book two chronicles life early on, as her parents meet and have their children and Francie grows older as things happen. And book three proves that you must grow up, as Francie enters college and begins a new life that only the reader can imagine what happens next. So read this book. Just read it, and you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have always wanted to read this book, and when I went into my ninth grade honors English class this year and saw it on the reading list, I couldn't wait to start it. I never had read it before because it had always seemed too long. How wrong I was! I couldn't put the book down, and when I finished, I yearned to know more about Francie. The story is very believable, as I am sure that Ms. Smith experienced some of the same hardships that Francie underwent. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an excellent book to read for school, and it is probably on most reading lists. The theme is very prevalent throughout the novel, and there are good examples of figurative language, and other aspects that are discussed in the classroom. I think that in order to truly understand the book, the reader must be at least eleven years old. However, I do feel that this can be enjoyed by a younger child, even if the exact meaning is not understood. Francie sets a good example for everyone in her ability to overcome obstacles and reach her goals. This is a timeless classic that I'm sure will be enjoyed for years to come!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book almost 40 years ago when I found it in my parent's bookcase. I was in grammar school at the time and my mother thought I wasn't old enough to read it so she hid it from me. It didn't take me very long to discover her hiding place and I read as much as I could each Saturday when she went to do her shopping. Even as I child, I was moved by the story of Francie's coming of age in a city and economic situation that were completely foreign to mine. Betty Smith's writing transported me into Francie's life. I loved the book then and still have the copy that belonged to my mother. Over the years, I have forgotten the details of the story, but have remembered the feelings that the book inspired in me and how I felt connected in some way to Francie. I have just recently come across my old worn copy and am currently reading it again. The feelings still ring true, but to read it now as an adult, I am finding a depth to the novel that I missed reading it as a child. I thoroughly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"i just finished reading &quot;A tree grows in brooklyn&quot; as part of a class project. I've got to admit, that I chose the book because of it's high point value. I had the book for 1 month, and just read it casually until i really got into it. The last 300 hundread pages were magical! I didn't want to put the book down! There seemed to be a new surprise every time i turned the pages. There was just so much to learn about Francie and her family. The book at me crying towards the end, even though it wasn't sad. It was one of those books you just want to go on forever and never end. I think this book ranks alongside my favorite book of all time &quot;Circle of Friends&quot;. This book is one for people who enjoy reading about family life, and getting very much invovled with the charecters and caring what happens to them in the following chapters. I admit, there were some points in the book in which i was screaming at the mother &quot;Don't do that to Francie! &quot; i would yell in my head. I think that is what makes this book so good-you become Francie and become very much a part of her world. I read 400 pages of the book in 2 days. I never put it down-it was that good.

I actually had to ration that book, so that I would not finish it in a day. I would read 50 pages a day and forcibly keep the rest. Its a beautiful tale of the girl coming of age and with harsh terms of life.Its nothing short of a classic.My wife has actually BOUGHT a copy to keep.5 stars!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"There is a Bugs Bunny cartoon that has the rabbit running afoul of some dogs in the New York City. Trapped in an alley, Bugs grabs a book that is nearby for some meager protection; the dogs see the title, perk up joyously and run away. The name of the book: A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. I have to wonder if more people have watched the cartoon than read the book that provided its punch line. Up until recently, I was only in that former group, but not anymore.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is Betty Smith's semi-autobiographical novel of life in a poor family in the early 1900s. As the story opens, it is 1912 and Francie Nolan - the protagonist - is eleven years old. She lives in a small apartment with her father, mother and brother. Her father Johnny is an amiable enough fellow who nonetheless has sunk into alcoholism. Rarely employed - and becoming less employable - he is unable to be the family breadwinner. Katie, his wife, married him more out of lust than love and now is suffering the consequences: although still young and beautiful, she is suffering from the burden of holding the family together. Neely, Francie's younger-by-a-year brother, still clings to childhood.This is the story of Francie's life, and like any life story, it is not driven by plot as much as character. We see Francie's development from child to young adulthood, while coping with the many problems (and occasional joys) that accompany an impoverished life. Attending bad schools, going to church, working to support the family at meager wages, even contending with a psychopath: these are some of the events that occur in Francie's life.This is an excellent book, well worth the \\"classic\\" designation often given to it. Smith's strengths are with her strong characters and wonderful writing. Francie, of course, is the centerpiece; a girl who is gifted but may not be able to exploit those gifts in her poor environment. Yes, there are sad moments in this book, but it is not really downbeat; one can imagine an adult Francie looking back at many of these events with a bit of wistfulness.Compared to other \\"great\\" novels of yesteryear - such as Gone With the Wind, To Kill a Mockingbird or the Grapes of Wrath, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn seems to not get the same attention anymore. It is, however, a book that is a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"As a middle-aged man in the 21st century, I did not expect much from a story -- even a famous one -- about a young girl set in Brooklyn 100 years ago. The only reason I considered reading it was a comment from a reviewer here on Amazon, a young lady who seemed to have excellent literary taste and who cited it as her favorite novel.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a force of nature. Author Betty Smith, like Theodore Dreiser, formed piercing views of social conditions and expressed them through literature. Her arch gaze falls on an elementary school teacher here, a Tammany Hall politician there, small neighborhood merchants everywhere, and reveals an iron judgment that convinces as it informs. The weirdest aspect is that much of what she decries still pertains today.The main theme is the novel's paean to the benefits of learning. The story line is filled with interest; this book is simply unforgettable. Francie Nolan and her immediate family will remain in the reader's head long after this volume is returned to the shelf."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It is the first book that I read that really made an impression on me, and I was only 13 years old the first time I read it (That was over 40 years ago!). I did not even realize how strong an impression it made until years later, as I began to grow and mature as a person. I recently (1 year ago) sought out and bought a new copy for my two teenage daughters to read.I identified with Francie's plight, growing up in a 'poor', but rural, area, and becoming 'aware of life' at 13, when I first read the book.Betty Smith's portrayal of a 'survivor' of a disfunctional life and time is 'universal' and timeless. Her poignant reflections of a young girl struggling and learning 'against the odds' are heartfelt and enduring.(I believe she was a strong influence in my love of writing and story-telling)"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's not every book that will grab you from the opening paragraph and draw you into the characters lives the way this one does. 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn' was a fascinating novel describing the life and times of a young girl growing up in the early nineteen hundreds, but the experiences are not dated - they are repeated with every generation of young women, and the writer does a wonderful job depicting the inner turmoil. I loved the way the author described things, I loved how it was a book about life that I could relate to, but the thing I loved the most was that when I finished it, I wanted more.'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn' was an amazing story that follows Francie Nolan throughout her early life in Brooklyn. It touches on the many trials and tribulations a child growing up in the slums of Brooklyn had to face in the early nineteen hundreds. The entire novel was split into five books and each represented a different point in time. The novel didn't have a single conflict, but instead it had problems overlapping problems throughout the story to show the reality of growth and development. The main goal in the novel though, was the maturation of a single child from their own perspective. It simply cuts right to the heart of life. The so-called solutions to the problems most of the time turn into larger problems and seldom solve anything in the novel, but that goes to show how honest and true this novel really is.The main character is Francie, a shy timid girl the reader can see changing and blossoming through the course of the novel, but the cast for this play has many actors. It takes many people to influence one's life. Francie's mother Katie Rommely-Nolan, played a huge role in this story, as she should because a mother's role is important to life. Francie's father Johnny Nolan also played a huge part in her life. He was an alcoholic singing waiter who was never around very much but influenced Francie's idea of life, death, and the value of everything. I noticed throughout the book that Francie compared everything to her father which showed his unbelievable importance even without a constant physical presence. Neely Nolan was crucial to this story; he was not only Francie's brother but also her best and only friend. Francie was also very influenced by her Aunt Evy who was a stern woman in many ways but you could tell that she enjoyed life, her Aunt Sissy who in the beginning of the story is a wild, crazy type and then settles as the story continues. Both of these women have husbands and children, but they don't play as much of an important role in Francie's life as the aunts themselves. There's also Francie's grandmother Mary Rommely, who indirectly plays a very important role in Francie's life because she taught Katie the grounds for raising her children. Other vital characters include Francie's bosses, teachers, schoolmates, significant others and random people she met on everyday travels throughout the city.This novel taught me that things are not always what they seem and that hardly anything goes exactly according to plan, and that you shouldn't take anything for granted. It mainly taught me however, to live life to it's fullest everyday so that I may get everything that I can out of it.If you have lived and you can read, you'll enjoy this novel. If you can't read, get it as a book-on-tape collection and you will love it too. Everyone could take this novel to heart because it's a novel about each one of us in the world, one that no matter whether you're a bum that lives in a cardboard box in the alleyway, or the king of England you can empathize with the author's growing pains, and that's the most important part. How can anyone deny reading a story about themselves? Some people are partial to science fiction, some people love editorials, all people would love this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is about a poor girl named Francie Nolan growing up in Brooklyn in the early 1900s. Francie lives with her brother Neeley, (who is a year younger), her mama, her papa, and at the end her baby sister. The story tells about the hard lives of the Nolans. After Francie had graduated from grade school, she had to start working while her brother Neeley continued on with his education and went to high school. I would recommend the book to anyone who likes to read books about growing up. I liked this book because it was very descriptive. It didn't focus on just one character, it told a lot about all of the characters. I also liked that it showed a very nice relationship between family members."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time! Although it seems a challenge to read since it has 500 pages, there wasn't a single page where I was bored. Betty Smith focuses on Francie's struggles and thoughts about life, her family, and the world surrounding her. Tragedy and tough choices plauge Francie all throughout the course of the story. Her lovable but unreliable father, loving, realistic mother, and favored, companionable brother add conversation and relationship to the book. This book is a moving tale of one little girl who tries to understand the world around her and teaches the reader about love, sacrifice, and hope in the process."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the coming of age story of Francie Nolan, an Irish-American girl growing up in the early 1900s. This book gives the reader a look into the daily lives and struggles of Francie's traditional, if not sterotypical, early Irish-American family. Poverty, alcoholism, and struggling to survive in a harsh urban environment are major themes in this book. Betty Smith's well-structured and detailed narrative helps the reader to experience the day-to-day hardships, emotions, and triumphs of the Nolan family, and is peppered with interesting details about life in early 20th century Brooklyn. Although the Nolans are poor and struggling, their intelligence and humanity never fails to shine through."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, by Betty Smith, is one of America's timeless classics. The story of young Francie Nolan will touch your heart and forever change your view of life. A young girl growing up in the Brooklyn of the early 20th century, Francie had to face the many hardships of poverty as well as just growing up. Some of Francie's experiences are funny, and others almost brought me to tears. This book isn't famous for the phenomanal writing style of Betty Smith, because the book is written plainly and simply. Smith doesn't mince words getting to her points, but shows the life of Francie plainly and bluntly. From selling junk to earn a few extra cents, to an interesting fishing trip, Francie's life is just so different. This probably ranks number 2 on my list of all-time favorite books, right behind The View From Saturday. You haven't lived life completely until you have read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. I would reccomend it to all girls over twelve or thirteen, because some of Francie's experiences are a bit inappropriate for some younger readers. A must-read!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I never read this book as a child (I missed out). I'll tell you right now that it is NEVER too late to read this book. It's a 'slice of life'. It's real-life with real lives that render characters that shine. It reminds us of the struggles we all go through in life. It's a beautiful story that revolves around the life of Francie and her family. It's no wonder that so many have told me how wonderful this book is to read. I underlined scores of lines that made me want to go back to re-read them...to be reminded of how to live my life or how to advise other people. This book would make a special gift for any one."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Francie taught me about America, immigration, poverty, and how hard it is to be an intelligent woman.My mom let me check this book out from the public library in 1976 -- I was 8 years old. I've read it countless times over the yaars, and it shaped my career choice... I'm a History Professor, and yes, I assign this book!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I love reading memoirs and I love reading about different time periods. Though this is classified as fiction, it is about the author's life growing up in Brooklyn in the early 1900's. This book spoke to me and gave me a deeper appreciation for what I have."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Re-reading this book was a wonderful decision. I read it when I was ten or eleven and enjoyed it, reading it as a mature woman, with life experince under my belt the book was the same and yet so different. I know I enjoyed it more this time but although it is the same book my prospective is so different, it was like a new book. It is no wonder that this book is still so read, it is still real and insightful into family interactions and personal observations by the all of charactersI recommend it highly"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a darn charming book with characters who are likable without being too swarmy, and I love the way they are presented, and the way the story is told. It's a long book, but you want the children to grow and mature, and I think Smith handled this part so well, so almost forgotten is Francie Nolen being eleven years old. At the beginning, Francie hauls junk, letting her brother split the money because he is a boy. They are poor. They live in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Their mother, Katie, works as a cleaning lady. Johnny was her best friend's boyfriend, and Katie coveted him, and they fell in love. Katie's brutish father was angry, feeling cheated that his daughter could not provide for him, and Johnny's mother was angry at Katie. They married, cleaned a school, then lost the job because Katie gave birth to Francie and a year later, there was Cornelius - Neeley. Katie loves her son more, and is afraid of how much she loves her son. Katie works as a cleaning person, hoodwinking piano lessons from the sisters downstairs - bringing the children so its three lessons for the price of one, and she is confronted, but Miss Tynmore likes her because Katie provides her good tea, whereas the piano teacher was only served watery junk from other customers. Katie is hardworking, smart, kind, and she loves her children - instructing them how to buy the meat, to have the butcher chop a fresh cut and then w/ an onion to prevent dilution of the meat, who to buy bread from and such. Johnny is a singing waiter, working less consistently, and the rule is that Johnny must bring home his salary, but he can keep his tips. Johnny is blond and handsome with a beautiful voice, but he is a drunkard, spending his time at a bar. He is kind, loving his daughter, calling her Prima Donna, never violent, more fun when drunk. His mother is sour, he is amongst four sons, and all the sons die before thirty-five. Johnny loves Katie. Katie has two sisters - older sister Sissy is good-hearted, loves children, has boyfriends, but cannot have children - she has more than ten stillborn children, and she blames husbands who love her, and she has a fondness for the name John. Later, she falls in love w/ her John, whose real name is Steve, and a baby boy is born. Younger sister is Evie, who marries a milk delivery man, William Flittman, who has an acrimonious relationship w/ his horse, who loves Evie, and eventually William goes away. There are more adventures, but the charm is not just with the adventures, but with the patient detailed writing. It was heart-warming to read this book. I loved everything about this book except the last twenty pages or so, when Francie becomes an adult and has that terrible misunderstanding with a boy. It was confusing to the reader, and I don't know quite what happened. The writing is so pure, almost every page is credible, and I could see all the events happening to a real family. This book has been accused of having no plot, but I think this is a book of adventures with many plots. It was so beautiful and extremely easy to read. No guilt in revealing some of the adventures, because the beauty is in the characters and the writing. A very, very charming read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was written many years ago and still pulls you in to keep reading--very heartwarming and thought provoking. It was recommended by a book club who has just completed it. Great Book-5 stars."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book popped up on some kind of must-read list recently, which I thought was a little odd. All I knew about this book was there was a movie version, which I vaguely remembered seeing part of on TV as a child. I got the book from the library and was immediately entranced. This story of a bright, sensitive child growing up poor in Brooklyn in the early 1900s is also a story about family, the strength of women and the value of love, hard work and education.This book is so honest about the weaknesses and flaws of its characters as well as their good points. In addition to the story, which draws you along to see what happens next, you learn what it was like to grow up in this hardscrabble environment and in this time. But it's not like a boring history lesson, but a fascinating feeling of being \\"in it\\" and exactly what it was like to live on pennies a day. I was worried it would be sentimental, but it's just the opposite.From reading the material that came with my copy, apparently this book started out as autobiography and the author was persuaded to fictionalize it. Perhaps this is why it is so heartfelt. It was also marketed as for adults, but it could be read by 14 and up in my opinion (there is some adult subject matter, but it's only dealt with on the level of a child's understanding.)This is one of those books where you're gulping it down while at the same time wishing it would never end. There are so many parts I related to as a wife, mother and daughter--it's timeless, while being very \\"of a time.\\"Perhaps the best compliment I can give is that this book made as huge an impact on me as Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House books. I can't believe I never read it before, and if you haven't, you need to!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn By Betty SmithFrancine and her brother Nealy are raised in the Brooklyn area and as they are growing up they do things for the family.

Picante is handed the book by a fellow soldier who is asked, is it full of blood and guts and gets the answer, it's not that kind of book. Rather it is about a smart young girl growing up in a tough tenement neighbourhood of Brooklyn who at one point assumes a fake home address so she can get into a better school. Reputed to be autobiographical the book is told matter-of-factually without pathos or appeals for sympathy. If it isn't on every high school reading list already it should be."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was a great book. I must admit that some parts of the book, some of the chain of events seemed unrealistic and this frustrated me a little bit but it did not keep me from wanting to read more. I was ready to give the three and a half stars until I reached the end, where I was hit with sorrow that the book was coming to an end and the characters had grown on me. The ending had a huge effect on me and was symbolic in that life goes on but you will never forget the hardships and the happiness that made you who you are. From the beginning of the book, I felt attached to the serene 1900s Brooklyn setting of the book and I can only imagine the blend of hardship and morsels of happiness that those times brought to a child and his/her family. I was very sad to say goodbye to the characters in the book and goodbye to life in early 1900s Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is one of my favorite books of all time. It touched my heart in the same way that Angela's Ashes did. To immerse yourself in the childhood tribulations and joys of a time when life was positively brutal in many ways...it makes you appreciate the society we now live in, flaws and all. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Every year I think about rereading books I loved when I was younger. Every year or two I'll reread \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" or I'll take another read of \\"Camille\\". It's like getting back together with a old friend and I always feel better after.Now these two books I've read rather consistently since I first fell in love with them but others I loved in High School and earlier I haven't read in years and in some cases decades. An example of that is \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\". I don't think I've read it in 20 years or more. This month my book club decided to \\"A Tree\\" and I realized I haven't read it forever. But I began to get nervous that I wouldn't love it the way I did when I first read it.Well, I didn't have to worry. It was everything I remembered it being. Francie Nolan and her family live in turn of the century Brooklyn. Poverty and cruelty is everywhere yet the Nolan family they're family and neighbors work hard to simply live, an accomplishment in itself. Francie's father Johnny is a lovable entertaining man who drinks to much and finds it hard to grow up and take care of his family the way he should. The job of providing for the family falls to Katie Nolan, Francie's mother. Katie works hard to earn money and take care of her family and also pushes each of her children to get an education, knowing it's the only way they will ever escape life in the tenements of Brooklyn.A vivid picture of a time and place that doesn't exist anymore \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is, at heart, the story of how one little girl, with the help of those who love her, survives with hope and a remarkable resilience that makes you root for her to become everything she hopes to be.I loved this book so much. The old chestnut of \\"I Laughed, I cried\\" really does fit this book. I think one of the things that struck me most is how fast children had to grow up in those conditions. We talk today about how fast our kids grow up but it seems nothing in comparison to that way children had to fight to survive in this time period. Children went to work to support their family and while I'm sure it still exists I wonder if it is prevalent. Just with the child labor laws it must be different.The hope that flows through this story is what really touched me. I truly believe Francie would be one who made it out but unlike others shown in the story who made it out and turned their backs on their life in Brooklyn you're left knowing Francie would never forget or hate her past life. Thanks to the love and support of all her family Francie would never really leave Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book last month....should have read it while an adolescent.Setting is pre-Depression era about the struggles of the American 'family', some born in country, others immigrants or first generation. You gain a tremdous appreciation for what we have now, AND on so many levels.

Both books paint a vivid picture of the lives of Irish immigrants in NYC at the beginning of the 20th Century. I am of Irish descent and had not realized the extreme poverty, exploitation and discrimination the Irish people experienced after coming to America. I was very touched by the audio book -- so much so that within a couple of months I checked this book out at the library to experience the book again and to read Betty's other book \\"Maggie Now.\\" Both made me sad, but also proud of the characters as they pridefully fought through sometimes overwhelming circumstances."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

I had heard of this book before, but when I started reading it, I was completely lost into it and could not stop reading it. It is rich and full of detail, and I can easily say that this book is one of the best that I have ever read. It's not hard to see why this book is such a classic. It's about ordinary people in ordinary situations - but is so well-written and the characters given such life and personality that it's easy to envision them in your head as you read this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"i missed this book in high school. twenty years later, i am so glad to discover this book. although it may be geared to young adults, everyone can relate to this family and francie, the young heroine. don't let this book get by you!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I ordered this book as it was my book club selection, very sure I would not find it terribly interesting.

I own hardback and paperback copies of it. The book was published in 1943 and I first read it a few years later, probably when I was 12 or 13. I became so engrossed in the story I once sat on our very small porch rooftop to be like Francie, who read on a fire escape she could reach from her apartment window. The story of young Francie, a voracious reader, who lives in Brooklyn with her poor family - an alcoholic father, an always-exahusted hard-working mother - is one of the best books any woman, young or old, can ever read. When I discovered it was available now on Kindle, of course I bought it. I'm now 76 and can't wait to share Francie's life once more.This is not a child's book. It is about a child who makes her way in a difficult world and neighborhood, with help from unlikely caring people along the way.Thank you to Betty Smith, the author, and to Kindle for making it easily available to thousands of us.Janice Kirkland, Salem, Oregon"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was such a good book.

I highly recommend this classic."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Hi Jayne,I recently reread \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" and as I closed the back flap of the well worn cover, I wondered why I hadn't sooner. This book is at the top of my Book List of Favorites and is perhaps one of the greatest books ever written.I don't want to spoil even one page of this miraculous novel for the new reader, so I won't divulge any particulars. (I find the less I know about a book, the more charming and surprising it's potential is.) I will say it is a young adult novel about a girl and her family in the poorest of New York neighborhoods around the turn of the 20th century. Mrs. Smith parlays feelings of innocence, yearning, grief, love, loss, hope, beauty, joy, childhood, family dynamics and how it feels to live in poverty so deftly, one can never forget this book.In our current \\"recession culture\\" this book is more timely than ever. Families are being ripped apart and children are growing up faster than before due to economic strains. While this book is set almost one hundred years ago, and some of the situations seem slightly archaic, the feelings are all still the same. The ability to protect a child and provide them with a happy and safe childhood is every parent's aspiration and the inability to do so is devastating. But as with any good book, it shows the the dark and light sides of any situation. Simply put, what doesn't kill us, only makes us stronger.Read this book as soon as you can. It is the bitterest of sweet and sends the message that hope, as symbolized in the tree, sprouts eternal."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I loved this book...I bought this in Oregon at Powell's Books a few years ago on sale and I thought the writing was fantastic as well as the reader (Kate Burton). She was able to do so many accents for various characters and they sounded so good! This is how much I was a fan...when I first bought it, CD #11 didn't work...there are only 12 CDs so I was so frustrated. I really wanted to finish this with the reader I had started with! I call Powell's and they sent me a new set...and of course CD 11 didn't work. I ordered it off Amazon, and CD 11 didn't work. Finally, I called the publisher and begged and pleaded not just for a replacement but for someone to ensure that CD 11 worked before it came. They sent it for free and FINALLY FINALLY CD 11 worked and it was worth it. So yes, now I have 4 copies of this audio book which is a bit crazy, but hey, it was a great book!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"How have I never read this book before? Why didn't my high school force me to read it, as they did other novels that so impacted my life, like Brave New World, Lord of the Flies, or The Great Gatsby? I wish that someone had made me read this book long ago, but I'm also excited to have discovered the beauty of Smith's book on my own, as an adult, when I could appreciate it for its own merits and not because I was supposed to.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn has been on my \`to read' list for the last year or so, and I have to admit I was kind of dreading reading it. Sometimes \\"classics\\" do that to me. I finally picked it up on audio, considering that to be a compromise - I could listen to it in my car driving to and from work without devoting my full reading time and attention to the novel.From the very first words that narrator Barbara Rosenblat spoke, I was completely hooked. Smith's story follows the life of Francie Nolan, a little girl growing up in Brooklyn during the early part of the 20th century. Though mainly a coming-of-age novel, the book winds its way throughout decades backwards and forwards, and into the lives of Francie's parents and extended family.Although Francie grew up poor in Brooklyn, concerned with the entry of the U.S. into the first World War, her father's alcoholism and where her next meal would come from, she is a character that can still be related to today. I thoroughly enjoyed this classic, and would whole-heartedly recommend the audio version."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was a wonderful classic.

I think my Wife bought it for our Grand Daughter because she and our Daughter both loved it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an amazing novel, a kind of New York To Kill a Mockingbird. Beginning in 1912 but then flashing back to the early 1900s, it is the story of Francie Nolan, the daughter in a poor family. Her mother, Kate, is determined to get the best for her son, Neely, who is a year younger than Francie. Their father, Johnny, is handsome and funny and flamboyant, and also drinks way too much. And Francie loves to go the library. She's working her way through the books, from A to Z. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the story of the Rommely and the Nolan families' lives, centering on Francie. The title comes from a tree that grows in the yard.It's hard to pin-point what's so great about this novel. I read it 2 years ago, and loved it. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is less compelling than To Kill a Mockingbird, less deep, I guess you would say, but it's still a classic in its own right, and written much earlier. And it is pretty deep, whatever that actually means.Betty Smith brings to life the squalor and poverty of Brooklyn, New York, with her elegant prose. She creates wonderful, memorable characters and scenes. I loved reading about the various things that Francie and Neely did to earn a bit of candy money (though obviously, it was kind of sad), and reading about the various eccentricities of everyone in the neighborhood. You can certainly tell that Betty Smith was knowledgeable about Brooklyn; I'm pretty sure this book is based upon her own childhood at the turn of the century, and it shows. It feels realistic.I also loved the way that school was portrayed. A lot of the kids are awful to one another; even after they go through something, they tease other kids for having the same thing happen to them. The teachers ignore when the children need to use the bathroom, and bullying is rampant. And yet, there are moments of brightness: when the music teacher comes, when Sissy (Francie's aunt) intercedes for her. Francie actually really does like school.A thing I found interesting was that even though Manhattan isn't that far away, it seems so foreign to Francie, a whole other world that she can't even imagine.The characters were amazing. Katie, Johnny, Francie, Neely, Sissy...all of them and more felt realistic and were really fun to read about. Francie, particularly. She's an avid reader much like myself, \\"on that day when she first knew she could read, she made a vow to read one book a day as long as she lived.\\" I can identify with that, and I would highly recommend A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.All of my reviews can be read at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith is a story that lingers in the minds of young adults worldwide. It is wrong, farfetched even, to say that this book is just about a girl and her life in New York City. This is a story about life at its limit and a girl that learns to grow up. Fragile threads of a seemingly dull existence and the tragedies of poor family are what holds the bindings of the book together. It is the rich past that makes it suddenly an adventure worth reading. The peace in it provides the finally perfect piece for the restless minds of people like me, who read this story. It teaches me that no matter how wrong the start, there is always a conclusion that fits incredibly well, despite the trail of sharp and cutting glass that a shattered mirror leaves behind. This is a journey spun beautifully by Betty Smith through her concise but stunning words, woven to life by her cunning twists of characters. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, a journey of life, misfortunes, and maturity, will become a towering figure that roots deep into your conscious mind."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book had interesting insights into life in Brooklyn years ago. Very good story and narration was excellent as well."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn , is a very touching novel. It takes place in the 1920's and tells what life is like growing up back then , with all of the obstacles that come along the way. Francis is the main character of the book who grows up along with the trees in Brooklyn.She grows up in a poor family and struggles to fit in and find friends however, that does not bring her down. Francis is still a very happy and cheerful person regardless of what other people may try to tell her. She loves to read and since she doesn't have many friends, she feels and makes her books her friends.

It is written not only for teenagers or adults, but anyone who wants to read about the thrill of growing up. If you miss A Tree Grows In Brooklyn you are missing a truly great novel."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was great!!!!!!!! It had everything and i mean everything! Even a little romance. Set in the early 1900's this book is about Francie Nolan whom we get to grow up with. As ur reading this even though the neighborhood is poor u find urself wanting to live in Brooklyn in the early 1900's. This book was too good to be true. I dont' ever really remember a chapter when i didn't like this book. I read it in fifth grade which might have been too young for even me, but it was great!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Even the weak small tree in the back yard can grow with only little sunlight. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith is a poignant novel that beautifully displays the themes of a growing family, often compared to a growing tree. The journeys of the Nolan family, all extensions included, are captured in five \\"books\\", each documenting a period of their lives. Mostly, the focus is on Francie, the book beginning when she is age eleven in the Williamsburg slums of Brooklyn, though there are also records of her early years and even her birth. When Francie is born and looks as if she might not live too long, her mother Katie is pitied for the sickly baby and she replies: \\"Who wants to die? Everything struggles to live. Look at that tree growing up there out of that grating. It gets no sun, and water only when it rains. It's growing out of sour earth. And it's strong because its hard struggle to live makes it strong\\" (93). Through this coming-of-age novel, Francie constantly exhibits her innermost thoughts concerning life, love, and her family from 1902 to 1919.After showing Brooklyn in the first book during the summer of 1912 as \\"serene\\", and quoting Francie's observations about the people who surround her, the path continues into lives of Francie's parents Katie and Johnny, beginning when they first met, and delving into their families. The tales of Katie's sisters Sissy, Evy, and Eliza and bits about Johnny's brothers Andy, Georgie, and Frankie are covered as well. Book Three begins when Francie is approximately age seven when the Nolan family moves to a new flat due to the accidents caused by an overwhelming amount of love from Sissy. Francie now begins a new adventure called school, which confronts her with both good and bad incidents. She painfully endures her beautiful father's death, and sees her mother's newest pregnancy, which is Johnny's child. She recognizes her mother's apparent love for Neeley over her, and learns that upon ending middle school she must get her working papers. Francie yearns for education but realizes that she must work to help her family and keep them afloat.Book Four begins with Francie learning the ropes of factory life and to appreciate the necessity of work. Annie Laurie, Francie's new sister, is born. She will not grow up in poverty as Francie and Neeley did, because of the nice, rich man who is courting Katie. Francie finds her first crush, her first love, her first heartbreak all in this section of the book. In Book Five Francie leaves the necessity of her life of work and prepares for a life of luxury thanks to Katie's new husband. The novel ends with Francie bidding adieu to her old town, her old life, and her old self.Throughout my journey of reading A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I both laughed and cried, and realized that there were aspects of this book that I liked and ones that I disliked. I liked knowing about all the people in the family, and knowing their emotions rather than merely knowing about Francie alone. I liked growing up with Francie, and observing her ups and downs. Though all of this possibly could not have been written in a shorter length, I felt that the book was too long and that it dragged at certain points. While I enjoyed the writing style of Betty Smith, I think that some of the vignettes were unnecessary. I most liked the constant symbolism of the tree growing in the backyard. \\"The tree hadn't died. A new tree had grown from the stump and its trunk had grown along the ground until it reached a place where there were no wash lines above it. Then it had started to grow towards the sky again...It lived! And nothing could destroy it\\" (483)."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book has a way of being able to transport you right to the place and time.

The part with the roses was my favorite. This is a truly wonderful book and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's certainly easy to see why this book is a classic. The haunting story of Francie Nolan, a young girl living in poverty in Brooklyn, strikes a chord deep within all of us. Beautifully told, this story draws us into Francie's early-20th century life-her father's drunkenness, her mother's disillusionment with life, her deep love of books- and makes us respond with empathy. This is certainly one of those books that trascends descriptions-it is simply a book about life that has become a classic because of its enduring truths. Betty Smith's strong main character, keen and startlingly truthful observations about life, and stark descriptions make this an unforgettable read-deserving many more than five &quot;stars.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"In Betty Smith's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Smith uses the descriptive style to depict Francie Nolan's story about her life well. Throughout the novel, readers are able to get a vivid picture of the struggles, hardships, and joys in the life of Francie. As the novel progresses, Francie faces the usual struggles of a poor family, worrying about where the money for food for the week will come from, and if her as well as her brother Neely Nolan will be able to acquire a higher education. An example of this is when the Nolan's are at the soda shop Katie Nolan, says, &quot;They never had enough to eat, never had right cloths. The best I could do wasn't enough&quot; (351). This passage shows that the Nolan's do not have enough money for everything needed and at times their family would struggle making Katie feel that she had not done enough for her children. Smith enables Francie to tell her coming of age story in a way that makes the reader know just as much about Francie and Francie herself does. When Francie speaks it seems that she is speaking to you and wants you to understand her pain, and joys allowing Smith to let the world know just how life was for some families growing up. Even though the Nolan family had nothing in the beginning, through hard work and some suffering, their family was able to gain a higher status than the generations before them, thus showing the reader that if you have strong determination, good will, and a sense of direction about where you want your life to take you, you will succeed and gain even greater happiness. Throughout the novel, Smith captures the readers mind as she takes them on a journey through the life of a child in Brooklyn, as seen through the eyes of Francie. Betty Smith's novel, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, as an astonishing descriptive style. For that reason, the reader is able to make a connection with Francie as if they were her very own best friend and she was confiding in then all the memories of her childhood and teen life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"In Betty Smith's novel, Francie Nolan is a poor Brooklyn girl, growing up at the turn of the century.

How he knew I would be drawn to this book, I don't know, but I have read this book at least once a year, for the past 13 years. Each time I read it I find something new, and something that strikes a chord and resonates so profoundly that I see my own heart mirrored in the typeset. I almost think to study this novel in school would do it a tremendous disservice--it is so personal, and subtle, and quietly stirring, that it needs no public dissection. Comfort and eloquence, like Francie's library books and that stubbourn tree, is what this book symbolizes."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A remarkable story that is sure to be treasured for generations to come; it exposes youth to a different way of life and also shows that a young girl, on her own, can achieve her goals.

Then, MONTHS later, I read it.....and fell in love with it. It's a wonderful book, full of emotions. It isn't afraid to show the view of real life, with all its hardships and happiness.

It made you feel everything that Francie felt, made you think like her. I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree grows in Brooklyn is a rare jewel. I fell in love with this book at age twelve, and have read it maybe one hundred times since (and i am not all that old) I am an avid reader, and usally finish five books a week. But the first time I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, something changed. It broke my heart while filling me with pure joy. I never cry at the end of books, but the last page of my copy is stained from all the years of reading and loving. I love it so much that sometimes when I get to the end, I flip to the first page, because I never wanted to hear the end of Francie Nolan.A Tree Grows In Brooklyn is a book about life. Nothing more. It fills you with a love and a saddness that almost no other books can. This is my favorite book, and as a huge reader and an editor of a literary magazine that is not said lightly. The ideas posed in this book will stick with you until your death, and maybe longer. You will never forget Francie Nolan.This book deserves much more than I can say. This book is amazing feeling, and maybe not more than that. Nothing really happens in this book, and that is perhaps the beauty of this book. If you read nothing else, read this book. I know you'll love it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was required reading by a Jewish teacher in my 8th grade English class, in Brooklyn. Being a know-it-all Black girl from Brooklyn, I never wanted to read it because I thought I knew it all. Fast forward 10+ years and I finally read the book as a semi-adult. Fast forward 10+ more years and I read it AT LEAST twice a year. This is, in my opinion, the best book for any young woman to read, EVER. It made me read everything else that Betty Smith wrote. It makes me check my local library's supply to make sure they have adequate copies for other young (or older, wiser) girls to read. I have searched and found a 1st printing of the book and I hold it more dearly that my most profound treasure. I would suggest this book to anyone that can read. It will surely teach you something about love, sacrifice and the complexity of the human heart. It is full of romantic love, child-parent love, hopes, dreams, fears, innocence, everything! I recently purchased the movie and I've watched it at least 15 times already. This is a really good book. Oprah thinks so too; she lists it as one of the few books that changed her life. I wholeheartedly agree."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Bad News in BrooklynFrancie Nolan is the kind of person that lives life to the fullest, no matter what the circumstances are. Francie is a poor Brooklyn girl, living in the early 1900's. She has many struggles to overcome, and few opportunities. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, a fiction novel by Betty Smith, is about the battles Francie and her family have to win in order to rise above poverty.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is essentially a biography about Francie Nolan, the fictional heroine in this novel. Francie is an intelligent and determined girl. She is a wonderful writer, and has planned to read every single book in her local library. Unfortunately, though, Francie's life is anything but perfect. Her dad is a singing waiter, and he is addicted to alcohol. Therefore, he doesn't bring home a lot of money, so Francie, her mom, younger brother, and dad, all have to live off of only a couple dollars a week. In order to survive, Francie will have to work hard, and get a job to support her family.In this novel, Betty Smith describes in detail all of the characters' personalities, which helps the reader better understand their actions. She also describes the time period very well, so it feels as if you're actually living back then.I really enjoyed this book because it opened my eyes to how different this country was, just less than a century ago. Few people back then were well educated, and some were even illiterate. It also made me see how difficult life is as an immigrant. Francie has to grow up living through all of these hardships.I would recommend this book mostly to girls, ages 12 to 15. Anyone who enjoys reading fiction or historical fiction , or who liked Number the Stars by Lois Lowry, is sure to love A Tree Grows in Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was a book I read over and over as a child. I so identified with Francie, the dreamer and eager reader, observing her surroundings as an outsider having trouble fitting in. I loved and savored the detailed descriptions of Francie's routines and rituals of junk selling, little treats, and books devoured on the fire escape. The world of turn of the century tenements seemed like a wonderful place, and the family's ability to make something from nothing was marvelous.Returning to the book as an adult I found new pleasures in the parts I'd skimmed or barely understood as a kid--the drama of the adult relationships of Katie Nolan and her husband, and Katie's sisters Evie and Sissy. Instead of Francie's impatience with her mother, I sympathized with Katie's point of view and saw the grinding poverty without the innocence of Francie's viewpoint. I was amazed anew at the vitality and resourcefulness of the characters.Recently I listened to the audio version of the book, read by Kate Burton. I rediscovered the story yet again, finding parts I'd forgotten in the ten or so years since last re-reading it and anticipating the parts I remembered. In having it read to me I enjoyed it all over, with the addition of Ms. Burton's talent for accents and the dialogue.If you have never read this book, read it. If you read it long ago as a kid, check it out again--I guarantee you'll find fascinating new dimensions to the story. If you've read it a dozen times, you will still find it worthwhile to spend a little more time with this old friend. I know I did."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, which is similar to Angela's Ashes, is a great book. Not only is it very personal and emotional, but it also is a reflection on a society. At times it can be so horribley honest; the descriptions are very blunt. Through the experiences of Francie and many other characters, we get a picture of what life was at that time and place. Francie is surrounded by ignorance and poverty. Some of the scenes she witnesses are not very pleasent (for example, the women who gang up on the girl who has a baby and throw rocks at her). But through it all, Francie manages to have a good time. On the last page of the book, i wanted to cry, which says a lot because i NEVER cry in books."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a very, very great book. I don't see why anyone wouldn't want to read it. I mean it has everything: romance, fun, adventure, sad stuff, down-to-earth characters, or whatever else you might be looking for. But really, this story one you read and then forget about. It really stays with you and makes you look at life in a different way. I know that I am a different person after reading this book.Anyway, now that I told you how truly wonderful this book was, here's a summary: This book is mainly about Francie Nolan, an eleven year old girl growing up in the slums of Brooklyn, New York. The book goes all the way up until like she's seventeen and the author does a good job of showing in an indirect way just how hard her life is. Sometimes her family doesn't even have enough to eat, and instead of going to high-school, Francie has to go get a job. Plus she has to deal with many problems in her family.I loved this book because of Francie's courage and strength and because the author knocked down the typical stereotypes about people living in slums. But what I really should have just said along time ago is you should just read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn instead of this corny review that lasted way too long."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I don't know how many times I've read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. My parents had a copy in the house where I grew up in Queens, and it was among the books I read again and again as a young teen. Perhaps that was because it was about a young girl growing up in New York, perhaps it was because it was among the few books (in the ramshackle, eclectic collection of my parents' house, which a friend once described as \\"decorated in Late Brooklyn Depression\\") that was clearly about the joys of being a kid. But I think it was really a lot more than that.The movies they made from this book are TERRIBLE, or at least they don't reflect any of the magic I found here, so please don't let them set your expectations.What Smith did so well -- and why this book has remained a classic -- is show the shabbiness and the innocence, simultaneously. The story, which you probably know is about Francie Nolan and her family in Brooklyn's tenement neighborhoods from the early 1900s, treats the poor with respect but without romanticism. It's nostalgic for the joys that children find -- in the flowers at a library checkout counter, in the opportunity to choose the best candy from the penny store -- without painting such a rosy glow that you ever want to go back there.Another reason that this book works so incredibly well is the author's marvelous ability to show each main character's viewpoint. Francie and her mother argue; instead of showing just Francie's side, you also know exactly what is going through Katie's mother's mind, and you know that BOTH of them are right. That's an important message, especially for teenagers, and I distinctly remember deciding to adopt some of the attitudes I saw in this book. How many books did you read as a child that had that kind of influence on you?Smith never shied away from issues of sex and drink, either, so if you're considering this book as a present for a child of, say, under ten, you might want to read through it first yourself. (Not that this will be a hardship; I just re-read it last night, at the grand old age of 48, and I obviously still love this book.)On the other hand, this might be a good book for a pre-teen, as the sex and substance abuse are treated with clear eyes and a kind heart. If you want to talk to kids about the choices that people make (\\"Could Francie's father have stopped drinking?\\" you might ask the kid), this would be a great vehicle for doing so.But heck -- you don't have to get that serious about it. This is a great story, wonderfully written, and the time-and-place comes alive."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Hello! ...I've read most of the reviews on here.

Character, self-reliance, pride and love see Francie through a life where every penny is precious, and most breaks seem to be bad.

Imagine you have a father who you love more than anyone in the world, but who drinks to much and uses all of his money for liquor. How would you feel if you had a father who was addicted to liquor? This book gives the reader an idea of how hard life would be growing up with a dad who drinks and a mother who works so hard to get money and help the family have a better life.Other characters in &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; have hard lives. The main character is Francie. The book tells the story of her life growing up in Brooklyn. Francie is a smart girl who likes to read and write. She lives with her mother and father and brother. Her parents married when they were very young. Her dad,Johnny ,drinks all the time. He loves his family but isn't happy. He is not happy because he didn't have enough education. He dreams all the time but it doesn't come true. Francie's mom works very hard because she wants Francie and Neely to have a better life than she did. Francie's Aunt Sissy loves her very much and hangs out with her when Francie's mom is busy.I really thought this was an interesting book. I thought it was interesting to learn about how different their lives were compared to mine. I learned so much about what life was like in the early 1900's.They wore different clothes and played different games. When I read this book I really wanted to know what happened to the characters.

The first 70 or so pages were very hard to get into but once I hit 100 I couldn't put it down! There are amazing characters in this book and when it ends you wish there was a sequel. I've read it twice in 3 years and will read it again in years to come."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Every so often I find a story that is so authentic in the revealing of its characters, that I find myself wondering about them when I'm finished. &quot;How is Francie?&quot; I think to myself...&quot;Is Katie happy?&quot; I wonder...&quot;Does Neely sing just like his father?&quot;...as if they are real, and their lives continued somewhere in the cosmos after I finished the last page. This is one such book. Although I found the everyday drudgery of the Nolans just trying to survive a bit tiring, I would often chastise myself with the thought that &quot;This is very real for many people, even today...&quot; The crisis of poverty and hunger remains with us, and I was struck by my own frivolity as I watched the Nolans struggle to save every single penny. I wonder if I had read this book at a younger age, would my lifestyle have been any different? It is well worth the occasional struggle to complete this novel...for I believe it will impact you internally."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith takes us back to the early 1900's (1912) where Francie Nolan grows up in Brooklyn in abject poverty. Her mother, who loves Francie's brother, Neely, better, works to support the family, while their endearing yet alcoholic father staggers though Francie's early life, giving her more support through out his weak life, than her mother's strength, because he truly loves her. To me, this is an amazing story of true life in the early 1900's among emigrants and others, like Francie's family, who consider themselves true &quot;American's&quot;, because her parents were born in America, making Francie the only one in her class in school &quot;a true American&quot;. Hard to find a great deal of humor, but easy to find an amazing family story as good today as when it was published. I recommend this to everyone and plan to make sure my grandchildren read it - hopefully with me- to explain a generation they cannot imagine, but certainly did exist (and probably still does)."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I would probably pick A Tree Grows in Brooklyn as one of the greatest books of this century. Yeah, I know Ulysses was chosen as number 1 but those guys who picked the best books of the 20th century don't know what their missing. This book has everything, you will fall in love with Franci Nolan and her family. Its realistic about poverty but not quite as depressingly repetitive as Angela's Ashes(I liked AA but A Tree Grows in brooklyn is much better) This is one of those books where you escape into the world of the characters and become best friends with the main character. I could read this book over and over again and not get bored, its a remarkable book and I recommend it to everyone who would like to be introduced to a wonderful book that they can treasure forever."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book along with my class and my language teacher in the seventh grade. This is one of the best-written books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. This isn't a book for short-story readers and it's definitely not one for fairytale readers. This book gives a vivid, firsthand account of a young girl growing up in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn, and it deals with all aspects of society, no matter how shocking or taboo they may normally seem. This book describes literally ever aspect of this young girl's life, and I think that the author should be praised for examining the issues that she did and presenting them without the silver lining that isn't there in real life. This is a wonderful book for fans of history and especially for fans of good literature. Books like this one don't come along very often, and if you haven't read it then you're missing a great work of literature."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn has been on my \\"to read\\" list since girlhood, but I never got around to it, until this week, at age 29. Now I almost cannot believe I lived so long without reading it. Smith's novel is a written masterpiece of storytelling, characterization, and narration. Never have I so longed to be back in college with a professor and fellow English majors, to be sure I hadn't overlooked a single morsel of a book. Though Smith writes in the third person, it IS \\"Francie's book\\" and the narrator describes the world beautifully through her eyes. Over and over, a single, simple sentence expressing a fleeting, naive thought by young Francie manages to make more of a poignant and sometimes humorous social commentary than what other authors might take entire chapters to describe. As Francie grows, so does the narration-- becoming more direct, less naive, and more self-aware. Francie is one of the most lovingly drawn and memorable characters I've ever encountered-- she is a timeless picture of every curious young girl who has ever grown up in a poor family, dreaming of more, working hard in school and writing her way to a better life. A century later, I know that I was that girl, and thousands of other women over time have been \\"that girl,\\" yet Francie manages at the same time to be both every-girl and a unique little jewel all her own. Smith's book not only provides an intriguing description of life of the American urban poor at the turn of the century, but also grapples with social issues still existing in modern America. This is a book to be read over and over; even while reading it, I was aware of how much I was missing by not pausing to relish and deconstruct particular passages. However, it is also a novel so well-written and so packed with life that it deserves to be savored between readings. So, as I finished the book, I had to stop myself from turning back to page 1 and starting again-- at least for a while."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I first read this book over twenty years ago and to this day, I think about the characters often, comparing their struggles to those I have experienced in my own life. I recommend this book to anyone who will listen. If this book touches you the way it has touched me, it will stay with you forever."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"They call it \\"a green umbrella\\", they call it \\"the tree that lived,\\", they call it \\"Annie,\\" this tree is no ordinary tree, it's a pet, it lived, through all the chopping down, and through all the fires, this tree lived. When Francie was 11 years old this tree was only 2 stories high, but it seemed that as Francie grew, it grew too. Betty Smith explains poverty of the 1910's in Brooklyn, in her book \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\". She describes the protagonist (Francie Nolan) as caring, loving, and creative. Betty explains Francie's life from her childhood days to her 15th birthday. Ever scince she was a child, Francie has loved to read. From her first glance at \\"If I Were King,\\" to her job at the Press Clipping office, Francie has demonstrated her creativity and love for reading and writing. \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is split into 5 books. Book One, explains the childhood life of Francie and Neely Nolan. It explains how Francie loves the library. Book Two explains how Katie Rommely and Johnny Nolan (parents of Francie and Neeley) first met. Book Three is the longest and explains Francie school life. She changes schools in the middle. In this book her mother saves her from a murderer. Book Four and Book Five go on to explain Francie's life from ages 13-15 and how she gets a job. It's a very good book. Outstandingly written, and explains 1910's poverty life very well."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I only recently got around to reading Betty Smith's 1943 memoir-cum-novel A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, mainly because it had a reputation as an Oprah Winfrey sort of book, meaning I thought it must be one of those tomes filled with good intentions but short on literary merit. After all, the first mention of it I can recall was a snide comment in an old Bugs Bunny cartoon from the 1940s. Boy, do I love to be wrong about things like this. The novel is a total masterpiece. At almost 500 hundred pages there is not a thing I'd cut- not a chapter, paragraph, sentence, nor word. It is a work of fiction the equal of Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn, and some other great works like John Steinbeck's The Grapes Of Wrath, Richard Matheson's I Am Legend, Charles Johnson's Oxherding Tale, and the best of Kurt Vonnegut and William Kennedy. In fact, it might be the best of the bunch.In fact, it's more than great literature. It personally resonates with me because its depth and narrative immersion in a bygone world rivals that of the best of memoirs, including my own True Life series. I include it, now, along with Walt Whitman's Leaves Of Grass, Alex Haley's The Autobiography Of Malcolm X, Leonard Shlain's Art And Physics, Loren Eiseley's autobiography All The Strange Hours, and Terry Matheson's Alien Abductions, as the most personally influential and resonant books I have read. Aside from that it is a perfect example of what the publishing industry used to do right versus what it does wrong now.In many ways ATGIB is a very similar story to 1996's Angela's Ashes, by Frank McCourt. The later book follows a poor Irish American boy who will grow up to be a writer for his first nineteen or so years, while this book chronicles a poor Irish-German American girl who will grow up to be a writer for her first sixteen or so years. AA is set three decades later and the family goes from America to Ireland, and then Frankie goes back to America, while Francie Nolan remains in Brooklyn, until heading off for college at novel's end. Both books feature strong mothers who endure alcoholic husbands, and both books have colorful families to sketch, as well as great poverty, but ATGIB is a far superior book to AA. Primarily this has to do with editing. AA is a 450 page book that could have been 300 pages, and included far more. But, in it, McCourt tends to ramble on far too much, and recount far too similar stories, with the effect of boring you. His book revels in suffering for suffering's sake. ATGIB, was submitted as a memoir, but the editor urged Smith to make it a novel, which helped her flesh out the characters and smooth over rough spots. It worked, for ATGIB is a compelling, poetic, and multifarious work, where AA is a spotty work of unrealized potential. I submit these two books as Exhibits A and B in the case of poor editing for most current books' being so poorly written, rather than just bad writers.The book ends with Katie Nolan accepting a marriage proposal from a retired police sergeant and widower who has long been enamored with her. He offers to adopt Francie's youngest sister Annie Laurie and to send Neeley and Francie to college. Francie readies to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan to attend the University of Michigan. As she stops past her old apartment building she sees the cut down but still growing Tree Of Heaven resprouting in the tenement yard. She sees a small girl named Florrie Wendy, for whom the tree will also come to represent something, just as it must have represented something to her older neighbor girl Flossie Gaddis before her. That all three girls have names that start with F is not coincidental. That the tree that is chosen as the titular tree is a nondescript tree is all the more apt. It is, along with Melville's white whale, one of the greatest metaphors in fiction. Yet, even as the book ends the reader wants to know more of what will happen in Francie's life, even though none doubts she will perdure.I am eager to read other of Smith's novels, to see if this was merely part of a continuum, or some great work that rose far beyond any other in her oeuvre. The scenes she so deftly set in A Tree Grows In Brooklyn are indelible, and even if her other works are not on par, this book alone is one of those near-miraculous things that justifies the 99.9% of bad arts being out there. Now, back to the crap!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was originally published in 1943, it was a huge success, and Betty Smith's book became an instant classic. It is about several years in the life of the Nolan family in the early 20th century and it is mostly about the coming-of-age of the main character, Francie Nolan. It is that rare novel that can be enjoyed by both teenagers and adults.This book very definitely has its own style, I think partly because it was written as a memoir and changed into a novel. Smith obviously poured her heart into this book. Her other novels are charming, but they don't have the depth of this book. Because Smith could fictionalize apparently real people, she could flesh out the characters until they seem like real people, not characters in a novel. Sometimes even minor characters are given thoughts and feelings, as how they relate to the main characters in the book.A strong point of the novel is its sense of place. Smith even describes in detail the neighborhood. the neighbors and everyday life until you feel are actually in the Brooklyn of 100 years ago. The novel opens by describing Brooklyn in 1912:\\"Serene was a word you could put to Brooklyn, New York. Especially in the summer of 1912. Somber, as a word, was better. But it did not apply to Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Prairie was lovely and Shenandoah had a beautiful sound, but you couldn't fit those words into Brooklyn. Serene was the only word for it; especially on a Saturday afternoon in the summer.\\"The women are the stronger people in the book. Many of the male characters are weak-willed, while the women persevere. Francie Nolan, the main character, is the daughter of Johnny and Katie Nolan and the sister of Neeley. Francie is a fully-realized character. Francie is a strong person, who you know will do well in life.Katie, the mother, is very hard-working. She cleans apartment buildings for a living. She is scrubbing floors when she is an advanced state of pregnancy. Katie refuses anything that smacks of \\"charity.\\" One wonders what she would think of Section 8, food stamps, free school lunches, and WIC. Sometimes there is no food in the house, and the children go hungry.Johnny Nolan, the father, is a singing waiter, but has no steady job. He mostly works at one-shot jobs like weddings and parties. Johnny is an alcoholic. There was little understanding or treatment of alcoholism when Smith wrote the book. We now know that alcoholism is a disease, with both powerful psychological as well as physical components. So even though Johnny is lovable, and really loves his children, he is perceived as weak and a loser. Johnny comes from a long line of alcoholics; perhaps his problems were at least partially due to a genetic disposition toward the disease.Francie senses that her mother loves Neeley more, but she eventually comes to peace with it. This does not mean that her mother doesn't love her, of course she does. It is partly because Neeley is reminiscent of the father and Katie does not want him to turn out the same way. Francie is like her mother in that she is strong and smart, but she has also inherited her father's creative ability and his dreaminess. One of the main differences between Francie and her father is that Francie takes action, and Katie admires that. Francie works hard at school and at her various jobs, and in improving upon her hardscrabble beginnings.The novel does have flaws. Some of the psychoanalyzing and character analysis is quite dated. Women are thwarted by \\"starved love instincts.\\" However, I find the book to be mostly very strong, especially about the characterization of Francie. She is a completely realized character. You feel as if you know her. The book takes her from an eleven-year-old child to a young woman about to leave Brooklyn and start new adventures. Even though she is going far away, she will never really leave Brooklyn behind:\\"She might get rid of her Brooklyn accent that way. But Francie didn't want to get rid of it any more than she wanted to get rid of her name. It meant that she belonged some place. She was a Brooklyn girl with a Brooklyn name and a Brooklyn accent. She didn't want to change into a bit of this and a bit of that.\\"You just wish that there had been a sequel."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Sweet. Real. Honest.

All of them impeccably vivid and startling the way a little 11 year old saw the world in Broooklyn,New York in 1912 and then moving on to when Francy is 14,In 1915.

She said she was going to read it along with me and quiz me after each chapter. It wasn't long before I didn't want to put it down. From then on, I would read just about anything I could get my hands on. I have such a fondness for this touching story and I plan to read it with my sixth grade students as the time frame and subject matter correlate with my state's social studies standards."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Some good books are good because of excellent writing. Some are good because of engrossing storytelling. Some are good because of fantastic character development. One characteristic that I had always overlooked was the setting, that is, until I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. In this book, the author seamlessly transported me from my living room couch to the streets of pre-WWI Brooklyn. She made me nostalgic for a world that I had never experienced.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a classic coming of age book. It opens in 1912 with 11 year old Francie Nolan scampering about the streets of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. It is a book about survival, overcoming adversity, and embracing life. Through her adolescent years, Francie Nolan copes with poverty, hunger, and her father's alcoholism. She is a strong, endearing character and you just can't help rooting for her.I have no doubt that the author herself lived through the same pre-WWI Brooklyn setting. No one could have created such a vivid setting without having lived through it. I was impressed by the incredible detail that she devoted to describing the setting. And I'm not talking about insanely boring details like the arch of every leaf. I'm referring to the little details about life that many authors overlook and don't even begin to think about describing.For example, I loved the author's inclusion of the milkman's horse in describing the times. At the start of the novel, the end of the horse-drawn carriage days was imminent, but it had not yet arrived. Milk was still delivered daily by a horse-drawn wagon. For some reason, the milkman's horse didn't like the milkman, but he seemed to like everyone else. In this detail, the author showed that horses had personality. For all the benefits that cars could bring, cars didn't have personality. This is the sort of detail that brings the pre-WWI world to life and makes you experience a world that has long past. Someone today imagining what life was like in pre-WWI might never think to describe horses in the way that Betty Smith did. Unless the story was specifically a horse story, a writer of today might just describe a horse as white or brown, tall or short, because for the most part, one horse would be just as good as another. Including details such as the personality of the milkman's horse was what made the setting of this book so realistic.In recent years, the young adult genre has gained quite a lot of traction. It's become popular and profitable. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a perfect novel for young adults, but I hesitate to call it a \\"young adult\\" novel. It doesn't obey by any of the characteristics of a modern \\"young adult\\" novel. It is not fast-paced. It is not plot-driven. And it is not part of a series. Instead, it is introspective, slow, and thoughtful. It is a book that any adult can appreciate without ever thinking that it is juvenile. And yet, it tackles the very same adolescent issues that everyone experiences in their transition from child to adult."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a member of that very small, elite club \\"My Favorite Books of All Time;\\" these are the books I have read numerous times, and will doubtless read numerous times again before I die. From the very first time I read ATGIB at age 11, it was firmly ensconsed as one of my all-time faves, and that position has remained unshaken in the ensuing 30+ years.I first obtained ATGIB through a free book give-away program at the poor, rural school I attended (back in the 1970s), and I can still remember so much about that very first reading -- for instance, that much of it was on a 10-hour long Greyhound bus ride. It was an impressionable and difficult age for me, which no doubt accounts for the very strong and indelible impression that ATGIB made on my psyche. I connected and identified strongly with Francie Nolan, and identified her parents with my own (and still do even now).I honestly don't know how many times I've read ATGIB: enough that I have most of the scenes and narrative practically memorized. It is a beautiful story, if a melancholy and bittersweet one, from beginning to end. Amazingly, I identify Francie and her family with me and my own even more now as an adult than I did as a young girl. I find the book more poignant and touching every time I read it.A few years ago I obtained this audio version (which I am now listening to for the second time) and it is superb. Kate Burton's narration is incredibly good, and she makes this wonderful classic even better. She captures the myriad of accents -- German, Irish, Brooklynese -- with perfect pitch.I can't recommend A Tree Grows in Brooklyn enough; although I think it might be primarily a women's book, I do think it could have some appeal for men, as well."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is such a beautiful title as it highlights the tree that continues to grow through the cracks in the concrete despite harsh conditions. It's such a beautiful metaphor for Francie who continues to blossom and even thrive through her difficult childhood with her alcoholic father, severe poverty, and the other harsh realities of her life. The tree continues to grow, despite all efforts to destroy it and is a strong symbol of overcoming adversity. I love that Francie is a reader and that her books help her transcend and escape from the world around her.Francie's innocence and perseverance was amazing. One would think she was gentle and passive as she would delight in the smallest things such as the beauty of the flowers. Don't let her fool you, though. When it was important, she would stand right up and do what she felt was right. She even found and lied her way into a school that would provide her with a far superior education to the one she was receiving from the school in her neighborhood where the teacher regarded her as worthless because she was poor.The touching and beautiful tale is a tribute to hope."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"If you loved Angela's Ashes?

I can identify with Francie Nolan more than with any other character I have encountered in literature. The story itself is very entertaining and engaging, even as it focuses on the ordinary lives and struggles of everyday, working class people in immigrant rich Brooklyn. The beginning was a little slow, but it quickly became interesting when a background was provided for it.

Definitely a must read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn when I was about twelve years old, and I decided to give it a whirl once again. I recommend that adults who loved this book as a child return to it because the magic of reading it is as wonderful and beautiful in your adult years as it was when you were a child. The story of Francie Nolan and her family will most likely have a different and interesting effect on the reader, or at least it had a different effect on me this time around. Francie is a bright young girl growing up in a poor, but hardworking family in 1912 Brooklyn. Although her life is a constant struggle over money, she still manages to eke out much joy. The novel, which does not really have a plot, is rather a collection of vignettes about Francie's life. While so much of her life appeared to be conspiring against her success, she never gave in to defeatism. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an inspiring and beautiful story that people of all ages will love. I cannot recommend this book enough."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A tree Grows in Brookly will always have a special place in my heart, it along with Maggie-now was given to me by my late grandmother when I was younger.

It is perfect for middle and highschool kids to read, it don't have all the bad behavior that's in so many coming of age stories today."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I've been singing the praises of the book (and movie) now for many years. It's about time Oprah and everyone else realized what an American classic this is. The story touched me long before I ever lived in Brooklyn, having moved there from the South. It's timeless and so beautifully crafted that you'd be more than a little off not to be moved by it.I actually found the character of the mother more likeable in book than the movie. She came off as a bit too hard and cold for me in the film, but then the policeman came off better in the movie than the book. Both are great--don't get me wrong--but I always enjoy creating the characters in my mind, with the help of the author. And in this case, it wasn't hard to do.The movie often veers dangerously close to something sappy, but is pulled back just in time by a wonderful cast. I didn't experience these problems when reading the book, possibly because I wasn't forced into the pacing of the film.At any rate, the style of writing of this book is excellent and the characters (even the tree!) will stay with you long after you've put it down.

Francie is a character to be envied, finding and making the best out of a hard life; she stands up to the world and prentends to be nothing but herself.

You think it's about a poor family and all their hardships. But it's not. It's about a poor family and their lives, how they form bonds and their sense of togetherness.

I still remember this vivid, moving, enthalling story while I have forgotten most any details from the usual 'thrillers' that I read in those days.I am not surprised to find that most of the reviewers are female. The central character is a young woman, but her coming of age and coping with the realities of the human condition are pertinent to anyone, anytime."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"&quot;A Tree Grows In Brooklyn&quot; is a truely captivating book, from the moment I was introduced to the grubby slums and characters of Brooklyn on the first page it cast its spell over me and I could hardly wait to get back to reading it after being torn away.All the characters are well rounded and the reader is shown them in all their wonderful glory, for better or for worse. The book's focal character is Francie, we are introduced to her aged eleven and follow her on a, sometimes turbulent, journey into adulthood as she gains wisdom and an understanding of the world.I found this book poignant, witty extremely wise and deeply moving. Betty Smith offers some wonderful insights into the human condition and gives a vivid description of what it was like to be poor and living in the slums of Brooklyn in turn-of-the-century america.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to look into the heart and soul of an era, I was deeply touched by the sheer brilliance and wisdom in this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have always heard of this book but never read it or saw the movie. I had just read another similar book, \\"The Glass Castle\\" by Jeanette Wells and the author recommended this one. I'm glad she did."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"My daughter recommended this book to me. At 58 and one who reads a lot I don't know how I missed this charming book about Francie Nolan (or is it about Brooklyn?). I loved every word. It was one of those books that I knew did not have an engrossing plot that chilled my nerve ends, I didn't care where it led me because I was living alongside a girl growing up in poverty who was teaching me about life. It is a story that both shamed me for my cavalier approach to material goods and gave me a renewed deep appreciation for the depth of the human spirit. If you have ever read Stegner you will love this book. The development of the characters, the easy flow of the narrative and at times, nodding your head in approval. It reminded me of Stegner's book 'Crossing to Safety'.

I've been an avid reader since I can remeber, but school, it takes the fun out of things. But this book, this book was amazing. I stayed up until 4 in the morning reading because I didn't want to put it down. It was the first book that really ever made me cry, and I cried and cried because I think everyone can relate to a lot of different aspects of the story, I know that I could. I got through this book in 2 days, and it's not a short story. I was even inspired to read Betty Smith's other novel, &quot;A Joy in the morning&quot;, which by the way, if you like this one, I highly recommend. This book is a classic and everyone should read it. I re-read it all the time, and it still gets me."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN is a wonderfully inspiring story about a girl growing up in Brooklyn in the early 1900's. The main character, Francie, is quite an intellect and would rather read a book than play with other girls any day. Throughout the story we see Francie change from a girl to a woman. Along the way we meet two of the major characters of the novel; Francie's alcoholic father and hardworking mother. I would suggest this book to any girl age thirteen years and older. Although, I do not want to discourage anyone else from reading A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN, I feel that girls over the age of fourteen would be able to relate to this book better than anyone else. This novel was not very original in setting, but the content and deep analysis of each character and situation by Betty Smith is quite unique. The narration was, for the most part the third person limited perspective. Betty Smith sets a very realistic story, though a sad one at times. I think this book is quite a timeless classic. It is an absolutely wonderful story in the slums of Brooklyn, New York. It will be just as wonderful a novel fifty years from now as it was fifty years ago. It has a timeless essence that I could relate to in 1998, and some young girl will in the year 2048. I loved this book because it was a fastpaced book and kept me reading until the very end. I hope you will decide to read A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN, By Betty Smith, and love it as much as I did."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a treasure, and it seems somehow shameful, that you can even get it in paperback. It's a keeper. My parents bought it for me when I was quite young, and now at the age of 51, I have just finished reading it again. For perhaps the twentieth time. There are few books that I read more than twice. My children will get the book soon, and perhaps they will treat it kindly, and pass it on to their children also. If they do not, there is not doubt in my mind that they will buy the hard cover copy. A paperback is fine, but if you can handle the price, by all means, go that way, so you know it will hold up for the many times you will want to reread it, and share it with others.This book will provoke so many different emotions in you, and I promise, you will never be the same again. If BOYS TOWN, A STONE FOR DANNY FISHER, and KNOCK ON ANY DOOR, brought all of your emotions to surface, then prepare yourself to reach new heights with these same feelings.

It is about growing up, family, and the discovery of truth in the squalor of life in turn-of-the the century Brooklyn, portrayed through the eyes of Francie Nolan. One should read this book because it's considered a classic, it's original ideas matching no other. One should like this book becauase it's bluntly honest and smooth-flowing. I like this book because the characters go on throughout their hardships, an inspiration."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but I understand why many would not. This is a historical novel and one where if you don't understand the language and descriptions used, you will not get much out of it. Also, this book requires a lot of reading in between the lines and critical thinking. This is why \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is so often required reading material and also why most adolescents don't like or understand it. This novel is about a girl living in poverty in the early 1900s. Simply put, this is about her life and the observations she makes about why people behave the way they do.There are many historical aspects to the story. There are references made to the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, and frankly, if you don't know much about the history of the country during this time, you will miss even more still. If you do not have at least some background and interest in reading 'classic literature' and even history, this probably isn't the book for you.But if you do enjoy reading good literature, then this is definately the book for you. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and got a lot out of it. The characters are interesting, and it's an interesting look into human behavior which, despite the times of the novel, still hold true today."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" tells the story of a young Irish-American girl growing up at the turn of the 20th century. Her father is a romantic man, with musical gifts and a tendency to drink. Her mother is a practical woman, who raises her children with tough love, and works as a janitor. The protagonist, Francie, is part of an extended family each member richly drawn, and as she matures, her world evolves from the stoop of her tenement to school to college and the workplace, all seen with her unique slant.I first read this book in fourth grade, and it is one that say, unlike \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" matures nicely. What moved me then, moves me now, and the author does that rare thing, gives each and every character his/her humanity. While the book is chock full of \\"Oprah\\" topics, such as alcoholism, sexual abuse and poverty, the characters are drawn as more than their various vices, far more. The protagonist at one point is chided for writing about \\"sordid\\" subjects by her English teacher, yet she quickly realizes that honesty as a writer is more important than fancy phrases and made up fantasies. So does the author.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I found out about \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" from Oprah. I didn't think a woman worth 40 billion would have time for a 60-year-old book about a poor New York tenement family at the turn-of-the-century. I was wrong. \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is an epic, detailed history of a destitute Irish family in 1912 big-city America. Father Johnny Nolan is a some-times singing waiter, mother Katie washes floors, and little Neely and Francie joust with cruel teachers, two-faced policemen, and self-serving neighbors. Dinner consists of stale bread and onion soup. They celebrate on Saturday night, when five bucks buys a mutton dinner. But \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is not all sad. It's filled with the love and tenderness only struggling family life can provide. Late one night, Johnny comes home tipsy, singing enchanting Irish tunes. Little Francie meets him at the door. He smiles, he winks, he gives her a tune. She turns away and faces the wall. A hot tear runs down her face. She doesn't want her father to know how much she really loves him...If you're tired of Stephen King mind-games and over-rated \\"How To\\" books, diversify into a heart-felt love-fest with this famous classic by Betty Smith. Somewhere in nineteenth century America, a little girl struggles for love and recognition. A tiny root pushes through cracks in the cement. A brave slender branch juts up, searching for the sun-light. A single vine might survive until the rain comes. \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\"."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"FRANCIE IS REALI first read this book when I was ten.

Now,as an adult,I feel the same.In fact,I found the story even more wonderful. With her simple yet eloquent writing,Betty Smith takes you on an emotional journey that holds you from the first page to the last. Francie(her alter ego) is a very real,sensitive young heroine,and her family,even with all it's problems is a lovable one.(we could all use an Aunt Sissy!) Her father,though he has a severe drinking problem(and this was long before AA) is a sympathic charactor who truly loves his family,especially his daughter who adores him in spite of his illness,however she's not blind to it,which shows how intelligent she is. There is alot of humor too,which provides a balance thats just right. A beautiful story about growing up and life itself."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book when I was barely a teen, and now 7 years later, I'm still loving this book. Brings to life the world of a family growing in the 1910s. The novel provides a critical view of class relations, without moralizing the actions of the main characters. The novel, one might say, claims only to paint a portrait of a working-class neighborhood in Brooklyn before WWI. While I cannot attest to the novel's authenticity in representation of the lifestyle of people in that neighborhood during that time period, I would argue that Smith opens a window to another world, and leaves the reader emotionally attached to Francie and her story. I must admit this novel caused a tear to fall down my cheek more than once."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I juts finished reading this book for the first time, and I can tell it is going to be re-read and re-read again and again! The development of the characters and the nuances of the plot make for a brilliant novel, and because this book was originally written in memoir form, the story and characters are completely real and believable. The book unfolds slowly, but never at a boring pace. Everything that happens is fascinating, because it is just the way life really is. This is a MUST-READ for everyone! Possibly the best book I have ever read!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"At first this book seems a little slow, but once you read into the second chapter you are mezmorized.

Now, even after having majored in English in college and become an English teacher, this remains my favorite book of any genre, any time. It is the kind of book you can enjoy as a child and enjoy even more as an adult, appreciating nuances you hadn't noticed before. The characters are so well-developed, so vividly portrayed, so multi-faceted, and so REAL that they become a part of you.

This girls name is Francie and the story is about her life from birth to her late teenage years. During this time, the book tells us many stories such as her school, her writings, and her family. The reader also gets to know Francie inside and out, basically from the little details the writer includes that normally would not be important in a story. We learn to sympathize with Francie and relate to her. This book also describes greatly the horrors of poverty for anyone. All in all, this is a wonderful piece of fiction that anyone can learn/relate to in their lives."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I was first introduced to this book by my mother at the tender age of 10. Since then, I have read it countless times, and find myself picking it up and reading sections of it from time to time. The Nolans became like family to me, and I find myself thinking about the characters--particularly Sissy and Katie--at inopportune times. These extremely well-written characters don't just get in your head, they immerse themselves in your soul, and if you read this book once you will read it 1,000 times. Betty Smith is not the best writer of the 20th century, but she writes stories like no one else and managed to create timeless characters, both in this novel and in Joy In the Morning. No one should miss reading this book at least three or four times. Trust me, if you read it it will become one of your favorites, and the characters will work their way into your heart.Sissy is my favorite character in the novel. Her lust for life, coupled with the unusual scenarios in the book, makes her unforgettable. I love Francie, of course, and who could help but love the good-for-nothing &quot;sweet singer of sweet songs&quot; himself, Johnny Nolan?This movie desperately needs to be re-made as a major Hollywood film. The 1940s version was good in its own right, but it was not entirely faithful to the novel. Think of all the charming actors who could play Johnny. Matthew McConaughey, Christian Bale, Chris O'Donnell...the list goes on and on.Anyway, do yourself a favor and read this book!!!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Shortly after reading this book, I have come to realize why A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, by Betty Smith, is considered a true literature classic. The story illustrates a beautiful picture of Brooklyn, New York during the turn of the twentieth century, and the types of lifestyles the working poor lived. The story is focused on the life of Francie and Neely Nolan, the children of a sweet but heartbreaking couple, Katie and Johnny Nolan. The mother, Katie Nolan, is brutally honest, never one to publicly express emotion or sugar-coat things for her family or friends. The father, Johnny Nolan, is a charming young man who serves as the backbone for the family, but has a terrible problem: alcoholism. Smith gives some of the most common problems of children, yet is able to elaborate on them to develop the characters and give the reader a real understanding of them. For young Francie and Neely, their lives are subject to poverty, and they soon learn how valuable every cent is. As poor children growing up in a rural neighborhood, they learn to cope with teasing of their social status and their given situation in life.With the sudden death of Johnny, the family learns to cope with an even tougher life, and the story begins to unfold. It begins to tell of the physical and emotional changes of Francie as she grows older, and her trials and tribulations as she goes from a successful student to a vulnerable factory worker. As life goes on for this family, we begin to sympathize for it, and come to gain respect for all that they must pull together for to get through whatever life throws their way.Not only will the story appeal to the reader, but also the writing style that Betty Smith takes on. The setting descriptions that she gives of the beautifully constructed buildings, blooming flowers, passers-bys, and the whirlwind of life that Francie is observing are amazing and cause the reader to have an early fondness for the book. Imagery also plays another part in the development of the characters and the story. You could feel the warmth of the sun beating down through the windows of the bakery Francie made multiple visits to for cheap, day old bread. You could smell the coffee that Katie had brewed the day before, and tasted the freshly cut rye bread to go along with it.Through the experiences Smith put the characters in, and the development of the tale of this unfortunate family, the reader is able to understand that many endless themes and messages are interwoven within the story. Hope, survival, and courage are all included with these themes, and are illustrated through the way that Francie and Neely live their everyday lives. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a book recommended for any classic collection, and can be enjoyed and appreciated by people everywhere. This heartwarming story is sure to touch all hearts of those who read it, and will give them a new view on life, and how lucky they are to live in the world they do today."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read a lot of books... and rarely have I had the experience that I had with this one. Usually I devour the language... gulp at it and after I finish a book I find that, although I enjoyed it, I didn't gain anything from the experience other than a few killed hours.This book made me slow down. Instead of reading ravenously through the pages I found myself savoring the language. I laughed, and cried, and rolled my eyes at the sarcasm and irony, and gasped, and remembered, and felt attached to the characters.I didn't read this book... I stood beside the characters and lived it with them."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is one of the best books I have had the pleasure of reading.

It is a wonderful book that speaks to your heart. It is a true treasure."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book takes the reader on a voyage through memories so heartfelt you will feel like you have become a part of the Nolan family. The story is of an Irish Catholic family bringing up their children in the heart of Brooklyn during the beginning of the century. Francie and her brother Neeley are characters that you will take away with you, never to be forgotten.Life is hard and times are poor, but love of family and a good moral upbringing by the ever-present, yet distant mother Katie, gets them through. Life in Brooklyn struggles along with a laugh and a song from their drunken father Johnny who tries his best. With love and respect they watch their father&#65533;s decline over the years. Life is a roller coaster of emotions, trials, and tribulations, all layed out by the author in a manner that will keep you reading late into the night.This book was written back in the 40&#65533;s and is as much a classic today as it ever was. It continues to reach people into the new millennium. Though the century may change the lessons remain the same, love of family, strength of character, honesty, and hard work.

I took an old book from an old set off the shelf and there it sat for a few years, under various plants. That book happened to travel with me, unread, for another 15 years from apartment, to home, to home, until someone gave me a list of the Top Ten Life-Changing American books. Happily, most of them I had read as required reading back in school. I felt so proud, until I read the subscript that said, &quot;Unless you have read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;, you haven't even skimmed the surface of great American literature&quot;. Truly, the only thought this book provoked in me was the memory of Bugs Bunny distracting a mad dog with it to make his getaway, in an old post war cartoon. How could I be missing out on the &quot;greatest american novel of all times&quot; if Mel Blank was using it as a dog pee-pee joke? I decided to put aside my Oprah list for a month, and &quot;suffer&quot; through the novel, stick with it no matter what. I wanted to &quot;grow&quot;.How surprised I was to become wrapped up in this book so completely, that I actually saw my husband peeking at it. What could be keeping me so quiet and occupied? Being the grandaughter of Immigrant Brooklyn-Americans, I was surprised no one in my family ever talked about the parallels between the Nolans and our very own family. I don't think I was ever required to read it. I never saw the movie - didn't even know there was one. To me, it is the most wonderful best-kept secret I have ever had right under my nose."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I was eleven years old I first began reading this wonderful novel. It tells the story of a poor young girl named Francie Nolan who lives in Brooklyn in the earliest years of the Twentieth Century. No work of fiction before or since has to me so captured the wondering observations of a child who lives his life in emotional isolation. The shabby, mean, and colorless streets and tenements of Williamsburg are to Francie a playground of colors, mysteries, and adventures. Francie bears a passionate love for her hopeless, drunken, dreaming father. In contrast, she struggles to love her practical, hardened, and unsentimental mother. This conflict leads to a climax that forces Francie to achieve a balance between the dreams of her father and the practicality of her mother. If you enjoy fiction that allows you to see the world through a child's eyes, this one's for you."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I really liked this book about a young girl growing up in early nineteenth century Brooklyn. Francie is a memorable, real character and one who is intelligent and very aware of her situation and surroundings as she goes about life day to day - collecting junk to sell with her brother, observing the neighbors and each of their idiosyncrasies, reading one book a day, and most of all trying to win the love of her mother. This book paints a very lifelike feel to this time period in Brooklyn including union sentiments, prohibition talk, war rumors and overwhelming class distinction. It makes you feel like you were there looking through the eyes of Francie."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book three years ago, when I was in fifth grade. It seemed to be the world's best book then. Now a little wiser and wider in my knowledge of literature, I see this book as an earnest, honorable book. One thing I loved about this book was how the perspective of the book grew more mature as Francie grew up. It makes this book a 'happening book', and draws its readers well into the book while reading. Another excellent technique that Smith used in the book is the way she made littel events seem so important and glorious, the way it would seem to a little girl. It is a touching, rich book, full of emotion and feelings."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The most amazing aspect of &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; is its universal appealto readers of any age, any race. Opening the covers of this book is likestepping into a time machine and visiting the squalor of 1920's Brooklyn, N.Y.Here Betty Smith's descriptive magic plunges you into the ugliness of povertyand the beauty of the people who fought to overcome it...Francie Nolan, a dreamy child who finds her escape in books...Johnny Nolan, her handsome young father, who finds his escape --and ultimate tragedy -- in the bottle... and Katie Nolan, her beautiful,hardened mother, who realizes that education is the only way her childrencan escape the life she is forced to endure.Although this novel was written many decades ago, modern readers will findthe prose to be shockingly frank and as realistic as it is descriptive.The only fault with the book, which covers the span of Francie's life frombirth until college, is that it eventually has to end.No history text can make the past come alive the way &quot;A Tree Grows inBrooklyn&quot; can...no movie can leave its audience with more satisfactionfrom a story well-told.

A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith describes the life of a poor girl growing up in the slums of Brooklyn in the 1920s. Johnny Nolan, her father, was a drunk and always became quiet and depressed when he drank, while Katie Nolan, her mother, worked late and didn't see her family much. Yet, you can tell because of the way Smith describes Katie that she deeply loves her family. Betty Smith talks about Francie's courage to seek a better life. This happens to be my favorite part of the book. In elementary school, on her own initiative, Francie switched schools to get away from the bullies and succeeded to make herself happier.I love how Francie Nolan has a passion to write and wrote many mythical stories of flowers and rainbows. After her father died, she started writing stories about poverty and people starving. Francie is a unique character for many reasons: I can picture her as she used to run down to get paper dickie shirt collars for her father, and she drank coffee when she was only 10. Although she went through many of life's hardships, she still turned out to be a very nice lady.I recommend \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\", A New York Public Library \\"Book of the Century\\" to anyone and everyone as it was enthralling and interesting, too.

I chose it beacuse of a quotable quote from Reader's Digest. Because of its length, I almost gave up. However, I stuck with it and was taken into Francie's world and could imagine myself in her position. It gave me a new outlook on the beauty of everyday life. Because Francie had little experience outside of Brooklyn, she did not realize her poverty and being poor did not bother her. I was profoundly moved by every section and feel that A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a very life-changing book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is one of the greatest books of all time! I completely relate to Francie, not in an exact, economical sense, but as a 15-year-old girl; I have gone through the same emotional situations as Francie. She is a modern heroine who does not rely on anyone except for her own strength and will to survive. The lavish descriptions about her family's life will touch the heart of any reader.

Hmmm, how can I explain myself better. I live in such a sheltered world. I am middle class, have never experienced hunger, and have cable. I also live in an imaginary world.This book finally presented reality to me... and it presented the idea that it IS possible to live in the real world. And it showed that even when things bad or sad happen, if you deal with it the right way, you become a better person for it. But it was not a book with a definate moral. It didn't follow the norm in books, no flowery language or silly romance. It was just straight out &quot;this is how it is, &amp; this is one way to deal with it, &amp; it is possible to be strong even when you are weak, or especially from your weaknesses&quot;. The impressive thing is how old it is, yet it dealt with issues that are still very prevalent today - the so-called disfunctional family (I so far have not yet met a functional one); alcoholism; idolatry of those you love; sexuality; fidelity; poverty; morality; mortality. In other words LIFE. This book is a must read for those who are daily forced to meet reality's gritty face as well as those who deny it, because you will hear an empathitic voice and even find hope, because after all... Trees grow in Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"As a 17 female I have read this tantalizing book a number of times. Basically the other reviews say it all, how magical this book is, how inspiring, and just plain special. I just wanted to add one thing however, and that is that this book is not only just for girls, my father read it and loved it, and so did my brother. Certain scenes like when Francie goes fishing with her father are drop dead hilarious. This book is a must read for all, old and young, female and male."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have read &quot; A Tree Grows In Brooklyn&quot; over and over again.When things in my own life seem too difficult,I read about the life of Francie Nolan and realize I can overcome any problem with the same determination that Francie and her family had. All the characters were good,from the strong-willed mother,the weak dreamer of a father, to the loving but promiscuous aunt. Francie was my favorite character of all,she was able to overcome the adversity in her life through sheer dtermination and the gift of learning. She learned from everyone around her and the harsh enviroment in which she lived. I would recommend this book anyone who likes coming of age stories.I have read &quot;A Tree GrowsI have read &quot;A Tree GrowsI have read &quot;A Tree Growsin"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I thought that A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was similar in so many ways to Angela's Ashes. I enjoyed comparing them as I read. Mainly, I thought that A Tree Grows in Brooklyn had a more hopeful spin than Angela's Ashes, but that Frank McCourt was more poetic in his writing than Betty Smith. If you have read one of these two books, I definitely recommend reading the other, too. It makes for a really interesting comparitive read!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I was in the seventh grade when I first read a &quot;Tree Grows In Brooklyn&quot;. At the young age that I was, I still knew I had read a book that had changed my life or at least the way I looked at things. This is a book that will make you smile and say thats me! And by time your done with it you will find that a little bit of it is a part of you. Since I first read it I have tried to find as many books as a can that Betty Smith has written. I have suceeded in finding only two, &quot;Maggie Now&quot; and &quot;A Joy In the Mourning&quot;. I have poured over these novels and dread the day that there will be know more left to find. Reading one her books has become to me like sitting down and being very content and confortable. I have had the previlge of reading many good books and understanding them. But there are none as good as reading The Tree for the first time."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Anyone who is lucky enough to read this wonderful book is sure to love it. The Nolan family lives in a poor neighborhood of Brooklyn at the turn of the century. Although their mother, Katie, works hard, sometimes they can barely scrape up enough money for food. For the Nolans everyday life is a challenge. But, everyday they wake up with a new strength, looking for what the new day will bring. Francie, whom the book mainly focuses on, is the oldest. she is very imaginative and smart, and learns a lot about her self over the course of the book. As Francie and her younger brother, Neeley grow older the world around them changes rapidly, as do they. This book is an excellent book about change and the relationships between family members."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I was in college, I discovered that a neighbor of mine ALSO considered &quot;Tree&quot; to be her favorite book. We have been best friends still after many years. I have shared this book with friends and lovers who in turn have shared it with their friends and families. The &quot;Tree&quot; continues to grow. I recently found a library-bound edition to replace my old, dog-eared, lent-out-in-perpetua paperback. I wanted something durable to pass on to my kids someday -- kids who will no doubt grow up with Shakespeare, a pilfered Bible and Francie."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"this book should be read not only by women but by men alike. the story follows a young girl &lt;francie&gt; and her childhood in brooklyn. the characters are amazing, the story beautiful. read this book, i highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"One of the only books I've read twice! I read this book in the ninth grade and again in my 30's. It's a book I've always cherished. The characters are lovable and believable. An excellent story of growing up with too little. The apple of her charismatic drunken father's eye, pitied by her mother, Francie is an every day hero. Her parents try their dreadful best to give their children more than they had. You want to hate them but you can't. She is a piece of everyone we know. A young girl who is alone and loves to read to escape the life & circumstances she has little control over. So many who read this book feel that the book was written about them. I mentor an inner-city student who I will definately pass this book onto. It offers hope that no matter how we start out in life we can all survive and achieve. Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger! A great book for teens."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book has so many pearls of wisdom. It's very simply written, so do not expect this to be a typical NYT bestseller like the one you read last week. I believe this book was written in the '40s, and although much of the vernacular in the book is obviously of a different period in time, it has a timeless and universal appeal. I haven't even finished it yet, but have already decided, enough with the library version, I want my own copy so that I can use the advice it offers later on in life. Don't miss this one, and make sure you tell your friends about it, so that they can come and thank you later, and you can say &quot;I told you so&quot;."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This novel is as much a snapshot of the first twenty years of Brooklyn's twentieth century as it is a book about a family that anyone can sympathize with and relate to. This is Francie Nolan's story yet at the same time, through this girl, we become part of her family and part of her world. Betty Smith writes with such detail that I felt like I had lived the life she wrote for Francie and as I ate up the pages in between my first meeting with Francie up until I said good-bye to her as a grown-up, I was certain that I shared a special bond with her even though our worlds are years and states away. Not in the least a disappointment."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I found the book very good at an 8th grade level. I had to read it for history class and many people enjoyed it. It was a great subject for our class because we are studying early 1900s. It was great in detail of the problems and impoverished life of many immigrant families in New York. The only problem I found, was that it was so detailed that it became a little boring at times, or that the detail confused me. If you want to read a good book about a teen girl in the early 1900s, read this. Its a great book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have only read up to Book One so far of A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, but so far enjoy it.

Read a tree grows in brooklyn to find out!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I just completed reading this book for my monthly book review group. I really wanted to give the book five stars, and the only reason I didn't was because when I first started reading it, I had a hard time staying with it through the first few chapters. Once I got into the book, I couldn't put it down. I think perhaps Betty Smith was ahead of her time in her writing. The book had mistakes, but they were few and far between. I thought Smith did an excellent job of portraying her characters and I felt a warm connection to each one of them. When Smith describes how the family lived in poverty and the buying coal for the stove, I remembered my own childhood and the hard times my own family had. I recommend this book to anyone. Francie will win your heart, your respect, your sympathy and well...there's not much more to say, I really loved the book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The world seen through the eyes of a child in Brooklyn. Many people have seen the movie which was excellent. The book however takes you from the courtship of the Francie's parents until Francie is a grown woman making her way in the world. The book is a piece of literature that will be read long past our life time. Read it and then read it again. It is nothing less than a masterpiece."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"If you are looking for a straightforward plot, this book is not for you. This is a beautiful novel, but beware, it requires more patience than others do. I can understand the complaints of some readers, in that the &quot;story goes nowhere&quot;. In a sense, this book is like a written photograph of the life of Francie, from the time she is 11 until she goes off to college. Betty Smith created her character and her environment and started crafting a tale about her life in exquisite detail. I enjoyed the &quot;mundane&quot; explanations and descriptions of what she sees or does in her everyday life. I have never been to Brooklyn, but i bet the author is extremely accurate in all her depictions, both of place and people. There is a very sweet, almost innocent touch in her writing style, something i have observed in other writers of her generation. In summary, a wonderful book that is a breath of fresh air in today's literature."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book three times already. The first time I read it I was in the fourth grade and didn't really get it. But in the seventh grade I read it again and now it's one of my favorite books. It was so realistic. I loved Francie, but hated Katie because she favored Neeley."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I must admit I didn't want to read it. I had to for school. I was horribly bored with it in the beginning but as it moves it's very, very good. Both girls and boys can relate to it. I related to a lot of what Francie said. However, Neeley is definately my favorite :)"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Im 17 years old and I bought his book and read it in a day and i loved it completely. It is one of the best books i have ever read. Francie Nolan has deeply impacted my life and i dont think it will ever be the same. I see things more clearly than i have ever seen them in my life. It is a truly enjoyable book that everybody should read!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"&quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; is my favorite book.

I would recommend this book to anyone looking for good reading around the age of 13 or older."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I was trying to catch up on my classics when I ran across this book. I can honestly say that it was one of the richest, most fulfilling books I have EVER read. A book that truely has stood the test of time, &quot;A Tree Grow in Brooklyn&quot; will always have a place in my heart. Exelently portrayed characters leave someone that every young woman can identify with."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was a beautiful book! I am 13 years old, and I had the obligation of reading it for high school summer work, so when I first looked at it, I thought &quot;Oh, this book is going to be boring.&quot; Boy, was I wrong! As soon as I started reading it, I just couldn't put it down. It's not filled with great action or adventure, but it is so interesting and well-written that I was pulled into the story, and I didn't want to stop reading it. Now that I finished it, I read it two more times, each time being just as good. I truly recommend this book to everyone!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"THIS IS ONE BOOK THAT I KNEW THAT I SHOULD HAVE READ LONG BEFORE NOW. IT HAS BEEN ON MY MUST-READ LIST FOR A LONG TIME. THIS IS DEFINITELY A BOOK THAT ALL YOUNG WOMEN SHOULD READ. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS SET IN THE EARLY 1900'S, SOME THINGS STILL APPLY TO OUR TIMES. IT WAS ALSO INTERESTING TO COMPARE LIFESTYLES THEN AND NOW. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Many years ago, my seventh-grade English teacher gave me the combined set of this book and &quot;Maggie Now.&quot; (I wish &quot;Maggie Now&quot; was still in print too.) This story made a great impression on me way back then. Even though the place, time, and circumstances were different than my own life, the author somehow captured emotions and feelings very much like my own. I am ordering this book for me and my daughter."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This novel is one of the best that I have ever read. I first read this novel as a child and still enjoy it each time I read it.It is one of the few novels that I make a point of reading at least once a year. Each time I read it, I come away with a feeling of hope and sadness. Hope because Smith expresses the concept that any dream is possible as long as you apply yourself, no matter how bad your circumstances are. I also have a feeling of sadness that the novel has ended. But I guess that is a sign of a truely great and timeless novel. I were to pick 5 of my favorite novels of all time, this book would definately make the list. The characters are timeless. Even though it was written in 1943, it still can be read today and have the same impact. Smith's characterization captures the feelings of a child growing into a woman. It also gives the reader a sense of hope. It expresses the feeling that a person can a accomplish anything that he or she wants. One of the best passages proclaims that Francie is a reader. I take this saying to heart. As a true reader, I find this novel to be a must in anyone's library. Anyone reading this review, should do themselves a favor and read a novel that will capture one's heart and soul."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"i fell in an anti-reading mood for a while in 8th grade, but a lot of people encouraged me to read because it really helps in writing. i went to the library 3 days ago and copied down some titles that incoming freshmen were required to read before fall. &quot;a tree in brooklyn&quot; was the first one on the list that still had plenty of copies on the shelves (i think the thickness discouraged some people). i opened it up that night and started reading; it's really interesting! some mysteries of life (some basic things like laughing in a new environment) are explained and in such a way so it isn't boring at all."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book in high school, and remember it to this day. There is also a well-known movie made from the book which follows the story closely. The book is the touching tale of a family with 12 children, much spirit and love, and at times very little money. It's an inspiring, very moving tale that shows how determination, hard work and the love of your family can get you through anything, good times and bad."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The thing about \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is that it is inconsistent in terms of quality. The plot is AT TIMES interesting, and other times so dull I barely even bothered to read what was on the page. The writing is in fact incredibly readable, but that is only because it lacks depth at times and is extraordinarily simplistic.For the most part, the story of the Nolan's is interesting. Francie seems to be a character that falls into a template or a pattern - she is a reader, she is somewhat weak, and she is an intelligent child. These traits have rather become cliches in main characters, but the point is almost irrelevant here. The remainder of the Nolan family is fascinating, but more often than not, we are only given Francie, which is both disappointing and also boring at times. Things do get quite repetitive.There's not much to be said about the writing. It's hardly the most beautiful writing I've ever encountered, nor does it have the greatest consistency or flow, but it reads simple. For readers who don't want to dive into a thick book that is also complex, this would probably be a great choice.The best parts of this book are the little things. The \\"should-be-great\\" parts of the book are merely \\"okay\\". While the overall story is grand and impressive, at times the book and the writing simply stall, giving a few pages of words that really need not be there. Editing, perhaps, would have helped.On the whole, this book can be recommended, though be warned that it may not suit those in search of good writing, and also that it stops at time, or rambles. It is thoroughly readable, though, and overall good.3 1/2 stars - Recommended."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A simple story of a seemingly unimportant life that is inspiring and enjoyable. A must have addition to your library of classics."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This novel is the detailed account of young Francie Nolan's life from birth to about age 17. While the story is quite poignant at times, the amount of detail is really just too much. I felt like Smith gave a breakdown of every meal and purchase made from 1901 to 1918! Yikes! While these descriptions did give the reader a sense of the desperation, hunger, humiliations, etc. that the characters faced on a daily basis, I felt that it detracted from the story after a while as I grew accustomed (and perhaps calloused) to their misfortunes. The characters were very well developed, particularly Francie, Johnny (her pathetic ne'er-do-well of a father), and Katie (the hardworking and often under-appreciated mother). Smith did an excellent job of presenting them as multi-faceted people, full of inconsistencies and indulgences, without passing judgment on them. The relationships between the characters were also touching and true, the emotions real and understandable. Smith gives poverty a true sense of dignity. For this, she is to be commended. Keeping in mind also when this book was written, Smith blazed some new trails for the frank discussion of women's sexual identities and labor inequities. By today's standards, these things may not seem significant, but Smith undoubtedly was ahead of her time and helped clear the way for women writers to follow. So, while this book is not one of my favorites, it is worthy of a read, more for historical relevance than pleasure, at least for me."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I had been looking forward to reading this for some time. I was disappointed and I wanted to love it. It was draggy and depressing."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is the first time I have purchased a book that has stated \\"good\\" condition. I usually get excellent or like new. It's rather old and the pages fall out as I use it but it works for me as long as all the pages are there and I can get through a classic I've always wanted to read.

The book was in great condition and I received it on time."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This timeless classic of Francie Nolan, growing up poor in turn-of-the century Brooklyn, should be required reading for every American girl. How can anyone not love this book, or its touching portrait of a young girl's coming of age?"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the story of Francie Nolan, her brother Neeley and all of the people who live with them in Brooklyn. It is sort of a documentary of Francie's growing up. This book has so much detail and excitement that it is hard not to understand, although it may seem complicated when you first pick it up. This is a good book for people age 10 and up, and is the perfect book to buy for the ummer- it would be ideal to bring to a cottage or on a camping trip. Altogether, this is a fantastic book that you don't want to miss."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I like this book, because it tells the truth about the way things are (and were). Francie is a lot like that tree in the book. raised in poor conditions with a dreaming dad and a severe mom, she struggles through the slums and evetually into an early adulthood."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Many years ago, I was staying with my aunt and hunting for something to read. She handed me this book and told me how much she had liked it. I started it and time stood still----I was transported to Brooklyn and the world of the characters---and I was very sad when the book ended and I had to leave that world! I wish this book had a sequel. I've read it many times since, with the same effect every time. If you've never had a first reading of this wonderful book, I envy you! You are in for such a treat."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is a foundation for all others. The author is a master - she has captured a life and preserved it forever for us with her words -- the life is not that of a stranger or just a randome little girl -- there is a piece of every American whose roots stretch back to poor immigrants. Many, many timeless quotes are seeded throughout the novel. I highly recommend this book to all readers!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. It is so depressing and made me so sad that I wish I'd never read it. (The mother's rejection of Francie while deeply loving the little brother still haunts me, probably because I see the same situation occurring in a child who is close to me.) On the other hand, it must be very well written to invoke such deep emotions for me."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A book worthy of praise for its historical detail, although for me the writing wasn't top-notch."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I recently read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn for the first time. I loved it. If I had to compare it to another book to someone else, I would say it compares to Angela's Ashes, though I enjoyed this one more.I did not like this particular book though because it has rough cut pages where the each page edge is different. I just don't care for that, and had I known that this edition was like that, I would have bought a different copy.But you can't go wrong with the book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Francie begins this story as an eleven-year-old, living in poverty in Brooklyn. Her father is an alcoholic who takes part-time work as a singing waiter. Her mother cleans houses to bring in most of their money. Francie and her ten-year-old brother, Neely, help out by collecting bits of scrap metal and other valuables to sell to the junk man for recycling. The family lives in a tiny apartment, is looked down on by many others and often they go hungry when money doesn't stretch far enough to buy food.Despite all of the hardships in her life, though, Francie is nearly overwhelmed by the beauty of the life she is living. She loves her father's singing voice, and she loves the things her mother is able to cook with their meager supply of food. She finds peace in listening to her parents talk late at night, and joy in reading every book she can get her hands on. She is happy in the way only a child can be.As Francie grows up, she comes to find that life is often hard, and her family is less fortunate than many. She observes the sacrifices her family members make, and is called upon to make sacrifices of her own. Throughout it all, though, she never loses her determination or her love for her family and for Brooklyn.The way Francie thinks and writes is absolutely beautiful. I like how Smith captured that peculiar habit of children to see the beauty in even the worst of circumstances. I liked the beginning of this book much better than the end, though. I was eager to see Francie and her family come into some money and have an easier life, but I felt the end of the book to be a bit too happy to fit with the rest. When an entire book is about struggling and fending for yourself, it doesn't seem right when something good happens, as it did to Francie's mother, out of the blue."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is by Betty Smith. Francie is growing up in the slums of Brooklyn in the early 1900's. The book takes place from 1902 all the way through 1919. Betty Smith has a very detailed way of writing. She can take a little subject, like a rose and turn it into a two page story."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is so well written that you feel like you are living next door to the Nolans and sharing their life.You hope success finds this family, and smile when it does.I really enjoyed this wonderful classic, and will read it again someday."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"No climax, no definite plot, no villain. This book breaks the definition of a literary classic and goes off on so many tangents that the reader becomes confused as to what the entire book is actually about, not to mention Francie is a one dimensional charachter who shows little growth until the end of the book where she suddenly changes into an entirely different creature. The novel would have been better if it was solely about Katie!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am usually fond of mid-twentieth century classics such as this, so when I was assigned to read it for my ninth grade english class, I looked forward to enjoying it. However, I was disappointed to find that it is a horrible and tedious book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I recently read this book for my English class at school. I have enjoyed every other book we have been required to read; however, I strongly disliked this book. From the first chapter I lost interest in the ornate, seemingly endless details. On several occasions I noted incorrect grammar in the book, and even misspellings! Never before have I seen such a poorly written book. I do not recommend this book. I would not call this book a classic."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is the kind of book that has poor grammer, misspelled words, and is too long. Often times authors make their books drag on and on and on. I feel that is what the author of this book did. I would suggest that you find another book to read and not waist your time."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a book I actually hated. I felt it was meant to show &quot;what growing up in a poor Catholic family in that time period in Brooklyn was like.&quot; That's my family background, and it just struck me as some upper-class WASP who beat it out of the brownstones down South at a young age's snobbish look down. The &quot;plain&quot; daughter got sent to a convent? The daughter who was moving up financially sent her kids to an Episcopalian school? The mother told her daughter it would have been a beautiful thing if she'd lost her virginity to a guy she wasn't going to see again, although wearing her hair down was bad? This is probably my least favorite book ever (I finished it because it was a school assignment.)"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a great book. I'd recommend it to people of all ages. It should be required reading for everyone! An excellent book from cover to cover."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is the most tedious novel I have ever read. Not only does it spend too much time with detail, it seems to drag on FOREVER. A complete waste of time. Smith spends so much time on character development yet none of the characters are interesting or intelligent. And it never ends! If you are suicidal, do not read this book--it's too depressing. This is the first book I have actually hated. When I read it I daydreamed at least 50 times a page. I though I would never finish. This book is for sensative, emotional girls who cried during Titanic. Boys who like Star Wars and Pulp Fiction will want to burn this book after reading ten pages. Trust me. A lot of people like it because they can &quot;relate&quot; to it. But that's not what literature is about. Literature is about telling an interesting story in a manner that provokes thought, not about spending three-quarters of the book getting people &quot;attached&quot; to the characters and then at the end put them through a tragedy that makes sensative people cry and delute themselves into thinking the book was &quot;powerful&quot; and &quot;moving&quot;. Take my word for it, this book is wordy and poorly though out."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The novel, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, was (in my opinion) not insightful, and completely lacked any reality needed to convince the reader of the author's position.The stories of the protagonist making up the entire novel may be uplifting to some, but those crave action or more reality are in for a snore. Of course, while some books really do a decent job of conveying their message without either of the two, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn not once persuaded me of the author's point of view.The novel was written in hopes of inspiring people by leaving out most of the details we need to hear to really understand what life in the slums is like. If you do not want to hear those details then read the book; for everyone else, however, I strongly suggest you stay away from A Tree Grows In Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I hate this book and wish I was not forced to read it. I fell asleep a good 15-20 times trying to get through this horrible novel. If you have to read it, I feel sorry for you. This is the kind of book that makes you want to go play in traffic. At least that Johnny dude dies. I wish they all would have.

Since then, I have fallen in love with the book. I simply like Betty Smith's profound and elegant style of writing; it was particularly effective since I couldn't put the book down. But often, after reading a few pages, I had to put it down to think about life: where I was going, what was my purpose on this earth, etc. These questions have been clear in my mind since then. I recommand this book grandly and I hope you'll love it as much as I did."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book showed me what it was like to grow up in a low-income family in Brooklyn.

A GREAT book!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am 13 years old, and i've already read this book 3 times!! The length and depressing periods could NOT in the slightest hold this story back!! I was amazed by the way that a full grown author like Betty Smith could show so perfectly what adolescent girls feel and think, and the anecdotes in the story stay with you forever and ever, The simple events like going shopping and searching for scrap metal makes being poor seem much more interesting than middle-class life, by FAR. I think every teenager should read this book for PLEASURE because it made me think in a totally different way than I ever had before."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is one of the best books ever read. I believe that Betty Smith wrote this story very much like her own life. She may not have lived in Brooklyn, but she did live during the same time period. I believe it paralleled her own life. What she wrote was fabulous. Her uses of words is wonderful. She's one of my favorite authors now, and that says a lot.This book is about the life of a tiny girl in Brooklyn. She grows up with her brother, mother, father, and a baby sister in the poor section of Brooklyn. She grows up very well. She refuses to do badly in anything. She has a spark for life, a zest for it. She works hard to get the things she wants, including going to a good school, elementary and college. I admire her perseverence."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I'm not as eloquent as the other readers here who have so enthusiastically recommended this book, but let me tell you; the surprise at Francie's graduation made me cry like a baby. Even as I write this I'm getting misty eyed.(Don't tell anybody I said that!)"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn..........read this and you will undoubtedly be able able to see a certain sweetness in life that might have once gone unnoticed. Betty Smith's poignancy and bravado breathe life into the story's central character, the utterly sweet, daring and soulful Francie. Francie, the little girl to whom we can all identify...for in some way, no matter how small,parts of her live inside us all. I first read this on entering my teens on my Mother's recommendation and we have delighted in the joy of this rich classic ever since. I collect as many lovingly used editions as I can find.........although I wonder how anybody could ever part with a Betty Smith novel! I own a few old copies of Maggie Now, with which I have been tormenting myself for more than a decade......I am waiting for the right moment to indulge, for although I know I shall read it time and time again.........that first anticipation of turning page one in a Betty Smith book, holds such excitement!

Now, at age twenty, I am reading it again for a book review and have found that I have a deeper understanding of its meaning. Francie is like the inner child in all of us, wanting to be greater than anyone thinks she can. She rose up out of poverty by her own thinking and has shown us that we can do whatever we set our mind to. Her mother Katie was a very strong character who gave us an insite into a mother's love for her children. At the end, I loved the symbolizm where Francie says good-bye to her old self, the next little girl to take her place. And always, there is the tree, the one that will never die. To me, that tree stood for the continuation of life itself - it will always go on."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I loved this book. It touched me.

I was dismayed because it was long and looked excruciatingly boring. Inside the cover, he wrote that I would someday enjoy it. He couldn't have been more correct. I have read and reread this brilliant book, about the passage of Francie into adulthood through the struggles of poverty. I have never experienced anything like what she did, but I felt as if I could be her. Everyone must read this book. It is a timeless classic."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This story is so true and one of my favorites. Meet Francie, the daughter of Katie and Johnny Nolan, who don't have much future in store for their intelligent and bookworm daughter. You learn about Francie, the so honestly true story. It's amazing that it isn't your story. The slums of Brooklyn come to life in this touching story. If you did not enjoy this book you have no passion for life, or no feelings for those who do exsist but you push them out of your mind."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"So much will be left unsaid about my love for &quot;Tree&quot;. I'm only 16 years old and I was introduced to the Noland family 2 years ago. This is a book that will bring tears to my eyes, a smile on my face, and countless hours of being locked up in my room imagining that I am living in a flat in Brooklyn- 1917. Thank you Betty Smith for bringing this book into my life. -Sarah Homan"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Turning 16 I went to California to stay there for a year as an exchange student. My English wasn't very good and the first thing I had to do in my junior-English-class was to read the &quot;Tree&quot;. I had a hard time surviving the introduction and getting on was even harder. But even though I failed the first five or six quizzes on the book (we did one quizz a day) I somehow started to understand the language and to sympathize with the Nolans. Francie Noland became my dear friend during my first two months in California and my English got better and better turning the pages of Betty Smith's wonderful novel. The essencial thing that made Francie special to me was the way my English teacher pronounced MY name, Franzi, that sounds differend in German and in English. When I came back to Berlin I couldn't get a German copie of the &quot;Tree&quot; which I thought was terrible for me. I searched the libraries and found an old English copie which I read instantly. I missed the Nolans and the 1900 New York.

Being 13 years of age, I am going into the eight grade, and therefore, must read four books over the summer for school. Well, a friend of mine suggested I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, and, my being a skepticist, I said &quot;Yeah, right.&quot; &quot;Yeah&quot; is right! This is one of the best books I've read since I was five years old when I started to read. It is, as I've said, negatively veritable, and I am a great fan and avid reader of real, in-your-face publications. Usually I read macabre, gory mystery, and basically ghoulish stuff, but when I read this book, my point of view did a total 180*. Macabre may be physically gory, but wonderful, realistic books like A Tree Grows in Brooklyn are emotionally and mentally &quot;gory&quot;. Emotional depression is, at least I think, the backbone of marvelous, expressive writing; I believe that this book is one of the only of its kind to provide that backbone in a way that separates it from unreal story-telling.

I thought that it would be a drag reading it because it was so long, but I didn't really take a long finishing the book. I liked this book because it was very realistic.

It also is what they call a real page turner.If I were to tell someone of a good book to read this would definately be the one I recomend to them"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a timeless classic. This is a book that warrants more than one reading, it is a keeper, with a special place of it's own. The metaphor of the tree that kept surviving is highly appropriate and mirrors the life of the novel's heroine, Francie Nolan. This tree, not unlike Francie herself, has been subject to harsh conditions, but it continued to grow and bloom. Both the tree and Francie are able to rise above the adversity and thrive.The characters are lively and real. The main character, Francie, who is articulate and bright, desperately seeks affection from her mother. Katie Nolan, is a mother that can not recripricate that love to her daughter. Instead, Katie directs her energy and affection to her son. Neeley. Francie is drawn to her father, a local drunkard, who pays her much attention. The reader expereinces the pain of growing and reconciling her relationships with her family.Francie Nolan is a survivor. The reader will follow Francie as she faces numerous challenges and diversions in life. We watch as she learns and becomes resourceful. We struggle with her during the hard and traumatic times in her life. Most importantly, we see her resiliancy and perserverance shine through.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a novel that should be read more than once in a lifetime. It's poignant message speaks volumes to all readers. I encourage you to read this book and share it with others."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was the 2nd time I've read this classic book. I was always held within the pages of intimacy of interest."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I used this for a book club and it was an excellent choice. I wasn't sure it was going to be a success but the members enjoyed it. There are so many controversial topics and differences in lifestyle from that era to today that it really facilitates great discussions. The questions in the back of the book that are provided for use in book clubs were great."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am so sad to say good bye to the characters in this book. It was a great read. I loved seeing the little girl in Brooklyn grow up to be a strong young woman. I loved the message of the tree. . . that beauty can grow and overcome the harshest of circumstances."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I had been meaning to read this classic coming-of-age story for years, and I'm so glad I finally did. Completely fell in love with young Francie Nolan and her family, immigrants who strived to make a better life for their children in poverty-stricken Brooklyn in the early 1900s. Heartbreaking and hopeful at the same time, this book had me both smiling and fighting back tears many times. As I reached the final pages, I slowed down my reading, because I just didn't want to say good-bye to the characters. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"As is stated in this book's forward, this story isn't about one thing. There isn't one topic, one climax, one point. It meanders quietly, yet poignantly through the growing up years of a young girl living in the poverty stricken tenements of 1912 Brooklyn, NY. To describe the plot is impossible if one wants to do it justice. There's just too much that would have to be left out and that that would be a shame. Suffice it to say it keeps one's attention to the elimination of everything else.Upon research, I found it is actually an autobiography of the author (which makes it even more moving and unforgettable) who, upon request turned it into a story. I also learned while it became a huge best-seller when originally published in 1942, it was also hugely controversial. People didn't want to see poverty and injustice, reality in their stories. Looking in that mirror could be just too uncomfortable. Honesty is fine - up to a point - but truth is sometimes awfully hard to stomach. Taking from the book:\\" Honesty is casting bright light on your own experience; truth is casting it on the experiences of all\\"And, that's what Ms. Smith did so well. In her story we see bits of ourselves, for good or bad. We relate to the too-skinny girl who doesn't fit in. We remember the cruel children, the harsh teachers, the humiliating situations that coat the human experience. We also remember the joys that make childhood magical, the dreams that make growing up an adventure, no matter one's social class. Francie's life is filled with life - humanities. It's a story of living among the desperately poor through the eyes of one who knows nothing else. But, lest one think it is depressing and dark, it's also a story of love, of family, of the infallible will to do better in a country where better is always promised but sometimes disappoints. It's innocence shines through even while its hideousness is obvious. It is a quiet, heart-wrenching, soul-felt, yet ultimately hopeful story. It accepts weakness but inspires greatness. It admits ugliness while searching for beauty. It acknowledges great despair while encouraging great hope. All with a clear, simple voice of an 11 year old girl"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I love this story and I plan to make my girls read it as soon as they are old enough.

I knew it featured an urban family in 1900 NYC, and my understanding stopped there. One day Audible.com had a \\"classics\\" sale and I picked this up and stashed it away on my MP3 player. Eventually I listened. In short orded I double-bought this magnificent novel for my Kindle and read along as I listen. Then I shared my Kindle edition with all my friends and family, who were equally impressed. There is no stopping this book. I delivers history like no textbook ever will, and human insight, depth and drama, that no film ever could."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"An easy and heartfelt read, so well written. So relevant across all times, to all sorts of people. Francie is an amazing character that anyone can relate to"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's a pleasure to review this book on the centennary of its story-time (the book begins in 1912). Yes, this is a coming-of-age story, but it is also a portrait of urban poverty that speaks directly to the present. Tales of kids collecting the lead from liquor bottlenecks and cigarette-pack foil to redeem along with the family rags at the junk man's--an extra penny for a pinch, for girls who can stand it--sheds light on the way we live now, and on what might yet lie ahead for us, as people once again start salvaging fat from restaurants (now to run their cars, rather than to make soap, as back then).The characters are surprisingly bold. The emotions of sexual desire, exploitation, pleasure, pain, and trust are explicitly portrayed, without prurience, and it is refreshing, compared to the present, that the urges are shown to stem from the desire to procreate and also to be thwarted by their own success! There is no prettying up of either women or men, children or aged, and the 'deadbeat' father referred to in other reviews is a man of talent and longing as well as weakness.If it weren't for his complexity, and the main character's loyal brother, the male sex might seem the weaker in this book, but Betty Smith was bigger than that. And if, as she herself said, sometimes what happens in this book is what should have happened, not what did happen, her realism and grit are more than sufficient to carry the day.I can only imagine how much fun it must be for New Yorkers, let alone Brooklynites, to read this; but for all of us this is a book that zooms on the most fundamental plot: how people manage to live."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I only first heard of this story years and years ago because of the movie and I've seen it several times.

The tree symbolizes Francie,as the tree grows in the worst conditions yet there's beauty within. Just like Francie."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book appeared on an optional eighth grade reading list for me -- 45 years ago. And, I'm very sorry I waited so long to become acquainted with Betty Smith's masterpiece. If nothing else, Francie Nolan is a contemporary of my grandparents, and it would have been a great way to start conversations that might have let me learn more about what it was like to grow up in poor immigrant families in small-town Wisconsin.Beyond that, though, this is a truly compelling story of a girl's coming of age under less-than-ideal circumstances, buoyed mainly by her own strength of character. Smith's sparse writing style took a bit for me to get used to, and it helped reading her biography and learning that she was primarily a dramatist; she prefers to show her readers what's going on and leave them to their own interpretations, rather than simply telling them.The latter chapters weren't quite as rewarding, even though it's comforting to see that Francie's hard work is finally going to pay off. The real meat of the story occurs in her formative years ending with her own eighth grade graduation. Even so, these were not characters I was prepared to leave when the book ends. And, while I believe I understood the adults better for having waited 45 years to tackle this book. I'd heartily recommend it to anyone 12 and up who wants to read a wonderful story of a girl's growing up."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"the author painted a clear picture of New York City and described the way of in the 1930s and growing up in the area"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Very good book, but is a slow read.

The hopefullness underpining all the struggles of the mther and daughter explains alot about the immigrant experience at the turn of the last century."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is one of those literary classics I'd always known about, but never got around to reading till I was an adult. This book was well worth the wait. Perhaps I loved and enjoyed it even more as an adult instead of a teenager. It has all the hallmarks of the classic fiction I love--well-developed, rich, complex characters you feel like you're friends with by the end, a rich backstory for each character, wonderful historical details, a well-described historical backdrop that yet doesn't overwhelm the reader by constantly calling attention to the past era, an episodic structure instead of being plot-centric, the now-underused third-person omniscient POV, a slower pace that develops the story bit by delicious bit instead of racing from Point A to Point B within 288 pages, and a story focused more on characters than stakes, action, and some kind of formulaic three-part act.While in many respects, the world Francie grows up in has advantages over the modern world (a slower pace of life, valuing family more, kids who love reading from an early age, understanding the value of money), in many ways, I'm glad to know this is history. It was so emotionally difficult to read about things like the treatment of Francie's neighbor Joanna, a 17-year-old single mom who dared to go out in public with her baby and show her love; Francie being shamed out of the special gift of left-handedness by her own mother, and never questioning why her natural inclination was wrong; a doctor and nurse who think poor children are sub-human; teachers who mistreat students simply for being poor; and hard-working people having a hard time catching a financial break.Initially I was kind of disappointed that the pace picked up so much later in the book, going through important historical events and long stretches of time so relatively quickly, but I guess that it makes sense, since Francie was a teenager by then. Time seems to pass more slowly when we're kids, and then passes more quickly as we get older. I do wish there'd been more coverage of things like the influenza epidemic and World War I, but the purpose of the story wasn't to be a historical epic. It's a Bildungsroman about a poor girl and her family as they experience life during some historic times. The only really negative moment I had in the book was the part where Francie had an instalove of sorts with a young soldier. It just didn't seem to fit with her well-established character. I was glad when that storyline was over.It really strikes me how a book like this would have a hard time getting published these days, because it's so slow-paced and quiet, focused on character over action, doesn't really have a plot structure, Part II is the backstory of Francie's parents and grandparents, tells more than shows, and doesn't really have any stakes other than the Nolans wanting to get out of poverty. And yet those are the things that make it such a classic and wonderful book. This is the type of book that wasn't written for people with a ten-minute attention span. It was written for people who enjoy a slow, well-crafted story that takes us through the ups and downs of life with beautifully-written characters. It's not meant for people who want to be hooked in the first line or who won't read anything that doesn't have a lot of action or high stakes. I think this is going to be one of those books I remember in detail years later, as though I just read it for the first time yesterday."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I would love to teach a literature class on historical fiction that was actually written a long time ago. It's so interesting to see how writers from a particular period saw an era that came before them.For example, The Last of the Mohicans was written in 1826, but takes place in the 1750s. To Kill A Mockingbird was written during the Civil Rights Movement, but takes place in the Depression. And now, I just finished A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. It's a great book that holds up incredibly well, but one of my favorite things is how the novel is a view of life in 1912 that's written from the perspective of someone in 1947. You can see both eras--the one being written about as well as the beliefs of the writer who came later.This novel is an absolute work of genius. It's completely addictive, beautifully written, funny and sad. The characters are so real that I felt as if I knew them, and while they don't always do what's right, they are heartbreakingly human and vulnerable. A truly fantastic read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Have wanted to read this since high school. Now I'm 41! Almost forgot that I was reading a classic! Please do yourself a favor and read this one!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"To say I was pleasantly surprised by this book is an understatement. I was looking to get out of my reading comfort zone as a 48-year-old man. It more than lives up to its billing as a classic. I draw a parallel between it and \\"The Good Earth\\" by Pearl S. Buck. It just says so much about so many things over the course of the story (roughly set in the years 1900-1918).The commonality shared by this book and \\"The Good Earth\\" -- besides being a story that is told over a period of years -- is family and enduring times of hardship and poverty through hard work. Whereas Wang Lung (in \\"The Good Earth\\") was connected to the land (in China), young, lonely and intelligent Francie Nolan is ambivalently connected to her neighborhood in Manhattan.Both books show the cruelty of fate and other people (especially the young in this book) to the poor and downtrodden and both serve to educate the reader to different times. There is also a lot a dynamic perception of family in both.I'm used to more immediate, dialogue- and action-driven stories and wanting to change that is what drove me to this book.At times the story appears as if there is no plot or trajectory, but that is where Betty Smith's craft took over. All of the seemingly disparate events depicted over time fit together like a jigsaw, building and enhancing characterization of its literary denizens along the way. It leaves the reader filled with hope and the feeling of love -- again, something I'm not normally gushing about. Which says a lot about the quality of the book. It's filled with truth.If you are into superficial action books, stay away from it. If you want to look at a unique time and place and enlarge your literary boundaries, then by all means buy it. I don't think one needs to be a young student to get the most out of it, though it serves well in that capacity. I think one just should want to look into humanity and a different time and place (and the more things change, the more they stay the same). To be clear, I never thought I'd find a book of this kind nearly as good as \\"The Good Earth.\\" This is right up there. Truly inspiring and poignant. I highly recommend it. It will stick with you."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Written in the third person, this certainly is Francie's story. The reader gets drawn into the poverty culture of the immigrants of Brooklyn during the years prior to WWI. The characteristics of the tree matches the strengths of the women especially Francie, her mother, Aunts and grandmother. It is a well written story, although perhaps a bit sterotypical. A story of courage and determination. A good read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Even though this book was written in 1943, I found it to be relevant today.

By saying that I mean that some of the classics we have read in the past have just been hard reads - hard to understand and hard to get into. This books writing was smooth and I could follow the story easily. The book is centered around Francie and her family in the back drop of World War One. Told from the perspective of Francie, I quickly was engrossed in the absolute and utter level of poverty they were.Food is a big theme in this book and while they had very little, Francie's mom Katie could work wonders with it. There is always stale bread and crushed pies, and bone marrow to spread on bread as a treat after the bone has been used in soups. Meat was a rare treat. This book reminded me a bit of The Book Thief as far as the poverty and making the best of what they have.I enjoyed the theme of the book, yet found it for the most part non eventful. The book goes page by page through Francie's life, what she sees in her parents (her dad drinks too much and her mom works hard cleaning homes to make ends meet). You see Francie is school and you learn her love for books and for learning. The book carries you through Francie's life and through this I see comparable to the tree that grows outside their home... the tree seems to represent Francie - strong and yet with struggles, continuing to grow.A Tree Grows In Brooklyn was published in 1943. The book sold 300,000 copies in the first six weeks after it was published. How amazing is that! I find it astonishing that I have never read this book before.

The prose is clear, simple, and truthful, but there are phrases in it that give off beauty--like the passages that describe Francie's imaginings, or her simple awe at the simplest things. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is truly like life.I grew so attached to the characters that when Francie worked to gain a measure of her mother's love for Neeley, I felt my heart hurt the way hers would have. When Johnny died, I cried (and still do, even after all these years).

Each time I flip through, I draw new connections from the story about the development of America's white immigrant population, women's roles in society, and the advantages and challenges that sprout from public education.

Very well written, with great descriptions and complete thoughts."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"\\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn,&quot; by Betty Smith, is a wonderful example of teenage hardships and a girl's struggle in her coming of age. Francie Nolan serves as an illustration of these hardships. In the novel, Francie is seen growing up. We are privileged to be given a window into Francies heart and the Nolan home. The novel shows Francies struggles with her family and school life, her fight to overcome the poverty that she was born into and to become a success.Francie was not born into the ideal family. The Nolans were poor, but they survived. They had love and enough money to have food, clothing and shelter. Francie's father, Johnny Nolan, was a fun-loving gentleman. Francie loved how he referred to her as his \\"prima donna,\\" and she cherished the relationship that they had. Katie Nolan, Francie's mother, was not as fun-loving as Johnny, but she loved her children and provided for them. Francie thought that she was not loved by her mother, but Katie instilled responsibility and independance in Francie, even though she did not think of this as love at the time. Katie was a very hardworking mother. Her job as a janitor kept her very busy and it gave her a very rough appearance. Neeley, Francies younger brother kept himself very busy by collecting recycling products to make a little extra money for himself and for his family.To Francie, reading and writing were the basis of life. She lived for weekend mornings when she could read, and she got so much joy out of going to the library and finding a new book. When Francie came home with a new book, she would read it on the fire-escape and indulge her active imagination. Francie applied her imagination to everyday experiences. She loved watching her neighbor get dressed up for her dates and she fantasized that the girls' dates were not coming for her, but for Francie. Francie got pleasure out of very simple and ordinary things, like her friend Frank's horse. Francie did not have an ideal school life, even though she imagined that she did. She battled solitude and loneliness throughout her school career. Her education, however did lead to better things for her.Francie's struggles in her life and her ability to endure show a strength that people long for today. Francie was able to overcome poverty, death, sexual abuse, and stress of adolescence. \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is a wonderful book that I advise every woman, regardless of age, to read.

This book is about a girl, Francie, and her growing up in a town called Brooklyn. It talks about her as a little baby and the troubles she went through (such as being a sickly little baby and having a younger brother that was liked more than she was) and it talks about her and her growing into a woman and the things she wants and the things that she has to do, the jobs that she has and her troubles with college ( i.e. getting in since she did not graduate from high school) and, to me the most important, how her family pulls together in hard times (like when there is hardly any food, how they pay bills and how they keep money) This book is truley a great book to read on a &quot;fire escape and looking out onto a tree&quot;.

Francie provides a sad, but moving description of life as she knows it and the tragedy and fortune that befalls her and her family.\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is a very hard novel to review. It's about more than just one little girl and her family.

She loves to read and longs for an education so that she can overcome the squalid conditions in which she is growing up. She is a survivor and does whatever it takes to get along in her world while having a rich life on the inside which no one else knows about. Her father is an alcoholic who causes severe financial problems for his family but still shows Francie love in a way that her serious and responsible mother never can. Her younger brother Neely is her constant companion and she loves him despite the fact that her mother favors him over Francie. This book was written during the time that my mother was growing up and yet I can relate to many of the timeless scenes in it, such as the magical moments when Francie learns to read.

But not in this case. I feel like I know these people - that I could hear Johnny singing just around the corner on his way home from work.

There are lines and images that have stayed with me for over 40 years and it just doesn't get better than that."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Readers who come to \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" looking for a fast-paced or action-packed storyline should look elsewhere: Betty Smith's perennial coming-of-age novel is more like a stroll through the forgotten alleyways and tenements of Brooklyn at the turn of the century.Influenced by Smith's work with the WPA during the Great Depression, the story ties issues of social injustice, gender, and class to a narrative of the childhood and youth of Francie Nolan, a poor girl growing up in the slums of Brooklyn. The novel is rich with vivid descriptions of tenement life, from clothing to food to the variety of ethnicities crammed together in busy Brooklyn.What's wonderful about this book is that it is accessible to all age ranges due to a cast of unique characters and has as much for the teen reader as the older reader who seeks a historical overview of the very specific period.

This book will leave you elated, sad, scared, and touched. Overall, a wonderful journey that takes us back to the early 1900s, and forces us to feel all of Francie's emotions."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have read this book more than once and I own old hardback originals as well as the recent edition.I absolutely love to read of the extremes the human spirit can endure and survive. We know now that children like Francie Nolan would be called resilient children, because they bounce back like the fabled tree growing thrugh the harsh concrete jungles of the brooklyn 'ghetto'. Unfortunately, we have way too many children who can survive such hardship with a resilient spirit.It isn't merely the storyline that is engrossing, it is the tone and voice, the narrative nuances captured by the writer, Betty Smith, that allow you to see with your mind, but identify with Francie and her plight with your heart.Even more inspiring is the triumphant spirit of this little girl under duress. It makes one proud to be human. I work in domestic violence field and I have given this gift as an inspiration to particularly challenged children and even ten and twelve year olds can appreciate A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, it becomes emotional meat for their bones and soul."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"How I wish I could have been a child like Francie Nolan! Yes, her family was poor and grief striken, but she enjoyed every day of her life! She made the good times seem magnificent and had a wonderful way of perceiving the bad times! The simpleness of her eating jello with whipped topping for the first time and the way she described that experience brought me to tears! How she craved education and new experiences! I hope from now on that when I encounter a new day that I look upon them the way Francie did! I believe that everyone experiences this book differently and that's what makes it such a jewel of literature!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book this year, my freshman year. It has been the best book I have ever read and I keep thinking about it. I think you can gather from the rest of the reviews WHY this book is so good. Just buy it, ya hear? You won't regret it one bit!!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Francie Nolan is a character who will long be remembered by anyone who reads &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.&quot; Bright but lonely, poor but resourceful, Francie Nolan is captured from ages 11 to 16 with poignancy and love. Francie is her daddy's &quot;prima donna&quot; and she treasures his love while fighting to win her mother's. Although she never achieves the place in her mother's heart that her brother holds, her strength and sheer perserverance guide her through difficult times. Like the sturdy tree that grows outside her window and survives all catastrophes, Francie Nolan survives poverty, lack of formal education, sexual assault, extreme loneliness, and lost love.The reader first meets Francie at age 11 when, as an inquisitive young girl, her favorite time of the day is on Saturday when she can go to the library then rush home with her treasure and read the afternoon away on the fire escape of her Brooklyn tenement. As a young girl, she feels &quot;rich&quot; when she receives bits of chalk and stubby pencils her mother and father bring home from their janitoring job at a local school. She finds simple pleasures in her life, like being allowed to sleep in the front room on Saturday night and watch the busy street below. You will ache to go back in time and be Francie's best friend as she battles loneliness and rejection by her peers but learns to live a solitary life. But, like the tree, she is ready to burst into bloom and when she does it is beautiful to read about.This book is a wonderful description of life in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn and a strong statement on the hope offered to the immigrants who came to the United States. The story emphasizes quite clearly the value of reading and a good education, but most importantly the strength of family and the dreams that sustain people. As Francie learns, &quot;there had to be the dark and muddy waters so that the sun could have something to background it flashing glory.&quot; Young teens and mature women alike will relish Francie's story and hold its message in their hearts forever."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am in total awe after reading this book. In the beginning I thought it was going to be a boring and long novel. But throughout my reading I became to grow more attached to the story. The main character Francie was an intriguing and delightful creation that anyone would want as their best friend, should she not be a fictional person. I enjoyed reading how the poor family made ends meet and continued surviving when it seemed they couldn't hang on much longer. It seems that you shouldn't find it entertaining to read of suffering, but the author writes it in such a ingenious way as to that you're really reading about the magnificence of life, living, and death. As the family encounters dilemma after dilemma you find yourself encased in the wonder of how they do it. Throughout all the sadness and suffering the Nolans are still kind and considerate, loving and caring, fair and just; overall good people! Don't get me wrong, this is not a sad story, although some parts are on the sadder side. This is a marvelous writing about why people live and how. It shows a young girl growing up and changing into a woman. I was so in tune with the story I found myself laughing, crying, cheering, and feeling scared! The Nolans are resourceful and caring people, although they do have their faults. You learn about them from birth to middle aged and curiously watch them change, grow, and develop their ways. You see where each person gets their character traits from and why they do certain things. The setting is early twentieth century Brooklyn, NY. The Nolans live in a neighborhood of old flats. Electricity has not yet been invented and the value of the dollar is way higher than the present. Its interesting reading about how their insurance was twenty-five cents and that four people could eat on ten cents a day! The author provides you with outstanding descriptions of looks, feelings, and mood as to that you feel you are really there. You feel as if you have known the characters forever and are close friends with all of them. This is because you learn more about them throughout the story as if you really were their friends, and they were alive and you got to know them better as time goes on. While you read this book, you will discover how lucky we are, and what some people went through to cope with the daily mandatory needs of humans. I am completely convinced anyone who reads this book will fall in love with the gentle rhythym of the flowing sentences. When I finished I didn't want it to end, the author could've kept writing until Francie died and you would've ever get bored. Yet all books have to end. With a touch of history, I am positive anyone who reads this will be more than satisfied. This novel definitely deserves more than five stars!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"In the first page of this book, Betty Smith writes very gently and calmly of Francie Nolan, a pre-teenager just beginning to step out on the edge of adulthood. And Smith ties the book up neatly at the end as if she's giving a present to the reader ... which she is. This is one of the sweetest, most eloquently written books I have ever had the pleasure of reading.Francie Nolan lives in Brooklyn with her brother Neely, mom Katie and dad Johnny. It is in the early 1900s where the book is set. The family is poor ~~ living almost on the edge of starvation. Francie has taken to reading like a duck takes to water ... once she discovered the joy of reading, she becomes a big bookworm. She is also a keen observer of life around her ~~ her thoughts are often witty and funny as she observes the strange behavior of her mother's sisters and their lives, the neighbors, her brother Neely, her mother and father's relationships with one another. Till Francie grows up to be this amazing woman set on the path of her destiny.Betty Smith takes you along for a wonderful story-filled walk in Brooklyn in the early 20th century. She introduces the smells of old Brooklyn, the noise, the joys and sorrows of being in a poverty-stricken family ~~ the hopes and dreams of the immigrants that left the old country because there was nothing there for them. The hopes and dreams of the parents for their children to have better lives than they did ... falling in love with one another ... the disappointments of being disappointed by life, the wonder of finding joy in anything new or rediscovering something old. Betty Smith has captured the nuances of life and shares a bit of her soul for us readers to find.What I like most about this book is how much I can relate to Francie and her reading habits and her growing up years. She is full of insecurities and questions, loves to read and takes such joy in reading ... especially when she promised herself that she was going to read every book in the local library, starting from a to z. And Smith captures that longing perfectly, as if she has had the same dreams and desires when she was 11.I can rave about this book forever, but it isn't as much fun as reading this book.

In this book she shows herself to be an author of great depth and knowledge into the human soul. All her words come strait from the heart to make a book that engulfs all who read it. This book gives great insight into life; it shows why many people strive to become someone better and how some people are able to craw up to a better station in live against tremendous odds as well as forces working against them. A tree Grows in Brooklyn touches every ones hearts. It is about a little girl, Mary Frances Nolan (also known as Francie), growing up in the poorer part of Brooklyn with a drunken, singing waiter for a father, yet this father somehow always make her feel so special and unique. She lives with her father, a severely realistic mother, and a brother who is always favored. She is treated poorly throughout school because she is so different and independent. Even at birth she was thought of as \\"different\\"; Francie was born with a caul which was supposed to indicate that the child was set apart to do great things in the world. Francie always kept to herself and was the silent studious type. In fast she entertained herself with books from the local library; she promised herself that one day read all the books in the library, she started this goal by reading a book-a-day. Her brother's birth, not one year after hers, doesn't help this division at all; she feels even more disconnected and different from the rest of the world at Neeley birth, fore he is the favored son and get all the attention that Francie lacked growing up. At a very young age Francie learned how important money is as well as the division is society caused by money and education. Because of this division and favoritism, Francie becomes the sole provider for the family after the death of her father. She goes to work straight after graduation from grade school and never gets to have the pleasure and luxury of a high school diploma, but that doesn't stop her from her dreams. Her dreams of moving up in the world, to a place were you don't have to worry about where your next meal comes from. True, this sounds like a ridicules dream considering that today this is a requirement from everyone, but at this point in time very few people, without wealth, were able to get a higher education or even be able to go to high school. Nothing can stop Francie from getting her dream. This wonderful book cuts right to the heart of life. It show the true American dream; the dream of higher education and a better live for everyone. If you don't read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn you will be denying yourself a rich experience of the true American dream. A dream that has made this country what it is today."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"While many novels offer an escape through some fantastical storyline set in a faraway place, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the kind of novel that makes you realize the universality of common feelings, frustrations, and hopes--and the role that sorrow and sacrifice play in the development of character. One of my favorite scenes is that of the Charity Party, when Francie is torn between her desperate longing for the doll being offered to any &quot;poor child named Mary&quot; and her resentment towards the manner in which affluent individuals approach giving. The author allows Francie to be a child--she lies in order to receive the charity doll, knowing that on the stage in front of her neighborhood peers she is both pathetic for taking charity as well as envied for owning such a rich toy. However, despite giving in to her desire, Francie is also a spirit beyond her years. She walks home both clutching her doll and cursing the insensitive givers, cyring out that for once, people should give to the poor without having to say, &quot;I am rich and you are poor.&quot; Another remarkable aspect of the book, further demonstrating it's stark realism, was the fact that Francie never places moral judgement on her father. If we contrast A Tree Grows in Brooklyn with Angela's Ashes, we see two opposing manners in which families respond to alcolohic fathers. Francie's strength, we may surmise, is most likely a product of her genuine belief that she led a happy childhood with two loving parents that had her best interests in mind. While she may later look back and realize her father's problems robbed her of some opportunity, her sense of security and love for her father would still remain intact, and judging from the role her father played in the household, Francie seemed to need a tender male role model to counter her mother's harsh pragmatism towards her children. We also see this in Francie's reaction to her ignorant writing teacher's claim that Francie's stories were &quot;ugly,&quot; as Francie recognized that these tales (which were about her relationship with her father) were important and beautiful enough to be saved.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a book that provides deep insight as to how individuals can be stronger, wiser, and more grounded. Above all else, it is an essay on love, trust, and suffering as it relates to the character strength humans need to be survivors. It was after reading this book that I realized for the first time in my life that suffering, though difficult to ride through, really is one of the most positive influences an individual can experience."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A friend of mine once said, &quot;A classic is a book which has never finished saying what is has to.&quot; This book is definitely a classic, one that I will read every year I'm sure.&quot;Serene was a word you could put to Brooklyn, New York.&quot; If that opening line doesn't hook you in, keep reading. With each word, sentence, phrase...it just keeps getting better. Smith writes beautifully, her words magically making something out of the life of a child who could have been a nobody. This story is moving and beautiful-a must read for anyone who loves books and an inspirational story.The story follows the life of little Francie Nolan, poor child of a penniless singer-waiter-drunkard Johnny, and hardworking-penny pincher-beautiful Katie. Francie is a smart child who loves to read. Her life is by turns happy, sad, melancholy and poignant. With parents determined to see her and her brother Neeley to do better in life than they did, she moves through school and into the working life of her teens. Her life is never easy, but one of her best characteristics is her ability to find beauty is the smallest things. One of my favorite examples of this is, upon a visit to the old, shabby library, she sees in a plain brown bowl &quot;...nasturtiums! Red, yellow, gold, and ivory-white. A head pain caught her between the eyes at the taking in of such a wonderful sigh. It was something to be remembered all her life. (page, 21-chapter 2).&quot;I laughed, cried and cheered with this tiny child, desperate to make something of herself and find love. Smith gives the lives of these poor, desperate, sometimes even starving people a measure of pride and beauty that is unforgettable."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have read many classic books, but \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is by far the best work of literature I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. As a sixteen year old young woman from suburban America, many may question how I can possibly relate to the unfortunate life led by Francie Nolan. However, this is the beauty of Betty Smith's masterpiece, for EVERY young woman is capable of relating to many of the scenes found in this timeless classic. These include Francie's sexual assault, the favoritism Francie's mother has for brother Neeley, and the close relationship Fancie has with her father, whose alcoholism ultimately leads to his untimely death.Despite the hardships Francie is faced with, she perseveres, acquiring a job in order to help her family survive. Although her education must be put on hold for the time being, Francie remains hopeful that the day will come in which she, like her brother, Neeley, will be capable of going off to school.Not only is the ongoing story of a young girl growing up in Brooklyn simply timeless, but the metaphor of the tree outside Francie's window that has grown through unfortunate circumstances is absolutely perfect. The tree had been cut down and was even the victim of a bonfire, but it continued to grow and blossom. Just like Francie, the tree beat the odds and rose from nothingness to beauty and strength.Never have I read anything and cried at the end simply because it was over. As you read \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\", you become wrapped up in Francie's life until you feel as though she and you are one in the same. The fact that I have only read this book once astonishes me, and I can guarantee you that I will read it again this summer. The purchase of this book may set you [a few]...dollars, but the experience of reading \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is absolutely priceless."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is about a girl named Francie.

Her parents are very young and her dad is drunk a lot. Her dad is out of work a lot, and goes back and forth between jobs. Her mom works very hard to try to support her family. Katie starts Franice and her brother Neeley in school at the same time, even though Neeley is a year younger, with the hopes that they will do a better job fending of the bigger kids together. Francie doesn't last very long in the school though. The teacher is mean towards the poorer children, and Francie is one of them. While taking a walk one day, she sees another school, one that looks much nicer and more fun. She gets her dad to write a letter to the principal of her school, saying that she is going to live with some relatives, and go to another school. He writes that Neeley will continue to go to this same school. She loves this new school and with lots of encouragement from her teachers, has found that she loves to write.I would definitely recommend this book. The book has lots of detail and the author does a good job putting into words kind of how it is like to be poor with a father who is drunk a lot the time. There are a lot of good adjectives and I felt like I was actually there.This is a contemporary fiction book and I give it 5 stars.Morgan Budihas"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I had always meant to read this book and, at age 22, I finally got around to it. Making this purchase was an excellent decision.This is the heartwarming story of a little girl growing up in--where else?--Brooklyn with her older brother, her overworked mother, and her deadbeat, drunken father. It follows her over a significant period of her life, making it one of the earliest &quot;coming of age&quot; stories which focuses on a girl. You grow up with Francie and experience her heartbreak along with her in different aspects, from life in general to, at a little older, love.Not only did the author do a great job of telling the story of a family, she also informs the reader about what it was like to grow up at the turn of the century in New York as a poor family. It makes the reader (or at least it did for this reader) appreciate everything that they have in light of such poverty. However, it shows that, even in such dire poverty, children can still have happy and cherished memories of their childhoods.The book is a bit lengthy and does ramble on at times, but it does not fail to keep you interested and turning the pages. It is also easy reading, although it may look intimidating--I managed to get through it within a few days, and would definitely read it again. It is a great addition to anyone's library."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a novel to be read and enjoyed for many different reasons. As an initial matter, it paints a portrait of Brooklyn at the turn of the twentieth century. Many books contain descriptions, but this book contains something more. I could hear the chaos on the streets, including the noisy children, horses and vendors. I could smell and taste the coffee that Francie's mother left boiling on the stove at all hours of the day and night. It went beyond mere description--this novel involved all of my senses and made me truly feel what it was like to live in that time and place.Beyond the amazing imagery is a somewhat simple story of a family in crisis. Johnny, the father, drinks too much and can't hold a job but is the light and life of the family. Katie, the mother, loves her family ferociously, but has been imbittered by the strain that Johnny and their perpetual state of poverty places upon her. The story truly belongs to Francie and Neely, the two children, who survive by staying together, inventing stories and games for each other, and finding joy in their meager surroundings.The most noteworthy aspect of the novel, to me, was its utter anger. I have heard Steinbeck's Travels with Charley described as &quot;an angry book&quot;. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was much angrier. Francie's childlike but astute observations concerning how society ignores the needs and struggles of the working poor explode with anger. Francie's shining moment is when she shames the doctor who comments in front of her that all poor people are dirty, without thinking that she and her brother can understand him. Sissy's shining moment is when she shames Francie's teacher who ignores poor children to the point that she fails to release them to use the bathroom, causing them to have humiliating accidents. Even Francie's and Neely's victories contain an undercurrent of anger. They catch the leftover Christmas tree, warming the heart of the peddler who threw it. But because he is poor, he cannot openly be happy for them, and has to throw curses after them as they parade home with their prize.This book contains magic and heartbreak, heroics and cowardice, beauty and hideousness. It describes what it was like to be a poor child in Brooklyn in 1908. Above all, it reminds us that poverty and human behavior is universal. Shamefully, children and adults are still going through what Francie and her family went through 100 years ago."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 13. I read it again recently, over 10 years later and I think I love it more then I did then. I truly believe this is one of the most beautiful books ever written. Smith is so observant of life. Although Francie is the main character, I love how she gets into the minds of some of the other characters. For example, the scene where she retells how Johnny and Katie met, and how Katie was willing to give up everything to look at him and love him for the rest of her life. Aunt Sissy is one of my all time favorite characters. I love how multi-faceted she is. How she is so good and \\"bad\\" at the same time. However, of course, I love Francie, and her amazing observations of life: how she loves how Jewish women are proud when they are pregnant, how she wants to read every book in the library, and how excited she is to go to school. Another reader mentioned how this book is like an old friend, and I can't agree more. I open it and reread passages in dark times. I haven't written many reviews, but this book compels me to recommend it to as many people as possible."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I was seriously deprived as an adolescent. I never even heard of Betty Smith's classic novel \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn,\\" let alone read it. And I was an avid reader who lived relatively close to Brooklyn. Whatever the reason for this significant omission in my early literary development, I remedied the situation recently, (yes, it took me a while). I can only echo here what millions of other readers have said since the book's publication in 1943, this is an extraordinary novel which enriches and delights. I can understand why The New York Public Library chose it as one of the \\"Books of the Century.\\"Ms. Smith grew up in Brooklyn and drew from her own experiences to portray the hardships of the Nolans, a tenement family living in that borough's Williamsburg slums during the early part of the 20th century. Teenage Francie Nolan is an avid reader who wants to become a writer. She adores her father John, an alcoholic with a multitude of pipe dreams. He, in turn, loves his children and tries to be a good father, but he is not able to carry out his responsibilities. Nolan has become a dissipated man due to his alcohol addiction. Francie believes in him regardless, (and she's the only one), because they're soul-mates. Although it seems contradictory, the girl also possesses a strong practical streak. Her mother, Katie, abandoned all illusions for a better life long ago. She is rendered almost emotionless by a surfeit of her husband's grand schemes. However she stresses to her children that education is the only path out of the tenements. Grandma Rommely, Katie's mother, also reinforces the importance of education.There is a single ordinary tree visible from the Nolan's tenement window. It grows doggedly through the cement, in spite of harsh conditions which thwart it's development. Yet, it perseveres. For Francie and her father the tree symbolizes hope - the blossoming of life against all odds. It is like a beacon of of light in the darkness of their daily lives. Francie has the tenacity of that tree, and remains steadfast to her dreams. Unlike her father, she has the inner strength and resourcefulness to make them come true.The author poignantly depicts the Nolan's struggles to survive and grow in a world of poverty, hunger, class prejudice and tremendous loss. Francie, a courageous girl, of strong character, comes of age here under extremely difficult circumstances. The portrait of her family members and her relationship with them is beautifully drawn, especially her relationship with her brother Neely. And turn-of-the-century Williamsburg is brought vividly to life. Broader topics are also introduced which enhance the narrative tremendously, such as, WWI, immigration, and politics of the period. Smith's characters are strong and well developed. She uses flashbacks to tell the fascinating story of John Nolan's courtship of Katie, their marriage and early years together.\\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is a heartfelt, moving novel which touched me deeply. Betty Smith's prose is powerful, as are her storyline and characters. This is a book I will keep to reread in the future. I cannot recommend it highly enough.JANA"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I bought this book mainly because I had always seen it on high school book lists but never read it while I was in high school, and thought I should read it. It turned out to be so much better than I'd expected! I couldn't put it down - loved it. Francie is a great character. It's both very interesting to read about her life in Brooklyn in the early 1900's and hear about her conflicts with her mother as she gets older and more independent - a timeless theme. Francie's aunt is probably the most colorful, standout character. Many (particularly in that era) would disapprove of much of her behavior, but she is in the end far more generous and loving than many \\"religious\\" people who frown on her.The book also has the potential to get kids (and adults too) to think about how they would have coped with the life and situations in the book. For example, how would they feel had they been completely responsible for younger siblings when they themselves were only five years old? Would they have been strong-willed enough to find a way to get to college while still helping her family as Francie did? Some great discussion points. It could also be a good way to connect to family stories from the older generations. (\\"Wow, Grandma did that too, huh?\\")The book is definitely most appropriate for mature middle school children, high schoolers or adults. Although the language level is not all that difficult, the book is long (although a quick read) and deals with some \\"adult situations\\" - the pain of childbirth, sex out-of-wedlock, even a brief touch on methods of ending an unwanted pregnancy, etc. But for all those reasons, it makes a fabulous read.Get the book for the rich descriptions of both the neighborhood and the characters, and just overall a great read. (And if you like stories such as this, visit the Lower East Side Tenement Museum in New York City if ever you're there!)"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn is a touching, coming of age story, about little Francie Nolan, growing up in poverty-stricken Brooklyn. I believe that what makes a novel a classic, is when it can be enjoyed and understood whether it is read one day after it is written or 50 years after it's release. Such is the case for Betty Smith's master piece. There isn't a lot of action and comotion in this novel, but there is a lot of life. It has it's moments of sadness, happiness and humor. There are issues that a young girl shouldn't have to deal with such as alcoholism, death...poverty but as in life the novel has it's ups and downs. It is impossible not to fall in love with delightful little Francie Nolan. A true relection of the highs and lows and the cracks and glitter of life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith's ATGIB is an astounding masterpiece. The novel is a collection of life stories and hardships that will never be forgotten. This storie of Francie, a young girl who lives her life in Brooklyn, New York, in poverty and coming from a fairly uneducated family and overcoming hardships such as starvation and drunkeness, and suffering losses like the death of her Father. You come to love each character as if they lived in your life. Her mother Katie, is well displayed as a strong hold who keeps the family together. She is a strong character who should be admired for her courage. Her father, Johnny, however, isn't as strong, and with his drinking and then his death he fades from the story line. This book is completely relatable. Smith wrote with an uncanny knowing as if she had actually lived each and every event. WE would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It has a little bit of everything... danger, romance, family, history, struggle, suspense. To read this book is to read about life and is as close as you can get to actually living it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I'm entering the 9th grade this September, and am almost 14 years old. When I first saw this book on the reading list, it came along with Little Women and Tom Sawyer. I had to read 2 of them, so first I chose Tom Sawyer, and was going to read Little Women. As I was on my way out of the library (they had no books from the list there), I bumped into one of my mom's friends. She looked at the list, and saw A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, and told me how much she loves the book, and that I must read it! I looked at it and first thought, 1912? How can THIS be interesting? So I started to read, and then couldn't put the book down. I began seeing how much the girl, Francie, is just like me, even though we grew up 74 years apart. I even learned some lessons in the book, and will defninitly give it to my sisters, and future children to read. I love that book so much."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"this story is about a terribly poor family living in Brooklyn, New York, at the turn of the 19th century. As technology advances and the American industry booms, a quiet, profound little girl called Francie Nolan lives in the slums of Brooklyn with her brother Neeley and her parents, Johnny and Katie.the novel begins with a view into Francie's world, of pennies saved and trash collected to earn them, the thin food and delightful stores; the libraries, the other tenants in Francie's apartment building.Betty Smith tells as much about Francie's parents, Johnny and Katie, as about Francie herself. We learn about how Johnny and Katie met, their whirlwind romance, soon falling out of the light as Katie bears children. Johnny, who is a kind, merry,friendly, impossibly handsome boy, starts abusing alcohol as domestic pressures fall upon his shoulders. Katie, a pretty girl, is much tougher than Johnny, and works from dawn to dusk in order to support her family, as Johnny, as lovable and sweet as he is, is not the main breadwinner of the house.We learn about Katie's sisters, Sissy and Evy, Francie's beloved aunts, pretty and tender and smart. Sissy, the man-crazy but fun and fantastically compassionate, and Evy, capable and refined, fun, and a wonderful storyteller of past events. Mary Rommely, their mother, who is saintly and understanding, clever and wise. Betty Smith tells everything about these girls, the Rommely girls, with their soft voices and the \\"invisible steel\\" in them, about their past and present situations, and they all play major roles in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.Francie is a smart, resourceful child and an avid reader. She is a talented writer, and is the favorite of her father. On the other hand, is her little brother Neeley, the favorite of their mother since his birth. They grow together, and you'll read about their exploits, and what everyone, even random people, think as they pass in and out of the Nolans' lives. What the tree-man thinks when he throws a tree at Francie and Neeley, what little boys think as they watch a horse, what Katie feels about her chidren, making plans about their unbringing and telling herself that she must not let Francie see that she loves Neeley much more than Francie, whom she only loves as a dutiful mother. (which, by the way, she fails miserably. About letting Francie know, i mean.)The books protrays Francie from the time she is born to when she is nearly seventeen and leaving for college. About her academic life, the bitterness and grief when Johnny dies, the Nolans' fears about money and food.Betty Smith is an expert on the perspectives of people. She has a wonderful idea of what people think, and why they do things. An great example of this is when she tells us about Joanna, a girl who gives birth to an illegitimate child, and the real reason why women despised her.This was a fantastic book, and i definitely recommend it to readers."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read tons of classic novels so I was surprised that it took me so long to discover this gem, which belongs on any list of classics.Betty Smith is a masterful storyteller with a gift for exposing human nature and illuminating the most meaningful nuances of relationships.I gave it a four-star rating only because it was a slow start for me. I pushed through based on friends' recommendations, and I was glad I did.After I got sucked in, I couldn't put it down. The story is touching, poignant, deep, moving, and profound. It made me more appreciative of the beauty of simplicity and the joy of relationships.To me the theme revolves around these two passages:\\"'Dear God,' she prayed, 'let me be something every minute of every hour of my life. Let me be gay; let me be sad. Let me be cold; let me be warm. Let me be hungry...have too much to eat. Let me be ragged or well dressed. Let me be sincere--be deceitful. Let me be truthful; let me be a liar. Let me be honorable and let me sin. Only let me be something every blessed minute. And when I sleep, let me dream all the time so that not one little piece of living is ever lost.'\\"\\"'People always think that happiness is a faraway thing,' thought Francie, 'something complicated and hard to get. Yet, what little things can make it up; a place of shelter when it rains--a cup of strong hot coffee when you're blue; for a man, a cigarette for contentment; a book to read when you're alone--just to be with someone you love. Those things make happiness.\\""},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Written over sixty years ago, time has not diminished the capacity of this book to capture the reader's heart. This coming of age story that takes place in turn of the century Brooklyn will simply enthrall the reader with its descriptive passages and its richly developed characters. This book survives the passage of time without becoming anachronistic, because the themes upon which it touches are universal ones.The story centers on the Nolan family. The central character is the daughter, Mary Frances Nolan. Known as \\"Francie\\" to all and sundry, she is an intelligent child growing up in poverty in the tenements of Brooklyn with her charming father, a singing waiter and an alcoholic, her hard-working and practical, no-nonsense mother, and her younger brother, who enjoys favored son status in his mother's heart. Surrounding the family are a host of characters that are richly drawn and serve to add to the ambiance of the story as it enfolds.The events that transpire in the book are seen through Francie's eyes. Her family's struggle with poverty, her father's alcoholism, her mother's steely-eyed determination to keep her family afloat, and Francie's thirst for knowledge and desire for higher education all serve to make this child strong and thrive, where others might only despair. Such is Francie's strength of character. It is that strength that helps her to battle her self-doubts, her loneliness, and lack of friends, while growing up.This is a beautifully rendered story, a true American classic that will keep the reader turning its pages."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I know it's horrible, but I JUST read this and I can't believe it took me this long. Lately I've been laying off the real reads and sticking to mags, blogs, and thrillers...with a few nonfiction pieces thrown in for good measure. I picked this up because it's the only mass market I own (someone gave it to me) and I was headed on a trip.I couldn't figure out why, but I couldn't put this book down. There's no big suspense, no mysteries to figure out, no major plot twists (or big plot, for that matter), but I couldn't stop reading it.This book reminded me what reading used to mean to me before I let myself get so caught up in reading current events and career-related stuff. This book is about hope. The characters are amazing and you grow to love them all. Then you keep the turning the pages because you can't bear to give up hope that everything will come out all right. This book is a lesson to all, without offering up any blatant fable-type morals. Please read it...and just enjoy."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the type of novel that comes along once in a lifetime. The reader is swept into the life of Frances Nolan, aka \\"Francie,\\" and is an unseen observer in the life young Francie leads. Francie and her family are poor. Poor to the point where it is a simple wonder that they have enough money to exist. There is a knowledge of this poverty in the characters, and a wish to be better, however they have no means by which to overcome it. Instead they embrace their lives and hope for better times. Francie values small things which may be overlooked in our world today, such as a pickle, jello, and even shiny pennies. She is grateful for what she has in life, though she is deeply poor and is well aware that others look down upon her.The title, \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is symbolic in its meaning, and has many layers by which to discover. The characters come to life in the beautifully written prose of author Betty Smith.Time passes through the life and eyes of Francie, and as she grows, so does her perception of the world and those around her. She grows up fast, and at 14 is older and wiser in years than her Mother. Her relationships are heartfelt, as are her desires to overcome her life of poverty. Though poor, she is not ashamed and her pride is felt in waves throughout the novel. Throughout her journey, she remains true to herself and to her family.Personally, I was moved by this novel. It is an excellent read. My perception is that it started out somewhat slowly, but soon gathered speed as characters were developed and the story unfolded. I recommend this to all who want to experience a rich, beautifully written and deeply moving novel."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith penned a true classic in her novel A Tree Grows In Brooklyn. It is a richly detailed and nuanced portrait of a time and place as seen through the eyes of young Francie. This is a classic coming-of-age story that follows Francie's growth and changes and is vividly told in her own words. It is a true pity that so many people seem to loath this wonderful book when it is assigned for school, but that is not the fault of the book. Thank goodness I came to read this one on my own so that I could appreciate the literary treasure that is A Tree Grows In Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I absolutely adore this book and recommend it to everyone every chance I get! I identified so much with Francie in her relationship with her family. I also admired her strength through all that happened. My favorite part is when they are getting the christmas tree chucked at them and they have to stay standing to win it. Francie was always thought of to be frail and weak b/c that's how she looked while her younger bro. looked strong and healthy but when the tree hit them, the bro. went to his knees and Francie jerked him back up even tho it hit her in the head. The book has great insight and narrative. It is a wonderful read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This novel can look imposing for the casual reader. However, the story is so wonderful and the writing is so enjoyable, that most people will rediscover this great book and realize why it is such a classic of American literature.The characters are \\"alive\\" for the reader. The Nolans are a family that could be any of us. Betty Smith must have felt these characters in her soul, because, they are that real! I tend to believe that Smith based these characters on her own personal experiences.Some moments of this novel will have you tearing up, some moments will have you cheering ( the christmas tree scene), and other moments will make you angry at the injustice that seemed so prevelant at the time.In this time of cultural excess and flomboyant bounty, it is a good reminder of how this country was at one time, not nearly so bountiful. When the \\"working class\\" lived in poverty. Much could be argued about the politics of the working class today, but we all have to admit that the \\"working class\\" of America is not living in the poverty and hard times of the early 1900's.This novel was a joy to read. I will recommend it to many others. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Set in the early 1900's, a tree grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith is an old classic we should all revist. The reader continually finds him/herself cheering for the sterdy little girl who forms the main character of the book, Mary Frances Nolan.The book tells of the struggle of a typical family living in that time. It shows the poverty, the happiness, the utter love for the opportunity that America provides and the pride that first and second generation immigrants felt at being in America. Though Johnny Nolan, the witty, talented, drunk father of Francie, Smith shows how, even in poverty, a typical &quot;johnny&quot; enjoyed his freedom and opportunity in America. Johnny's conversation with Francie about the opportunity to drive a car if you could afford it (chapters 25-6), not based on who you were, shows the real love of the American dream of getting ahead on your own merit. Each such conversation is equally compelling and satisfying on the topic presented by Smith.Smith's portrayal of the relationships that Francie had with her mother, Katie, her aunts, Sissy and Eve, and, in particular, her brother Mealy, are so well defined and understood. Like Dickens, Smith, through these relationships and personalities, has the reader identifying smilar characters in their own life.A reader will really enjoy this classic and I would recommend it highly."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"You can see, hear, and taste Brooklyn in the early 1900's while reading this book. I connected with Francie, the heroine, on the first page and loved her by the time I reached the end. I finished the book last night and must find a new book to fill the feeling of vacancy in my heart today. While it's pretty hard to impress me these days, this book made it onto my 'absolute favorite, must read list' of books...please don't miss this one."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It was with relish that I opened the book for the second reading of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. It is one of those novels that you can read over and over and find some lovely detail that was missed before with each reading. This is the coming of age story of Francie Nolan and her family living in Brooklyn in the early 1900's. What is fascinating to me in addition to the story is the accruarate portrayal of life for the working class citizen at that time. Life was hard and could be physically and spiritually back breaking for the uneducated working class man or woman of that time. Betty Smith so beautifully captures this in her prose and observations about life. This may be so, because the author grew up in those very neighborhoods at about that time period.Francie is the daughter of John and Katie Nolan who grows up knowing that her father is an alcoholic and that her mother loves her brother Neely more. Although this is conveyed to the reader what you really see is the love Francie has for her parents despite their shortcomings. As a child she only sees the way her father sings and his poetic, dreamy view of the world. Francie admires the hard working ethic and coarse love and protectiveness of her mother. We meet her aunts and other neighborhood characters who add to the richness of the story and feel of authenticity of that time period. She views all of the secondary characters for what they are, flawed but worth loving. She is a dreamer who goes from being a little lonely girl with the ability to see lifes ugliness with a sense of wonder and joy to an accomplished woman who still maintains this ability. As the reader we are treated to life through Francie's eyes and that is truly a journey worth taking more than once."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is my favorite book now, and will be for a long time to come....it reminded me of Angela's Ashes (Frank McCourt), the story of a young woman against the world.

It was a very moving and poignant novel, with every detail intact, it gives you a full description of events and it does not let you imagine a setting of your own. Betty Smith, the author, gives such a detailed introduction that there is not an absolution in how you want to imagine the setting. I think a reason why many people do not like this book from the beginning, are because of its length, and use of verbal effusion. She does use a lot of unnecessary descriptions followed by mindless bits and pieces of little information at odd times. Nevertheless, this is a great novel, of which there are very few, and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. I do believe that the way this book composed, it cannot be a novel that is forced to be read in schools, for this reason, it is such a great novel that once you get an introduction of all the characters (a.k.a. the first hundred pages) it will want to make you read onward to see what happens to these beloved characters. One of the best things about this book is that it can be interpreted differently by each person who reads it. I love the way Betty Smith, the author, has used a tree that grows outside the Nolan house, to in a roundabout way portray the dramatic life that Francie had lived. It also shows the unconquerable vivacity that Francie Nolan possess. The usage of a tree to describe Francie's life is so intelligent and well thought up it makes you realize at the end of the story the significance of the tree that grows in Brooklyn. That tree is named Francis Nolan .

When se was happy, I was, when she was sad, I was. I felt so sad for her when I read that her mother did not love her as much as she did Neeley. Francie only had her dad to rely on for strength.

I figure, if they're classics, they must be good. Well, I was so right. I can read this book over and over and everytime I read it I love it. I like to picture life as it was in the early century, and this book showed me that it wasn't all fun and games and that everyone struggles. I cried when the father died becasue he seemed like such a hard worker and the entire family depended on him. The book is better then the movie and nothing ever made with the name attached will be better. Even though the length is really long, you become so interested in the characters that it goes by like that. and remember: IF ITS A CLASSIC, IT MUST BE GOOD, and it is."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When reading this book for a seventh grade book report, I fell deaply in love with it!!! It was all so realistic. I was given a month and a half to read the book and write the report, but now I am finished after four days!!! I love this book and will read it many more times in my life time! I belive Betty Smith Deserves great praise for her work in this book. My heart goes out to the Nolan family. They suffered and worked so much with little reward. The ending is extremely heart warming! Anybody that doesn't read this book will be greatly deprived!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book when I was 13 and at that age, I related to Francie. As I grew older, I find myself relating to more that of Aunt Sissy and fianally Katie's. Aunt Sissy's &quot;love for men&quot; was a strength and a weakness. It was a strength with her relationship to Johnnie's that out of her love and compassion she gave him alcohol when he was drying out cold turkey as could not stand to see such sadness and suffering. It was also her compassion for others that allowed her to adopt an unwanted child which invaribly saved it's life as well as the mother's. There was no judgement nor moralization on Sissy's part. When I was younger, I didn't like the mother, Katie much, but now I understand the hardship she went through to provide for her family through it's setbacks. She lost some of the joie de vive, but in the end got what she truly deserved, a good reliable man to provide security and love. She married Johnny out of young immurity, but sadly paid the price. This book also gives great background of the New York Tamammy Hall political corruption of the time as a general feel of the firt 20 years of this century from the view of an every day working class family. I read this book every 12-18 months or so and always find something new. To this day, reading about how Francie received the graduation roses from he father posthoumously, I cry. It is touching to know of an example of how love reaches through even death to reach another through Aunt Sissy's compassion."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a book that deserves to be read by all.

I'm sixteen and a real book freak- I read more than 20 books in a year- and I assure you, this is the best book I ever read in my whole life. Apart from being a light reading, it is a very strong and thought-provoking, inspiring novel- the kind that makes you happy and hopeful in a somber kind of way. When I finished it, I looked up and smiled and even my room seemed to brighten up. Step into the world of this young girl from Brooklyn, and you will find yourself there!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"In A Tree Grows in Brooklyn Betty Smith does a wonderful job of not only portraying people to the reader but also portraying thoughts and feelings. The characters were very well-developed through both the dialog and the narratives. Each action and word said by the characters seemed to fit them and make the reader understand the person a bit better, but at the same time it makes the individuals seem more confusing and complex. There was not a page in this book that didn't create a mental picture of the scene in my mind. Betty Smith depicted scenes and settings just enough for me to have a picture of it, but not so much that I got bored with the tedious descriptions. The fact that this story took place in the early 1900s made it much more appealing. It was interesting to learn about the Nolans' lives not only in poverty but in that specific time period. It is amazing how Francie, the main character, can overcome all the many obstacles working against her. It shows that the parents of a child really do make all the difference in how the child turns out. Francie's mother worked hard from the beginning to make her children's lives better than her own, and she succeeded. This book made me glad I lived in America where one can change his or her social status after birth. This novel proves that no one should ever give up. It illustrates that no matter where a person comes from, if they get an education and work hard enough, there is always a chance of success. This book is probably more interesting to women, but the occasional sensitive man would enjoy it too. Both teen-agers and adults can read this book and enjoy it to its full extent. No matter who you are, this book can open your eyes to something new."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I loved every page of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.

In &quot;A Tree Grows In Brooklyn,&quot; the reader is taken through an incredible path of the main character, Francie Nolan's life. From the death of her father, to her assult in a dark hallway, to this amazing girl supporting herself into college, this book finely illustrates the transition from girl to woman. This story takes the reader back to a childs perspective, and also helps one to remember to take time to appreciate the smaller things in life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"There have been many memoirs of sad and deprived childhoods on the market lately (most notably &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; by Frank McCourt, which is very good), but this magnificent novel is far superior to any of them. It is fiction, but it reads like a memoir and is told with an innocence that tugs at your heart.We come to identify very closely with the characters and their deprivations, and rejoice when they do, and sorrow when they do. It paints a picture of poverty in a city that had a booming economy that makes you feel guilty for having a comfortable home with plenty to eat. And yet it does not intend to be a confronting novel - it is easy to read and is truly entertaining and heart warming.It is one of the best books of its type, and I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is the most realistic, well-written book that I have ever read.

Fantastic, superior, genuine, wonderful... it really is a masterpiece! I had to read this book for 7th Grade English Class (3 Chapters a night). Even though this was a lot to read a night, I truly enjoyed it. This really is a classic book and almost every adult you talk to will say they read it as a kid. Buy it today, it is worth the money, you will want to read it again and again. But, we also are in the process of watching the black &amp; white movie which is horrible and stops on chapter 36 when the BOOK ends on 56."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Reading this book felt like falling in love. It helped me re-connect with an appreciation for small pleasures and grow to appreciate the importance of how I look at the world around me.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn changed my life more than any other book I've ever read. The first time I tried to read it, I thought the beginning was slow and didn't try it again for a few years. Oddly, the second time I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. Because I enjoyed this book so much, I sought out some of Betty Smith's other novels. While they were all moving and wonderful, this one is by far her best.I think everyone should try this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am seventy three. I remember reading this book in my early teens. I gave a copy to my daughter, then to my granddaughters, who enjoyed it as much as I did. Fashions and lifestyles may change, but the human condition does not. 'A Tree grows in Brooklyn'is a perennial delight and as fresh as the day it was written. The bitter-sweet tale of Francie, a young girl of Irish immigrant stock, approaching womanhood in downtown Brooklyn, speaks to the heart. On the face of it, this is a somewhat bleak tale of poverty, disappointment and sorrow, but above all, it tells of great love and youthful hope springing up among the weeds. My only fear is that in today's society, where instant satisfaction has become the norm, this book, with its' 500 pages, might seem too long - I hope not, for it is one of literature's truly great stories and a very good read!Rita Southgate - Cyprus"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Of all Brooklyn literature, \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\", has probably the most charm and magnetism for everyone, who reached for it at least once.The story of the Nolan family from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, comes to life in the book - and the novel is really heartfelt, very much because of simple, but poetic, suggestive and emotionally engaging language. Betty Smith managed to write a timeless piece, not only because of what she wrote about, but largely due to the lack of mannerisms and phrases fashionable in the 1940's, when she wrote \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\".Francie Nolan, a gifted girl who loves books and decides to be a writer (an alter ego of the author), who is 11 years old at the beginning of the book, is a daughter of Katie, a strong, pragmatic, honest, down-to-earth woman of Austrian descent, who supports her family being a cleaning lady, and Johnny, an Irish, heavy drinking romantic, earning some money now and then as a singing waiter. Francie has a year younger brother, Neely, and although the children are often hungry and cold, and try to earn money, selling scrap metal, they have the love of their parents, their own good nature, and a happy childhood as a result.The plot follows Francie from 11 to 16, when she goes to college, but also goes back in retrospective as far as the childhood and family lives of Katie and Johnny. Francie is at the center of the story, growing from a dreamy, shy child into a bright, imaginative woman. The lives of the Nolan nuclear family and numerous relatives and neighbors are described in a series of anecdotic pieces, which could make very good short stories, like snapshots of everyday life of the poor neighborhood, where people are resourceful and full of character. These stories, however, are masterfully tied together into this brilliant novel, which made me laugh and cry, moving me to the core, and teaching important lessons of the essence of humanity and American spirit.Betty Smith wrote a wonderful novel which will inspire generations to come, and immortalized the atmosphere of Brooklyn at the beginning of twentieth century. Thinking of this book simply as of \\"coming of age\\" novel does not do it justice - it is much more than that."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"My grandmother, who I adore/admire in words I am not able to convey, passed this book onto me years ago. It still remains in my top 10.It is intensely emotional and affirmative for a woman of any age... and, for those who want to be around them.I can't imagine anyone being disappointed."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"To all the one star reviewers out there complaining about the tedious details in the book. Betty Smiths gift for detail is what makes the book so wonderful. I was fascinated with this book as a kid. I even tried to recreate the stale bread cutlets with ketchup sauce that Mama Nolan made!To this day, if I find a book about turn of the century NY tenements I will stop everything to read it. I've had a copy of ATGIB for 30 years now and I don't think I've ever gone a year without rereading it. Now I need to buy a new copy as my treasured copy (with illustrations!) has become lost. I hope whoever finds it enjoys it as much as I did."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I just bought this for a young lady I know who is graduating High School. I read it at that age as well, and it is the perfect tale for a young woman on the verge of adulthood as it moves from the children to the young, and eventually middle-aged adults as it tells the multi-generational tale of the Nolan family. Heartbreaking and heartwarming without ever delving into sentimentality and highly, highly reccomended."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Not many books come close to Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird on my bookshelf, but A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith has been placed right next to it.The story may seem bland: a girl grows up in a poverty-stricken section of Brooklyn in the early 1900's, as her mother and father struggle to provide a better life for their family.Yet, the story does not totally transcend the standard book: the characters are not overly eccentric and the plot is simple. After finishing the book, I could not put my finger on what it was that left such an impression, until I realized it was very demonstration of human nature which left me breathless.Smith's work offers much insight into the gorgeous complexity that is the human spirit, and the innate ability to acclimate to the life one is thrown into the moment they are born. When boiled down, the essence of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a beautifully written tale of strength in the midst of the eternal turmoil in poverty, heritage and relationships, both deep and superficial.The book, being semi-autobiographical, is easy to identify with; the themes of poverty, innocence and strength flowing strong throughout the story. But what may seem as urbane and indistinctive actually reveals the matchless feats and adventures conquered in an ordinary life.The characters of Johnny Nolan and Aunt Sissy bear a kind of comedic tragedy: a loving, alcoholic father who leaves flowers for his daughter a year after he dies, and an \\"over-sexed\\" woman who calls all her lovers \\"John\\". The characters are odd, but also very recognizable in any lifetime or family.Conclusively, Betty Smith's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the humbling story of ordinary people, doing ordinary things to stay alive, while astonishing readers by how parallel the fictional characters' lives are to their own."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"With joy and regret I finished A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, the tale of the Nolan family (and the Romelly women too). Started by eleven-year-old bookworm Francie Nolan and told by her younger and older selves, this book is rich with all the truth and tragedy of life at the turn of the century. Francie, born sickly and never quite getting enough food, thirsts for knowledge and in ways that she doesn't understand, love. Katie, her mother is a hardened and hard-working scrub woman who takes care of the family when her drunk but handsome husband is between jobs, which is most of the time. Though Francie and her father are very different, he understands her in a way that her mother can't and her brother Neely won't.On each page, there is something rich about the Brooklyn in all of us, the stingy place where we nail down our best dreams in tin cup banks and pray that something amazing grows out of the often sour soil of our lives. Francis and her family remind us that are many things in the world more important than money. This one goes on my \\"Books for Life\\" list. It's a keeper to be read over and over."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I've read this book twice in my life, and am thinking of picking it up again. I can still \\"see\\" the scenes from the book, and remember how I felt at each part. One of the best books I've ever read, definitely in my top 10. A book that stays with you and becomes a point of reference in how you see the world.Yes, that good."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is the kind of book where there is no interwoven complex plot - just life, death, marriage, sacrifice and lessons learned. It's these simple writings that sometimes touch us the most and are the most thought-provoking. A girls life from childhood into womanhood, and all the dreams and devastations in between... Excellent."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's wonderful that Betty Smith's classic &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; is still being read enthusiastically.Betty Smith's character Francie Nolan is autobiographical. The detail with which Smith recreates life in a poor section of Brooklyn is memorable and meticulous: the small details such as dinner after dinner of fried eggs with onions (eggs and onions being what the family could afford) are reminscent of &quot;Angela's Ashes.&quot; Francie is spirited, bright and unquenchable and it's this spirit that has inspired young readers for decades.Smith was able to write autobiographically while fictionalizing the events sufficiently to create a novel. This is a marvelous writing. I enjoyed reading it again to study the skill with which Smith blended the ability to recreate her past in detail, yet keep the writing spare and fresh. This is great fiction."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I don't know how I got through junior high without reading this. I listened to it on tape and loved it.

Francie is very poor and she has to deal with food problems, money and her dad comes home late every night. Her mother, Katie is a very hard worker. When you finish this book, you have read an unforgetable book and a timeless classic. Please read this book-you don't know what your missing!!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"As a lifetime voracious reader, I'm not sure how all this time has passed without me having read this wonderful book. Any novel that can captivate me for 500 pages has got to be something extra special, and this one did. It has everything you want in a novel, great writing, superb characters, humor, sadness, joy and pain. I loved every word. There is really nothing more to be said, if you have not read this book you are truly missing out on something magical."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is an America classic, so you probably already know the plot outline. The book is the story of Francie, a poor young girl growing up in Brooklyn in the early years of the 20th century. Francie is an intelligent girl who aspires to be a writer, but she has to overcome the predictable obstacles associated with poverty and absence of connections.But the author doesn't over-romanticize the story by inventing a too-good-to-be-true character who is single-mindedly ambitious. Francie has the same concerns as any young girl in the poor section of Brooklyn would have had during those years. She is no more honest, no more selfless, no more generally virtuous, than any other girl. That typical-ness, I believe, is the key to the book's popularity.The book has been more popular with women than men, I believe, because the book evokes powerful memories of what a girl's childhood is like. And the female readers whom I have talked to all say, \\"Yes. That's just what it was like.\\" And it's probably not a bad idea for men - especially men with daughters - to have that vicarious experience by reading the book, either.Heartwarming, genuine, and well worth your time."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book when I was 12years old. I'm now 33 and I still find myself returning to this book for its beautiful story. I love how Betty Smith drew a picture of early 1900 Brooklyn and it's temement district. The story she reveals page by page of Francie Nolan and her family is filled with triumphs and sadness and the joy of learning and growing."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"For the life I don't know how Betty Smith managed to write my life decades before I was born. I too, am a Brooklyn native and I truly believe Smith has a amazing style of writing. Like Francie, I'm the older daughter, and I have a younger brother close in age. If I were to describe all the similarities between Francie's life and mine, I would never finished. I recommend this novel whole-heartedly. Every Brooklynite should read this. Though the story takes place in an entirely different era, Smith evokes a wave of nostalgia to all who understand the appeal of Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am a Brooklyn native, with my father being brought up in the same neighborhood (Williamsburg) described so vividly in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. My father (deceased) never spoke much of his childhood, probably wanting to avoid telling me of the squalor. But as Betty Smith proves, one person's &quot;slum&quot; is another person's &quot;home&quot;.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the (hard-to-believe-it's-fiction) story of a teenage girl, Francie, being raised in rather rough conditions during the 1910s. Her life, as viewed from 30,000 feet, is not terribly exciting. Yet it is her mind, her curiousity, her compassion, and her soul which is so well projected by Betty Smith. I feel that Francie and her family are, well, people *I KNOW*. A brilliant novel.My only 'objection' to the novel is that it is targetted to young adults, which might limit its overall popularity (..the book has only been recently reprinted here in the UK). I believe the strong emotive element of this novel to be a bit too ... intense for folks under, say, eighteen. Young adults might actually find A Tree Grows in Brooklyn to be too sentimental."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I remember i first read this book when i was in Grade 8. My mom had told me about it, and i couldn't find it in any bookstore. I finally found it in our library at school and was spellbound the minute i picked it up.

I'm 22 now, and have an old copy of the book that i cherish greatly..it is my favorite book and i am a voracious reader! Francie's story rings so true, it doesn't diminish with time at all.

READ IT!!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I agree, is an excellent book. However, it does not have much action. It seems like the author keeps telling the same thing over and over: Francie Nolan and her family are poor and have to do whatever they can to survive.Throughout about 3/4 of the story, Francie experiences being poor and growing up in Brooklyn, doing whatever she can to live a successful life. Near the end, she finally starts to become more independent and learn more about the real world.This story took me a long time to read, probably because the first 3/4 of the book are so slow. I would reccommend this book, but have patience, because it doesn't get very good until the end."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The book arrived in a timely fashion. It is in very good condition with only minor stains on the edges of the pages."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I thought that &quot;A Tree grows in Brooklyn&quot; was a very well written book. Yet, I am a boy, and the sort of topics hand-picked by Smith didn't appeal to me. This was issued to me through the summer reading program at my high school. Being dissapointed with the previously picked &quot;Anne Frank&quot;, I figured this would be the typical, mushy, girl book. Yet it was very moving and kept me reading. If you like this, I would recommend anything about the Great Depression. See ya!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A fine book. An interesting book. But hardly one that I would single out for highest praise. Why not try &quot;Anne of Green Gables,&quot; &quot;Harriet the Spy,&quot; &quot;Caddie Woodlawn&quot; or &quot;From the Mixed Up Files...&quot; instead?"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This novel tells a story: a can't put it down, page turning story. However, evaluations of this novel as a five star work, or &quot;masterpiece&quot;, may lead prospective readers to believe that superlative literary technique is involved. Certainly it is a stunning work, something of a period piece (and enlightening in that respect), and it is an emotionally moving story. But it is a story that is told from a variety of viewpoints that are not clearly developed nor developed through inventive or identifiable technique. This limited criticism gains in perspective through contrast: whereas Toni Morrison may shift perspectives in many of her works, engage magical realism, and countless other techniques, Smith shifts without the clearly conscious development (requisite?) that an author such as Morrison employs. Smith, as authoress, speaks and speaks again interupting the voice of character and relating stories that develop the story -- punctuating the novel as story -- a very good story. The story that the novel tells is well structured and believable, replete with conditions and experiences of a protagonist that unviersally invite readers to recognize character-building truths within realistic parameters that resonate throughout the pending turn of the century. The foundations for empathy are believably developed and it is a page turning read. For these reasons, the work maintains the status of a &quot;beloved&quot; work, but in all fairness it reads as an incomplete work of &quot;literature (of the highest rank)&quot;."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"While Betty Smith's A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN will never rival Henry Roth's CALL IT SLEEP for so-called high-brow literature, the two books have something in common: pluck. In the eminently readable A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN, Smith shows it to us in the Nolans--a half Irish-, half Austrian-American family at home(s) in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In CALL IT SLEEP, Roth uses stream-of-consciousness alongside narrative descriptions of squalor and depravity on the Lower East Side of Manhattan to show us--if you'll allow a clunky metaphor--an alternative definition of pluck: namely, \\"the heart, liver, windpipe and lungs of a slaughtered animal\\" (American Heritage Dictionary).Is it fair to say that one novel is better than the other, that one writer is more accomplished than the other? I think it is. Henry Roth wins hands down.If Roth's novel deals with depravity, Smith's deals with deprivation. The difference between Roth's David Schearl (the beaten young \\"hero\\" of CALL IT SLEEP) and Smith's Francie Nolan (the coming-of-age heroine of A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN) is no less than that between resignation and hope. On Manhattan's Lower East Side in the first two decades of the last century, 'hope' would've been a cynical sluice to the East River and its pollutants. In the Williamsburg ghetto of the same period, 'hope' would've been the only dyke keeping that same river and its pollutants at bay. Hope, for the heroes of both stories, is just a well-appreciated resting place along the way to resignation.If there's any similarity between the two novels, it's to be found in Chapter 43 of A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN. This--at least to *my* way of thinking--is where Betty Smith's prose shines with a brilliance equal to Roth's.Why, then, would I here suggest that Roth is the better writer? In deciding upon the virtues of the harp or the lyre versus the trombone or the tuba, first consider the player--as much the reviewer as the author. I find that Roth takes me deeper into his characters and into their immediate circumstances while Smith tweaks me as a reader. For my money, she's a bit too heavy-handed in jerking the obvious tear.Would I read either or both once again? Unequivocally, yes. I've already read CALL IT SLEEP twice. I may one day invest in a second reading of A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN.If, in a word or two, I had to characterize the two novels, I'd say that CALL IT SLEEP stretches the brain cells while A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN tugs at the heart strings. Either way, you can't lose. But what do *I* know? CALL IT SLEEP had to wait thirty years to find an appreciable (and appreciative) audience; meanwhile, A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN was an instant success. Is there a more fitting--and telling--tribute to the American myth? Ms. Smith, meet Mr. Horatio Alger."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I can't say I really loved this book but it was a decent read. I loved the symbolism and the characterization. I would say this is between 3 and 4 stars. I just can't say it gripped me."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I just finished reading this book a few minutes ago. I am not trying to be against the grain here at all but I don't understand how this book is so reputably powerful and a classic. It's not terrible reading because this story was by far very well written and my vocabulary has increased by atleast 13 new words. Overall though, this book felt like a auto biography, too close to reality to really wow me. As the reader, I was experiencing poverty, hunger, bulleying, chronic rejection and loss of innocence through Francie's eyes and yet, she progressed beautifully by independently finding ways to be educated and learning about the world and the people in it. I did find myself physically reacting to certain parts like when this young woman whom had a baby but was unwed was bedeviled by the neighbors and having rocks thrown at her and her child. Also, an important character in my mind passed on which changed my mood from then on. For the record, I feel the need to defend Francies Father Johnny. Yes, he did drink but I don't feel like he deserved to be treated like an acute alcoholic. He was never biligerent or hurtful to his family. Johnny wasn't the type to pour whiskey in his morning cereal and he was always singing and being chipper. But because every night when he performed he had gotten inebriated this is how he was remembered. Luckily, Francie saw past it because he was the only one that truely understood her and supported her ideas and dreams. Katie, Francie's mother lacked a sense of humor, obviously favored Francie's younger brother Neely, and could not let go of her control issues. It was her way or the highway. I don't want to give away the entire story but I must say that although I did enjoy reading this book, it did not satisfy my hunger from what I expected based on all the reviews I read about it.

Critics have called in a \\"coming-of-age novel\\" but when it is looked into further, this novel is really a story about pride. It is about family pride and personal pride. It is also about instilling pride in the younger generations. Too often children are spoiled and told the beautiful parts of life, but Katie Nolan knew better. As the mother of two children Francie and Neeley, she made a point to show them the hardships in life while still giving them happiness in the little things. For instance, coffee was given to the entire household as a supper drink. When Francie decided she didn't want her coffee during supper she was allowed to pour the remains into the sink. For the Nolan family, this seemed to be the exact worst thing to do. The Nolans were extremely poor and barely had enough to keep everyone in warm clothes during the winter. Johnny Nolan, the head of the household and Francie's father often drank his tips as a singing-waiter away leaving only his meager pay to bring home. However, allowing Francie to throw away her coffee gave her the feeling of being rich and proud and Katie knew well enough that if Francie wasn't proud of herself, then no one else would be proud of her.Katie wasn't the only person who wanted to instill pride in her family. Katie's mother, Mary Rommely, gave Katie the secret to raising children. She said first Katie must own land. Katie was to make a tin can bank and every day add a little bit of money to the bank until she had enough to buy a plot of land. Then she must read to her children, one page of the Bible and one page of Shakespeare and as her children grew and learned to read on their own, they would take the role of reading one page each every night. Lastly, Katie was told to instill a sense of imagination in her children by reading them stories of fairies and elves etc. At first, Katie was skeptical of her mother's advice but soon realized that Mary's advice was only to help the children remain proud of where they are from and where they are going.While the fairy tales did not last long for the Nolan family, the mystery surrounding Santa Claus and elves gave Francie the love of stories and books. She went to the library every day and checked out every book she could. Her goal was to read every book in the library. The land ownership gave pride to the entire family. Unfortunately, the land that the Nolan family would finally own was the burial plot of Johnny Nolan who died of alcoholism. Johnny's death affected young Francie the greatest because of their close relationship. Francie was \\"daddy's little girl\\". The reading of Shakespeare and the Bible was the beginning of Francie's love affair for books and her yearning for an education. Education was what would give her pride in herself. Especially after Johnny's death, it was difficult for both Francie and Neeley to stay in school past the eighth grade but because Francie pushed herself and wanted to get a good education, she made it to college ending the novel with the new young woman proud of where she was from but even more excited about where she was going.Betty Smith used the hardships of early 1900's Brooklyn to tell a story of pride and youth. It is probably one of the most influential novels in America today and will continue to influence future generations."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This story stays with you, it is inspiring and grounding, so beautifully written, a must read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Many of us read about Francie Nolan and her life 100 years ago growing up poor in Brooklyn when we were young ourselves. Try it now as an adult. Although the writing is at times a little stilted and too often we are told things instead of shown them, the spirit of Francie and her practical and hardworking mother and her dreamer of a never-do-well father comes through. Some scenes are absolutely delightful: Papa taking Francie and her brother on a fishing trip or Aunt Sissy finally finding a way to get herself a baby. Other parts are poignant beyond words: Six-year-old Francie having to take her younger brother for their vaccinations before starting school or Francie finding that she must work instead of going to high school."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was in very good condition and I received it in a very timely manner."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am more than satisfied with my purchase.

It thoroughly described the hardships that Francie Nolan had to go through while living in the poorer parts of Brooklyn in the early 1900's. All the sad things that Francie had to put up with, all her fun times, and all her problems just touched me so much. It made me realize how lucky I am, how lucky we all are, to be living in such a time as this, with so much more fortune. It touched my heart as much as my grandparents' stories of the old country did, like Grandma Rommely, Francie's grandmother, had described (excepting that I did not come from Europe as they had).

She goes threw, and experiences many things that every one has to go threw in life. She has to learn about sorrow, why things happen and the good and bad advantages of growing up.

It is exiting, sad, heart warming and very intresting (in a good way)."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn By Betty SmithBetty Smith isn't well known for her many works, but the one book that almost everyone has heard about, is A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. In this novel she shows herself to be an author of great depth and knowledge; she gives us a peek into the complex human soul. All her words come straight from the heart to make a story that engulfs all who read it. This book gives great insight into life; it shows why many people strive to become someone better and how some people are able to move up to a better station in life even though there are tremendous odds and forces working against them. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn touches everyone's' hearts. It is about a little girl, Mary Frances Nolan (also known as Francie), growing up in the poorer part of Brooklyn with a drunken, singing waiter for a father. This father somehow always makes her feel so special and \\"normal\\". She lives with her a severely realistic mother, father, and a brother who is favorite child. She is treated poorly throughout school because she is so different and independent. Even at birth she was thought of as \\"different\\" just because she was born with a caul which was supposed to indicate that the child was set apart to do great things in the world. Francie always kept to herself and was the silent studious type, which deepened the division between herself and the other of the children. In fast Francie entertained herself with books from the local library; she promised herself, that one day she would read all the books in the library. Her brother's birth, not one year after hers, deepens the division even more. She feels even more disconnected from the rest of the world at Neeley's (her brother) birth, fore he is the favored son and gets all the attention that Francie lacked. At a very young age Francie learned how important money is as well as the division in society caused by money as well as education. Because of this division and Neeley's favoritism, Francie becomes the sole provider for the family after the her father's death. She goes to work straight after graduation from grade school and never gets to have the pleasure and luxury of a high school diploma, but that doesn't stop her from her dreams. Her dreams of moving up in the world, to a place were you don't have to worry about where your next meal comes from; a place where money doesn't necessarily make you rich. True, this sounds like a ridicules dream considering that today a high school diploma is mandatory for everyone. At this point in time; however, very few people, without wealth, were able to get a higher education or even be able to go to high school. Yet nothing can stop Francie from completing her dream. This wonderful book cuts right to the heart of life. It show the true American dream; the dream of higher education and a better and equal way of life for everyone. The novel tell this dream through one special girl who realizes that she can be and do better. If you don't read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn you will be denying yourself a rich experience of the true American dream. A dream that has made this country what it is today."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was recommended to me by my 8th grade teacher. It is absolutly beautiful!

History of turn of the century Brooklyn unfolds before our eyes. But this is more than that, it is the story of a family, a very real, flawed family. This in not a sit-com family, where everyone is happy all the time and the biggest choice is what to wear to the prom. This is a gritty reality, sometimes good, sometimes terrible. I was unhappy when the story ended, loving the characters too much, but I was also glad that the author ended it when she did, not dragging out the tale too long. She left me wanting more, which is the best I can ask of any character. Actually, it seems hard to think of these as characters, they seem like real people."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Though this book was a little long in places, I loved it. I'm not even half-way through and I have to be yelled at to STOP reading. What thirteen year old can say THAT? I loved the book, felt as though I was Francie.

It is right next to my bed every night along with my Bible. I can never get enough of young Francie Nolan. It shows how much we really need to survive. Most of us are living in luxury, but I would rather be Francie any day. She had the love of her father and the soul of her mother to survive on and nothing else. She didn't need the money to be happy, she was content and taken by the world around her. I think if more people in this world took time to look at their surroundings, and acknowledge their worth it would be a much happier place. Francie really knew the secret of life. She knew that &quot;This too shall pass.&quot; In the end, we are all survivers of the biggest game. Life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I could not put this book down!

Not only does it make you stop and think about your life differently, but it makes you appreciate what objects you have.

I still get a tear in my eye when I think about Francie and all she endured- perhaps because I can relate to her life in so many ways. Like Mary Nolan did for her children- I hope to do for my own. As Mary Nolan had Neeley and Francie read a page from The Bible, and a page from Shakespeare every night before going to bed- my children will hopefully do the same- however they will also read a page from &quot; A Tree Grows From Brooklyn&quot;. I only hope that they too will learn as much from the Nolans as I have over the years..."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I thought this book was amazing. It was one of my most favorite books. I felt like Francie became a distant friend. I felt her hardship, and I felt sad for her, too. She was a poor girl living in Brooklyn in an extremely hard time. I was astounded when Betty Smith said that Katie, her mother, liked Neeley, her brother, more than her. Thank god I had never had that happen to me, but it really hurt me when that was said in the book. I felt terrible when Francie's father died, he was her only support, she could always fall back down on him, and then boom, he died. So sad. She was so helpless, yet so strong. She was a wilted flower that still had the potential to live. Betty Smith gave Francie a very realistic role in the book, as she did all the other characters. She built them up beautifully, so you felt you really knew them, atleast I did. The story was like a jigsaw puzzle that wasn't missing any pieces."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I first had to read this book my sophomore year in high school I frowned on it simply because it sounded like a extremely boring book set in a boring time.

No matter where its seed falls it makes a tree which struggles to reach the sky. It grows in boarded up lots and out of neglected rubbish heaps. It grows out of cellar gratings. It is the only tree that grows out of the cement. It grows lushly...survives without sun, water, and seemingly without earth. It would be considered beautiful except that there are too many of it.&quot;This paragraph, which appears right before the book starts is the definition of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. It is the story of Francie, who like the tree, struggles to reach the sky. The sky represents the vastness of knowledge. To the people around her she would seem beautiful except there are too many of her. Her family is poor and are sometimes completely out of food, but she survives. She lives on life and gets drunk on it. Knowledge is her food and life is her drink. Betty Smith, the author, saw the beauty in a child growing up in the slums of Brooklyn and wrote a powerful book.One of the most important characters in this book besides Francie is her dad, Johnny Nolen. Although he is a drunk, he is a wonderful father. Even though he brings in very little money for food he fills Francie and her brother, Neely's mind with stories of great beauty and with his own love. He is a pipe dreamer who never gets his dreams, but he builds a whole heep of them for Francie who has a chance at fullfilling them.Betty Smith brings color and sunshine to the Brooklyn streets through her characters. Sometimes with a simple barber or junk man or with a strong character like Francies mom, Katie. My favorite side character was Francies aunt Sissy. Sissy married a man of 25 when she was 14. She is concidered a bad woman because men like her pretty looks. She has married several times, calling every one of her husbands John. With her love of men comes a love of all human kind, and in that way she isn't bad.When I read this I was so pleased to find some things in common with Francie. Although there weren't many, it made me happy. I think any girl who reads this would find bits of herself in Francie. We sometimes forget that poor people have just as high expectations and longings to learn as any of us. Every time I opened this book I felt like I was being bathed in sunshine and when I finished I sat and smelled the pages, trying to take it all in."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I got this book, I had a warm feeling because I knew it was a classic and because I rarely get American books. I think this is a good choice for foreigners like me.A good thing about this book is that Betty Smith tells all about every member of the Rommely and Nolan families, as well as other people, even though this isn't important to the plot. She isn't realistic the way modern children's writers are, but she gives lots of little details. I love the parts about the Catholic religion.My favorite character is Mary Rommely, and I enjoy daydreaming of being cared for by her or Sissy. I like the part where she tells Katie how to raise her daughter. This could be used in real life, even today.Katie is very smart, hard-working and strong-willed. Sometimes she seems too stern, but other times she is kind and understanding.I can most identify with Francie when she argues with her teacher, Miss Gardner over her writing. Also, same as her, Ikeep imagining things, so I liked the part when she's told to write down stories instead of speaking lies. (Only writing takes much more effort!)I think part of what it makes this a serious novel is that sometimes little sad details are included. I don't mean the kind describing the cruel school system, but softer ones: the father Johnny being a bum; Francie and Katie knowing it would never again be all right between them. However, there are also some parts telling of good times.This is a good book to read, and after you've read it, you can browse through it again and enjoy your favorite parts separately."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I really loved this book until it got to the point where Francie left school and started working. From that point on the novel seemed like a Disney story. Factory work is fun? You can easily skip high school? I felt like the author ruined all the good she had put into the earlier part of the book. I loved, in the first 2/3 of the novel, seeing the characters overcome their hardships, the frank treatment of sexuality, the hipocrisy of the neighbors with the pregnant teenage girl, the way the family deals with attempted rape, handling difficult issues like alcoholism and the way the author honestly described peoples' flaws. Then it seemed like the author thought that the story was too sad and had to create a forced happy ending. The part where McShane \\"proposes\\" marriage to Katie was laughable. Here is a woman that would never accept charity but then she automatically jumps into marriage with the rich guy. I didn't believe that Francie would become such a snob too and state that she would never return to her old neighborhood. I just really hated the ending."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith does not need my words of Praise.

Look beyond the poverty to the wealth, beyond the filth to the clean heart, beyond the wrongness to all that turns out right, all because of Francie's strength of character.

I took an old book from an old set off the shelf and there it sat for a few years, under various plants. That book happened to travel with me, unread, for another 15 years from apartment, to home, to home, until someone gave me a list of the Top Ten Life-Changing American books. Happily, most of them I had read as required reading back in school. I felt so proud, until I read the subscript that said, &quot;Unless you have read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;, you haven't even skimmed the surface of great American literature&quot;. Truly, the only thought this book provoked in me was the memory of Bugs Bunny distracting a mad dog with it to make his getaway, in an old post war cartoon. How could I be missing out on the &quot;greatest american novel of all times&quot; if Mel Blank was using it as a dog pee-pee joke? I decided to put aside my Oprah list for a month, and &quot;suffer&quot; through the novel, stick with it no matter what. I wanted to &quot;grow&quot;.How surprised I was to become wrapped up in this book so completely, that I actually saw my husband peeking at it. What could be keeping me so quiet and occupied? Being the grandaughter of Immigrant Brooklyn-Americans, I was surprised no one in my family ever talked about the parallels between the Nolans and our very own family. I don't think I was ever required to read it. I never saw the movie - didn't even know there was one. To me, it is the most wonderful best-kept secret I have ever had right under my nose."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith's clear narrative of her days (as this book was based on her own experiences) a young girl in the Brooklyn slums brought life in the early 20th century to life for me.

It is responsible for most of the viciousness, violence, terror, and heart and soul breaking of the world.&quot; -page 226 in the 1998 Perennial Classics (excerpt from 13 year old Francie Nolan's diary)This quote is what I believe to be the most powerful. It wrenched me to it from the moment I read it, and made this book worthwhile to me. It was a wonderful book, but I might have read it much faster if I did not keep turning back to that page to read that quote over and over. It stuck in my heart, and will stay there forever. It made the novel for me."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I first read 'Tree',I must have been around 10. I read it over and over. The subject matter hits too close to home for me, having grown up in the 70's, but under startlingly similar conditions for their time. My mother, brother and I were alone, yet we utilised our time and resources just Like Francie and Neely. As one who has gone through poverty can tell you, that is much the way it is for many, many people in the USA. Reading this book will remind those people of the small things, the things that matter. This family was like many, in Brooklyn and all over the world, with its harshness, ugliness and hope. There will always be poverty, but for those, like Francie and Neely who have finally found their way out, it makes the past all that much more bittersweet. I recommend this book for those kids who have never gone without, who have their lives handed to them, and for whom the computer does all their work. Read this: you will be humbled. I promise you will appreciate what you have."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn is an extremely fasinating. It combines love with the hardship of life in the 1920s. This is one of the only books that was hard for me to put down. Yeah, it was long but when I was done I was completely overwhelmed by the amazing abilities Betty Smith had for writing. She keeps you interested through the whole book. There is never a dry moment.

I felt this way when I first read it: for me, I had to read it for school and thought when I first picked it up that it was a long book and what possible plot took up such a long book? Since then my life's changed because of Francie. I, unknowingly, acted like Francie each time I read this as a young girl: I managed to sit out somewhere where I could face my whole life (the neighborhood really) with a bag of something to eat with me. Sitting usually up in a tree with the copy, a bag of pennystick pretzels or popcorn, and a nice breeze once or twice, I fell in love with Francie, Neeley, Katie, Sissy, and all the rest. I could hear Francie telling me about her life in Williamsburg, NY and how she loved her father so much. I saw Sissy, the wild Sissy, doing all kinds of things imaginable. I smelled Katie cooking dinner and touched the library books that Francie treasured. I tasted the candy that Francie and Neeley bought.

Betty Smith's description of life in Brooklyn in the early 1900s is magnificent--you can smell &amp; taste it right along with Francine. (The Elia Kazan movie does some justice to the book--Peggy Ann Garner's portrayal of Francine is haunting &amp; makes rereads of the book even more enjoyable.) No matter how many times I read this book I never get tired of it.

It gave a really moving story of what it was to be poor in this country in its early years. Really made you think how much we have now. Also, gave you much insight on the struggles that immigrants had when they first came to the land of opportunity. It was not a face paced book. Took me awhile to get through it.

Her Irish father, Johnny, is an aspiring singer and waits tables while dreaming of a better life. Her mother, Katie, finds herself supporting the family more than Johnny, as he is an alcoholic. Francie is an admirable girl living in poverty and wants a good education; she has a true love for learning. Francie and her family live a hard life, but just like the tree that grows in her neighborhood despite a lack of soil, sun, and water, her family will find a way to survive. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith really captures the American Dream at the turn of the century. Fans of coming of tales must read this literary gem.Francie is one of my favorite literary protagonists. What is not to love? Despite growing up in a rough neighborhood, she loves books, libraries, and wants better for herself. Her mother is also strong as she has been dealt a tough hand in life. She could easily give up, but is an honorable character and a role model for her family. On the other hand, Johnny, although a sweet romantic, is unpractical and brings his family down. It was hard to watch his slow spiral into alcoholism and its impact on the Nolans.Smith is a brilliant writer. Her use of flashback takes us back to when Katie and Johnny first met, which was one of my favorite parts of the novel. Also, there were parts of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn that stopped me in my tracks and there were lines that were simply beautiful. Here are two of my favorite lines:\\"People always think that happiness is a faraway thing,\\" thought Francie, \\"something complicated and hard to get. Yet, what little things can make it up; a place of shelter when it rains - a cup of strong hot coffee when you're blue; for a man, a cigarette for contentment; a book to read when you're alone - just to be with someone you love. Those things make happiness.\\"\\"From that time on, the world was hers for the reading. She would never be lonely again, never miss the lack intimate friends. Books became her friends and there was one for every mood. There was poetry for quiet companionship. There was adventure when she tired of quiet hours. There would be love stories when she came into adolescence and when she wanted to feel a closeness to someone she could read a biography. On that day when she first knew she could read, she made a vow to read one book a day as long as she lived.\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn's theme is a powerful one and will always be one of my favorite classics. It teaches us so much about perseverance, love, family, survival, and the American Dream. I display this classic proudly in my classroom library."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" by Betty Smith is a historical fiction book set in ... Brooklyn. The book was published in 1943 and became an instant best seller despite criticism on its content.Young teen Francie Nolan's family has many struggles. This Irish-American family faces poverty, alcoholism and the brutal realties of life in turn of the century New York City.\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" by Betty Smith is considered an American classic and an essential part of American literature. The book describes life in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn and is a testament for the hope kindled in immigrants who came to the United States.Not surprisingly, this well written book emphasizes the value of good educations, good teachers, community and family.\\"Before they went to bed, Francie and Neeley had to read a page of the Bible and a page from Shakespeare. That was a rule. Mama used to read the two pages to them each night until they were old enough to read for themselves. To save time, Neeley read the Bible page and Francie read from Shakespeare.\\"To be honest, I ignored this book for a long time. I had several chances to read it but chose something more \\"manly\\" each and every time. Finally the \\"classic book club\\" I belong to has chosen this book and I decided that this is it.I'm going to read it.The reason I always passed on \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is because it has always been billed as \\"a book every girl/woman should read\\". That tag line didn't sound to enticing to me.Once I did read it I discovered that all the taglines and advertising did injustice to the book. This is not as \\"a book every girl/woman should read\\" but a book that everyone should read. While the story is also about the coming of age of young Francie Nolan, it is also a touching testament to the early immigrant spirit and the hardships of life which were rarely written about first hand.\\"'This could be a whole life,' she thought. 'You work eight hours a day covering wires to earn money to buy food and to pay for a place to sleep that you can keep living to come back to cover more wires. Some people are born and kept living just to come to this.\\"Even though this book was not written as historical fiction, I believe that it squarely falls in that category in 2011. The story is a powerful look at the time using relateable characters (even for guys). The book reminds us how lucky we are to live in this time, where the daily dilemma is should you download the new song from iTunes instead of not knowing where you're going to get those ten cents to feed your family for the day."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"They call it \\"a green umbrella\\", they call it \\"the tree that lived,\\", they call it \\"Annie,\\" this tree is no ordinary tree, it's a pet, it lived, through all the chopping down, and through all the fires, this tree lived. When Francie was 11 years old this tree was only 2 stories high, but it seemed that as Francie grew, it grew too. Betty Smith explains poverty of the 1910's in Brooklyn, in her book \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\". She describes the protagonist (Francie Nolan) as caring, loving, and creative. Betty explains Francie's life from her childhood days to her 15th birthday. Ever scince she was a child, Francie has loved to read. From her first glance at \\"If I Were King,\\" to her job at the Press Clipping office, Francie has demonstrated her creativity and love for reading and writing. \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is split into 5 books. Book One, explains the childhood life of Francie and Neely Nolan. It explains how Francie loves the library. Book Two explains how Katie Rommely and Johnny Nolan (parents of Francie and Neeley) first met. Book Three is the longest and explains Francie's school life. She changes schools in the middle. In this book her mother saves her from a murderer. Book Four and Book Five go on to explain Francie's life from ages 13-15 and how she gets a job. It's a very good book. Outstandingly written, and explains 1910's poverty life very well."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn tells the story Francie Nolan and her family growing up in Brooklyn in the early 20th century. The book is divided into five parts. In part one, the reader meets eleven-year-old Francie and her little brother Neeley. Francie and Neeley live with their parents, Johnny and Katie in the tenements of Williamsburg. Johnny Nolan is an alcoholic and Katie works as a house cleaner. Living in utter poverty, Francie and Neeley earn pennies selling scrap metal with other children of the tenements. Part two tells the story of Johnny and Katie's meeting and falling in love as first generation immigrants. Part three describes the Nolan children as they begin school, as well as the death of Francie's father from pneumonia. The rest of the book chronicles Francie's coming-of-age as she and Neely grow up and get jobs to support their family. As Francie's life appears to have more on the horizon than that of her mother, she can't help but remember the small apartment in Brooklyn where she grew up.Though written almost seventy years ago about a time long since past, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn remains one of the most celebrated and classic coming-of-age tales .The character of Francie Nolan is one many teen girls can identify with: she struggles to find out who she is while coping with her father's alcoholism, her family's poverty, and her unfortunate surroundings. Addicted to reading and education, Francie's unending struggle to better her life has and will continue to inspire many. Betty Smith paints a rich portrait of the characters in the novel, and as they grow, the reader feels connected with their lives. The book is also an excellent look at life in the early 20th century. Smith's attention to detail is perfect for creating a realistic backdrop for her story. In a way, Brooklyn itself is another character in the novel. Francie's ability to overcome adversity, essentially becoming the \\"tree\\" that grew out of Brooklyn, is what keeps generation after generation interested in reading this wonderful, heartwarming novel.I have read this novel twice, once when I was about 14, the second time as an adult. Both times I thought it was wonderful. It is truly a classic piece of American literature, but I have met quite a few people who've never read/heard of it. It's definitely a must-read for people who enjoy historical fiction or period novels, but can be enjoyed by all audiences.Like my review?

I realized that I was not alone in the world when I read about Francie who loved her alcoholic father and had to cope with her mother, who had been so hurt by her father's alcoholism that she was unable to be the mother Francie needed, hard as she tried. Instead, her mother had to figure out how to keep her family together, always a tough job for the non-alcoholic parent.I admired Francie so much, and she inspired me to be strong, courageous, kind, creative, and loving.I am 62 years old now, 50 years after reading A Tree Grows in Brooklyn for the first time, which I re-read every couple of years, and I still remember the thrill I felt as I learned that there were other girls who faced the same challenges that I had to face when I was 12. Oh, and I was born in Brooklyn too!St. James Place"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Francie Nolan is an 11-16 year-old girl growing up in 1910 Brooklyn, part of a seriously poor immigrant family. Her story is valuable to teens, young adults, prime timers and retirees. Her story is an inspiration to upwardly mobile individuals and a tonic for those who assume that the poor are lazy, unskilled, bad, incompetent or different. The story is timeless.Francie loves her alcoholic father and appreciates her hard-working mother. Her life is shaped by a handfull of rules from her grandmother, most importantly those about thrift and education. Her life is also shaped by her extended family, her neighbors and her city. She is a good person who shares her innermost thoughts with the reader. Francie is one of the most attractive characters in American literature. She is not perfect; she's simplistic, naive, overly individualistic and overly focused. But, she's a keen observer of life.This book is rated a top 10 American novel on Amazon because it is approachable to all. It reflects American values. The description of life is authentic. The characters are familiar, but not mere caricatures. Francie is driven to succeed, but not at all costs. She learns and grows. The \\"cattiness\\" of life at all socio-economic levels is well-described. Francie rises above it. Random events and tragedy are fully included in the broadly positive tale. In spite of economic pressures, war, cultural norms, institutions, and human nature Francie ultimately succeeds in her primary quest for higher education. Her family succeeds economically. But, this is not utopia. Success comes with a cost. It does not provide permanent security. In the author's tale, grace comes to some, but not to all.The possibility of individual progress, in spite of ..., is elevated by this novel in a believable manner. If Francie Nolan can overcome the odds, we should all be fully engaged in the game of life, pursuing our dreams.The CD version is exceptionally well performed."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I did enjoy this book, but at some parts I felt the author could have done without. Some places have too many details and over explain; I got it the first time....the book is about a family, focusing on Francie as she grows up in Brooklyn, beginning in 1912. pre WWI. It's about loss of innocence in many ways, the harsh cruelty of life and the sacrifices that must be made, and the downfall of Francie's mind after a tragedy, dealing with her emotions, not being favoured by her mother and finding herself through the experiences of her life, her job and war. Francie triumphs in the end,and how she gets there is incredible and will leave you feeling like you've a diary of someone who had it harder than you and you will feel better and more confident about yourself and finding the strength to accomplish your goals no matter the hardships that come your way."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn captures the life of the Nolan family, who live in the slums of Brooklyn, not by choice, but because they are poor. The book follows them from the opening of the 20th century through the 1920s. The central character here is Francie, the daughter of Katie and Johnny, opening when she is 11, and follows her through her teenage years.The book is a coming-of-age novel, but at the same time, it's a look at many issues prevalent at the time which one could argue are still prevalent now. For example, beyond the immediate effects of poverty on Francie's family's life, the author has also reflected on how people both on the inside and outside of the Nolan's community viewed poverty. There is a great scene where Francie and her brother went to a \\"celebration for the poor of all faiths\\" (211) -- where the kids received little gifts, watched a play, etc., and then there was a give away of a doll. The woman gives a speech about the child giving away the doll, saying that \\"Little Mary is a very rich little girl,\\" who had received a lot of dolls for Christmas, and wanted to give the doll to \\"some poor little Mary.\\" All of the \\"poor\\" little girls refused to own up to being named Mary, because no one wanted to be a \\"symbol of all the poor little girls in the audience\\" (212). There's also a part where Francie, who wants to become a writer and is good at it, turns in compositions about \\"poverty, starvation and drunkenness\\" which her teacher tells her are \\"ugly subjects to choose..\\" and while Francie argues that they are true, the teacher says something along the lines of well, sure, but these are not subjects to be written about. (321).Smith also writes about the perception among many of the poor that education would lift their children out of the slums and give them a chance to have a better life than the previous generation, but at the age where they can go on to high school, many families were so poor that the kids had to get working papers to help support the family, sounding the death knell of many parents' dreams to get their children out of the slums and into a better situation, further perpetuating the cycle. I could go on. Gender, geography, the role of women, these are all important themes, but I can't write forever here.What this book is really about is hope and perseverance. At the end of my edition is a little bio of the author, and in it, the author's daughter notes \\"She often said about 'Tree' that she didn't write it the way it was, but the way it should have been.\\" I think the reason this book resonates with so many people is reflected in that statement. Would we have liked it as much if she had written A Tree Grows in Brooklyn \\"the way it was?\\" Contrast this book with Ann Petry's The Street, where it was definitely written the way it was and see which you like better.I vaguely remember reading this book as a teen, but I think my recommendation would be to older readers who are a bit more life savvy. There's a lot in this book to contemplate."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"There is not much more to add here about this amazing coming-of-age novel, except to say that the reader of the audio version, Kate Burton, made the book come alive by being spot-on with several different accents found in the melting pot of early twentieth-century Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I absolutely love this book!

I already can't wait to re-read it!And though its setting takes place around WWI, and the city is New York City, the book really reminds me of my own grandparents (contemporaries of the author, not her characters) in many ways.

Her family-Johnny and Katie (her parental units), Laurie and Neely (her sister and brother), Sissy and Eva (her aunts) all help build the pages of this book with a since of character and wit. The simplicity in this book is fantastic. I'm not very good at summarizing but basically it is about Francie and her family through out a period of over a decade in New York. Francie's family is poor, yet they are one of the purest families out there. I especially loved &quot;Book One&quot;, this section made me feel like a kid again.

She lives through many trials of being hard up on money, but family ties and events keep the apple of life as sweet as ever. Even sweeter, for though every meal is an adventure, she has a wonderful education and class, which as her mother believes is the difference between two types of richness, money and love from people and richness of knowledge. As she grows up, she sees the rest of the world, and her life is compared to a tree in Brooklyn, which always forces itself to grow, as she pushes her way out of poverty, getting a good job, and struggling to rise above her parents and go on for greater things. It is a very compassionate story, moves quickly, and though life is viewed from the point of a young girl growing into an elegant woman, it is meant for all ages. It gives the reader a power of hope. Aye, it has the same underlying generalized moral, but in such sweet and unique words, its like drinking hot chocolate on a cold winter day. This is an awesome book, which you should read at least once in any point of your life, for it touches on all aspects of life. Cheers!! : )"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a novel that I read when I was a young girl and one that I've reread several times since then.

Money is not very plentiful in the Nolan household but yet somehow this family knows how to take a loaf of stale bread and turn it into a feast. We learn how Francie makes it through her teenage years and her story is of hope and survival.I truly enjoyed reading this book, it was well written with a lot of great characters especially Francie, Aunt Sissy and Katie. This is the type of book I could read again and its one that I plan to hold on to for a very long time."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn when I was about 12 years old, and have had reason to return to it as an adult. I recommend that adults who loved this book as a child return to it. The story of Francie Nolan and her family will most likely have a different, and interesting effect on the reader. Francie is a bright young girl growing up in a poor, but hardworking family in Brooklyn in 1912. Although her life is a constant struggle for money, she still manages to eke out much joy. The novel, which does not really have a plot, is rather a collection of vignettes about Francie's life. While so much of her life appeared to be conspiring against her success, she never, ever gave up, never gave in to defeatism. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an inspiring and a sweet story, squeaky clean, one which both young teens, and their parents should enjoy."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Fast Service, Brand new book as advertised.

As an avid reader I had to practically force myself to get through this book and only did so because my book club was reading it. I wasn't the only person in our club who was disappointed. It was a miserable story and pointless. It was a great discription of life in Brooklyn during that time period but Betty Smith never made me care about the characters enough to care about what happened to them.

The reviews for this book got my hopes high before I started reading it, but disappointed me after I completed the book.

I usually choose books with topics and intersets that I like. I, and like a lot of people, do not like to be told what I have to read. This was I book I had to read for summer reading. Out of all the books on the list and that I have ever read, this was the worst piece of crap that I have ever read. The main thing that made me hate this book was that the depressing and sad life lead by Francie Nolan, is that it is very much like mine. She is me living in the 1800's. The story is about Francie and her family's struggle through poverty, death, periods of no food and money, and most imoportantly, alcoholism. When you think that things can't get any worse, they do. Out of all the characters in the book I hate Johnny Nolan. He is just like my dad, but when my dad is drunk he is a jerk. I don't know how she can love someone who is holding her back from the world. She and the rest of her family give up alot for thier father's little things like clean shirt, beer and bus money. My favorite part in the book was when he died. I celebrated this convince for Francie...."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was an incredible book. I read a few of the reviews that criticized the sadness and the troubled personalities of the characters. Look, those people have not truly read the book. They read the outside meaning of this book. They didn't read in between the lines. To get the true experience of this book, the sorrow and the triumphs, you have to discover the beauty of reality. You have to look beyond the hardships and the personal anxieties. You have to look at Betty Smith's absolutly beautifully written American classic."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is the inspirational story of Francie, a young girlgrowing up in a tenament in Brooklyn in the '20s. Her fatheris an alcoholic with big dreams and no way to realize them.Her mother is down-to-earth, but completely worn down by theirpoor life.Francie is determined to learn; she enrolls in a school milesfrom her home, regardless of the hardhship this imposes on her.This is just one example of her strength and courage.I read this book first when I was in my teens; I am now 40,beginning college, and still find inspiration and hope in itspages.I would recommend it to anyone; however, women may find a lotin it. The main character, Francie, is a child of courage; Iwould love to meet her when she's 40!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I liked this book, I read it as a high schooler and found it intrigued me enough so that I finished it. I like historical fiction, and this edition is so nice for a paperback, with helpful added bio-information about the author in the back. The first thing I like about the story is how the central character is a girl who has a passion for knowledge and literature/writing.Although this was a coming of age story, I still couldn't swallow some of the things the characters went through; which made the story kind of dark, but not too much. The descriptions of life as an immigrant in early 20th century New York were not so disturbing as to make me put the book down, but it sombered me. I can only look back at this book somberly.There are some lies that were told in bittersweet ways to make life easier and some truths told in harsh ways that made things harder. Which was confusing and thought provoking at the same time. That's why I say brilliant but can't quite define the book as beautifully written. I suppose it is all a metter of opinion.Overall, it was a fairly nice read for its' genre. I wouldn't reccomend it for anyone younger then a highschooler, and I think it would make a great book club read.It is an odd but sweet ode to family."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The book's cover is in good condition and the pages are in good condition too.

The main topic of this book as it states in the foreword.\\"The best anyone can say is that it is a story about what it means to be human.\\" Represents that the novel about a little girl named Francie and her little brother named Neeley that wasn't just about how they pulled through in a poor neighborhood. It was about the real life struggles families have to go through.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a novel. The author of this novel was born on December 15, 1896 with the name of Elisabeth Wehner. She married young with a law student from the university of Michigan. She then had 2 daughters named, Nancy and Mary. She wanted to finish her schooling but she didn't finish high school. Although she was able to take classes and she was focusing in journalism, literature, and drama. The foreward states that the novel isn't just a book about \\"social issues\\" nor \\"class struggles\\". Its a novel when you read it you recognize yourself.The main topic on this novel is that Nolan family of 4. Living in Willamsburg, Brooklyn. Trying to make ends meet with the father, Johnny Nolan, being the head of the family. Working as a singing waiter, And drinking his tips away. The Nolan family were very poor. they bought penny worth stale food.This work addresses to many audiences, but i think the problem relates to a particular audience which is the ungrateful audience. The type of audience that have enough and wanting more.At first the book confused me a little. The reason for this because the way the story was written in which i liked. But it started with Francie and how her life was. Then the next chapter it was about Francie's meeting. i got that part but the part where it was a chin scratcher was when the part where Mary and Sissy came in. Until I read on and understood that Sissy was Katie's sister, and Mary was her mother.The book in general is great. But the part that I loved. Was the part where Francie went up to the fire escape and started to read on a Saturday. I like this part because it made me understand the difference between kids from then and now.I completely concur with previous reviews.

I have read this book a dozen times and have never seen grammatical errors other than intentional ones in the characters' dialogue. And for heaven's sake, if there are misspelling in your edition, they are typos created by someone who is not Betty Smith!

But there isn't a better way to describe Betty Smith's beautiful \\"A tree grows in Brooklyn\\" - except it isn't about a boy, but about a girl, Francie Nolan. It is a sad story - one that we have seen so many times - and, yet, Smith is capable of making it fresh and touching, because her prose is confident and abundant in details.Despite not being narrated in the first person, the story has the intimacy of narrator-protagonist, because we learn so much about Francie and the ones who surround her - her parents, he brother, friends and relative. She belongs to the same league of \\"To kill a mockingbird\\"'s Scout; and Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. They are kids whose wisdom is beyond their age. They are perceptive and sensitive about life and, specially, its difficulties and obstacles.What makes Francie Nolan - and consequently \\"A tree grows in Brooklyn\\" - an enduring character is that in she we can see all of us. The girl is the fear of growing up, and, at the same time, she is the courage overcome our neighborhood after something bigger. We accompany her for too many years in the narrative, and become close friends with her.Francie is Betty Smith - Betty Smith is Francie. But she is also each of any of us fighting an everyday battle for a better living. Life has rarely been kind or fair to her, and in that we see every injustice kids have suffered all around the world, what makes of \\"A tree grows in Brooklyn\\" a perfect book for every generation - anywhere in the world."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was for my daughter.

She and her parents and her ten-year-old brother, Neely, are a poor family and they know it. Her beloved Irish father, Johnny, is a part-time singing waiter and a nearly full-time alcoholic. Her petite, black-eyed Austrian mother, Katie, is the janitor (\\"janitress\\" here) for three tenement buildings, in return for their rent on a small flat. But with all this, they get by, though it's nearly always a struggle. Everybody likes the dapper Johnny, who seems incapable of doing anything right. Everybody respects the steel-cored Katie, who is equally incapable of making a misstep. This entire book could have been written about either of them and the reader probably would be just as satisfied. But Francie is the focus: Intelligent, thoughtful, observant, imaginative, dogged, tough -- she's all those things. She's also lonely and pretty much friendless. The narrative follows her through the next six years as she grows up physically, mentally, and emotionally, changing from a ragged street kid who collects junk to sell for pennies into a mature, confident young woman of seventeen who has skipped high school and yet is going off to college, having passed the regents' exams on the strength of summer courses, and without the benefit of high school. Francie is one of those kids who understands things. The book isn't exactly a novel, in the sense that there's no overarching plotline and nothing much of importance happens. It's difficult to answer the standard inquiry: \\"What's it about?\\" It's more of an oil painting in words, a portrait of the Brooklyn of a century ago and the people who lived there and who, with all their tribulations, still thought it the most wonderful city in the world. The style is very plain and straightforward, yet quietly poetic (which is partly why it's always included on school reading lists), but Smith spins her story out in such a way that you can't wait to find out what happens next to her characters. What holds everything together are the book's universal themes of family, interdependence, determination, and the power of learning, as well as a profound realism regarding both the good things in life and the bad. Betty Smith herself grew up largely as Francie did -- she originally wrote the book as a memoir but was convinced by her editor to recast it as a bildungsroman -- and she went on to do memorable things in literature. The reader will have no doubt that Francie (who no doubt has added \\"bildungsroman\\" to her vocabulary by the end of the book) is headed for a similar future. This book and the people in it -- and Brooklyn -- will stay with you for a long time."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Like us, you'll find it very difficult not to fall in love with little Francie Nolan.While you may not pull an all nighter to finish this one, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a must read. The plot is delightfully complex, though, primarily surrounds the childhood of a lonely girl who loves books (now you know why we're so fond of her). Her family is stricken with many hardships including poverty and alcoholism, although her dad possesses one of the most underappreciated singing voices in all of literature. Symbolism is prevalent throughout and even Francie herself represents the American dream.For us it was so much fun to watch Francie bloom, ironically enough, much like a tree. We found it very easy (almost too easy...) to get caught up in each one of her successes and failures. There's also a whole cast of great characters that evolve and mature throughout the story. In the spirit of the holiday season, we double-dog dare you not to crack a smile at some of Aunt Sissy's antics."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I think that this book is very good, and the descrptions are very elaborate.

I listened to it in the car and it held my interest all the way through. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A friend recommended this novel since I enjoy historical fiction. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn follows the path of a turn of the 20th century family in Brooklyn. Although Ms. Smith wrote the book in the 1940s, its message is timeless. The reader watches as the central character, Francie, grows up determined to have a better life for herself. Francie is 2nd generation American who comes from a working class neighborhood of Brooklyn.Francie adores her Irish father who does not have steady work and often comes home drunk. Her father loves Francie dearly and encourages her to dream and to become a writer. He even supports her efforts to go to a better school despite the distance the school is from their home.Francie's mother, Katie, works hard and long as a housekeeper and keeps the family together. Katie recognizes the value of education and reads to her children from the Bible and Shakespere nightly. She also encourages their imagination. When the family moved into a house with a piano, Katie had the children sit with her during lessons so that they all could learn to play since the family could hardly afford lessons for one.Francie is very close to her brother, one year her junior, who is also pushed to achieve more than what the parents have been able to do.While money is always tight, the family always has a roof over their heads and usually they have food. Francie's maternal grandmother and aunts add to the moral fabric and are there to support the family when needed.There is conflict between having the children work so that the family can survive vs. allowing them to focus on education. Francie and her brother are able to do both, but the logic that Katie uses when forced to choose was not intuitive, but the right choice.What I loved about the book is that it showed how the children grew up with very little material things. Another message is to look at everything around you with the attitude as if it was the first or last time that you have seen such things. Recognize beauty of which it beholds and you will live a much for fulfilled and hopeful life. Sure, the children had conflicts with their parents, but in the end, they recognized how important their relationship was with each other and that having money didn't equate to having happiness. It is a wonderful, timeless, coming of age story that should be required reading for today's youth."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Brilliant book!

I just wanted to say that this book is not for very young readers: it's maybe just a tad too realistic. After all, one does want to believe in Santa Claus for awhile. This is a book worth reading. It opened a new and deeply moving world to me which I'm not sure I want to explore further, but I probably will because Betty Smith has caught me in her web.

I was expecting a sweet tale about a young girl growing up in Brooklyn, and yes, on the surface, that is what you could say this tale is about. But even moreso, I found this book to be a good, entertaining read, and it has an edge to it. This story is surprisingly unsentimental, and surprisingly enought, it's extremely frank in its depiction of adultery, sexuality, and alcoholism. This is not to say that it's explicit, but the lack of moral judgements make this a refreshingly non-biased look at the girls childhood, and we see things through HER eyes, and not the author's. This novel is very entertaining, and shows a city in the midst of change, with the influx of immigrants and faces that was slowly changing the face of early 20th century america. This is a fun, entertaining and moving book, and one you shouldn't miss.

The story follows her through her life, with all the ups and downs included, until she is at the age of twenty and off to college. A wonderful long read, I think that a girl would like it more than a boy would. Some material may be inappropriate, so I recommend an age minimum of 9 or 10.

They become very rich not just with money, but as a family. I really liked this book because it was a very touching and interesting story. It gave me an idea of how fortunate I am to have the things I have. It was also a really touching story about families, and struggling; Even through the thoughest of times."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I was not too excited when I first found this book. It was assigned as an English assignment, and I have NEVER, NEVER, seen, or read a better peice of literature. Read it and fall in love!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have nothing fancy to say about A Tree Grows in Brooklyn like everyone else has (probably because I'd like to keep my feelings about the book to myself; it's one of those books you can't discuss with others - there's just no way to explain). But all I gotta say is: I am Francie! Read this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"My mother recommended A Tree Grows In Brooklyn and I was actually reluctant to read it . I didn't want to read the book until I finished reading the first page ! Then , my mom would have to tell me to stop reading and come down for dinner .A Tree Grows in Brooklyn isn't any normal novel . This book actually makes you grow , not physically but - how can I explain - It made me feel reborn , in Francie's shoes . I 've read the book 6 times and am planning to read it again . I recommend this book to all people .I also don't understand how anyone could rate this masterpiece anywhere under 5 stars ! These are the ones who flip through the book and say &quot; too long , too many pages , I don't feel like reading. &quot; Please listen to me - I'm 13 , and truthfully say this:A Tree Grows in Brooklyn will always be the best written novel you shall ever read ."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"While reading this book one truly understands Francie Nolan's struggle to grow up and live her dreams. Growing up isn't easy,but when your father is an alcoholic and your mother clearly favores your brother, most people would turn inward and reject the outside world. However, Francie Nolan is too strong for that. She knows she will accomplish her dreams, and she won't let anybody else tell her differently. Even when her father becomes ill, even when Francie must leave school to work, even when her heart is broken, Francie never gives up. I think Betty Smith gives courage and spirit to the Francie Nolan of today's world, a young girl growing up amidst anything else. Francie's struggles are the same struggles of girls of today, only in a different time. Parents, sibling, school, dreams, and simply understanding why the world works are all part of growing up. Just as Francie must learn these things on her own as part of growing up, young girls must learn these things on their own, as a part of growing up.The book shows that young girls are never alone in their struggles, and never will be, ever. Because this book gives hope and inspiration to girls of today, this book is among my favorites."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I originally picked &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; off of a reading list my junior year in high school. I wasn't looking forward to the reading, and frankly I put it off until the very last day. I picked the book up the day before the report was due, and did not close it until the next morning when I was finished: not because I had to, but because I was enchanted. In a world that is so fast paced, I was overjoyed to read about a time when all a little girl wanted was to read every book in the library. When penny candy really cost a penny, and when ice was delivered. This book is magical and educational. It shows the aches and pains that all young women feel, regardless of what decade you were born. It is passionate, and full of love. Each sentance is crafted, caring for the finest detail. It is truly the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I'm not one to gush, but I consider this one of the finest books ever written. I've read a decent percentage of the &quot;great books&quot; and &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; deserves to be on the list.It can be read and enjoyed by young people, but so can &quot;Huckleberry Finn.&quot; Like &quot;Huck Finn,&quot; this book is even more rewarding to the adult reader.I read it for the first time at age 47 and was blown away. The characters, even the minor ones, truly leap out from the page, they're so real. The writing is seemingly effortless (which we all know is the hardest thing to do!); nearly every word is perfect. The insights into human relations and human pscyhology are startling and profound.The book is also incredibly modern. Published in 1943, describing life in the 1910's, yet, like any true classic, the dilemmas are timeless and the author's viewpoint, especially about women, speaks to us powerfully even today.Among its many strengths, &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; is a completely truthful portrait of the effect of alcoholism on a family. It also tells us about how poverty really affects people and about the immigrant experience.I can't speak to how men will respond to this book, but I believe that any woman of any age will be thrilled by it.Don't miss it. And if you read it as a teenager, read it again and rediscover one of the greatest books of 20th century American literature."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is the best book I've ever read!!!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is superbly realistic and worth reading over and over again!

One time you could be sad, or one time you could be happy. One time you could be so mad that you wanted to put down the book and one time you could be proud of the characters. No matter what, &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; is a very good book for all ages."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Recommendation I highly recommend A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Its portrayal of coming of age is both easy to relate to and very interesting. It was beautifully written, and was never boring. It gives you first hand, seemingly accurate knowledge of life in poverty at that time. The time during which the story takes place is made real through the effect of the different events and ideas (such as advertisement, the union, the urban machine, and WWI) on the characters. The book explores and analyzes each character's life, so that everyone seems like an old friend by the end of the book. Through these characters you experience joy, pain, hunger and sorrow as if it were your own. While it was lengthy (430 pages), it was not very complicated, so it remained enjoyable throughout."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith enchanted me with her beautiful description of early 19th century America through the eyes of Francie Nolan. Despite the significant differences between Francie Nolans lifestyle and my own, I feel connected with her. I love this book because I loved Francie's character. Francie's innocence, imagination, human desires, and passion make her very lovable. I cherish the descriptions of Francie's relations with her family. I also enjoyed Francie's endless observations of the world around her. I anticipated reading from chapter to chapter to see what trials, experiences, joys, and triumphs she'd come across next. I recommend this book to anyone who loves detail and good anecdotes. Francie makes me appreciate the wonderful life around me, one of the greatest gifts a book has ever given me."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read, and certainly is Betty Smith's best book. It follows, for the most part, the life of the Nolan family from the oldest daughter's point of view. But it also gives you backround to give you idea of John and his wife's lives and their families before Frances was born. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was the best book I have ever read. I was assigned it for an English class I took. I moved away from my old school and finished it for no reason at all. I feel in love with Francie, and continued to read &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot;, also by Betty Smith. That was wonderful too. I am currently reading &quot;Maggie-Now&quot;, by Betty Smith. She has a way of writing that I can't even describe how good it is. I would reccomend for anyone that hasn't read &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; to do it fast. I learned a lot from it, and I think you will too. I have been encouraged by this book to be strong when times are tough, and to NEVER give up. Here's the surprise, I'm only 15 years old. I think I have matured a lot from reading this book. I can't seem to stop reading. This book has gotten me addicted to reading. I go from one book to the next, but &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; will always be my favorite.

I went on to read her other novels as well. I got the audiobook for my husband and I to listen to on a trip. I still love it. I think I missed some of the underlying messages when I read it when I was young, and I don't think I really agree with Ms. Smith's world view, her political and theological ideology. But I love her rather poetic writing style, and the way the characters are so REAL! The reader on this audio version is excellent as well. Everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Have you ever had a book that you did not want to end? Because it sucked you in, grabbed your heart, transported you to a place and a time you did not want to leave? If so, you have been lucky. If not, this is the book. It has captivated me since I first read it in middle school, and I read it at least once a year.The title refers to a tree that only grows in Brooklyn. No one plants it, no one really tends it, they don't want it, but there, stuck in the cement, often deprived of sunlight, the tree grows into a thing of beauty. This is the story of Francie Nolan, a child growing up in slums of turn of the century Brooklyn, and her family, Neeley, her little brother, Johnnie, her drunkard father, and Katie, her mother, who works hard and doesn't have time for her dreamy daughter. The story follows Neeley and Francie as they grow up and deal with life's trials and small joys, all while beautifully describing their community in a way that places the reader in Brooklyn and makes you yearn for life to be like that again, even just a minute.I have read other books by Betty Smith, and this is, by far, her best book. Francie is such a lovely, well-drawn character. The reader can not help but feel for her as she deals with the sometimes rough life she has been given. When the children go to the doctor after playing in the dirt all day and a nurse makes rude comments about dirty children, we hurt because Francie hears her and hurts, and cheer her for standing up to the nurse, and, when the children earn a Christmas tree by letting the seller throw it at them (a tradition), we cheer because they've come out ahead in a world where that doesn't happen often. I laugh at the events of their trip to the shore with their father and a neighbor child because it reminds me of the good-intentioned but poorly-executed day trips of my childhood. But we WANT Francie to succeed, for her to be OK in the end. It's hard to find many books that make you care about a character so deeply and this book does it so well.I look forward to the day when I can read this with my daughter and let her discover the beauty of the story."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith's novel, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an essential read for teen girls learning about their surroundings. This historical fiction, set in early 1900s Brooklyn, leaves readers feeling like they have grown by reading the book. The plot centers around Francie, a girl who grows up with and learns to navigate a dark world.The beginning of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn establishes the poverty Francie Nolan, the protagonist, faces. Evidence of the Nolans' poverty can be found when Smith writes about how Francie enjoys \\"their one great luxury,\\" wasting coffee: \\"From time to time, she'd smell the bitter sweetness of it. That was better than drinking it. At the end of the meal, it went down the sink... Mama explained: \`...I think it's good that people like us can waste something once in a while and get the feeling of how it would be to have lots of money and not have to worry about scrounging'\\"(14). Since Francie's mother, Katie Nolan, likens being wealthy to not worrying about scrounging, you could infer that her family is poor. A middle-class person would think it was normal to live without scrounging. The poverty, and other problems such as Francie's frequently drunken father, creates a challenge for Francie's growth.One of Betty Smith's messages is that in order to grow up, you must understand the world in which you are growing. The tree foreshadows this theme in the beginning. Smith writes about that type of tree, \\"You saw a small one of these trees through the iron gate leading to someone's yard and you knew that soon that section of Brooklyn would get to be a tenement district. The tree knew. It came there first\\"(6). This detail suggests the tree understands poor habitats and that is why it thrives in these places. In the contrast, Francie is initially too innocent to understand the darkness of her life. Her navet&eacute; is demonstrated in the passage, \\"Francie made Mama watch while she put the eight cents in the tin-can bank. They had a pleasant five minutes conjecturing about how much was in the bank. Francie thought there must be nearly a hundred dollars. Mama said eight dollars would be nearer right\\"(12). Francie is too nave at this point to see that her family is poor. She will have to understand the circumstances if she is to succeed as she gets older. The tree symbolizes this requirement and, in that way, sets the stage for Francie's story.Teenage girls who are beginning to understand the realities of life and enjoy pondering these discoveries should read A Tree Grows In Brooklyn. It is about a girl who is challenged to face the facts of her life. The plot would be attractive to another girl facing similar challenges because she could relate to Francie and would learn more about life. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn helps develop readers by vividly portraying Francie's development."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE MOVIE BUT THE BOOK HAS SO MUCH MORE THAT WAS NOT FEATURED IN IT.

I am rather surprised that some people gave it a one-star rating. If/when you do listen to this audio of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I believe you will understand why I am a bit confused by the one-star ratings.Our Book Club had this as our February 2013 book to read. One of the things mentioned in our discussion was that what you felt about the book might depend a great deal upon the age at which you read/listened to it. Several of our members read the book in school. Now as older adults, with life experiences and having children of their own, the book meant more to them. I am so very pleased that I had the opportunity to listen to this book. There is a reason that it was named one of the books of the century by the New York Public Library. If you have never read it before, or even if you have, I believe this audio version is one which you will appreciate very much.I highly recommend this book and, in particular, this audio rendition by Carrington MacDuffie. She brought the book to life for me. And, for those of you with a busy life style, having the audio to listen to while you drive, walk, or just rest (and listen to it with your eyes closed), is a great way to experience the book.I will not soon forget this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"this book covers it all.

She lives in a poor neighborhood in Brooklyn, NY at the turn of the last century. Her mother has to work as a janitor to make up for the money her kindly but alcoholic father drinks away. Francie herself collects junk to sell to the junk man just to help buy food. Despite the obstacles Francie faces, she is fiercely determined to break her family's cycle of poverty and ignorance. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn chronicles her life as she grows from a child into a young woman, learning about family, dreams, love--and herself.Betty Smith's largely autobiographical novel doesn't sugar-coat the hardships of urban poverty in early-twentieth-century New York. The reader sees how want and ignorance can dehumanize anyone. Smith's narrative follows first Mrs. Nolan and then Francie as they make mistakes--and leaves the reader with room to learn from the characters' mistakes with them. As Francie and the Nolans slowly lift themselves out of poverty, they never forget to be grateful for what they have and most especially for each other."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"In all these years of reading, no one ever mentioned this book, no one suggested it and I had never seen it on a list until last month.

I am delighted"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a beautifully written book that invokes a world long forgotten.

It seems to me to be the author's autobiography. Before I read this book, I thought the only poor people lived on small farms in the Deep South. Don't miss it. This book is a lesson in survival that will make you a better person."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn transports us back to an earlier time, the early part of the 20th century in one of the most famous places on earth, Brooklyn, New York. Here masses of relatively new working class Americans came to make their way, dreaming about the endless possibilities while working hard to make it through the day.In this faraway place we meet the Nolan family, Katie and Johnnie who marry young, love, work hard, and bear two children, Francie, young, impressionable and sensitive to the hard world but aware that beyond her neighborhood's confines is a gentler world she wishes to enter, and Neeley, tough and tender at the same time but rambunctious and anxious to live for the moment.Johnnie Nolan makes his way as a singing waiter. He is liked by everyone for his friendly, respectful and thoughtful ways. As a father he encourages Francie, his \\"prima donna\\" to follow her dreams, and he encourages her fancies just as he lives in his own--that the impresario will discover him one night as he works, and all his wishes will come true.In order to keep her home together, Katie Nolan does not have the luxury of dreams. She works as a janitress in her building. She loves Johnnie, but she does not like his drinking nor the idea that she cannot depend upon him. Her sense of responsibility makes her appear hard, and in some ways she is, but she feels she has to act as she does if her children are to have a better and easier life than she has.Katie's mother, who can neither read nor write, insists that the family reads the Bible and William Shakespeare. Each night they read whether they understand or not, for she knows that somehow it is education that opens doors to a better world. It is Francie's intention, in fact, to read her way, alphabetically, through the books in the library, and she reads voraciously.We meet Katie's sister, Sissy, with her peculiarities. We meet other neighbors, some good and some bad. We see Francie become an adolescent and deal with all the problems that involves, and we see the very difficult and divisive decisions Katie is forced to make as Johnnie's drinking becomes more of a problem.Despite the hardships of daily life, throughout the novel there is so much good and a great deal of happiness in little triumphs and successes that keep spirit and hopes high. It is a testament to the strength of the human spirit. It is a reminder that the little things in life are often the most memorable. It extols the importance of love and family and of forgiving when forgiveness is not easy. Many of the characters are as strong as the tree that grows outside Francie's building--a tree that refuses to die.I love this book. I've read it before and it never loses its appeal. I've cried through the sad parts and smiled happily at others. An absolutely marvelous movie was made in 1945 starring Peggy Ann Garner and Dorothy Maguire. It cannot cover the entire novel, but it is a treat. I recommend this too.I re-read the book recently for a library book discussion, and I asked the men there if this had appeal for them as well, and the answer was an unqualified yes, so take A Tree Grows in Brooklyn along on your next trip."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was truly wonderful.

I've always loved libraries and reading and now that I am a librarian, I rarely walk into any library without thinking of Francie's interactions with the librarian and her goal of reading all of the books from A-Z. This is a wonderful book for all--women, children, AND men."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I could NOT put this book down!I have read it three times in total and plan to read it again. Betty Smith writes of the coming of age of one young girl in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn.

It is time for a revival."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I got this book off a reading list and put it on my own for the summer. This book is amazing.

This book will make you laugh, cry, and really help you to get your priorities straight. It is a classic, and should be in every home in the country. By not reading it, you are depriving yourself of an amazing experience. It is great reading for teenagers as well as adults, although the readers should be mature enough to truly grasp the story's meaning. I know some 13-year-olds who get more out of this story than some 30-year-olds. Like I said, it all depends on maturity. To wrap this up, I believe that this is an amazing book, and everyone should read it at least once at some point in their lives."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"even though i'm 12, i've found this book to be amazing. it first appealed to me at a family friends's house at the age of nine. i find it hard to believe that a book can be read at least 10 times. now, my class is reading it and we all love it. we analyze every single chapter to the point, and i absolutely love this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Having just moved to Brooklyn my mother thought that I should read this book.

She read this book when she was the age of eight or nine and living in New York City. I recall her talking about how wonderful the book was and how much she enjoyed Francie and aunt Sizzy. Like Francie (including myself), she grew up in similar circumstances except there were six siblings and mother. Dad was too irresponsible to fit any of the characters, except perhaps the disgruntled Willie Flittman, who runs off with his new found vocation; a single man orchestra (substitute women). Anyhow, she grew into Sizzy more than Francie although there was a lot of Francie in her as a young girl. I certainly went off in search of the American dream. My sister did not, although Francie still lives in her particularly in her search for beauty, love, and insatiable love for books. She too wanted to read all of the books in the local library.The book speaks mounds of truth about poverty and the struggle faced by urban poor. Ms. B. Smith treats the subject and the characters with great tenderness and honesty. Although the pathos and ethos of the urban poor may not have been of great interest or even palatable to readers at the time of the book's publication, the great human paradigm and its redeeming values is timeless and relevant. Reading A Grows in Brooklyn and having lived in Brooklyn Heights as well as experienced a similar childhhod is especially welcoming. To reflect on those difficult childhood times is important as it helps keep me grounded. I would not deny or exchange that experience for anything in the world.The book is a must read for all lovers of literature regarless of age, gender, or socioeconomic circumstances."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Everyone should read this book.

Would recommend it to other people."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a coming of age story and I know that is such a cliche - especially for a debut novel. But this coming of age story is one set in a world that I had never read about before. How is that possible, you ask? It's set in Brooklyn, right? Every story about Brooklyn or NYC has already been told, millions of times. But I'm telling you, this one is different. The main reason it's different is because this Brooklyn story is told through the eyes of young Francie Nolan, one of the most glorious characters ever created in literature. Truly, she's almost indescribable. She's smart without being precocious, at times sad but never maudlin, and traversing the world of Brooklyn at the turn of the 20th Century with her is one of the greatest reading experiences I've ever had. I will love her forever.This book is about family and community and love and education and poverty and strength and mistakes and triumphs and growing up. It is filled with the most amazing characters and paints a picture of America that is utterly new to me and leaves me believing there IS magic in America, magic in the neighborhoods we call home, magic in our childhood memories . It will make you laugh and cry (I cried three times, a record for me, while reading a book) and as soon as it is over you will vow to return as soon as you can.So if you've been putting it off, or if you've never heard of this book before, or if you haven't read it in years, do yourself a favor and read it now. And then reread it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book first at 11 years old. It has been one of my favorite books ever since. The writing and the story are so clear it takes my breath away. You should definitely read this if you haven't already."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was an unexpected discovery: I had seen something about this American teenage classic, but had no idea what it was about. It sounded rosy and childish, but turned out to be an excellent novel on the life -from age 11 to 16- of Francie Nolan, a girl who lives in Brooklyn. The Nolans are very poor. The father, Johny, is a handsome guy, but he suffers from a horrible alcoholism that only leaves him time to find sporadic work as waiter and singer. Katie, the mother, is a young, admirable hard-working woman, who has had a tough life and who finds work as housekeeper in order to sustain her children. Francie has a younger brother, Neely, with whom she generally is in good terms. The portrait includes uncles, aunts, and grandparents, depicting their lives and misadventures. It is a grand realistic fresco of life in Brooklyn during the first decades of the XXth Century, a poor Brooklyn populated by Irish, German, Italian and Jewish people.But the main, and most interesting, focus is on Francie's inner world. She's an absolutely lovable character, an admirable, brave girl, self-assured and reflective. Francie enjoys going to the library to borrow books which she later reads in the peace of the fire ladder outside their tiny apartment. Although she is kind of a loner, this is compensated by the mental travels and the enrichment of her mind provided by books. The novel recounts the difficult passage from childhood into adolescence, her troubled and hurting love for her father, a pathetic failure who can't find the will to overcome his problems, and who stumbles from fall to fall until his destruction. It also recounts Francie's relationship with her mother: she suffers from believing Neely is her favorite, but she's never reproachful and is always helpful.The tone is intimate, and even sordid aspects are treated with great beauty of language, depth in psychological description, and empathy with the characters. Feelings, values and situations are universal and allow the reader to really feel the story. Readers of any age beyond early childhood may enjoy it. It is about dignity, courage, effort, and authenticity without ever being corny or preachy."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith isn't a novel about a dysfunctional family. It is a lullaby of a quiet corner in the city that never sleeps. It is a lullaby that whispers the joys, hardships, and love of a family that will forever be in my heart.The story revolves around Francie Nolan, a young girl growing up in Brooklyn in the early 1900s. She is one of the only true Americans on her blocks and is proud of it. Living on little food, Francie quenches her thirst for life through books and school. Her mother is a traditional housewife with a twist of rebellion. Her father is a man as magical and loving as he is drunk, living through a kaleidascope of wonder that he teaches his children to adore.Everything about A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was utterly enchanting. I truly connected with each character. It doesn't matter whether you're an eager young author, someone who has experienced a tragic loss, or simply someone who loves life, I believe there is a little bit of everyone in Francie Nolan. Everyone has that childlike need to live their dreams in an attempt to escape an imperfect reality. In fact, all of the Smith's characters are so terrific that it is hard to believe that they are 'ction. Their attitude, togetherness, and love are something that every family should strive to imitate. By the end of the novel, I began to miss the family that I had grown up with as if they were my own.Betty Smith's writing is full of wonderful portraits of the place she grew up. She displays the glory of New York City at a time when immigrants poured into America. Her prose make us feel the pride of Francie's neighbors when they leave their homeland, and the freedom they felt as their boats docked. Yet, along with these beautiful images, she portrays the struggles of so many people living in the small crowded islands of New York City. Betty Smith shows us the loves and losses of a new nation by painting a picture to rival Picasso.The chronicle of the Nolans' life was a truly wonderful and enlightening experience. It is so enchanting to travel alongside the family through their trials and celebrations alike. I will admit to several tear streaked pages and advise anyone who reads this book to have a box of tissues handy. I will end with my favorite part of the book. The tree is growing outside the window as Francie looks out at it for the last time. About the tree, Smith writes: \\"It lived! And nothing could destroy it.\\" Those sentences remind me that nothing ever truly dies. Everything and everyone will live on forever in the memory of all who come to love it.- Victoria Testa"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I lived in the pages of this book, was totally carried away to Brooklyn. It made me want to be a better person. I cannot wait for my teen daughter to read this book and to find out what she thinks of it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The term \\"classic\\" is thrown around these days and lands on lots of inappropriate choices, whether it's books, movies,music, etc. But this book is- and always has been - a gem. I read it myself fifty years ago; bought it for my daughter, my daughter-in-law, and, most recently, my niece. We have all loved the story.Buy it and share it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is an incredible coming of age story that everyone should read regardless of social class, race, etc. It is the story of Francie Nolan and her often impoverished family and their daily struggles to put food on their plates and to become educated. Francie's voice is so innocent and perceptive as she narrates her family's history, the Brooklyn neighborhood she was raised in and the adjustments she must make as she grows older. She is able to find pleasure in the simplest of things, yet her life is a constant struggle filled with small joys and immense tragedies. Smith's beautiful writing immerses the reader in the Nolan's lives, effectively conveying the atmosphere of their existence and defining the era. I was so absorbed in this novel and am thrilled that I was prompted to read it for my book club. It will be a favorite that I will recommend and revisit over the years."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith deftly depicts a young literate woman's perspective of Irish life in Brooklyn during the turn of the last century - impressively in a manner similar to great American authors Theodore Dreiser or Saul Bellow. She shows us the great American story where simple roots can bring rise to good and sometimes great triumphs.Protagonist Francie Nolan is the main party throughout the book whose literary verve and gift make her the seemingly natural person to author this or a similar book. She writes about the happy and sad times of poverty in Brooklyn when impoverished lives delivered grueling challenges. But, to deliver such stories to the teacher in grade school can be straining.All great writers probably stretch the truth - that is what makes their stories surpass what we read or hear about on a daily basis. When Francie writes true stories about her poverty, her teacher says, \\"You know, Francie, a lot of people would think that these stories that you're making up all the time were terrible lies because they are not the truth as people see the truth. In the future, when something comes up, you tell exactly how it happened but write down for yourself the way you think it should have happened. Tell the truth and write the story.\\" She learns \\". . . poverty, starvation and drunkenness are ugly subjects to choose. We all admit these things exist. But one doesn't write about them.\\"But, Betty Smith did write about such difficult topics, and succeeded. So have numerous others since. Recently,Angela's Ashes: A Memoirrevolved exclusively about such Irish poverty forty years later. And how many post-war novels (WW I or WW II) have caught the public's attention with doom and despair as the almost exclusive focus of the fictional or nonfictional account?Reading books like this also allows modern readers to learn about the times and events. People walked outside late at night with little wonder about physical assault. Meals were \\"stretched out\\" from crumbs, day old bread, soups and parts of animals most of us would ignore. Education was very expensive, and horses ruled the roads in New York. As the subway and car were still not fine-tooled enterprises, trips from Brooklyn to Manhattan were journeys. And, \\"When you get a Democrat president, you got a war president.\\" Times have changed.This book proudly has been selling for decades, and could continue its selling feats beyond a century, because of the simplistic delivery and acute perception tied with great story and dialogue. Books like this are fun."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith's classic is probably my all-time favorite book. After falling in love with it at age 13, I've read it at least 100 times as I approach age 40. And each time, I find something new -- a new character insight, a bit of description that I hadn't noticed before. Each character is memorably drawn, leaping off the page and coming to vivid life in my mind's eye as I read. I recommend it for all ages, but it's especially good for young girls and women who are, like Francie, smart and bookish and a bit of a square peg."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Even the weak small tree in the back yard can grow with only little sunlight. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith is a poignant novel that beautifully displays the themes of a growing family, often compared to a growing tree. The journeys of the Nolan family, all extensions included, are captured in five &#65533;books&#65533;, each documenting a period of their lives. Mostly, the focus is on Francie, the book beginning when she is age eleven in the Williamsburg slums of Brooklyn, though there are also records of her early years and even her birth. When Francie is born and looks as if she might not live too long, her mother Katie is pitied for the sickly baby and she replies: &#65533;Who wants to die? Everything struggles to live. Look at that tree growing up there out of that grating. It gets no sun, and water only when it rains. It&#65533;s growing out of sour earth. And it&#65533;s strong because its hard struggle to live makes it strong&#65533; (93). Through this coming-of-age novel, Francie constantly exhibits her innermost thoughts concerning life, love, and her family from 1902 to 1919.After showing Brooklyn in the first book during the summer of 1912 as &#65533;serene&#65533;, and quoting Francie&#65533;s observations about the people who surround her, the path continues into lives of Francie&#65533;s parents Katie and Johnny, beginning when they first met, and delving into their families. The tales of Katie&#65533;s sisters Sissy, Evy, and Eliza and bits about Johnny&#65533;s brothers Andy, Georgie, and Frankie are covered as well. Book Three begins when Francie is approximately age seven when the Nolan family moves to a new flat due to the accidents caused by an overwhelming amount of love from Sissy. Francie now begins a new adventure called school, which confronts her with both good and bad incidents. She painfully endures her beautiful father&#65533;s death, and sees her mother&#65533;s newest pregnancy, which is Johnny&#65533;s child. She recognizes her mother&#65533;s apparent love for Neeley over her, and learns that upon ending middle school she must get her working papers. Francie yearns for education but realizes that she must work to help her family and keep them afloat.Book Four begins with Francie learning the ropes of factory life and to appreciate the necessity of work. Annie Laurie, Francie&#65533;s new sister, is born. She will not grow up in poverty as Francie and Neeley did, because of the nice, rich man who is courting Katie. Francie finds her first crush, her first love, her first heartbreak all in this section of the book. In Book Five Francie leaves the necessity of her life of work and prepares for a life of luxury thanks to Katie&#65533;s new husband. The novel ends with Francie bidding adieu to her old town, her old life, and her old self.Throughout my journey of reading A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I both laughed and cried, and realized that there were aspects of this book that I liked and ones that I disliked. I liked knowing about all the people in the family, and knowing their emotions rather than merely knowing about Francie alone. I liked growing up with Francie, and observing her ups and downs. Though all of this possibly could not have been written in a shorter length, I felt that the book was too long and that it dragged at certain points. While I enjoyed the writing style of Betty Smith, I think that some of the vignettes were unnecessary. I most liked the constant symbolism of the tree growing in the backyard. &#65533;The tree hadn&#65533;t died. A new tree had grown from the stump and its trunk had grown along the ground until it reached a place where there were no wash lines above it. Then it had started to grow towards the sky again&#65533;It lived! And nothing could destroy it&#65533; (483)."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"In an effort to move away from books that are published to appeal to women's book groups, we decided to select a classic. No wonder \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" has endured! This book was so far ahead of its time, it pleases me no end to imagine that school students are still reading it and finding meaning in it.I would be hard put to decide which of the well-defined characters would actually be my favorite character.I think I will carry Francie Nolan, her mom, Katie and her aunts in my heart always. I also loved the way Johnny Nolan's alcolholism was treated. The author was so wise to just tell the story and not moralize as would be the temptation. The same can be said of the poverty of the people. It simply spoke for itself.I will simply never forget this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a true classic that has withstood the test of time. It will touch and warm your heart, and remain with you long after the pages have been read. You will become deeply and emotionally attached to Francie Nolan, a young girl who overcomes many obstacles and challenges beyond her control in order to survive. Taking place in the slums of Brooklyn, Francie is part of a family who dotes on her brother. Her parents are not without their own set of problems, and Francie is faced with growing up in a world that has not been kind to her. She understands only too well the meaning of hunger, doing without, leaving school and not having enough money to go around.&quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; takes place in the early part of the century and was written over fifty years ago. With this in mind, it may be difficult for today's generation, particularly if financial stability was never a problem, to fully understand and appreciate Francie's life. Unless, of course, the reader also experienced poverty - &quot;no money&quot; means no money, no matter what year or generation you are living in. You will marvel at Francie's determination, strength and courage, smile at her resourcefulness, and feel compassion for a girl who, by necessity, is far more mature than her years.Another excellent, highly recommended book by the same author is &quot;Joy in the Morning.&quot; It is written with the same grace, style and heart-rendering emotion as this one."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"As I read this book, I felt a mental change occuring and as I'm only 13, I didn't know what to expect from this story which my mother so highly recommended. But the story of young Francie touched and affected me so deeply, I felt her pain, sorrow, and triumph. Through all hardships and heartbreaks, Francie and Neeley endure and survive in their threadbare world, which in itself is admirable. This book struck a nerve in me that has changed my image of life drastically. Now the grass seems greener, the sky bluer, and suddenly it is as if someone held a candle up in front of me. The world is more distinct, and I appreciate the little things. I recommend this book to anyone that loves to read, it is truly a wonderful book!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I just read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, and I could not put it down. All of Betty Smith's characters are vivid illustrations of types of personalities, yet she manages to show a bright side to all of them; the alcoholic father who loves his daughter, the &quot;free&quot; aunt who knows the true meaning of family loyalty, and a strong, sometimes harsh mother who will fight to the death for her children. This book is poignant and touching, with scenes that expose the tender and fragile nature of childhood. Francie's insights about society and people are also thought-provoking. The novel is an easy-read; however, by no means should it not be considered a literary treasure. Pick this one up for a novel study, a reading group, or just some summer reading next to the pool."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book many years ago as a young woman and loved it. Now many years later, it still is a wonderful story of a young girl growing up surrounded by poverty but maintaining an innocence of heart. There is not one ounce of cynicism in Francie's entire body; something that is rare today.I read many of the negative reviews from young people who have been required to read the book. It is so difficult for them to get past the differences of today's age and then; however, hopefully some will have inspiring teachers who will be able to get them through the details enough in order to see the universal story of perseverance and strength of family.This book is not a page turner, has dated dialogue and writing style, and is probably not for everyone. However, it is a warm, pleasant, inspiring read that should at least be tasted."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Written over sixty years ago, time has not diminished the capacity of this book to capture the reader's heart. This coming of age story that takes place in turn of the century Brooklyn will simply enthrall the reader with its descriptive passages and its richly developed characters. This book survives the passage of time without becoming anachronistic, because the themes upon which it touches are universal ones.The story centers on the Nolan family. The central character is the daughter, Mary Frances Nolan. Known as \\"Francie\\" to all and sundry, she is an intelligent child growing up in poverty in the tenements of Brooklyn with her charming father, a singing waiter and an alcoholic, her hard-working and practical, no-nonsense mother, and her younger brother, who enjoys favored son status in his mother's heart. Surrounding the family are a host of characters that are richly drawn and serve to add to the ambiance of the story as it enfolds.The events that transpire in the book are seen through Francie's eyes. Her family's struggle with poverty, her father's alcoholism, her mother's steely-eyed determination to keep her family afloat, and Francie's thirst for knowledge and desire for higher education all serve to make this child strong and thrive, where others might only despair. Such is Francie's strength of character. It is that strength that helps her to battle her self-doubts, her loneliness, and lack of friends, while growing up.This is a beautifully rendered story, a true American classic that will keep the reader turning its pages."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book as required reading my freshman year of high school. At the time I hated it. I read it again for fun about a year later and could not believe how great it was. I too was an avid reader as a young girl, just like Francie Nolan. I still have the same old beat up copy of the book I read in high school. I have seen the movie more times than I can count, and they're both wonderful. I think this should be required reading for every school child, especially the girls!

Originally published some 60 years ago, even to jaded readers of modern contemporary fiction, it remains highly readable. Every word.This was my mother's favorite book. I remember watching the movie with her when I was a child and for these two reasons, reading was slow. I couldn't help but reflect on the story as if they were MY memories rather than the main character's, a young girl named \\"Francie,\\" growing up in poverty in the early twentieth century. It reads like a series of both heartbreaking and entertaining anecdotes about life among first and second-generation immigrants in Brooklyn, New York. And while you can sense the starvation and the continual worry over making ends meet, through the eyes of the children, Francie and her brother, Neely, and also through their Aunt \\"Sissy,\\" who absolutely takes a bite out of life, it's difficult to feel sorry for them. They are prideful and make the most of all that they have. There's a scene where the children manage to stay standing as the tree vendor chucks a giant Christmas tree at them on Christmas Eve, which I will never forget. What will also stay with me are the feelings Francie discovers while growing up, about the different kinds of love she had for her family.I savored each page and didn't want it to end. For all the days I read, it was like spending time with my mom.Michele Cozzens is the author of It's Not Your Mother's Bridge Club."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was very popular when I was in eighth grade (1968.)

Thirty years later I picked it up in the bookstore and couldn't put it down. I avoided rereading it for a few years because I didn't think I could enjoy it as much the second time around but I did."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Since reading Betty Smith's classic A Tree Grows in Brooklyn I keep finding myself thinking about little Francie Nolan growing to young womanhood on the streets of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Just like the \\"Heaven Tree\\" that grew up through the concrete, she too struggled against hard, tough elements to reach the sky. For starters, Francie somehow knew that she had to get into another school if she had any hope of improving her life, and her determination led her take the necessary steps...even if it meant faking her address.Although she lived in poverty, Francie had the good fortune of being surrounded by people who loved her, especially her beloved brother Neely and her handsome, charming father. Unfortunately, the latter had a \\"likin' for the bottle\\" which proved to be part of his undoing. Katie Nolan, Francie's mother was a hard working woman who was forced to do more than her fair share of providing for the struggling family, and the scenes describing her diligently cleaning floors while pregnant are unsettling. So is the one in which young Francie is nearly attacked by a child molester until Katie rescues her. There are funny, lovely, and uplifting passages too...like those of Francie sitting outside to read while absorbing the sights and sounds of the city. The flowers in the library are pleasant to think about and visualize too, lovely reminders that regardless of poverty, pain, and disappointment, there is also beauty.It's a wonderful coming of age book, one that I plan to read again."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is one of those overlooked books that everyone should read!

I highly recommend this book!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"For anyone who believes in the power of words to shape and transform, this book is a \\"must read.\\" It is stirring and rich, steeped in history and immensely entertaining. A really good book has the ability to make us understand life better. This is one such book. I learned so much about history from this book, as Smith brings color and depth into each page of her story with vivid details of the culture, the habits and the mores of the day. Her characters are strong, weak, flawed...utterly human. I was also reminded of the complexities of the human condition. Timeless issues make this book relevant to readers of any age in any decade. I savored Smith's style rather like one eats a really good chocolate, slowly as to truly experience its richness. I read this book in less than 48 hours; now, a week later, I'm re-reading it carefully with the intent of teaching it. It is my hope my own daughters will read it, as it presents as clear a picture of living, and as powerful a message about family and sacrifice, as I have ever encountered."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a book that somehow over the years I had missed reading.

I love the detail in which it is written and the relationships between the characters. I think it's a fine example of what it means to come of age, and shows how, as we get older we understand and look at things differently then we once had. I read some of the lower star reviews and I don't think it was slow moving or plotless. The plot is life, and sometimes life isn't gun slinging and damsels in distress.

What a great book. I had just finished reading Angela's Ashes and I'd thought, that even though the books are 60 years apart, and one was written by a man about a boy, and the other by a woman about a girl, they were quite similar.They both drew me in and held me. It's incredible to me when an author can touch on something as unpleasant as poverty but not weigh you down and depress you with it. You aren't horrified by it and unable to finish it, and you aren't gobbling it up for morbid thrills as if staring as you pass by the scene of an accident. You come to admire the characters, and dread the last page.This is one that will always be on my shelf."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was honestly one of the best books I have ever read. I was actually a little shocked at how deeply I loved it and how much I didn't want to put it down. A lot of times books written many years ago have a style to them that makes them a little less enjoyable to read. This didn't have that at all and I actually thought it was a new book just written about the early 1900s time period. The story really flowed nicely.One of the things I think that makes a book great is it's ability to change your perspective. This book really did that for me. In the way I think about money and education. I have a passion now to really succeed through college and get the career I have always wanted and I attribute a lot of that new drive to reading this book.In short, this book is an excellent choice when looking for a good read. It is now one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Tales of the Treasure Chest","review":"This is a wonderful story around the changing lives of 3 women who run a thrift shop.Helena, the protagonist, roles is especially interesting. She has been married to a military officer, who has managed to control her every thought, for nearly 30 years.During this story, you will watch her evolve, fall back, grow some more, then fall back.Helena is trying to break out of long-time conditioned habits, which limit her to waiting for her husband to give her what she really wants.This book would appear to a very wide audience, because there are many things to think about, as you get a glimpse into not just the lives of these 3 women, but also the lives of the people who work with them, and who touch their soul, on other levels.Read this novel to visit a circle of friends, and enjoy sharing their lives, while you choose where you really want to be."},{"Title":"Harmonium: A Book of Poems","review":"Wallace Stevens first revealed his genius in 1923, when his first collection of poetry \\"Harmonium\\" was released. While it was only the first part of his career as a poet, Stevens' first book is in some ways his best -- despite being a little uneven, \\"Harmonium\\" has a rough, passionate quality.\\"At night, by the fire,/The colors of the bushes/And of the fallen leaves,/Repeating themselves,/Turned in the room,/Like the leaves themselves/Turning in the wind,\\" writes Stevens in \\"Domination of Black,\\" a display of the beauty and eerieness of his work. And Stevens sticks to that in poems like \\"Infanta Marina\\" (\\"Her terrace was the sand/And the palms and the twilight\\"), the steamy beauty of \\"O Florida, Venereal Soil,\\" or the eerie surreality of \\"Tattoo.\\"While lush, rich poetry was what suited Stevens the best, \\"Harmonium\\" also has some more minimalist poetry, such as the sparse \\"Gubbinal\\" (\\"The world is ugly,/And the people are sad\\"). And one of his rare strikeouts is the confusing \\"The Man Whose Pharynx Was Bad.\\" Even these are not bad, just not as good as they could be.Virtually anyone can write poetry -- the trick is writing something that stirs the reader, or at least makes them think. Stevens had a rare gift for poetry, and that gift propelled him into fame during his own lifetime. It isn't much of an exaggeration to say that he was one of the great poets of the twentieth century.Stevens dips into both free verse and rhyming poetry, without sticking solidly to anything for any period of time. At times his poetry is just an intellectual pleasure, without any rhyme or rhythm. But in \\"Le Monocle De Mon Oncle,\\" he creates a poem with an almost hymnlike quality -- solemn, ornate and thoroughly beautiful.It's the descriptions that really make his poetry shine. He paints almost everything with color -- sapphire seas, gilt umbrellas, electric fireflies, rotted skulls, and how a \\"red bird flies across the golden floor.\\" And with lines like \\"the light is like a spider./It crawls over the water,\\" Stevens also gave his poetry a note of the dreamlike.Richly surreal and beautiful, \\"Harmonium\\" is a remarkably polished first collection. Wallace Stevens wasn't yet at his peak in the years before 1923, but with \\"Harmonium\\" he became a must-read."},{"Title":"Harmonium: A Book of Poems","review":"This is one of those rare volumes, like the 'Lyrical Ballads' of Wordsworth and Coleridge which announces to the world the arrival of a new major Poet.

The poetry of its music is among the most deeply felt and colorful in all Stevens work.

This year, I made the happy choice of reading Kate Huntington's &quot;His Lordship's Holiday Surprise&quot; first. It turned out to be a good decision on my part because the novel was a truly satisfying read -- romantic, whimsical and full of Christmassy good cheer.Miss Augusta Oglethrope is literally at her wit's end: her nit-witted younger sister (Clarissa) has suddenly decamped London (in order to 'think'), and has left Augusta in sole charge of her three rambunctious children. Determined to find her sister, Augusta grimly makes for the Marquess of Ardath's hunting lodge, sure that her sister has abandoned her children in order to romp with the rakish Ardath. But her hopes are completely dashed when she finds a morose and dejected Ardath and no sign of Clarissa at all (Ardath had proposed marriage to Clarissa, but instead of accepting his offer with all alacrity, the merry widow had rejected Ardath, and he has been comforting himself with alcohol).Augusta is tired and scared and not at all sure what to do next, when Ardath chivalrously steps forward and offers her his help -- he will get the Bow Street Runners to begin searching for Clarissa, and help Augusta care for her niece and nephews. As the days pass with no news from Clarissa, and as Augusta, Ardath and the children try to cope with Clarissa's bewildering absense, something unexpected develops between the no nonsense bluestocking and the rakish Ardath: friendship and mutual respect. In fact their relationship is on the threshold of developing into something warmer and a lot more satisfying. But at the back of both their minds is the worry about Clarissa's fate and whereabouts. Where is Clarissa? Is she all right? And what will Augusta and Ardath do when Clarissa returns and decides that she wants to marry Ardath afterall?&quot;His Lordship's Holiday Surprise&quot; was a very satisfying read. The story was a good one, and the manner in which Kate Huntington fleshed out her characters and the romance between Ardath and Augusta -- tentative and flirtatious in parts, and yet with that romantic sizzle we all would like our romantic heroes and heroines to have -- absolutely brilliant. I also thought that the authour had done a good job in conveying Augusta's panic when she realizes just how much the children have (and will) changed her life (esp if Clarissa never returns). And the manner in which Kate Huntington gradually revealed the full scope of Ardath's character -- from rakish and seemingly a care-for-naught at the beginning of the book, to a responsible and caring gentleman in subsequent chapters -- was really well done. The only character I wasn't partial to was Augusta's niece, Cynthia. I know the child was only supposed to be four, but I had rather hoped that Augusta would have dealt with some of Cynthia's less than desirable characteristics. But then you can't have everything!All in all, &quot;His Lordship's Holiday Surprise&quot; was a terrific read. And if you're looking for an enjoyable and charming Christmassy read, you can't go very wrong with this latest Kate Huntington offering."},{"Title":"His Lordship's Holiday Surprise (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"'Tis the season to be merry, but Miss Augusta Oglethorpe is anything but - thanks to her ninny of a sister who has dashed off to heave knows where, leaving her three young children behind Her upcoming Christmas plans now in total chaos, Augusta decides enough is enough.

But alas, here he is, bitter, jaded, and most decidedly alone. So where is Clarissa? As Augusta and RIchard forge a tentative alliance to search for her and try to tend to her three rambunctions children, something warm and wonderful begins to happen. Is it just the Christmas spirit and the joy of beaming young fances? Or perhaps the herald of new love?This book was an unexpected pleasure. It's languished on my shelf for several holiday seasons until I recently opened it and was surprised. It was not a run-of-the-mill holiday regency. The characters were well drawn and very human, their reactions understandable and humerous in the best way. I was happy with how the arthur resolved the central dilemma - it could have been done poorly and undermined the story, but instead it was the perfect ending to wrap things up. Definitely a holiday star."},{"Title":"His Lordship's Holiday Surprise (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Augusta Oglethorpe is stranded with her widowed sister, Clarissa's three small children just before Christmas. She invades the hunting box of Richard the Marquess of Ardath, who she knows had been pursuing Clarissa. He indeed had been, with certain intentions that included marriage. Alas, for both parties, she is not there nor in fact anywhere to be found.The weeks until Christmas that ensue prove to be both eventful and eye-opening for Augusta the bluestocking and Richard the rake. Poor Augusta's bemused invasion by the children was well done, (deserted by both her cat and her personal maid!).Well of course the pair fall very easily in love with the children as well as each other. In fact Richard rather over does the fond 'father' and practically lives in the quartet's pockets.This was a charming story, with both hero and heroine nicely drawn (if a little lightly). The three children are not horribly good or bad, convincingly childish without being twee. My only complaint in this regard, was that both the adults were far to lenient with the little creatures, apparently being unable to resist melting looks and beseeching big eyes.This and also the very strange fact of just why Richard would want to marry a widow with three very young children kept the story from the five stars. Huntington gives the standard explantion of Richard thinking Clarissa as good a match as any and that he lusted after her - but the children really stretched this piece of conventionality.A light, charming, entertaining confection in keeping with the Christmas setting."},{"Title":"His Lordship's Holiday Surprise (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Miss Augusta Oglethorpe, bluestocking and spinster, has just received the surprise of a lifetime. Her sister just left 3 children on her doorstep! Augusta knows very little about children, and rarely saw her young nieces and nephews.

Together, they try to make the best of the Christmas season with the 3 children.... whose mother may or may not come back.Kate Huntington gives us another charming story, which I can comfortably call one of the best Christmas Regencies I've ever read. It's sweet, funny, heart-warming and touching. It's not predictable, and the precocious children are delightful (even the sometimes bratty 4-year-old, Cynthia). The ending was slightly rushed, but that hardly seemed to matter in light of everything else. If you only read one book for the holidays, I'd recommend this one."},{"Title":"His Lordship's Holiday Surprise (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"I found this book not worth the $$, it was well written but too sweet and hard to finish. Definitly not a page turner."},{"Title":"The Life and Work of Harold Pinter","review":"Having nearly walked out of &quot;The Room&quot; at the Almeida theatre in London, I determined to find out more about Pinter. This book sets the context and is a must for anyone new to Pinter or - like me - too young to have grown up with his work. The account of his early life in London's East End, and subsequent years as an actor in repertory theatre, are especially interesting. The Grocers school in Hackney was outstandingly successful in bringing out the best in its pupils - educationalists today can learn so much from it. And in turn we can learn so much from Pinnter about what it's like to be the &quot;outsider&quot; in a closed society. And his plays are so evocative of their vintage - it's hard to believe for example that as recently as the mid-1950s in England it was perfectly legal for a landlord to place a sign outside a house saying &quot;To let - no blacks or Irish&quot;. The book also reveals Pinter's huge courage and passion in arguing for causes in which he believes. A wonderful book about a man who can justifiably claim to be one of the world's leading playrights."},{"Title":"The Life and Work of Harold Pinter","review":"A thoughtful and admirably complete survey of Pinter's life and career so far, even if it betrays the signs of being an &quot;authorized&quot; biography. I say so far because the author makes it very plain that Pinter is far from a spent force, either creatively or politically. Given the tiresome and almost ritualistic bollocking (a very Pinteresque word) he receives in the British press every time he signs a petition or attends a protest, the book comes on like a stern corrective, exposing the thoughtless double standard for what it is. Far from being a relatively recent fashionable pose taken by a celebrity intellectual, Billington makes clear that Pinter's political outspokenness is an organic consequence of his work in the theatre, which was essentially political from the start. Pinter's plays have followed a slow arc since the late fifties from the domestic to the more specifically political, but the overriding concern has been the same - the potential for language to conceal rather than to reveal meaning, even to corrupt our need to hope that transparency between people is attainable. Hope for Pinter lies in the potential for resistance to this process through imaginative identification with the sufferings of others.If I have a criticism, it is the author's tendency to overstatement in sometimes irritating contrast to his subject's famous economy. Also, that the equivalence between personal intimate action and political reality comes a little too easy. I mean what does the phrase \\"sexual Fascism\\" (p. 377) really mean? I suspect that a victim of actual political Fascism wouldn't find that glib metaphor so easy to digest. Such phrases, which appear here and there in the book, would seem to be an example of the verbal laziness that Pinter himself spends so much time fighting. However, thanks are due to this author for constant emphasis on the actual performance of Pinter's texts, whether written for the screen or the theatre. Billington's comment and analysis of the performances are always insightful and interesting."},{"Title":"The Life and Work of Harold Pinter","review":"Harold Pinter was perhaps one of the few dramatists to have an adjective named after him: the term 'Pinteresque' is still used to describe a certain kind of dramatic writing, in which the pause assumes as much significance as the word. Yet Pinter was so much more than just a dramatist: beginning his career as an actor in touring productions, he was also heavily involved in politics, as well as becoming an Associate Director of London's Royal National Theatre. Billington's biography of him, published while the author was still alive, is definitive: based on extensive research as well as the author's own experience of witnessing Pinter's plays in performance, it traces the author's life from his childhood in Hackney, East London to his pre-eminent position in world theater. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Classical Hebrew Composition","review":"Weingreen forces his reader to think in terms of Hebrew grammar. In order to do the English to Hebrew translations in this book, one has to think about all the subtleties of Hebrew grammar that one takes for granted. Would it be better to use a Niphal or a Qal form of the verb? It's a great way to keep the Hebrew fresh and sharp."},{"Title":"The Principle of Relativity (Dover Books on Physics)","review":"Of course this is a five-star book: it contains two of the mostimportant scientific documents of all time! It is, of course, not a book for beginners: the very Planck, who was the editor of the Annalen der Physik, where the German originals were published, had to ask for explanations a few times, in order to grasp the meaning of the &quot;Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies&quot;. The teaching of relativity is now done in a rather different way, emphasizing, from the beginning, the 4-dimensional picture, as in Taylor-Wheeler's &quot;Spacetime physics&quot;. Einstein's paper is on a modification of electrodynamics to make it agree with the tenets of relativity (the particular inertial frame being used is of no effect at all). In order to do that he finds it necessary to change mechanics, and actually the very basic concepts of mechanics. In contrast, the great paper on general relativity &quot;Foundations of general relativity&quot; has pedagogical preocupations, and is quite readable, including an interesting introduction to tensors which clearly shows that, master of the physics of the problem, Einstein was a novice at the mathematics of it. This book is a treasure. There are also papers by Lorentz, Poincare' and others. Great fun. But, learn your relativity first!"},{"Title":"The Principle of Relativity (Dover Books on Physics)","review":"This is a collection of the original papers that led to the principle of relativity.The book gives excellent insight as to how and why the theory was developed. It clearly shows how the theory better explains certain parts of our universe.The only drawback is that the mathematical level may cause the book to be unapproachable to many. I reccommend at least one year of Calculus if you intend to understand the works fully. Without such a background the book is difficult at best, but still rewarding.If you lack this background you might be better served by reading Einsteins Relativity, the first book in the list above of what purchasers of this book also bought.Nonetheless I agree with the School Science and Mathematics review,&quot;It is really a thrill to read again the original papers by these giants.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Principle of Relativity (Dover Books on Physics)","review":"Reading the original papers would be best, but if you don't read German then the Dover collection is the next best thing. In the paper on special relativity, the Lorentz transformations are derived via formulating and solving a first order pde, a treatment that no textbook presents (first order pdes aren't taught in math physics, in spite of the fact that every set of first order autonomous odes generates a first order pde). It took my teaching the subject to advanced undergrads in later years to realize what many others have by now noticed, namely, you don't need two postulates for special relativity. &quot;Galilean invariance&quot; is enough. The constancy of the speed of light follows from the requirement that there is no special reference frame.Einstein's presentation of GR is unsurpassed for conciseness and clarity, is a model for other researchers to follow when writing papers. Here, he introduces the famous misconception (corrected today in the better texts like Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler) that general covariance is a physical principle. Well, even the greatest minds make mistakes.Feynman wrote well, but no scientist to date has written better than Einstein."},{"Title":"The Principle of Relativity (Dover Books on Physics)","review":"I do not know how I can adequately review this. That this is indispensible to any theoretical physicist is pretty much the extent of what I am about to say. I mean, here you have the greatest scientific giants of all time grappling with some of the deepest, most complicated issues of 20th century physics: you not only get the opportunity of finding out what they really thought about relativity, with all mathematical and philosophical details, but you also are able to see how truly great minds go about solving difficult problems (which, I feel, should be an inspiration for modern theoreticians as to how to solve the problems associated with quantum gravity, string theory, etc.). Just the section of Einstein's paper The Foundations of a General Relativity Theory on the deep, philosophical reasons why a theory of nature should be generaly relativistic are well worth getting this book; I personally think that this one paper is the greatest scientific publication of all time (Principia is certainly bolder, more revolutionary, but Einstein's deepest ruminations, I feel, are almost religious). To be sure, one needs certain mathematical training to get the full benefit of this book, but this could be said of relativity in general; I personally do not think that one can fully comprehend relativity theory, in all its beautiful glory, without this training. Despite this, I still think it is possible, even without sufficient mathematical training, to get a real feel of how these titans thought and felt, even if just by osmosis (you know that profound thoughts are being expressed when you can almost grasp them without really understanding them). In short, it is the duty of every physicist, maybe even every scientist, not just to read, but to EXPERIENCE this book (that is the only way I can adequately describe this; it is an experience)."},{"Title":"The Principle of Relativity (Dover Books on Physics)","review":"This compact collection of English translations of the original papers is a cheap and highly accessible reference book.The book is a chronology of the development of the theory of Relativity. Starting with Lorentz' papers on Michelson's interference experiment and electomagnetic phenomena in moving frames of reference, the book follows the rapid development of the subject from Einstein's ground breaking papers of 1905 on Electrodymanics and Inertia. Minkowski's original paper on Space-Time is a delight: it's always a pleasant surprise when one finds that the explanation of the originator has not been bettered in nearly 100 years!Latter chapters of the book present Einstein's papers on General Relativity -which are mathematically complex. They are definately not the place to start if one wants to learn the principles of General Relativity. Nonetheless, after one has learnt the principles from more accessible materials, such as &quot;The Principles of Cosmology and Gravitation&quot; by M V Berry, these papers can be very useful as original sources that the reader can use in order to grasp the methods by which Einstein presented his revolutionary discoveries.This is an excellent, high value, low cost source that is worth keeping!"},{"Title":"The Principle of Relativity (Dover Books on Physics)","review":"I really do not know how to rate this book. I hope that rating it with three stars could be a neutral point between the opinions of laypeople and the physics' community. This book is a collection of the most important lectures given by Einstein, Lorentz, Minkowski and Weyl that led to the formulation of the theory of relativity in its two parts. The first part is the special theory, which studies the inertial and moving reference frames without considering the effects of gravity. The second part, the general theory, explains the nature of gravity as a consequence of the curvature of Minkowski's four-dimensional space-time. The expositions featured in the book are, of course, the written version of the lectures given decades ago by its authors. Because of this, they are plenty of strange-looking and complex equations to the laypeople but, for any physicist, is a beautiful mathematical symphony that explains with accuracy the principle of relativity. You have to be a physicist to fully understand this book, namely, if you are not a physicist, or, if you are not formally studying physics, please avoid this book!. I am almost sure that you will get tired of reading it after the first lecture if you do not have solid knowledge of physics and mathematics. Try to look somewhere else for less complicated explanations of the relativity. Maybe the book: \\"Relativity: The Special and the General Theory\\" could be useful for you, the laypeople.

This collection includes Lorentz's papers \\"Michelson's Interference Experiment\\" & \\"Electromagnetic Phenomena ...\\" and Minkowski's \\"Space and Time\\". The latter was instrumental in forging the notion of Minkowski 'space' - and forever altered our conception of how we view time vis-a-vis space. Additional notes by Sommerfield are present as an appendix to Minkowski's paper.All this is in addition to the famous papers by Einstein which gave birth to Special & General Relativity. In particular, \\"The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity\\" is, of course, a classic - but a tough read. The paper on Special Relativity, \\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\\", on the other hand, is easily accesible to anyone acquainted with high school mathematics.Even for the non-physicist, with a suitable grounding in the requisite mathematics, this book is a real gem.

The original audience was cientists, so the usual reader will be daunted by formulas and formal description of theories and hipotheses.It is however a must read for physics students and those interested in theory of relativity and a strong reference for PHD thesis and cientific works.I bought it to use in my PHD thesis as reference as the basis of the view of the world where there is no priviledged point of reference, that is, everything is relative, wether in physical sciences or social sciences. This is the essence of the relativism that permeates the post-modern view of world, and historiography today.I strongly recommend it for use as reference for cientists and students, but it is daunting in mathematics, You can use it without knowing lots of math, but you need to understand the concepts derived from the math.

The names are well known to science specalists (and beyond). Nowadays it is common to derive Relativity Theory from Maxwell's Equations (although Maxwell thought they were in error!).

There are no comments or explanations, in addition Sommerfeld's notes.This is a very good book for a reader with the right background, i.e., one well-grounded in physics, especially 19th century physics. The book shows the development of Special Relativity, from original ideas of Lorentz, through Einstein's and on to those of Minkowsky. Likewise one can see the development of General Relativity. I should emphasize that these are original papers, written for an audience that had the necessary background. I do not, however, feel that it is the best choice for a modern student who may not possess this background. For such an audience, I would recommend \\"The Einstein Theory of Relativity\\" by Professor L. Lieber. This book presents both Special and General Relativity using much the same mathematics as Einstein (which is not the way it is done today), but I think that it is easier to follow, having been written for a student (albeit one circa 1945 when Lieber's book was written)."},{"Title":"The Principle of Relativity (Dover Books on Physics)","review":"If you are serious about relavity, read this book and no other.

Its most important feature is the way the author allows students with a little background in mathematics to go through all the topics presented without getting lost or discouraged. The purpose is achieved with a simple but efficient strategy: an easy to follow level is the main body of the book and a lot of examples provide the reader with all the tools necesary to grasp the basics. The higher level material (advanced mathematics) is therefore not indispensable to actually understand Image Enhancement, Image Restoration, Preparation for Automatic Vision, and a little bit of Image Compression."},{"Title":"Image Processing: The Fundamentals","review":"I found the book extremely helpful and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.It gives the solid theoretical background of the methods and algorithms, which range from classical material to more modern techniques, like ICA, graph cuts, etc. At the same time, the book guides the reader in a step by step recipe of how to use techniques, and what to avoid. What I also found extremely useful, for teaching the topic to students, is that there are many examples, which are fully worked out with all the details. The students love it.The MATLAB code, that is included in a CD that comes with the book, is a valuable tool for experimenting with the various techniques, and helping the reader to grasp the secrets associated with the associated techniques and algorithms.Sergios TheodoridisUniversity of Athens"},{"Title":"Image Processing: The Fundamentals","review":"This is a book that many of us wanted to see in the market since long ago. Among all the published books on image processing only a few of them devote enough space to both theoretical fundamentals and practical issues.The mathematical principles are clearly a major concern for the authors, so they are a fundamental part of the book and are very clearly explained. Moreoever, most of the fundamental principles are presented as answers to key questions frequenty posed by anyone seeking to understand the basics of image processing, what makes the book very easy to read and undestand.Another nice distinctive characteristic of the book is the detailed explanation on practical issues and fully developed examples that allow the reader to thoroughly understand how to solve problems and how to implement the main image processing algorithms.The book covers all the topics that one expects to find in an introductory book but also some of the more important advanced topics that have proven to be indispensable for any one aiming to understand modern image processing such as singular value decomposition, independent component analysis, multispectral image processing, homgeneous and inhomogeneous image restoration, etc."},{"Title":"Image Processing: The Fundamentals","review":"It's a very good book in theoretical part, BUT the practical exercises contain many errors; I suggest an accurated revision to the next edition."},{"Title":"William the Conqueror","review":"I received this book (along with others in the series) as a gift when I was about 7.

They bring history alive for children, and are filled with fascinating information. As well as bringing alive an animated, exciting past, they also show how events of the past, are with us today, in so many fascinating ways.William the Conqueror is part of the Ladybird series on great rulers and vividly tells the story of one of the best-known figures in British history, which defeated King Harold at the Battle of Hastings, to become the first real King of a united England.It tells much about the times in which William lived and ruled, for young people, with the lovely illustrations by John Kenney. Kenney draws both scenes of momentous events such as William forcing the captured Harold to take an oath, that Harold would acknowledge William's claim to be the next King of England, and the Battle of Hastings, as well as scenes in the lives of ordinary people at the time, such as that of a peasant Saxon shooing a horse, while his two young children help out.It also, as all Ladybird history books do, it describes how the events described in the book influence life today, and speaks of how King William ruled England during peacetime, and the famous first census that he ordered the Domesday Book to be written, England's first census.Any child that has a love of history, will love this book, and all other Ladybird history books."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"Hayden is a fine writer and obviously cares about teaching. I'm an educator but I'm also a pretty selective reader and I quit reading a book if it's boring or I don't think it's worth it to me. I kept reading this book to the end. She makes you care about her special needs students. Just a warning. For those who don't read books with vulgarity or profanity, this book contains some. But if you can ignore that, then definitely pick up this book, especially if you teach or parent."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"I have read many of Torey Hayden's books and have never been disappointed. She is a very talented special ed teacher and has changed many lives for the better."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"READING THIS BOOK, I COULDN'T TURN THE PAGES FAST ENOUGH. I DEFINATELY WILL BE READING THE OTHER BOOKS SHE HAS WRITTEN. PARTS OF THIS BOOK WERE SAD, BUT PARTS WERE ALSO INSPIRING. GREAT READ!"},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"Special needs teacher Torey Hayden brings us the story of another year in her classroom -- this time with an aide who's got emotional problems of her own.Ladbrooke Taylor, mother of severely autistic Leslie, is a beautiful woman with a PhD. Yet beneath that, she struggles with alcoholism, promiscuity, low self-esteem, a crumbling marriage and a difficult child. Most mornings, she tells Torey, it's all she can do to get out of bed.Despite Torey's initial misgivings, Lad soon becomes an integral part of the classroom. She learns to work with the children - sisters Shemona and Geraldine, and their cousin Shamie, all victims of the violence in Northern Ireland; schizophrenic, severely abused Dirkie; sexually precocious, academically lagging Mariana; and her own Leslie.This book is unlike Hayden's others, as the focus is largely on Ladbrooke instead of the children (though there is a fair amount on their progress as well). Some readers might not like the story as well, if they are accustomed to, and prefer, hearing about troubled children. However, in many ways, Lad is indeed \\"just another kid.\\"When the school year ends, there are no neat, happy endings. Although just about everyone has made some sort of progress with their individual issues, it would be unrealistic to expect students placed in a self-contained classroom to suddenly achieve total normalcy.In the case of Torey and Ladbrooke, however, they progress from Ladbrooke's being \\"just another kid\\" to true equal friends -- a relationship they have maintained in all the years since."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"I loved this book and the way Torey Hayden treats these special children. I have read all of her books and liked every one.She just have been put on this earth for what she does for these children. Excellent writing."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"This book was fantastic. I had only read one of Haydens books previous to this one but you can be assured that I will have to get my hands on her whole collection."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"Torey Hayden once again has written a powerful, moving story. I read the story this past fall, and even now I still think about the people in the story and wonder where they are now. In this book Torey focuses primarily on her relationship with her teaching assistant, and I would have liked some more detailed information on the actual students. However, Torey still presents a gripping account of her students' struggles as well as her assistant's difficulties. Once again Torey helps bring about miraculous improvements in the lives of both her students and her assistant. However, one child has been so badly traumatized by her life in Northern Ireland that she deteriorates markedly while the other students blossom. Torey tries hard to save this child, but in the end her problems are too complex for a teacher to handle. I still wonder about what happened to this child, and I pray that perhaps someone, somewhere can help her. Torey has once again written a memorable book that will have a lasting impact on the readers."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"This is Torey's best book. If you are only going to read one of Torey's books this should be the one. All her books are great, but this is book stuck with me the longest. It was a great book."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"&quot;Just Another Kid&quot; has become one of my favorite books by Torey. Probably because I see a little of myself in the Ladbrooke. Not the alcohol problem, mind you. reading Torey's books has inspired my interest in Psychology and Education very much. I think that it is such a wonderful way to spend one's life. What a wonderful career, what could be better than to give your time to those that need you most. In regards to the dispute about the title, Ladbrooke, was just another kid. SHe had problems that she needed help with and she couldn't do it on her own. Her problems show us that problems don't go away because one has grown up. Her vulnerability gave her the innocence of one of Torey's disturbed children. well that's all I have to say. I highly reccommend all of her other books. Can't wait for the new one's she is writing!!!!!"},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"As usual with Torey's books, I was unable to put this book down and finished within two days. The classroom setting and children all kept me turning the page. Torey helping her assistant, Lad, proved to be an interesting dynamic to read. As always, Torey's book was easy to read, fun, informative, and entertaining."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"This is the best book Hayden has written!! I love hearing about her kids however it is Shemona who holds my heart in this book!All her books are great.

Thank you for sharing your life with us Torey!!!"},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"Torey Hayden is a powerful person and a great story teller. I have read all her books more than once, and I am only in 8th grade. After reading her books, they have made me think about becoming a physchologist, or some other type of person who works with austistic children, when I grow up. Torey is a super person and has made some peoples lives a lot happier than they were before."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"I loved this book. I believe that adults also have appeal and that is not a property solely owned by children. Ladbrooke was a delightful woman who overcame big hurdles and rose like a winner. I loved her! Ladbrooke's bond with Shemona was a classic in the healing powers of love. As for Ladbrooke, You Go, Girl! We're rooting for you!"},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"I disagree with the other reviewer. I think the title describes this book beautifully, because the alcoholic adult in the story WAS &quot;just another kid&quot; and that's the way Hayden treated her. I found this a deeply moving book. It is easy to love and want to help small children, even difficult ones. It is harder to have the same kind of feelings for adults. That Hayden showed so well that adults are &quot;just other children&quot; was beautifully done, I thought."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"I am a twelve year old boy and I absolutely love this book. It shows how problems can be overcome with a healthy helping of love and care"},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"Well, this book was altogether well done, but honestly the title, &quot;Just Another Kid&quot; would almost imply that it would be about the CHILDREN. They spend way too much time focused on the alcoholic woman in the book instead of the actual students, who were far more interesting. I would recommend other Torey Hayden books over this one."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"This is one of my favorite books. It's good to know that Ladbrooke was able to sort out her problems. I liked how Torey got Shemona to talk and not be afraid of her sister. What happened to Geraldine absolutely broke my heart, though I thought what she did to Shamie was disgusting. It's awful that a child deteriorates emotionally like that due to a tragedy that she can't understand. I hope to read more Torey Hayden books."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"This book was given to me by a friend in 10th grade.

I wait to be able to read yet another book by you! ~Tara"},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"As usual, Hayden delivers a soul-searching emotionally touching masterpiece. I disagree with other reviewers in their views that Hayden focuses too much on Ladbrooke. Indeed, I found it to be one of the book's major strengths that not only do we get detailed accounts of the children and who they are but we get the added bonus of Ladbrooke's story, which to me was quite a touching one. I could see a lot of myself in Ladbrooke and I think a lot of people can. The self-hate and the alcohol that she tried to numb it with is a familiar story to many. You find yourself feeling so sorry for her and wanting her to believe that she is just as competent as anybody else, and at the same seeing yourself in there and thinking that maybe it applies to you too. I cheered when she got Shemona to talk - not only did it immensely help her own self-esteem but it obviously helped Shemona more than words could tell. An absolute win-win situation. Torey has had such an incredible impact on people's lives, it is just so amazing to read about her kids and fight along with them as they try to make it in a world where they don't fit in. I highly reccomend this book and anything else by the author. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"Those are the two words that summed up this book for me. When I was through raeding it all I felt was sad and mad. There was a child in it (not mentioning his or her name) that the whole time I honestly felt needed a good spanking since obviously nothing else was going to work. It made me think back to each child who I wasn't able to help and the horrible things that had later on happened to them.Whle this book is good I recommend it in doses as it made me way too angry to read in one sitting. Your typical loveable Hayden children are here, but there is a viper among them"},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"In this book, Torey Hayden teaches a challenging class for emotionally disturbed children consisting of Shamie, Geraldine and Shemona, three refugees from Northern Ireland, one of whom (Shemona) is an elective mute; Dirkie, who has schizophrenia; Mariana, who is sexually precocious but academically behind; and Leslie, also autistic and unable to communicate. Hayden could badly use an aide, and she accepts Leslie's mother, Ladbrooke, who is a beautiful but aloof women with a history of alcoholism and child abuse. Through their relationship, Ladbrooke comes to trust Hayden and begins to face up to her problems. Through working with the children, Ladbrooke develops considerable self-esteem. All but one of the children improve, as well, and make dramatic gains in academic and social skills. In an epilogue, we learn of updates, the most remarkable perhaps being Ladbrooke's. This is anything but a grim read, however, Hayden seasons her book with a healthy dollop of black humor."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"I am also the mother of a \\"Special Needs\\" child; I happened to discover \\"Twilight Children\\", Torey Hayden's most recent book by chance in a local bookstore. I was spellbound and couldn't put it down, and when I had read that book, I ordered everything else she ever wrote from Amazon (how's that for a recommendation?). This book, (and I say this without exaggeration) literally made me gasp at some parts and cry at some others. This is a book that I feel would be of value to parents of special needs children, but also to members of Alcoholics Anonymous, or anyone who believes (or wants to believe) that miracles can still happen to the most hopeless of \\"lost causes\\"."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"Torey Hayden is a master at writing about her experiences in the classroom..... I am a mother of a Special Needs child and found her book to be both informative, inspiring, and honest. This book is the type of book that you want to read all at once, yet you don't want it to end either. Torey Hayden keeps you interested and wondering what is going to happen next. I plan on purchasing all of her books as I am so happy with this first book of hers that I have read. You will not be disappointed if you buy this book....for anyone who is curious or has a real interest in what goes on in a Special Needs classroom... of course during this timeline and with these students and this teacher... you will be surprised at the honesty, reality and the love and warmth that radiate from the pages of this book. We can only hope and pray that all of the Special Needs teachers are exactly like Torey and that their love of children and interest in their future is a basis of what All special needs teachers have in their own hearts (which I believe is true). I can't say enough about this book, as it is truly a treasure to read and own.Thank You Torey!Susan"},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"Awakens awareness to children who are different.

I found someone else who was \\"like me,\\" and it was wonderful to know I wasn't the only one.\\"Tense, she became less articulate. Frightened at finding herself unable to say what she wanted, she panicked. The panic destroyed whatever bit of expression she was still capable of.\\"That is by far, my favorite quote that describes me perfectly. Reading it was an eye-opening experience. The actual storyline was good, and entertaining, but it wasn't anything exceptional otherwise. But I thought overall it was worth reading."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"This is to me a perfect book! I have read all of Hayden's other books and this is my favorite. This book tells the usual story of a classfull of behaviorally challenged kids, and adds to it the story of one of the children's mothers Ladbrooke Taylor. The children and their various troubles and mishaps are easy to picture in your mind. While reading this and all of her other books I always feel as though I am there witnessing these events in person!Torey manages to incorporate the heart wrenching story of mother Ladbrooke into the book without taking away from the story of the children. The most beautiful parts of this book occur when Ladbrooke reaches out to Torey for help, in particular a moment that occurs inside a women's bathroom stall after something happens to one of the children.This book has some gut wrenching moments in it but not the nauseatingly horrific images and stories contained in Murphey's Boy and Ghost Girl. This makes it a more easy read than the above mentioned. I would recommend to first time Torey readers that they start with this book or Somebody Else's Kids."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"Excellent book -- gripping, can't put down once you start. Absolutely fabulous."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"I have read Torey's GHOST GIRL, MURPHY'S BOY, ONE CHILD and THE TIGER'S CHILD and found them all to be excellent so I was pretty disappointed with this book. I can't exactly pinpoint why, though.Maybe it was that it focused on multiple children rather than just one or maybe it was that it was focused so much on Ladbrooke, a mother of one of Torey's students. Yes that was probably the reason. We read more about Ladbrooke than we did about the children and their problems and that was very dull."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"Once again Ms. Hayden has captived me.

They have all kinds of different problems and together they make progress. It is not always success stories, but that's good. It's real.

It is an interesting book."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"I love all of Torey Hayden's books, but in some ways this one has the best characterizations and interplay between the characters. Shamie and Shemona are such special people, with a rare gift of the human soul. Mariana was a brat. Geraldine's inner self had been shattered, but she showed occasional glimpses of hope. I found Leslie and Dirkie oddly likable. Leslie was a tyrant, but this is understandable, as her &quot;father&quot; Tom had tyrannized her into it. (It worries me that she was allowed to stay with him, because he has problems.) Dirkie was impossible, in an understandable way. And Ladbrooke was a terrific example of the resiliency of the human spirit, just like the kids. They were all lucky to have known a great teacher."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"Ms. Hayden does a fabulous job of discussing the needs of emotionally disturbed and disadvantaged youth. Ken Grant of Massachusetts and New Hampshire also wrote a book of his own life as an abandoned,abused,negelected youngster in state care and how some individuals, many teachers, showed him kindness along the way when others wouldnt.Another story lesser known is Ken Grant, a man who has been driven into homelessness and joblessness perhaps by the government itself where he worked at a defense contractor and had a story published about his search for his father.After the story appeared in the newspaper he became chronically unemployable, was denied a decent job with decent health insurance for over 10 years.Grant found state and state subcontractor records santized and perhaps his own book manuscript viewed as a political weapon. Grant wrote an autobiography detailing his own experiences both positive and negative and with a spiritual, not a political, bent. Grant discusses among other things how God led him through his own tribulations as a handicapped,abandoned and abused and neglected youngster in New England.Grant has never been able to get decent work since his own story came out and it has been a question whether political forces have been at work to \\"teach him a lesson\\" for 'daring' to offer objective commentary on life in state child care. Grant wrote of triumphs in finding private individuals who cared and his work is a testimony to their caring as much as his own narrative.Grant and Pelzer have much in common.Grant wrote his book first but Pelzer succeeded in getting it published where Grant has been the ongoing target of harassment and such."},{"Title":"Just Another Kid","review":"imagine you self wakeing one morning and getting beaten to death by you mother. well i am shure that this has never happened to you before but it happened to dave pelzer in the book a child called it. in this book the only way that dave could ecape all the pain from the beating was by going to school. his mother had starved him badly and so when he went to school he stole food out of peoples lunch boxes. then the nurse started to figure out what was going in his house hold and started counting all of the marks that he had on his body. then they had put dave in a new home. i will leave the rest for you to find out."},{"Title":"The Accidental Millionaire: Leaping From Chance To Mastery In The Game of Life","review":"What an incredible disappointment! Is one star as low as I can go? Nothing, lots and lots of nothing, is what this book contains. Unless you like to read, over and over again, the words Me, I, My, Me, I, I and Oh yes, ME, don't bother. Where is the Beef? I have never seen such a narcissistic endeavor. It was a total waste of money and expectation. The hype I received from the E-Zine Queen convinced me I should buy this book. That's the one and only chance she had to gain my respect. It seems a club of mutual admirers got together and decided to endorse this shallow, boring fake. What a shame. Count me out of this network of self admirers. I have been robbed."},{"Title":"The Accidental Millionaire: Leaping From Chance To Mastery In The Game of Life","review":"Disclosure: I bought this book online after hearing Ms Frank's teleclass and then emailed for a refund. Four weeks later, her assistant responded: they anticipated no refunds because everyone loved the book! And a few weeks after that, someone called me, demanding why I didn't like the book! I gave up and donated the book to a local library.Ms Frank autographed my book, \\"Cathy I believe in you.\\" An immediate credibility-buster: does she really believe in everyone who forked over twenty bucks to buy her book? And if so, why?If we believe Ms Frank, her success was lucky but not at all accidental.First, when leaving her abusive husband, Ms Frank needed a lawyer -- and her mother just happened to work for a lawyer who could take the case! Many abused spouses have trouble getting a lawyer to take them seriously.Frank says she walked away from the successful business she had built with her husband. Clearly her \\"accidents\\" began later -- she should have had some kind of written agreement.Second, Frank got involved with computers and then moved easily to training. She was in the right place at the right time with the right talents. She likes to make the move seem easy. When a training company asks for a tape, she just calls someone she knows and asks to give a class. And they say yes! Not many people have those kinds of connections.But the most frustrating part of this book is the misleading title. First, Frank's success was planned. As soon as she left her husband, she sat on her sister's couch and made a plan. (How many abused women have sisters living 3 hours away who can take them in? That's another story.) She writes about the way she set up her website -- but doesn't tell us how she learned these techniques. Accidental? I don't think so.But the real quibble I have is, \\"What can we learn from an accident?\\"By definition, accidents are unplanned and unpreventable!How do we create our own accident?The website tips are easily available elsewhere and they're not clearly explained. Anyway, Frank's own website is filled with links that lead nowhere. I tried to follow links to an advertised class. After being led through a form that demanded all kinds of information -- for a free class - I was taken back to the announcement page! There was no place to email for help.So Ms Frank just is not credible as a resource for Internet marketing.This book will no doubt be purchased by people who hear the author, appreciate her speaking skills and want more. She comes across as likeable so they may be reluctant to criticize. I suggest catching her on a free teleclass...you'll get everything that's in this book and maybe more."},{"Title":"The Accidental Millionaire: Leaping From Chance To Mastery In The Game of Life","review":"The Accidental Millionaire is such a delightful and informative read.

If you have ever been in a relationship that doesn't support your highest good, you MUST read this.I am not sure that I can actually articulate how powerful this book is but I will do my best to share what really impacted me.Personally, I have always been a firm believer that the most successful people in the world are just people. They get up in the morning, put their pants on one leg at a time and face the challenges of the day. The difference comes when they choose to use each moment to advance skillfully towards a goal.What are your goals?The Accidental Millionaire gets to the core of what truly motivates you individually and provides chapter summaries called Something Successful to Think About. The success strategies give a little nudge and really make you think about ownership of your destiny.Here are a few success strategies that really stuck with me.- Included is a three step plan to living your purpose and mission (this is really powerful stuff and it will make you truly think)- Mastery of decision making based on your top three values- Facing your fears and going for the gold anywayOf course this is just a small sampling of what you can expect and rest assured, Stephanie over delivers in this book. Plus, I had to contact my friend Viki who recommended the book and thank her because I now fully understand why she said I had to read the book.Here's what I said to Viki regarding her nudge to read the book. \\"I cannot thank you enough for recommending this book. You know what was really freaky for me? Stephanie uses much of the same language I do and her planning philosophy is similar to my POWER Planning Process. Plus she talks about POWERFULLY communicating business messages which is my tag line. Eerily cool! Thanks for the recommendation. Great timing.\\""},{"Title":"The Accidental Millionaire: Leaping From Chance To Mastery In The Game of Life","review":"Stephanie's personal story is a great read and full of tools to produce the results you want in your life and business. Stephanie tells it like it is and writes just like she speaks and, if you have met Stephanie, you know this is delightful. You really shouldn't miss this if you are searching to improve your business results. Most of all, enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Accidental Millionaire: Leaping From Chance To Mastery In The Game of Life","review":"I had a hard time putting this one down. Stephanie gives us the opportunity to crawl into her head to share and benefit from her experiences as she delivers useful, relevant information in a refreshing way that touches emotionally as she bares her soul. You'll want a highlighter in hand as there are many 'A-ha's' between the lines in addition to the Useful Tools and Specific Action Steps that are given at the end of each chapter. I experienced a 'Paradigm Shift' as I read about the different types of ADD. \\"Reading\\" Stephanie is no different than meeting Stephanie, or hearing her \\"Speak\\" (which I've had the distinct pleasure to do)...she's a real 'down to earth' Wisconsin girl and you can't get much better than that! Stephanie's heart is in the right place and you'll 'feel' that when you read The Accidental Millionaire (and you'll find out what the title is all about too!). The 'feeling' you'll get from Stephanie's work...(books, websites, products, coaching services, etc)...is... Love, because THAT, is what Stephanie Frank is about... Providing high quality service to \\"Empower\\" Entrepreneuers at a great value, from a loving heart-space, but don't take MY word for it, Read the book, go to her websites and find out for yourself...you'll be glad you did!

Rarely do I ever read a book cover to cover. Like Stephanie Frank, I have a touch of ADD so I tend to get bored partway through a book or just skim and get the nuggets.But when I got my copy of the Accidental Millionaire when it first came off the press earlier this year (2005), I literally could NOT put it down. I was moved to tears several times before I'd even reached the end of the first chapter. (I must say, I LOVE a book that moves me!)I imagine it took Stephanie quite some courage to be so vulnerable and bare her soul in this masterful book. She very cleverly weaves her own personal story into every single chapter - then draws lessons from her journey for the reader to immediately apply to her/his life. Plus, she generously shares useful resources in each chapter.I definitely saw myself in many places in this book. Stephanie is a powerful inspiration - to us women in particular - to stand in our power, to speak up for what we want and need, to reach out for help and to take courageous action to follow our dream.My copy of this book is dog-eared: covered in my own notes, post-its and corners of pages folded down. I find myself frequently recommending this book to my coaching clients - especially those budding authors who have their own compelling story with life/business lessons to share. (I've written and released three e-books myself since reading Stephanie's book!)In summary, I believe The Accidental Millionaire is a shining example of how to inspire others to be the best they can be by drawing from your own personal experience. I'm reminded of a quote by Ghandi: \\"My life is my message.\\"Enthusiastically,Mari SmithSuccess Coach[...]PS - I highly recommend Stephanie Frank's e-book too: \\"Makeover My Website!\\" Of the gazillions of e-books I buy/download, it's one of the few I printed out in full and read cover-to-cover.

While this book has some nice photos and some interesting facts about sea life, it is also filled with religious propaganda -- which is fine if that's what you're looking for, but I wasn't and now I seriously regret the purchase. I think the description should have been much more clear about the preaching contained in the book - the single reference to \\"God\\" was an insufficient warning."},{"Title":"Spacial Delivery","review":"In my opinion Gordon R. Dickson (1923-2001) is one of the most consistently entertaining American science fiction authors of the 20th Century.His early novel, Spacial Delivery, first published in 1961, is an excellent example of Mr. Dickson's ability to utilize shopworn SF themes to craft an amusing and perceptive story.The planet Dildia is an object of diplomatic desire for both the humans and their space faring adversaries the Hamnoids. Unfortunately Dildia is inhabited by fully intelligent beings, the bear like Dilbians.Imaging an intelligent bear that walks upright weight about 1500 pounds and stands 9 to 10 feet tall. The Dilbians are a low technology society but have elaborate social codes involving clans and respect for physical strength and individual combat.Both the humans and the Hamnoids must plot to curry favor with the natives at the expense of the other party. Although the diplomatic mystery dancing is not a major plot element it does add a colorful layer of interest and background to the story.John Tardy is \\"drafted\\" to serve on Dildia. Like the draft that use to be in effect in the US until President Nixon terminated it, once drafted you have to go where they send you and do what you are told. Tardy is not pleased having his career plans interrupted but he reports for duty on Dildia as ordered.Before I continue I have to inform the reader that the Dilbians names and the names they apply to humans and Hammoids are descriptive, comical and add considerably to the charm and entertainment of this book. The human ambassador, Joshua Guy, \\"Little Bite\\" informs Tardy \\"Half-Pint\\" that he must rescue a female human, 'Greasy Face\\" who has been kidnapped by the Dilbian the \\"Streamside Terror\\" due to a misunderstanding with his female object of desire \\"Boy Is She Built'. Tandy, \\"Half-Pint\\" is mailed to a show down with the \\"Streamside Terror\\". Yes, mailed in a harness attached to the back of one \\"Hill Bluffer\\" the local Dilbian mailman. It does sound a little silly but in the context of the story and the world Dickson creates it results in a very entertaining story."},{"Title":"Signature Style: Creating Beautiful Interiors","review":"A must-have book for anyone who loves beautiful interiors.

So many of us today -- especially those at mid-life -- are engaged in a search to find meaning and happiness. We often ask, as Peggy Lee once did, \\"Is that all there is?\\" The purpose of this book is show how Aristotle is an effective guide on that search, and how he can help each of us find our own practical answer to a critically important question, \\"What's next?\\"In an interview to appear in the July/August (2005) issue of Chamber Executive magazine, O'Toole observes that \\"Aristotle was the most practical of all great philosophers. His audience was the business and political leadership of his day. He offered them wisdom they could apply in their own lives -- practical advice on matters ranging from ethical business practices to effective philanthropy. Aristotle even describes 'virtuous non-retirement' -- the lifelong commitment to engage in leisure work which is characterized by pursuit of the 'highest good' of individual excellence and the 'complete good' of community service. He offers practical tests to help us determine how much wealth we need to support us while we engage in those activities.\\"O'Toole goes on to say, \\"So my challenge was not making Aristotle relevant to today's successful professionals and managers; instead, I faced the nearly impossible task of making his difficult language clear to modern readers [begin italics] without dumbing it down [end italics]. I had to find a way to explore the depth and complexity of Aristotle in a way that makes sense in an age of sound bites and blogs. After all, who ever heard of a [begin italics] serious [end italics] self-help book? But that's what I set out to write.\\"As O'Toole explains in this book, Aristotle struggled with many of the same difficult circumstances (more than two centuries ago) which most of us face in 2005: \\"...in his career as a teacher and a consultant to leaders of ancient Athens, Aristotle thought long and hard about what it means to live a good life and how much it takes to finance it. His thoughts on this matter are particularly applicable today, given the baby boom generation's anxiety over insufficient retirement savings and shaky investments: Aristotle shows how we can find happiness at almost any level of income. Moreover, he argues that the ability to find true contentment correlates only tangentially with the amount of money one has cached away. Unlike so many of today's \`life advisors,' Aristotle integrates financial planning with the broader task of life planning.\\"Throughout human history, there has been a constant challenge to get lifestyle and quality of life in appropriate balance. As O'Toole notes, \\"Aristotelian ethics concern moral decisions related to how we should allocate the limited time of our lives. We must each plan how we will allocate our energies among such activities as earning, learning, playing, being with friends and family, and participating in the community. As we make these choices, Aristotle warns, we will fail to achieve 'the chief good' -- that is, we will fail to be happy -- if we pursue the wrong ends.\\"If the pursuit of philosophy is to serve as a practical guide to action, and I believe it is, then the wisdom which Aristotle gained from his own experiences will guide and inform our own pursuit and achievement of \\"the chief good\\": personal happiness. In the Foreword to one of O'Toole's previously published books, The Executive's Compass, Lodwrick M. Cook (former chairman and CEO of Atlantic Richfield Company) explains O'Toole's use of the central metaphor: \\"The beauty of the compass is that it provides a framework for the executive to create order out of the growing chaos of cultural diversity and conflict of values. Like a real compass, [O'Toole's 'value compass'] helps us to find where we are, where others are, where we want to go, and how to get there. Like the Aspen experience itself, O'Toole's compass is aimed at developing executive judgment by expanding our understanding of the interrelationships of fundamental values.\\"Cook's comments are also relevant to Creating the Good Life. For those now struggling to define and then create the good life for themselves, whatever their current circumstances may be, Aristotle's wisdom can indeed serve as a \\"compass.\\" In this volume, O'Toole prepares his reader to use it effectively."},{"Title":"Creating the Good Life :Applying Aristotle's Wisdom to Find Meaning and Happiness","review":"The book is a recast of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics which was summarized ih Mortimer Adler's Time of Our Lives. What James O'Toole does well is to weave his personal story and struggles with these issues in a language and context of today. I found this personal view refreshing and move Aristotle's theory to a very practical level. The book is clearly aimed at baby boomers, like himself, who are struggling with meaning and unfulfilled career aspirations. Personally, O'Toole's writing got me to think more about the question of whether all vices are \\"fun and exciting\\" and all virtue is \\"boring\\". The book is easy to ready and allows one to access easily Aristotle's important writings. I recommend it for anyone struggling with these issues.P.B.Boston, MA"},{"Title":"Creating the Good Life :Applying Aristotle's Wisdom to Find Meaning and Happiness","review":"This book starts out with a strong review of Aristotle's ethics the application of these ethics to life in the 21st century. The writing is clear and easy to follow, even if you have no background in philosophy.The second half of the book is weak. The book profiles people that the author believes have clearly failed or succeeded at finding happiness as Aristotle would define it. Unfortunately, almost all of the examples cited are wealthy, white men in their 50s, 60s and 70s. The book would have been much stronger if the author had profiled a broader range of people."},{"Title":"Creating the Good Life :Applying Aristotle's Wisdom to Find Meaning and Happiness","review":"This is a book where the author tells about his own expirience on self therapy in order to accept the fact that he isn't as good as he would like to be in his professional area (despite he thinks he is teaching how to run a good life - i.e. finding hapiness despite you don't have the recognition that you would like in your professional area). Perhaps it can be helpful for someone who doesen't have a grate consciousness about him/herself and/or face the same problem of the author."},{"Title":"No Comebacks","review":"Forsyth is best known for his taut thrillers, especially The Day of Jackal, but this collection of short stories reveals him a very competent crafter of clever short stories. Originally written in the early to late '70s (and three of which appeared in Playboy), each of the ten tales is a mini-morality tale, with a lighthearted tone and a twist of some sort. Their unifying theme is revenge/comeuppance&oacute;each story is about someone getting their just desserts one way or another. The exception to this is \\"Duty\\", which is not light at all and quite different in theme and perspective, and for those reasons, feels wholly out of place.Two of the stories feature wealthy protagonists, including the title story, which tells of a handsome, successful English businessman who can have anything he wants from life and yet is still bored. It's the old \\"money can't buy you happiness\\" story, until one day he falls for a married woman. She admits the mutual attraction but won't leave her husband, and so the tycoon decides to send a hitman to solve the problem. The mechanics of the hitman's assignment are very compelling, and it all leads to an obvious twist that reaffirms the moral. \\"A Careful Man\\" is another rich man tale, but in this case, the wealthy coin dealer is dying of cancer and has no one he wants to leave his fortune to&oacute;least of all his detestable sister and her family. His solution is fairly clever and the fun is in watching the odious family catch up with what the reader already knows.Another set of stories feature unassuming hard-working middle-aged men who have yet to reap many fruits from their labors, and are generally married to unpleasant frigid nags. In \\"The Emperor\\", a bank manager vacations with his wife on a tropical island for the first (and probably last) time. It's basically the best experience of his life, and on the last day he quite daringly sneaks out for some sport fishing. This is transformative in a fairly predictable way, but satisfying nonetheless. In \\"Money With Menaces\\", an unassuming man comes across a \\"swingers\\" magazine on the train, and is intrigued by the idea of meeting a woman for sex. He falls right into an obvious blackmail scheme, but for once Forsyth hides the twist until the end, providing perhaps the best resolution of all the stories. \\"Privilege\\" starts with a small businessman who has been libeled in the newspaper and seeks redress. His lawyer dissuades him from suing, pointing out that winners of such suits usually incur huge financial costs that aren't worth the satisfaction of winning. Studying the libel statutes for a few days, he spots a possible form of redress. This story seems a little strange, as Britain has some of the harshest libel penalties in the Western world. \\"Used in Evidence\\" is about an old man who may or may not have killed his wife thirty years previously.Three of the stories are set in Ireland, a place Forsyth had a great personal interest in. \\"There Are No Snakes In Ireland\\" is a straight-out revenge tale, pitting a hard-working Indian student against his persecutor, a racist UVF thug. \\"There Are Some Days&Ouml;\\" is a comedy of errors about the heist of a truck of French brandy which goes completely pear-shaped. As in other stories, the reader knows more than the characters, and the pleasure comes in watching it all unfold. \\"Sharp Practice\\" takes place on a train, where a judge, priest, and humble worker pass the time with a friendly game of poker. Anyone who's knows a bit about con artistry will see the setup and likely result a mile away, but it's still good fun.All in all this is a very solid, if not spectacular set of stories. No doubt due to his journalistic background, Forsyth is great with the details of the stories, especially how people go about their work. His characters tend to be types rather than individuals, but for the kind of stories he tells, that's all you really need. As morality tales they are all set up and executed quite cleverly. And yet for all that, there's a kind of disposable element to them; none will make you sit up and say \\"wow\\"."},{"Title":"No Comebacks","review":"Frederick Forsyth is an excellent author, and No Comebacks will serve as a fine introduction for readers new to his work. If you're already familiar with Forsyth, this is a collection of short stories similar to The Veteran. The stories in No Comebacks are shorter, usually about 20-30 pages each, ten in all. They are a little more lighthearted than the tone of Forsyth's novels, which are predominantly serious, and most involve an unexpected twist or turn along the way (sometimes saved for the very end). There's a story in here for everyone: a playboy in pursuit of a married woman, a victim of prejudice out for revenge, an answer to a mid-life crisis, a way to handle extortion, a response to a soiled reputation, and a unique way to settle an estate, to name a few. Timeless little episodes that are well-written and delightful to read."},{"Title":"No Comebacks","review":"The short story demands a special talent and a special market. The diminishing market has, not surprisingly, just about dried up the development of talent. Back when the Saturday Evening Post, Sports Afield, the Farm Quarterly, Colliers and so many other periodicals kept a roaring fire under the genre we took swell short stories and short story writers for granted -- they were all over the place.Not a single name comes to me from those bountiful years -- I have to go back to Poe and the old master, Ambrose Bierce, to even throw out a couple of examples.The collection in No Comebacks was a welcome surprise, and I had to stumble onto the volume purely by accident, not knowing that Forsyth had even written short stories. He's got the talent for it, that's for sure.Any reader who appreciates good, crisp short stories will love every one of these by Forsyth. But maybe the audience for them has ebbed, too. Which may explain why this worthy book is not readily available.Doug Briggs"},{"Title":"No Comebacks","review":"I've read this book many years back and recently I read it again. &quot;No Comebacks&quot; is a real great book. Every story has its' own impression. Amazingly every story gives one common impression of a real fix, i.e. No Comebacks. There Are Some Days, There are No Snakes.. and of course No Comeback are really very good stories. The beauty of the book is that there are soft crimes &amp; no violence. This is probably one of the best work of Forsyth !"},{"Title":"No Comebacks","review":"The ten stories in the book are on a wide range of premises, from a man plotting to kill the husband of the woman he loves, to an indian exacting revenge on a co-worker. Half of the stories are relevant to Ireland, a country which Forsyth has a great interest in.The stories are all very believable, and some of them have shocking twists which will make the book unforgettable."},{"Title":"No Comebacks","review":"Forsyth is a master of detail, encased in tight, fine prose. In this collection of short stories, his hallmark of fine fiction derived from real-life situations prevails in an assortment of unexpected, even surprising, tales mostly of ordinary people leading ordinary lives. Several command re-reading, especially \\"The Emperor\\", which women will hate and men will adore."},{"Title":"No Comebacks","review":"I loved the twist endings, some were funny, some insighrful, others a little boring, but the overall effect was good. Great writing style, and interesting enough plots for short stories and the irony of life."},{"Title":"No Comebacks","review":"No Comebacks was the first short story collection that introduced me to the dark side of society in a way that felt incredibly real. I was a teenager when I came across an audiobook (read by Frank Muller) from Recorded Books.I was riveted to these stories of people who--more often than not--get themselves into strange predicaments and have to resort to violence or the like to get out. Often the stories end with a twist on the level of O. Henry (except more dire, of course) where we learn something new about the character(s) that Forsyth had previously held back from us.I have yet to read any of Forsyth's novels but I keep going back to this collection time and time again, enjoying them as much as the first time (perhaps more now that I am older and can identify with them more)."},{"Title":"No Comebacks","review":"I have returned to this book time and again, and it never fails to grip... even though I have read the stories before. Forsyth is a master at his craft, and every one of these stories is sure to grab you, to tease you into trying to guess where he is taking you, and finally to surprise you with the twist at the end. I have recommended these stories to several friends, and all have agreed with my judgment. The plots of the ten stories include deception, assasination, blackmail, revenge, confidence games -- but each one is a gem unto itself... guaranteed to entertain the reader. I recommend No Comebacks very highly."},{"Title":"No Comebacks","review":"When I finished reading these stories, I felt very sad about the fact that the author preferred to write novels."},{"Title":"No Comebacks","review":"Forsyth's method is almost formulaic. These stories are carefully planned, then meticulously realised. You can see how he has an idea, researches and/or thinks it through, then spells it out precisely, neither skipping nor wasting words. There's no ebullience or flights of wit, surrealism or insight. The characters are all described dispassionately, at a distance, and are frightfully British - reserved, self-controlled, non-demonstrative. A strange way to describe a book that includes several murders, blackmail over illicit sex, and even big game fishing, but Forsyth, while professionally conveying detail, doesn't write in order to make our heart beat faster.However, he does write with an addictive slow burn. These stories aren't flashy, but they are satisfying and meaty. The twists are generally potent, and occasionally you have the added bonus of the little man surprisingly overcoming.I first read this collection over twenty years ago, and it says something for the lasting impact of these stories that I could still clearly recall several of them: the irony of \`No Comebacks' and \`There are no snakes in Ireland'; the epic metamorphosis of \`The Emperor'; and the delightful justice of \`Privilege' have all stayed with me through the years.It could be seen as dated, but I'd more see it as an able time piece: you can feel, for example, the 70s society so wonderfully pilloried by the Monty Python TV shows in these pages. Moreover the ideas for these stories (except, perhaps, \`Sharp Practise', the weakest of the series: an (obvious) accomplice is hardly a shock twist) are consistently strong, and ably presented."},{"Title":"No Comebacks","review":"Written in his characteristic crisp style, Forsyth's 'No comebacks' is one of the best collections of short stories I have ever read. An assortment of ten of his best, each story is guaranteed to hold the readers' attention. A twist to every tale is the plot that he follows, taking the reader along with him for most of the tale allowing him, the reader, to get lost in the story before sharply jolting him, I'm referring to the reader again, out of his reverie with an unexpected turn. No amount of prior groundwork can prepare you for this sudden bend in narration. The work of a true genius. Hats off to Forsyth!"},{"Title":"No Comebacks","review":"Very few writers are equally good at both novels and short stories. I will not leave you in suspense - Frederick Forsyth is a better novelist. That is not a problem, however, as his novels are strong enough that he can dip a bit below that level and still be quite good. NO COMEBACKS demonstrates this.As one would expect from Forsyth, the stories in this collection often have either a violent or malicious undercurrent to them or explore the inner recesses of man's psyche. Many of the stories have a bit of a twist at the end, with some easy to see, others a bit harder, while still others appear to be apparent only to take a last minute swerve to somewhere else. My personal favorite is Money With Menace because it illustrates one of my favorite principles - you should not mess with someone even if he looks to be a sap because you never know when that other guy is tougher and nastier than you. The story Duty is out of place, which Forsyth acknowledges in a footnote. But as it is claimed to be true, I am glad it is included and the story did stay with me for a while after reading it.Forsyth unfortunately tends to be far too technical with some of his descriptions. Usually this is easily overlooked but becomes irritating in the story The Emperor with its details of fishing equipment. I suppose, however, that one does not earn Forsyth's reputation without an eye for detail and one cannot blame a man for showing it. Get the book to read a story or two between larger and heavier books and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"No Comebacks","review":"I read it years ago, and recently re-read it.

I always loved reading him and cannot wait for another book. I have almost his entire collection."},{"Title":"No Comebacks","review":"This is my first time to read a short story collection, and my first time to read Forsyth. All ten stories were amusing but nothing startling or shocking. All stories were lighthearted, with no violence, sex or swearing.Some reviewers mentioned each story ending with a twist, and that intrigued me because the \\"twist\\" ending hadn't gained popularity when these stories were written.The twists were all pretty obvious but still each story was easy and fun to read."},{"Title":"No Comebacks","review":"In 'No Comebacks,' Mark found more than he bargained for when the Corsician assassin told him to strip. He had his public and 'professional' life, his private life, and his secret life -- none of which matched the London tycoon personna he projected. In his kind of fast lane wheeling and dealing, there are no comebacks, but he did not see this one coming. As in any kind of business, even radio, there are no comebacks from scandal. On air pranks and stunts are not acceptable at any time, and yet a group of incorrigibles got away with it free and clear. At least, they thought so, until a stranger entered their world with a mission of revenge.In another story, there is a libel victim exacting sweet revenge. 'A Careful Man' wasn't careful enough as he wandered around his meek neighborhood for his usual two-block walk. 'There Are Some Days' and 'There Are No Snakes in Ireland' regardless to what you've heard are strange and different. \\"You are not obliged to say anything, but anything you say will be taken down and may be used in evidence.\\" He can write on many diverse subjects, even in French. Writing is magical. The empty page is where you start to put together the disparate parts of your life.

Eustace Mullins is an expert researcher. Previous to this book he was the FIRST person to reveal the true nature of the Federal Reserve (which has nothing to do with Federal). In this book he details the history of how control of the medicinal market has been won by the FDA and the AMA (and similar organizations in other Nations), and how the healing of citizens has been put in the hands of the Government rather than in the hands of the citizens themselves. Their choices for treatment have been downsized to that of Allopathic medicine, a way of trreatment that is relatively new, only a few hundred years old, if at that, as compared to medicine that has been practiced for thousands of years. This book details the methods used by the Rockefellers to control the medicinal market to their advantage. It also guarantees a level of population control....read on! You will be surprised!"},{"Title":"Murder by Injection: The Story of the Medical Conspiracy against America","review":"Read this book, all the pieces of the healthcare debate will fall into place after you've read this. You'll realize what a sinister system we have in place in this country. PROFIT MOTIVE."},{"Title":"Murder by Injection: The Story of the Medical Conspiracy against America","review":"this book is an incredible compilation of facts that challenges a life time of propaganda reaped on us by the medical establishment in their attempt to protect their money making monopoly"},{"Title":"Murder by Injection: The Story of the Medical Conspiracy against America","review":"In \\"Murder By Injection: The Story of the Medical Conspiracy Against America\\", Eustace Mullins continues what he started in \\"Secrets of the Federal Reserve,\\" this time focused on the American Medical Establishment - or rather, the Western Medical Establishment, as the controllers of this system exist in the US and across the pond in England and parts of Western Europe.If you've traveled abroad, especially into Asia, you no doubt know that our system of medical treatment differs substantially. This is because in Asia the culture endorses a homeopathic system, or a reliance on natural remedies that seek to build the body's immune system to fight disease. Here in the West, we have an allopathic system. Although it wasn't always so - and indeed there remain pockets of homeopathic practitioners - modern society's medicine is heavily based on allopathy, in which the focus is on attacking disease at the cell level. An unfortunate byproduct of that aim is that the cell and the immune system itself are harmed during treatment. While a person might recover during their course of allopathic treatment, their natural defenses may have been weakened during the fight, leaving them susceptible to additional disease and viruses.Here, Mullins deftly connects those same Federal Reserve interests to the modern Medical Establishment. On many and varied fronts, Mullins describes how these monopolists seized control American medical care, making it into a multi-billion (and probably trillion) dollar enterprise. Along the way, these manipulators have used expert public relations and advertising to sufficiently convince most everyone that deviating from their allopathic recommendations will result in certain disaster for the individual and society. The author begins with the origins of the monopoly, and then moves into the tale of how Quacks set up their control mechanism; a tale of bribery, graft, hucksterism and murder.I greatly enjoyed the chapters on vaccines, cancer, Aids and fluoridation. Essentially, when there are excess byproducts from these monopolists' latest scheme, such as a World War, they'll find a way to sell it to the public by hook or crook. Such is the case with fluoride, a byproduct of aluminum production and a main ingredient in rat poison, which almost everyone consumes in high quantities via their town or city's water supply.If you've recently stayed at a hospital whether due to an ailment or emergency and then marveled at just how high your bill is, then you'll be interested in Mullins' chapter on The Drug Trust. Needless to say, that little pill that cost you over $20 can be bought retail for pennies. \\"Administrative Costs\\" are the reason given by the establishment for the high price, but most likely it's due to creative accounting. This ridiculous system thrives because its overlords are connected to Rockefeller/Rothschild interests. Mullins shows the reader how the medical establishment is interconnected to defense contractors, food production conglomerates, and banking interests; which of course have no interest in actually healing the sick.\\"Murder by Injection\\" will undoubtedly affect the reader, and should be given wide audience. All of us know someone that has suffered from or is currently battling a debilitating disease, whether cancer or one of the myriad of neurological disorders - perhaps it is the reader themselves. Armed with the information in this book, we can move forward, not being held hostage by a lab coat wearing high priest or the puppet master that moves his hand - and just maybe save our lives.Five stars - heavily and heartily recommended!"},{"Title":"Murder by Injection: The Story of the Medical Conspiracy against America","review":"This book gives you the TRUTH behind our sick Medical Monopoly - ALL the long history, \\"big\\" names you know like Rockefeller, JP Morgan, Rothchilds(bank roled it), the interlocking directorships - medical insurance & FDA in their back pocket.

I have suffered because I wasn't smart enough to listen. Dr. Gills, one of the nation's leading eye doctors, surgically destroyed my sight leaving me needing contact lenses in order to see through glasses. Subsequently, Dr. Gills' lawyers found that my sight was \\"normal\\" prior to unnecessary cataract surgery. A former student of Dr. Gills, now an independent optometrist, had claimed I needed the surgery after the $400 glasses he sold me did more to hinder than help my \\"night\\" driving vision . That \\"STUDENT\\" referred me to Dr. Gills, St Luke's facility.Since my perfectly working natural lenses were removed needlessly, as long as I was able to \\"see\\" with contacts combined with glasses, no action could be taken against Dr. Gills. That is just one of several encounters with the medical profession I've experienced. Indeed Dr. Eustace Mullins presents a superbly written, well documented account of the myth that America's health care is the best in the world. You will be startled to find that the only thing that is \\"best\\" about U.S. medical care is that both the medical and pharmaceutical industries are the best at extracting the wealth of this country.After reading this book, you will come to recognize the value in homeopathic medicine. In countries like Germany, very little else is prescribed. Between the side effects of prescription meds that provide lawyers with generous incomes from class-action lawsuits, and the multitude of unnecessary medical procedures that literally kill people for profit, Americans fall victim to the vultures we call doctors. Discover \\"why\\" medical education is so costly in the U.S. in this credible account of the history of the AMA. My only regret is not having read the book a long time ago. If you doubt such claims, please pay closer attention to the TV & radio ads, as they rapidly recite \\"potential side effects\\" in those very expensive media commercials. Not to mention, all the ads produced by the legal profession, advising you of your potential financial benefits, should you have incurred suffering or LOSS THROUGH DEATH due to negligent medical care.Our government, working hand in hand with these charlatans and insurance companies have now found a less intrusive (for them) method of \\"funneling\\" America's wealth straight into their pockets with Obamacare. I'm sure the \\"BEST\\" is yet to come. This book is priceless for anyone seriously interested in maintaining their health.

Just the thought of reading several sequels to this snooze-fest is enough to make me drowsy."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"This book is basically a tale of survival that makes us follow a group of people, foreign to one another, in a remote English city. What starts off as an isolated viral attack spreads incredibly fast and reaches the scale of a global epidemics in way less than a day. People just die randomly under one mere minute and spares no one: elders, infants, women and men alike, everybody's subject to the potential threat. A group of people manages to survive -the explanation will probably be given in one of the sequels- and decides to make it to the relative safety of the countryside. This is the story of their survival that Moody has us follow.I share the opinions of many a reader here: the book is somewhat slow to start. However, towards the last quarter of the novel, the pace gets up all of a sudden. Probably the main merit of the book is the quality of its human characters' thorough description. None of them is a Mr or Mrs \\"I-know-it-all-inside-out\\". Rather, they are full of doubts, subject to the highs and lows that each and every one of us would go through in just the same situation. Their morale is fragile, as is their social bond. Everything, from characters' description to the succession of their decisions and acts, the layout of the scenery, the behaviors of the various people involved, everything is accurate and highly credible.Know what? I don't know if you noticed that too, by Moody's managed to write his entire book without mentioning the term \\"zombie\\" a single time!! He instead uses words like creatures, corpses, pathetic beings etc. I guess this shows his willingness to break away from the usual zombie clich&eacute;s: everything in his description of the transformation of the corpses into walking deads suggests that he is very fondly attached to the human side of things. He never criticizes what's happening. Rather, he writes in the style of a journalist: factual, to the point.This makes for a very great reading. If you manage not to be deterred by the somewhat slow action pace at the beginning of his novel, you won't be disappointed afterwards.Can't wait until a get the copies of his sequels in hands!!"},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"One person begins to cough and hack. His airways swelling up and beginning to suffocate him before cracking and bleeding, causing his coughing a hacking to be filled with blood. Then death. Within twenty-four hours everyone suffers the same fate and the world becomes a silent graveyard. A few are lucky survivors who seem to be immune to this sickness. They think the worst is behind them, but they are wrong. Within a week the dead begin to stand and shuffle harmlessly around. Within two weeks the corpses are actively seeking human flesh. Autumn follows the struggle of three survivors as they search to find a new home and struggle for food and supplies. The zombies are the classical slow moving variety who singly are easily overcome, but in mass are unstoppable. The three survivors have completely different personalities and this adds to the tension of the book by not only having the people dealing with day-to-day survival, but also overcoming their different ideas and viewpoints.

There are no in depth descriptions of the deaths and dismemberments where it seems that other zombie books get hung up. Instead it leaves these up to your imaginations. Plenty of twists and suprises to be had, and even the more \\"traditional\\" aspects of zombie-lore have a new wave of freshness breathed upon them.

Please give him credit where credit is due. This book is a classic."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"Without a doubt this has to be most boring, apocalyptic zombie horror book I have ever had the misfortune to read.The story starts off promising enough with an unknown virus which kills millions and nicely introdcues us to the characters but thats where it ends. The rest of the story is taken up with them finding somewhere to live and going out for supplies.The author does a good job of trying to convey the shock and disbelief of surviving such an event but it is overdone. 200 pages into a book I dont want the characters still sitting around in a state of shock.It seems as if David Moody started to write the first few chapters which evolved into a whole book but the early chapters never ended.At no point did I care about any of the characters because they were two dimensional. We learnt very little of their back stories so I never connected with them.Now onto the zombies, OMG without doubt these are the most unscary monsters I have ever come across. They dont do anything but walk around and bumb into things. Its obvious that the trio are never really in danger from them. I also find it hard to believe that in todays world, if you saw the dead rising and walking around the word zombie would not pop into your head, but it seems as if the protagnists in the book are oblivious to the fact that these dead people are indeed zombies.Save your money and buy World War Z."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I practically devoured the entire Autumn series (except for Aftermath, as it's not out yet) in a little less than 2 weeks. It really is that good! I have no doubt this is one of the best Zombie books out there now, and most likely will be indoctrinated as a zombie classic (if such an honor exists). Moody is an excellent author, well worth following. His characters were well thought out and develop in a very natural manner. But the plot is where Moody \\"broke the mold\\". Most zombie books follow a very standard template: someone, somehow is infected, he or she bites someone else, gore and blood exudes, repeat and rinse. In Autumn, the zombies almost seem a bit too tame. They're practically the victim most of the time. Moody turns the table around and shows how its really the living that self disintegrate. So why the 4 stars rather than 5? Maybe it's unfair that I'm using this one review to rate the entire series, but I figure anyone who is about to start reading Autumn will probably pick up the rest of the series eventually anyway. So on it's own, this first book is probably a 5. But with the rest of the series, I'd settle for a 4. The rest of the books seems to settle into a specific \\"Autumnisc\\" pattern of it's own."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"When i first read the plot for this book, it sounded good. Maybe not original in the Zombie genre (i'v only found Sandman Slim Kill The Dead original in the genre). But god i did not expect it to kill me with boredom. I am a avid reader but i had to push myself to finish this book, it was slower than the undead it chronicled. Also i didn't care by the end of the book which of the main charters died...i was actually hoping for it . The mere thought of trying to read the others in the series... frightens me. Unless David Moody's style of writing changes and actually gets some life to it...i wont be reading further novels from him."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"This book series gets annoying. Every character in the book is a whining sissy. The author repeats a few phrases more times than I would like to read. The lack of creative writing along with the characters whining, irritates me. If you like zombie novels were everyone sits around and sobs about how pathetic and confused they are. Then this is your novel. This book is bad, but it has some good qualities. The second book (the city), however, is just more of the same and worse. I'm 100 pages into The City, and I feel like a chump for giving this publisher more of my money. In both books there has been the introduction of more than a hundred characters, and out of all of them not one is going on a zombie killing rampage.Autumn doesn't compare to other great zombie adventures like Day By Day Armageddon or Tooth and Nail.This is one story that isn't worth the time or money."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I work in a Hastings store in the USA, I was stocking some books one day and as an avid zombie lover, I read the back cover, I decided to come back after work and by the book as I would get a good discount anyway. After it set on my shelf for about a month I decided I wanted to read it, I picked it up and within moments I was hooked! I went back to the store to see if he had any other books out that I might like and to my surprise there was not one but two sequels on the shelf, I bought them up write away! I finished them both in an afternoon! Looking at the back page my heart skipped a beat when I found out there was a fourth book so I instantly got online and found out there were two more!!! But then I discovered I would have to wait for them to release..... the anticipation is going to drive me crazy! I must know what happens next!"},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"A wonderful start to a series of books.

From moment one, people were dropping. The 'slower' parts were taking you deeper into the 3 main characters.

This was a dark, but fun change from what I usually read."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I wasn't expecting what I got with this book. Rather than an all out zombiefest, this turned out to be more of a character study. I was really drawn into the story by the end though. I have a feeling you'll either love this book or hate it though."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"In less than a day, 99% of the population died because of an unknown virus. The few survivors are shocked and gather together for safety in a community. Then some of the many corpses start to walk around. Most of the survivors start to panic and turn on each other, so Michael, Carl, and Emma decide to go off by themselves and find a safer place to stay. They find a secluded farm house in a rural area and opt to settle there for the time being. Then the walking corpses seem to be more aware and gather around people or things that make noise. The survivors don't know what to make of this new development, so they try to avoid the dead and make a new life for themselves. Then, they start to attack the survivors. Michael, Carl, and Emma realize the danger they are in. The walking dead keep coming in huge numbers and are attracted to the light from the house and every sound they make. Can they figure out a way to survive in this world full of corpses dead set on destroying them?Autumn is a good, solid zombie book. The writing style and plot really drew me in from the very first pages. Others have complained that the pacing is too slow, but I disagree. The focus of the book isn't on the zombies, but the emotions and conflict between the human characters. It takes time to illustrate detailed characters, their different lives, and their connections with each other. This situation seemed much more plausible and realistic to me. The survivors are upset because practically everyone they know is dead and of course their minds aren't instantly going to go to zombie apocalypse. They are confused and don't really know what to do or why everything is happening. Emotions are running high, causing them to make unwise decisions and lash out at each other out of fear or anger. This is how people act in extreme situations. Michael, Carl, and Emma all have their own unique things to deal with and aren't perfect characters. They doubt themselves and agonize over what would be best to do. No one is confident in their course of action in this post-apocalyptic world. The survivors' actions made sense to me and illustrated what real people would do in a horrible situation.This isn't your typical zombie book. There aren't gobs of blood and gore drenching every page, but there is definitely potential for more in the next book. I really enjoyed the quiet, slow burn of the book. It is reminiscent of John Ajvide Lindqvist's Handling the Undead. I would recommend this to zombie fans that don't mind a more casual pace. I can't wait until the next book comes out."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I bought this book just to have somethingto read, and was I suprised! I couldn't put it down, something great was always happening, new and different Characters in EVERY BOOK! Once I read this book I had to go and buy the others, I was one of the lucky ones that got all of the books before the price sky rocketed! if you goto [...] you can find them for a reasonible price, why you ask? because it's actually Mr. David Moody selling them! he's is a great Author. There are 4 released Autumn books, but he is working on a fifth. My faveorite author hands down."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"This book offers a delicious blend of isolation, survivalism and the undead. A satisfying selection of character personalities that paint a perfectly hopeless situation.Not for those who like fast paced, shoot em up zombie thrillers. Some are upset with dialogue, whereas I feel it keeps with the bleak tone of the book.A very satisfying beginning to a series that looks extremely promising."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I wanted to like Autumn by David Moody. I really did. The book starts off with potential. The way the 'epidemic' spreads is interesting as is the manner of how the corpses slowly become zombies. But that's it.The writing is poor, the pacing is snail-like slow, and the characters are just blah. The dialogue is often repeated, with dozens of pages dedicated to the: \\"Are you alright?\\" \\"No.\\" \\"What should we do?\\" \\"I don't know.\\" His recycling of dialogue is just too painful to look past.As for the characters, I often found myself forgetting which character was which as their personalities melded to the same and there were no real indistinguishable qualities among them. Also, the author suffers from 'telling' the reader to much. When you read the novel, you don't get to see a character being frustrated. Instead the author simply does something like, \\"Carl answered frustrated\\". Or if a character was having a break down, \\"Carl said as he broke down.\\"One thing the book does do well is portray the boredom and anxiety of the characters, but that's only because as a reader I was bored and anxious for the book to end. I will not be reading the sequel to this book, or the sequel's sequel."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I love the Autumn series of zombie books. The first installment \\"Autumn\\" provides a horrific introduction to the day England succumbed to a plague/disease, which kills millions. Of course, the dead only stay on the ground for a bit and once they regain some basic skills they are thrashing about in the UK. God save the queen!I guess people expected a ton of gore but actually I think Moody provided the perfect amount since the whole time the survivors are indoors we know the horror that awaits them outside. I think the book was methodical in describing specific details on the everyday survival routine of a group of strangers in a zombie world. I know that some reviewers were disappointed that the characters used phrases like, \\"I don't know\\" or \\"I don't understand.\\" I think in a post apocalyptical world most people would have a hard time making decisions on their next course of action to survive. It's not like a Hollywood movie where there is always some great leader that would have all the answers. I think this showed the desperate state of mind these characters were in considering their horrible circumstances- all of their closest loved ones had died and the dead are now walking the earth (including their loved ones).I would highly recommend all zombie enthusiasts to read the rest of the series. Honestly, it only gets better."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"and less pictures... seriously, this is great ...no, the best zombie fiction I have ever read, and close to as good as i could expect any to be.

The difference is as that between harlequin romance and The Master and Margarita..."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"Just finished reading David Moody's first novel of the Autumn series. I cannot say I was either blown away or disappointed. Fans of Romero style zombie tales will be surprised by the overall behavior of Moody's undead. For the vast majority of the novel the zombies wander the land aimlessly, oblivious of the living. Be warned: This novel is SLOW, but does pick up the pace the last 75 pages. I have just started Autumn: The City and I am expecting much more from the Author. Overall, I would say Autumn is worth reading if you are planning to read the entire Autumn series. If not, pick up Brian Keene's \\"The Rising\\" and skip this novel entirely."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"On one mundane autumn morning, what appears to be a virus spreads rapidly throughout Northwich. Within minutes, the vast majority of the population is killed and lies strewn all over the streets of the city and roads of the outlying country. Emma, a medical student, Michael, a manager at a computer company, and Carl, a maintenance worker, are among a small handful of survivors. Within a small and somewhat shoddy community center, the survivors sit and wait for aid.A few days later, and still no aid has come. However, a new challenge appears as the dead begin to rise from the surrounding streets. Food supplies diminish, tempers begin to flare, and slowly but surely hope dwindles.Autumn is not quite like previous zombie novels I've read. Though the plot, at first glance, appears to be a cut-and-paste version of most other zombie books and films, the author approaches this material from a slightly different perspective. David Moody, rather than giving the reader fountains of gore, fighting, and violence, chooses to dissect the human condition. Moody delves into the heart of human emotions in times of crises, and interpersonal relationships when all hope seems lost. This may be a turn-off to those looking for an all-out splatter-fest, but you have to give him credit for trying a different angle in a genre that seemingly had little else to offer. The personalities of the characters are laid out quite well, leaving you caring about what happens to them by the end of the book.I must admit that, at times, this slant can make for a somewhat slower read, and hence the four stars instead of five. However, the ending does pick up the pace quite abruptly, returning to the gore and tension more characteristic of the genre, and paving the way for the rest of the books in the series. The conclusion indeed leaves the reader wanting to indulge in more that Moody has to offer.I thoroughly enjoyed the book and will pick up the remaining books in the series. It should be noted that this novel is also available as a free download from the author's website for those interested in checking out the series and saving a few bucks in the process."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"Autumn isn't a zombie novel. That's something you'll have to figure out pretty quickly. Sure, there are corpses that get up, wander around, and bump into things, but that's really about all they do for over half the book. Instead, the focus is on a group of three completely unlikable (and frankly, hard to keep track of because they all talk exactly the same way) \\"survivors\\" whose names I won't even bother mentioning.Essentially, the premise is that a virus sweeps the world (I assume), randomly killing...well, just about everyone. The few left (in the unidentified \\"English\\" city this story takes place in, about thirty people out of half a million are left unaffected) band together at a community center with flimsy walls (this exposition is set up rather ludicrously early on and there's not even a pay off), the dead start rising, and people start to panic. Unfortunately, it's really hard to figure out why everyone immediately goes into survival mode (people panic at the site of a mob of undead, only to learn they've simply gotten themselves hung up on a parked car), since the zombies, while obviously dead, aren't initially any more deadly than the average pot head or dementia patient. They shuffle around and bump into things, they freeze up whenever anyone touches them, etc. The irrational level of fear people have for them would seem to indicate people have been watching BBC's midnight zombie flick marathon, except no one ever seems to make the zombie connection (Moody apparently subscribes to the theory that zombie fiction is best when the word zombie never appears). While I don't really care what you call the undead (be it skels, Deadites, zombies, Darkseekers, or whatever), I at least a reason for everyone to be afraid of them.For over half of its over 300 page length, we get a series of repetitive sequences that don't really move the plot along, all the while mobile corpses (it seems to cheat the term to call them zombies or even undead) wander around in the shadows. True, scenes of zombies in the distance do make for an eerie atmosphere (Resident Evil Apocalypse and Dawn of the Dead's far superior remake manage this beautifully), but since for most of Autumn that's all the dead even do, it quickly stops being scary (at least for me, if not the characters themselves) and starts just being loopy.Let's talk about the characters themselves. Autumn has quite a large cast of them, all of whom Moody seems to feel duty bound to name, but none of whom really matter. There are, however, three main survivors. One man has lost his wife and daughter (his only unique feature, and one which Moody will keep pounding into us long after it gets old), another man (who I really can't remember anything at all about, and I gave up on this book yesterday over 150 pages in), and a woman whose response to this nightmare at first was to simply crawl into bed, pull up the covers, and wish everything would go away. There are a host of tertiary characters as well, such as the man in the first chapter who succumbs to the plague (since he never comes back as a zombie, it seems rather pointless to have this scene at all, since we get not one but about a dozen similar scenes through the eyes of our survivors), another man who starts off looking for a gas station and quickly reveals himself to be a massive prick, two rather pointless old women, two equally pointless young women (who both sob a lot), and several others who are fortunately only present briefly, only to be eaten off screen when the extremely flimsy building they all stupidly took shelter in (\\"I can push the walls apart!\\" announces a main character rather pointlessly early on, which terrifies the others for no reasons, since there's no danger from outside at this point, and is to foreshadowing what a three year-old's finger painting is to Monet). We knew this was going to happen the minute our three main characters left, the only problems with the scene are how badly it's set up and the fact that it all occurs off page (including the aftermath), meaning we don't even get to see the results of the suddenly not friendly zombies as they devour everyone. This is, frankly, a shame, since the long and plodding scenes leading up to this deserve SOME sort of pay-off, but they really don't ever get any, as is the case with this novel as a whole.It's hard to keep the characters straight, mainly because they have such a narrow range of personality: depression (primarily women), self-centered ponce (all the male characters I mentioned above), and mute panic (everyone else). Literally every character speaks with the same cadences and vernacular, and I have to question whether or not Moody is even English (miles and meters are used interchangeably, for example, which seems odd for a country I thought used metrics like the rest of Europe; maybe a lackluster attempt at localization for American audiences?). As a case in point, just about every other sentence contains at least on example of over the top Britishism (either \\"bloody\\" or effing 'ell). While there are probably some people who think Brits actually talk like this, the reality is they use their slang just as often and naturally as everyone else. The dialogue in Autumn feels as if Moody wrote the entire novel out, then went back and added in his \\"witty\\" Britishisms wherever he felt appropriate (or at random), resulting in speech which is at once unnatural and stilted. And that's without all the gratuitous use of the f-word (I can tolerate this in a story, but there comes a time when it just stops being shocking or even mildly surprising and starts sounding like a 12-year-old on Modern Warfare 2).In addition to being wooden, the characters aren't especially likeable. Everyone seems to be at everyone else's throats for the entire novel. While conflict is fine (and oftentimes essential) in any survival story, there needs to be a pay-off and some sort of resolution. Either by the end of things everyone manages to work together and survive (the way things usually turn out), or your group of survivors just never gets it together and everyone dies. It's as if Moody is compensating for the notoriously bad zombie erotica Down the Road, where all the characters (except the obviously evil bad ones, who are invariably soldiers, cops, and government officials) get on swimmingly; here Moody seems to think all English are hopelessly self absorbed idiots and who will NEVER grow out of it. Autumn doesn't quite reach this stage of character development; in this respect, the plodding 308 page novel feels like only the first part of a larger story, where the characters will actually get a personality or a shot of adrenaline to liven them up. But what a good writer could do in a few chapters Moody can't pull off in an entire novel, and 308 pages of exposition is far too long in my opinion.My bottom line here is this is one of the worst pieces of fiction I've ever encountered. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I would think that the technical ability to write would be a minimum requirement for an author and having a compelling story would be key to publishing a novel. Worst case, an editor can fix the former, but the lack of the latter spells doom. This book fails on both counts.If I was kind, I'd attribute the swtich from first to third person naration as an attempt to be artsy, but it is seemingly so random that I can't believe that. Oh, and here's a tip, you don't need to refer to the three main charcters by their first name in every scene. If I had a dime for ever sentance that contained some variation of \\"Emma, Michael and Carl ...,\\" I'd be a rich man. Here's a good drinking game: every time a charcter asks, \\"Are you OK?\\" every downs a shot. I'll bet a large amount of money that even sailors couldn't make it through the first chapter.OK, so, even if you loose an experienced editor on the copy, this is what you'd have:* An aftermath in which the dead do not rise until several days later and when they do, it is several more days before they even hint at being dangerous.* A lack of desire to arm ones self. OK, this does not take place in America with a plentiful supply of guns, but there's gotta be a few in Britain. When they do find one, there is actually argument over whether to even carry it.* Unreasonable fear in EVERYONE.\\"I'm locked in this building with nothing to eat but canned soup.

The hope to carry characters through a cataclysm is one that intreges me. Unfortunatly, although the concept around the story is a good one, the characters are incredibly unsympathetic. They are either bickering or whining, even close moments when you feel that they are going to connect it turns into a confronation. At the end I really didn't care if they lived or died.And the language is unbelievably harsh, yes, I don't mind the occasional f-bomb, but at times it seemed unrelenting.

I probably made it halfway.The book dragged and was quite boring. In an attempt to make the zombies &#34;different&#34;, I thought the author failed miserably. I kept waiting for something to happen and... nothing. One reviewer said the last 75 pgs were great. Huh?I couldn't keep the characters straight, I ended up taking notes. That being said.... the characters were hateful. Nothing redeeming whatsoever. E very page (just about) kept asking.... are you okay?It was odd how close they got to the zombies.... even bringing one into their refuge without knowing if they were contagious.Lastly, it always amazes me that during TEOTAWKI nobody really cares about their lost ones (except one guy). If my family were across the ocean, you bet your butt I'd be looking for a row boat.I have no intent to read a sequel.... I really don't care what happens to these morons."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"Please note: This post will have many spoilers.Some stories are about people and some stories focus on a situation and what people do. Autumn seemed to be about the latter. I personally don't really feel this is a horror novel. It seemed to be more of a survival story. There was some gore and rotting zombies and corpses, but it didn't really instill a sense of fear or dread in me. The only really scary chapter turned out to be a dream.I would have liked to have seen more showing in this book, but unfortunately, it felt very narrative throughout most of the novel. The events were basically the three main characters trying to get through the days. Because of the style, it took me several pages to figure out who was speaking and there were sentences that didn't make sense and it was distracting to me.I would have also liked to have seen traits that make the characters stand out or expose who they are. They are sad and upset and they understand that the world has changed and they reminisce from time to time but they don't explore their feelings in depth. The only thing I got from their personalities was that Carl is rude and Michael is arrogant and bossy. These traits can be interesting, but I couldn't find anything behind their words and actions. When Emma and Michael say that they are upset after Carl leaves the farmhouse, it surprised me because I really didn't see anything to back up their feelings. They just argued with him and tried to bully him into staying. There was also a part where Michael states that he'd come to rely on having Emma around and even though they hardly knew each other they shared \\"...more pain, despair, and raw emotion with her than any other person.\\" However, this is not shown to my satisfaction.The characters also fight a lot. I understand that emotions are high, but there is constant bickering, criticizing, hairsplitting and going over arguments again and again. The people reminded me of dysfunctional family members more than survivors who needed to work together.There were also some moments that were touched upon that could have been very special and I wish they were explored a little further. Michael wants to rebuild but he thinks they have to clear out their old life first. While this may seem a little presumptious of him, I think he has a good point. However, he only expresses this opinion by arguing and not explaining. The trio also don't like doing anything normal in the \\"new world\\" because it reminds them of what they lost. This could have been very poignant and I would have liked to have seen it explored a little further.In Autumn's defense, I do have to say that the story itself was believable. I never once thought, \\"...that could never happen...\\" even though it was a zombie novel."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, and it really never did. There was a total lack of character development, and even less plot development. I'm buying the second book to see if the characters die.."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"This story begins at a relatively slow pace and builds some steam towards the end of the novel. I think the tempo could have picked up earlier on, but I realize this is just the first of several Autumn books so I can forgive the author a bit of extended character development and time to build some suspense before diving head long into the meat of what will likely be the real story for several books to come. I would presume the future books will continue at the pacing set in the last 100 pages of this one, or at least I hope they do.The zombies, a.k.a.: ticked off undead who hate the living, really do not show up until about half way through the book. They are not traditional Romero-esc type zombies though in the truest sense: they don't crave your flesh as much as they just want you to be quiet. You see, 99.9% of the worlds population died all at once and that makes for a pretty serene environment. But those few remaining pesky living folks still want to make a lot of noise and interupt the stillness. So the undead tend to show their disatisfaction with this by showing up in ever increasing numbers and like a cranky neighbor are ready to really complain vehemently about the racket you are creating.The dialogue in this book is a little repetitive. I am sure if I faced a crisis such as this I would be as glum and moody as these folks, but hearing some of it over and over was a bit tiresome. I was also a slightly disappointed by what seemed a rather predictable character arc with Carl. He appeared to have come to terms with reality late in the story and then all the sudden loses his grip yet again at the most inopportune time. Certainly within the realm of possibilities, but I guess I just didn't appreciate how that played out that much.Even with the criticisms I have laid out above, I feel this story was entertaining overall and this world worth revisiting at least for one more of David's books. I got this one free on line and I feel it is worth paying for the next story and seeing where this leads to. If he can sharpen up the dialogue and keep the pace he employed at the end of this book, the rest of the series should be pretty interesting."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I'm sorry to say I was seduced into purchasing this novel by several factors.

The writing is so amateurish, it leaves me wondering if \\"Infected Books\\", the publisher, is a vanity press. The paperback itself is printed with a cheap-looking typeface in a fairly large print.Occasional chapters are narrated in first-person point of view from one or another of the several main characters, but since there is no discernible difference in their voice or tone, this just seems silly. Not only are the characters barely distinguishable, they are also inarticulate and unsympathetically drawn, and the dialogue is tediously repetitious, basically: \\"Are you all right?\\" \\"No.\\" \\"What should we do?\\" \\"I don't know.\\" Over and over again.Were it not for the profanity, it might be acceptable as juvenile fiction. Only the most undemanding readers will be able to tolerate this poorly told tale.I'll give this two stars instead of one, because there are a couple moments of suspense. Still...Not recommended at all."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"The whole autumn series.. If your not used to actual english style writing, you will possibly find it slow, boring, or annoying in some way. This series isn't too bad with it, but its there. The story is really good, but for long expanses it seems the characters just sit around and whine, for chapters at a time. The action parts of the book are really good, but these long expanses of supposed hopeless despair suffered by the characters, also truely gets felt by the reader, due to how boring it gets to hear some brits whine and cry about losing their families. I guess it's pretty realistic on that part, because the end of the world would be pretty horrible. But it also made it pretty hard to force myself to keep reading each of the books from this series. I think the only reason I continued to read them was because I already bought the whole set, and so I can count them in my collection of zombie books I've read."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"Life can be a gamble. In fact, life is full of gambles. Every decision we make has direct consequences, whether they are obvious or not. David Moody took a massive gamble when he unleashed his zombie novel Autumn on the internet for FREE. The gamble paid off and more than half a million downloads, a handful of sequels and movie deals later, Moody has the kind of acclaim that many authors can only dream of.With that kind of hype, I was wary about reading Autumn but from the opening page, Moody had my attention. There's no gentle preamble to ease you in and introduce the characters going about their previously mundane lives; Autumn drops you in at zero hour of an unexplained outbreak.I don't recall the word \\"zombie\\" being used within the book at all and although Autumn is described as \\"the hit zombie novel\\" on the front cover, I would suggest that Moody's undead, so far, are a little different to the zombie of modern pop culture. However, there is no doubt that in Autumn, the dead have risen...Interestingly, I found that the absence of the word \\"zombie\\" or the fact that clearly none of the characters had ever seen a Romero flick concerning. The world created by Moody in Autumn is incredibly believable, with very ordinary people who are subjected to extraordinary and horrific circumstances at the centre of proceedings.The language employed by the author on the whole, is straightforward yet incredibly illustrative. I could picture every event and location narrated within the book. It is with the depiction of the undead that I would suggest that Moody comes into his own. Where many authors would simply rely on the use of the word \\"zombie\\" or the term \\"walking dead\\" to illustrate their point, Moody employs graphic descriptions of decaying flesh, diseased corpses; and as the novel advances, the state of putrefaction of the undead progresses also.Those readers looking for a mindless action horror novel will be left disappointed by Autumn. Although the book has more than its fair share of imminent peril and impending doom for the central characters, Moody is in no rush to tell his story and for that, I am grateful. With Autumn, Moody has created a compelling, character driven zombie tale and although the undead are very much omni-present, the book very much focuses on the actions and consequences thereof for the individuals at the heart of the story and how they deal with the situation in which they find themselves. Moreover, Moody deals admirably with the various emotions that people in such an extreme situation would invariably be going through, principally: fear, despair and grief at the loss of their former life and all of their loved ones.I would suggest to you that Autumn's power lies with its characters and the very real situation they find themselves in. There are no ex-special forces commandos among the survivors, no treasure trove of weapons to be found to aid their cause. These are ordinary people in a horrific situation, dealing with it as best they can, with varying degrees of success.At under 300 pages and very well-written, it will take you no time at all to consume Autumn which starts strong and finishes powerfully; and its not a book that you're likely to forget and I for one cannot wait to see what the rest of the Autumn series has in store."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I've heard so many great things about this book and I thought it was about time that I gave it a go. Many people refer to this as a zombie classic or as a pivotal book in zombie literature, and I am hard pressed to find a reason to argue against those people. This book is a solid story with a realistic scope. Most zombie novels are either packed with guns, meat-head Rambo types, or super zombies. But not this story, this story somehow manages to hold true to zombie lore, meanwhile establishing its own unique spin on zombies.What didn't I like about the book? There's nothing much to dislike. The only quibble I have with this book is that the characters could have been fleshed out a little more. At times they seemed a little stale but that isn't a major problem with the type of novel this is. This novel focuses on how people cope with a zombie plague--or a plague in general--and the book does a fantastic job displaying real human emotions, I particularly enjoy the psychological breakdown of certain characters in the story, it just seemed very real.I think what makes this book scary is how real this book felt. This book is perhaps the most realistic zombie novel I've ever read and that's because of how the characters were displayed, and that's what makes it bit nerve-wracking.If you're a big fan of zombie literature and haven't picked up this classic then I highly advise you do so, this book should be a staple read alongside zombie classics such as 'World War Z', 'Day by Day Armageddon, and 'The Rising'.It won't dissapoint."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I have to admit that I tried hard to love this book. However, I could only find myself liking it. It just seems to move far too slowly. It is well written, and there are even some moments that will have you at least inching forward in your seat, but it just did not grab me. I will continue on with the series and see if perhaps it picks up. The story IS good enough to make me want to continue."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"Despite some less than stellar reviews I bought this book. I got a chapter or so into it and thought it sounded familiar. I had seen the movie. I really liked the book. I liked that it moved slowly. I think if real people faced such a scenario, they would experience the same disconnect: disbelief in the situation and the idea that rescue would come if you just stayed put and waited. Deciding on your own what to do would be a difficult decision, especially in the face of pressure from others.Moody's story slowly built up to the final confrontation. Anticipating some horrible climax is, to me, good horror. Even after having seen the movie, as I read the story I wanted to put it down. I couldn't. I wanted to see what would happen.I'm hooked. I'll read more of his books."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"This is the first zombie book I've read. A fan of the Walking Dead, I wanted a story with some substance about the catastrophe and its after effects. I wanted a story about the people and how they figure out how to survive. I did not necessarily want a macho, violent story about ripping apart the zombies. I got it in Autumn. It's a good book, not a great one. The story is intense and leads to a great climactic ending. I was ready for book 2, which I'm working on now. It seems even better than the first. So it appears this first book is a warm up to an ever improving story and improving writing."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. Hard core zombie readers may have a problem with the lack of gore, but I felt a connection with the survivors. To me it was more realistic. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love zombie books, but I could see myself in this book. It's more about the survivors coming to grips with the reality of their situation and trying to find a way to cope. I was absolutely devasted when I got to the end. I felt as hopeless as Michael and Emma must have felt.I'm now reading Autumn: The City, and never fear, we do find Michael and Emma..."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"This isn't your normal zombies against the few remaining unaffected humans tale which may disappoint some, but at the same time may be refreshing for others. It doesn't have the high level of action, senseless killing of the undead, survivor cults, armed gangs controlling the supermarkets and streets and the other staples you come to expect with the zombie genre, I can understand why some people who want to reread those things over and over again don't like Autumn. I'd previously read David Moody's Haters series which is brilliant if you haven't checked it out yet. That series even though it doesn't have zombies or the undead in it all, is often mistakenly categorised as zombie novels, but what I found interesting when that series is compared to the first book in the Autumn series, is that Haters has more typical elements of a zombie novel than this one does.There's some brief spoilers in the following. I liked how in this one the survivors have no idea what is going on in relation to what wiped out their families, friends and 99% of the population. Also like in real life they really have no idea what they should or need to be doing. I liked how the dead didn't rise straight away but instead go through stages of becoming animated. I liked how they weren't really a threat to humans being as how deteriorated and slow there movements are, as a corpse would be if this ever happened in reality. That they are even when able to walk, still decomposing and full of maggots also adds to the authenticity. Although being that they are so easy to fend off does make you wonder why the three main characters are so scared of them down the track. If a motorbike can crash through them and not come off balance why not just plow over all the ones in the vicinity in your 4WD until they are not a threat? Also living on a boat in deep enough water so the zombies can't get close never occurs to any of the three.What I think holds the story back a little from being as good as the Haters books is that the three main characters aren't very likeable or interesting. I also had trouble distinguishing for the first half of the book between Michael and Carl since they were pretty similar and remembering which one had the family and kid. Emma is pretty much just like a bit of furniture in the room, she doesn't do anything. If her age was revealed at the start, when there were more characters, I didn't remember it, but I pictured her as an old woman from an era where she does whatever the alpha male tells her, and blindly follows whatever he says not understanding why and getting angry at everyone else who isn't towing the line. Also she was supposed to be studying something in the medical field but was disturbed when asked to do anything in this area, even as simple as gather medical pills and supplies. Maybe if she was younger her age could have added a bit of tension between the male characters who both might have wanted to sleep with her down the track (neither seems to have any desires in that direction). With all three character leaving the teenage girl behind in an environment where she is likely to be killed also made them a bit unlikeable in my eyes. If they had forced her for her own good to join them she would have had a lot to add to the storyline once she had calmed down and maybe fastly matured in the real zombie filled world.Autumn does hook you into this version of a zombie filled world. I'll definitely check out Autumn: The City and the following books in this series, where hopefully a few more interesting characters join the living."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"David Moody is an etremely talented writer who can take a situation like a \\"zombie\\" apocalypse and write a story that is both believable and amazing.I'm a fan of horror and many other genres, and after reading Autumn, David Moody has become one of my favorite authors of all time. I highly recommend this book and its sequels to everyone. The story is gripping, the characters believable and the writing is excellent. Completely un-put-downable."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"This is by no means the worst book I have read, but I could never shake the dark feeling that I was being cheated somehow. I wanted to root for the characters, but I found myself caring less over the course of the read instead of more. While I wanted depth and complexity to the characters, they were shallow and contradictory. Ultimately, I could not connect with them and wished they would just die already.The storyline was only marginally better and too many twists just felt.contrived."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"David Moody has written a hyper-realistic apocalyptic zombie survival thriller - not simply a knock off text of popular zombie movies, but a strongly character driven book.Three Characters who are so obtuse and dull, and written in the same first person voice as to be indistinguishable from either each other or the 3rd party intermittent narrator.Virtually nothing happens in this book - sure most of humanity is wiped out, and eventually rises in mass - but readers know how that goes; getting a hyper realistic look into the psyche of three nearly identical characters isn't that interesting - and certainly doesn't warrant 200 pages.Maybe as an American reader I expect more from both my zombie thriller and its protagonists, than several trips to the grocery store, lots of soup being consumed, and one brief chapter of massed zombies at the barricades."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I read this, the first book. I admit, I haven't read the rest of the series, but I don't really feel a need to. The book doesn't really stand on its own since almost nothing happens, and the book isn't that interesting to begin with.A mysterious force kills everyone in England, but re-animates some of the dead. Those who survived find themselves lost and aimless in a decaying world. At first, the story focuses on a group of survivors, but then three of them leave their fragile retreat and find a deserted farm where they try to survive.As other reviewers pointed out, the zombies don't become dangerous until halfway through the book. The book isn't too badly-written with three compelling characters (although with vague backgrounds), but the book spends more time dealing with their despair at the dead world than anything else. There are endless scenes where the characters literally do nothing but sit around, contemplating the hopelessness of their existence. They encounter the zombies a few times, but most of their encounters involve pushing the zombies away.Since the heroes find a sanctuary almost immediately, there's not much of a threat. I'm not saying there's not room for a story dealing with the psychological aspects of a zombie story, but there needs to be something else for them to do. I also was confused by why they gave up on life so quickly. There was never a scene where they confirmed that *everyone* in England was killed. Couldn't it have been a local phenomenon? And they never bothered to check to see whether it was a worldwide disaster. The characters immediately came to the conclusion that civilization had ended, and life was over. Unrealistic and that shut off what could have been a compelling story.There are geniunely well-written and frightening scenes, but those are too few and far-between. Maybe the other novels get more in-depth, but I think the author should have given us more in the first book. As it is, the events of \\"Autumn\\" could have filled five or six chapters, and gotten to the good stuff. And for the record, this book was indeed self-published."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I have to agree with much of Mr Goddard's review. The story is like walking in dense woods - you wonder how long before you get to the other side. Since this is a the first of a few books and it was a FREE download, I'm going to give the series a fair shot with the next book. If the progress stays this slow, I am out.Detail is good and character development as well, but for so much time spent with the characters, you'd think you'd know their backgrounds better. Zombie encounters had a unique take with their own development, but they were limited. Honestly this feels more like half a book and perhaps it was the author's intention.So overall, it's not a bad book, but it is incomplete. The next volume may flesh it out.Look up Moody and Autumn on Google and you'll find the author's website with the download. I read it in about 3 hours."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"Most zombie stories begin the same way. Take a random, ordinary day; add a mysterious plague that kills a great percentage of the population; focus on a handful of survivors as they seek each other out and come to terms with the fact that their loved ones are now flesh-eating undead. I really don't see the need for re-writing the classic Night of the Living Dead gig, unless there's a new (or at least interesting) twist to it. Like 28 Days Later, where the never-identified-as-zombies \\"Infected\\" have a very different sort of affliction, and even Shaun of the Dead with its comic twist. Autumn, sadly, offers nothing new or exciting in its story.True to the genre formula, the book begins with an ordinary autumn day turned gruesome, as people begin to asphyxiate and literally drop dead, leaving very few survivors. By the end of the next day, half of the bodies \\"wake up\\" and start walking around aimlessly. And then they start reacting to sound and light... And then they start attacking the living... Not really all that suspenseful if you've ever seen a zombie flick.But that's ok, that's what makes it a horror story. Author David Moody (if he - a horror writer - was actually born with that last name, it would be a crazy coincidence) still has a chance to wow me with his writing skills and characterization. We can look into the human condition; we can sympathize with the characters and bite our nails when it looks like they have no way out. We can be mentally transported to the cottage in which the survivors huddle and feel part of the story. At the very least, since it is a horror story after all, we can be supremely grossed out.Or not.Moody's writing is disappointingly amateurish and repetitive (if I read the phrase \\"unexpected and inexplicable\\" one more time, I would have slammed my head into a wall). His descriptions are flat and the characters are mind-numbingly dull. We skim the surface of them - age, sex, occupation - but never delve into what they are feeling. Their interactions mainly consist of: \\"What should we do?\\" \\"I don't know,\\" and, \\"Are you ok?\\" \\"Yes, are you ok?\\" I think the zombies could have had more interesting conversation!The overall lack of suspense made the entire story seem anticlimactic. Nothing, truly nothing, happens. Even the undead are boring. They don't eat a single brain in the entire book. Everyone knows zombies eat brains! I believe the closest we get is reading how one man is \\"swallowed up by the crowd\\" or something similarly un-detailed and not-interesting. Yawn.Maybe the story gains momentum in one of the four sequels Moody penned for Autumn, but I'll never know, because I won't be reading them."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"One word: boring. This book took 40 pages just to describe people dying everywhere and that the remaining survivors ended up in a hall together. After that, no zombie-killing action for the next 100 pages or so. All of it went something like this: \\"We were all scared. We didn't know what to do. Michael showed signs of irritation at the group's indecisiveness. How could dead bodies move? Some of us wanted to leave, others wanted to stay here. The whole world was coming to an end.\\" Way too much imagery about their surroundings and emotions but not enough horror element to warrant this as a horror novel. Makes a good read for people who just want to throw away their time at amateur work that offers nothing particularly interesting. The spotlight review written by \\"citymars\\" is yet another testimony to the points I'm trying to make.If you really like this or want to see for yourself what I meant, you can download a free ebook version at David Moody's website. Other titles that ARE actually worth reading are: \\"The Rising\\" by Brian Keene and \\"The Walking Dead\\" series by Robert Kirkman."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I wanted to like this book; I can even admire the guy's tenacity and willingness to break the bounds of the genre. I don't have to have gore and violence in my reading.But I do require two things: (1) Plot and (2) Good Writing.In \\"typical\\" zombie books the plot is survival in the face of a terrifying, unfeeling enemy. But while the enemy in this book is unfeeling for certain, they're certainly not that terrifying (other than the whole rotting away aspect, but that's more gross than anything else). So, what's the POINT to the book? I know that it's supposed to be an exploration of the human experience, etc, but it seems just a way to open up a series. The main characters just drive around and are shocked. Which, hey, if it really happened, I would say would be fairly realistic, but this is FICTION and it features REANIMATED CORPSES, so it's not really necessary to be authentic to real life. Um, yeah.But I can overlook all that. My biggest problem with the book is the absolute atrocious nature of the writing. Grammatically, it's okay. Quite a bit of passive voice and trendy use of fragments, but okaaaay, I'll let that go too. No, by far the worst part of the book is that you're being told a story--it's that age-old adage \\"Show, don't Tell\\" and boy does he tell. And tells and tells. He writes things like \\"The arrival of the second survivor brought sudden hope and energy\\"--that's telling us, not showing us. And really, the way he writes you, as the reader, are constantly aware of the writer's voice and the third person narrative. In well-written books, the author disappears and the reader isn't really aware of the third person. But between his endless paragraphs explaining the emotions of the characters while the characters just sit there two-dimensionally (which is a result of telling instead of showing) and his jumps between 1st and 3rd person, the audience can't quite get close to the narrative or to the characters--the narrator/author blocks the way at every turn.All in all, if you're looking to buy a post-apocalyptic book about \\"zombies\\" that isn't necessarily blood, guts and gore, I would recommend World War Z by Max Brooks over this one."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"At first I found it hard to commit to this tale. However, the slow start is appropriate for the grim world that is portrayed. The true feat preformed is to spin a tale of dreadful suspense without buckets of blood and gore. Entries to the zombie genre so often forget that the most powerful scare is to put you in the mindset of a survivor rather than the monsters that caused the calamity - the AUTUMN Series makes up for that over and over again.I was introduced to David Moody through his Survivors group on Facebook. Early on I watched the movie in hopes of catching up with the group. Honestly, I wish that I'd never watched the movie and jumped right into the books. I also haven't finished the series yet, but I have bumped many other books off the top of my 'must read' list just to see where Mr. Moody will take this journey next."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"So, this was apparently a first for the writer and you can tell. The story is slow-moving with dialogue that's stalled from beginning til end. It was interesting to read, but the characters lacked depth and logic. One character asks why they need a rifle. Duh!? And when (spoiler coming) another character swears he's going to kill all the walking dead what does he do? He runs into a mob of undead with a single firearm. He doesn't even get off one shot. Come on? There were other options that was sort of teased, but never attempted by the characters. And there's absolutely zero explanation as to why the outbreak happened and why some folks survived. I eagerly read the book - just to get over with it, so I could begin another zombie thriller. I probably will read Moody's next attempt. And I was thinking about watching the movie, but the reviews on Netflix are absolutely hilarious - hilariously bad. I think the reviews might be more entertaining than the actual film. :)"},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"This was not a story of zombies, and barely a story of the undead. Not to give away too much of the plot, but the bulk of the story centered around a small group of survivors - not so much as how they struggled to survive against the zombies as much as about how bored and lost they were, and how they missed their former lives. The story is well written - no doubt about that - but there is simply not enough here unless you like to read a lot of whining. Any real plot advances are crushed as they plummet into their own set of whining.98% of the conflict in this book is internal to each character, as each character struggles with survivor's guilt and if/how they are going to move forward. Is life really worth living with 99% of the population dead, and some of those \\"re-animated\\"? Would my (now dead) family want me to keep going? How are we going to live? Where are we going to live? Are we just going to \\"survive\\" while we hide from the re-anmiated creatures? You are asked these questions again, and again, and again, and about the fourth time the characters ask the question you almost start to wish they would get attacked or something to spare them, and yourself, more of the half-hearted mental \\"anguish\\" that quickly devolves into just more whining.You don't really get \\"zombies\\" until perhaps the last 15-20 pages, and despite the writing, you never quite feel the -desperation and fear that the author should have been trying to instill. The \\"zombies\\" are terrifying more the way a freight train would be terrifying if you were near the tracks as the train approached. There is no malevolence, no eating flesh, no hunting humans - really very few moments of excitement, and absolutely no chills. In the end, there is nothing thrilling about the climax, and even less about the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"The novel Autumn by David Moody is in one word bleak. In minutes about 99.5 percent of the population of a British city is dead. The few survivors that remain watched everyone around them suddenly choke on their own blood and suffocate to death. Millions upon million of people lay dead in the street, in their offices, and homes. Autumn follows three survivors: Michael, a company executive who watched an entire High School die within seconds, Emma a medical student who was at home with a cold, and Carl a mechanic that came home to find his wife and child dead.The novel follows the three survivors as they find each other and start to prepare how they can go on surviving in a city that in a few weeks will be crawling with disease and pests. Much to the horror of the survivors their plans are complicated by the fact that the dead, after a few days, have begun to rise and as the dead begin to regain their most basic senses they also start to turn violent.I really enjoyed Autumn but when I call the novel bleak I'm not kidding. It's so depressing you just start to wonder why the survivors don't just go ahead and kill themselves. Autumn is the first in the series so the open-ended ending didn't bother me too much. Although almost the entire population drops dead this is not a blood and guts type of thriller it's more a cerebral thriller that keeps you asking the question \\"what would you do if all your options pretty much sucked?\\""},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"Everybody is so hard on Mr. Moody's novels.

How would you cope afterwards ? what would you do ? all these questions, and more are answered in this novel. Sometimes it has you screaming \\"no don't do that\\", such is the extent of MOODY'S ability to reach out of the pages and involve you in the storytelling.

Who is not yet Croesus, but probably will be given a few more years.Autumn is like nothing you're ever read. It is often referred to in word-of-mouth gatherings as a zombie novel (and, in some cases, the zombie novel), and it's blurbed as a zombie novel on its cover. But here's the thing: it's no more a zombie novel than 28 Days Later... is a zombie movie, really. And this has led to some negative reviews by folks who were expecting something other than they got. If your blurb suggests a comparison to Romero, your readers are going to expect Night of the Living Dead lite, at least. Autumn is, above all, not that.It actually starts out rather more like Day of the Triffids than Night of the Living Dead-- a plague, whose genesis we do not yet know (though I assume we'll find out in the rest of the series), wipes out most of humanity. Or so we think-- again, our perceptions are confined to England here. For all we know, the rest of the world is just fine. (A trope used to great effect, with opposite endings, in Day of the Triffids and 28 Days Later....) But it's England we're focused on, and things are decidedly not fine there. A small group of survivors of the plague holes up in a drafty town hall and tries to live together. Moody is not interested in everyone coming together to face tragedy despite conflict, as was the case in Romero's or Robert Kirkman's or Brian Keene's works; no, Moody allows that the group is not sacrosanct, and three of the characters split off to try and find something better. (And yet even this group is not sacrosanct; Moody's iconoclasm cuts all the way to the bone, folks.) The remainder of the first book deals with the first period of his three characters adapting to post-plague life, after the dead finally do get up and walk around, which takes an awfully long time for a supposed zombie novel. It's impossible to go into the other main differences between Autumn and your typical zombie novel without major spoilers. Let's just say that Moody seems to have set out to write, simultaneously, an anti-zombie novel and a satire of zombie novels. Which, for obvious reasons, seems as if it's going to be working at cross-purposes with itself. And yet, somehow, he succeeds-- well enough, at least, that I've put the other three novels in the series in my Amazon shopping cart, to be bought with my Christmas gift certificate.As with most post-apocalyptic novels worth their salt, Moody doesn't focus on the by-products of the plague (in this case, the walking dead); he uses them as accents to highlight his story of interpersonal relations. Which sometimes falls a touch flat; there is, after all, a reason this is self-published work. But while the gulf between self-published and professionally published work is often a vast one, there is the odd book now and then that narrows the gap considerably; Autumn is one of them. This is one of the best-written books you'll ever see outside a professional publishing house. It's worth your time. ***"},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"Cool plot,character developments good, Zombies are interesting.

Much of story is these idiots who hang around a building, yelling at one another, then die. So you get to know a few characters, and then they're dead in a few pages.Gawd. There was not one single character I liked. I actually hoped they would all get keeled and recuse me from this poor excuse of a story."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"Interesting story with the evolution of the zombies. It's drawback is that it's very slow in parts."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"David Moody is not the first author to write about non-zombies. They seem to be popping up more and more as writers search for an original spin to the classic horror monster. What makes Autumn original are its characters. As I read, two things kept drifting into my thoughts. One was The Earth Abides and two, Survivors, the UK television series about a flu pandemic the wipes out over 90% of the world's population. What do these all have in common? Characters from all walks of life. Real characters. Real dialogue.Besides the fact that Autumn kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, I think its characters are what appealed to so many people. They are ordinary, everyday people struggling to survive in extraordinary circumstances. There are things about them you love and there are things about them you hate. They are not perfect people, they are real people. It's easy to then insert yourself into this incredible story of survival, and think yes, I bet there would be people who react this way.There were only a few qualms I had with the book. Mainly little details, like where were they getting their water? I also wondered about the gas pumps (petrol in the UK)-would they still be working without power? If not, the characters could siphon it I suppose, but it was things like this that went unanswered and nagged at me a bit. But not enough to distract me from the story.Autumn is one of those books that will keep you tense, worried, and frightened from beginning to end. It's no wonder it became an online phenomena, with over half a million downloads before St. Martin's picked it up for publication."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I read a lot of Zombie books, some good, some bad. \\"Autumn\\" is in the latter category, it is slow too get moving and the British terminology is off putting.

I'm so happy that he has made it into the mainstream now!"},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I don't understand is this book made of gold or gasoline? Why the hell does it cost sooo much? Does the author David Moody come to your home and actually read the book to you? When you order this book do you get 25 copies? I have many more questions about this book, but I don't wish or want to waste my time. Hope this review helps, maybe when I get back from overseas, get out of the military, sell my home or first born just maybe I will be able to afford such a luxurious book. This explains why the local library doesn't have the book."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"...I'll just talk about the book as a physical object.The print is large and glossy. Not grade school primer large, but still larger than normal novel type. But it's the glossy that gets me, made it hard to read in bed with the light right behind me. The reflecting words disappear into the page. Rather aggravating.The cover has a rather gruesome illustration on the front. No problem, I see gruesome pictures all the time. The back of the book, though, has a TERRIFYING picture. It scared me, this tiny zombie face in a sea of blackness. When I read the book I had to be careful to keep it angled so that my wife couldn't see the front, or especially the back, cover. She would've been left climbing the walls all night.Unfortunately, the cover design is slightly amatuerish and the defining line is visible between the black edge of the graphic and the black of the book cover. Eh, who cares? I don't, not really, but it bothered me when I noticed it.My reaction to the story, in brief, was boredom shooting to tangible fear half way through. The writing isn't the best at points, and an awful lot of time is spent on the feelings of the characters, but when the horror kicks in it was upsetting.I will be buying the next book."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"Okay, so this is a pretty good book but I can't believe people PAID for it. It was a free download on the internet for years!"},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I loved this book series! It was totally different from the traditional Zombie book in that you felt for the zombies and the characters alike. He gave the zombies something personal besides just being murderous. He described them before they became zombies and then in the last book, gave them feelings and names! I am on bedrest due to pregnancy and read the whole series in a matter of days!"},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"At first when I realized this book had been taken up my a mainstream publisher I thought great I will definitely give this one a chance since I am a huge fan of everything zombie related.I do regret buying this book. It's not often that I have regrets about something I have purchased but this is one of those times.The story is nothing special or in fact, new. The writing reads amateurish and when I was finished reading I knew I definitely would NOT go any further into this series.For fans of the genre, if you are looking for action stay away. This book was rather mundane and boring."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"Here's the thing. You see a good deal of negativity directed towards this book but I've got to say, I simply loved it. And hey, it's available for FREE download from Moody's website, so you cant beat the price, right?? And yes, it has it's flaws, and no there isn't a great deal of stereotypical full on zombie slaughter guts and gore going on, but the thing is, that's not the point of the story. What the novel focuses on, and does so exceedingly well is the atmosphere of fear and emotional devastation that such an event as a zombie apocalypse would cause.Completely disturbing and emotionally withering, Autumn is a wonderful spin on the standard zombie apocalypse novel, focusing not so much on the zombies themselves, but the plight of the survivors. Bleak and poignant, Autumn was a novel I could not put down. Er... since I downloaded it.. I could not pry my eyes from the monitor, no matter how much I felt I wanted to. I went on to purchase the following two books in the series as well and loved the both of them.I feel the story is realistic in it's portrayal of what likely would be the behavior of a survivor during a zombie apocalypse. Human nature in all it's negativity, selfishness, and arrogance is portrayed well throughout the novels. But so is the more noble side of mankind. Love, devotion, and hope.Download the novel and give it a chance. I don't imagine any fan of zombie fiction will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I had been eyeing David Moody's 'Autumn' trilogy for a while now and happened to come across all three books in my local used book shop. I couldn't pass up the deal, so I purchased all three.'Autumn', the first in the series, concerns a zombie apocalypse where about 98% of the world population just up and dies. The story that we're told concerns twenty or so survivors in a small English village. The survivors hole up in an old community center and watch as the dead rise. At first the dead are harmless, but as the days pass become more aggressive and eventually downright deadly. Hilarity ensues.The plot focuses on three of these survivors, two men and a woman, none of whom are what I would call \\"likeable\\". Moody's characterization is very thin and the characters are constantly doing and saying things that no normal person, regardless of the stress of the situation, would ever do or say. Our three \\"heroes\\" tire of the situation at the community center and, through some vague rationalization, decide to set out on their own. They head out into the countryside and suffer through some less than thrilling adventures and eventually find a farmhouse out in the middle of Nowheresville, England. They set up shop but, unfortunately for them, the zombies find them.The books reads quickly, but not because its necessarily interesting but moreso because of its amateurishness. Characterization is attempted(one guy misses his dead family, another is tough on the outside but a real softie on the inside, etc.)but shows that Moody is no Stephen King. The storyline is pretty standard for a zombie book: run, get attacked by zombies, hide, get attacked again. Lather. Rinse. Repeat. I can deal with all the usual trappings of the survival horror genre. In fact, I like most of them. But they're just not very interesting here in 'Autumn'. There's no real excitement in words on the page. Its hard to care what happens to characters you don't like in situations that are supposed to be life-and-death but just come across as more lifeless than anything(pardon the pun). Example: the climax of the book involves the three survivors being overrun by zombies. Its the most dull, least exciting zombie attack I've read or seen. It is supposed to be a big, cathartic moment but comes across completely anti-climactic.I can't really recommend 'Autumn' as it just wasn't very good. The pace is slow, the plot is dull, and the characters are one dimensional and annoying. That being said, I still am going to read the other books in the series. Moody has some good ideas but, at least in 'Autumn' anyways, he just doesn't have the skill as a writer to make me care about what happens. Maybe he improves as the series moves on, I guess I'll find out.On a related note, 'Autumn' will soon be a feature film. I don't think it'll be coming to your local cineplex, but you'll probably be able to find it on DVD eventually. Here's a link to the website with a trailer for the film(which looks slightly more exciting that the book itself):[...]"},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"The mundane reality of a zombie attack might just be that - a mundane attack that doesn't present itself as something fast-paced and bloody but as something that imprisons people amongst themselves. In the beginning there were the problems with the air, and the coughing and gagging that led to Patient Zero quickly began infecting the population, Soon there were cities filled with bodies and ghosts, highways clogged with asphalt debris, and there were also the survivors. As far as the survivors go, there was the community center that sheltered individuals, almost paper walls and a lack of both patience and food, and later there were other places with one thing in common. Within each place, amidst all of the walls, there are explosions of what makes humanity all-too-human.That's what Moody offers - a look into the way people deal with one another when confined into a societal coffin.When I first started reading Autumn, it took me a while to get into the \\"flow\\" of the book because the pacing can seem to drone on a bit. It took me a while to figure out that it wasn't the \\"flow\\" that was causing me problems - it was the expectations that I brought to the table when reading the book. When thinking of the atypical zombie book, I don't expect everyone to fall down and the survivors to have to come to terms with what is taking place, hoping beyond hope that something good will come of it. Within Autumn, however, that is exactly what transpired. He used his writing talents to track multiple characters, sometimes over thirty at a time, and tracking thirty characters is a lot different than trying to keep up with a few people under the press of teeth and timing.With a rest and a second try I saw that and, as I moved on, I found I really liked the book.Admittedly, this book IS NOT for everyone. A lot of people called it slow-paced and that is true; introducing a montage of personalities really takes a long time. If you need something new to try out, however, you should look into the book and see if you like the pacing. If you search the internet for the book you can find free samples of the literature, and this is only something that grows and grows as the problem continues to grow.While not my favorite read ever, it does get high marks for excellence in continuing the genre in new ways. Check out what exists by keywording Moody and Autumn and see if you like it. If so, you have a lot of books to look forward to."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"David Moody did a masterful job of creating a tense world in Autumn. As some other reviewers have written, he does not jump right off into a chaotic apocalypse where the dead are trying to eat the living. Yet, while some have claimed the novel is slow, I disagree; I found the first part of Autumn (where the dead are ambulatory, yet not attacking the living) to create an immense tension which made the novel incredibly entertaining.I was turning each page (on my Kindle, so not literally) with the same sense of dread that I feel when watching a horror film and awaiting the scare. I knew that the dead would eventually become dangerous and the wait made Autumn scary in a very different way. Thumbs up to Moody on this accomplishment. After all, why should every zombie novel follow the same format?As the dead become dangerous, the novel becomes more about the survivors than the surviving. I came to care about the dynamics between the three who hole up in the farmhouse - their decisions were logical, believable ones in a way that made me feel they did what I would have done if (when, LOL) the zombie apocalypse does come. They don't magically overcome their demons nor their dysfunction, instead they have to work around them to survive.If you want down-and-dirty zombie action go with Craig DiLouie. And I believe that is where the disappointment expressed in some of the negative reviews emanates. If you want an entertaining, scary, psychological horror novel where zombies happen to be driving the plot, pick up Autumn. This is a zombie novel that Alfred Hitchcock would write - if that appeals to you, you will be very glad you read this novel."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I decided to expand my horizons and read this book to see why so many are fascinated by zombies. Vampires I understand, but zombies? I was surprised by how well the book was written, how well the characters were developed, and how tight the plot line was. The writer doesn't bog the reader down with moral stream-of-conscience ramblings by under-developed characters. I just wanted to have a fun time reading an entertaining book about zombies and I got that and more. It's fast-paced where it needs to be and slows down to let you catch your breath when you need to!"},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"Here's how to make a good idea go bad in about 300 pages: sloppy and repetitive writing, careless characterization, zombies that aren't scary, and a story that shambles around as aimlessly as one of the undead it describes.For an example of this, see David Moody's 'Autumn,' a book which starts out strong, promising a fresh spin on the zombie story but delivering something stale and dull.I'll say this much - it's refreshing to read a first book in a series and be left with no desire to continue reading the rest. Life's too short to read bad books, and 'Autumn' was enough for me."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I really wanted to get behind this book. I've read other zombie novels and I've loved them.I just couldn't.This was a really quick read. The main characters were bothersome. The one with the most depth became dull as the author reminded us again and again of the character's driving force.A lot of the prose was beating the dead dog. Anytime someone came up with a proactive idea, there were pages upon pages of argument. The point when I felt the characters should have argued, they didn't, causing plenty of problems and ultimately forcing them from their safe haven.The initial few chapters, in which everyone died, had me on edge. They were that awesome. The shell shocked survivors that came after that, well, let's just say that their elevators no longer went to the top floor.The zombies, oh the zombies. There wasn't even really a zombie until a good quarter of the way through the book. Even after the dead started shambling, they only shambled aimlessly, not reaching their full zombie potential until well into the novel. Scenes involving them varied from nail biting to dull.I'm torn as to if I'm going to attempt to continue the series. I'm hoping that the author learned from his faults and improved, because what was exciting was very much so. It was just padded with a whole lot of unnecessary fluff."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"First let me applaud the author on creating a compelling Zombie world in which to take his readers through. With some nice twists (Zombies which do not immediately rise, and when they do...don't immediately notice the Living..brilliant!)...this book is written with a more serious tone than some other books in the genera might be. This is a book for the person looking for a Zombie drama, not a Zombie Die-Hard experience. Also, because the situation takes place in England, its a refreshing change of location.Unfortunately, at least for me, this book takes a very, very, very long time to get rolling. The very cool twist with the zombies I mention above is not used as well as it could have been, in fact its somewhat tragic that the book didn't explore this situation further. Soon the situation changes and the standard human-attacking zombie is back in the fold. This is a cool idea that I hadn't encountered before and frankly, I wished the author had spent more time here....it could have *really* made the pacing of this book unique (rather than the standard Humans-Run-From-Attacking-Zombies).Also, endless reminders of the shattered psyche of the characters really starts to get in the way after a certain point, particularly when nothing much is happening. When things do get rolling, the story immediately begins to mirror...well.....isolated Farmhouse? 'nuff said. So we are treading on a bit of conquered ground to a certain extent. This, by itself isn't an issue...but because the book takes quite a bit of time to get our characters to said farmhouse, it seems to all wrap up fairly quickly...as though the Author only wanted to include enough \\"meat\\" in this book to sell the sequel.One last thing, because we are always reminded of the horror the characters are experiencing, the author seems that gives them carte blanche to behave like jerks, all the time. This gets old since, halfway through the book, I was hoping they'd all get wiped out, and a new more \\"deserving\\" bunch of humanity would appear :) No such luck.So, I hated it? No, absolutely not. In fact, I'm buying the next book in the series, because I want to see more of the world the writer has created. Issues with the read? Yes....but not terrible ones. I'd rather have a slow book with some well-traversed zombie situations than a shallow cliche ridden action fest. But in the end 3 stars....I enjoyed it, but with some reservations. I am, however, looking forward to reading more...something I can't say about all the books I read."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"\\"Surviving is one thing, but you've got to have a reason to do it. There's no point in living if you don't have anything worth living for\\"When I first read the premise for Autumn, I couldn't wait to read it. If there is one thing I love more than vampires and werewolves it's ZOMBIES! You can't help but let this book get into your head and under your skin. The very thought of something like this happening to you in real life is terrifying enough on it's own. The nagging question keeps running through your head \\"What would I do?\\"David Moody knew how to deliver a solid, frightening story! His setting descriptions alone were enough to give me the chills. He had a perfect way for describing how dark, cold and spooky the surroundings were and how horrible the decaying zombies looked and acted(although never once does he use the 'Z' word). As the storyline progressed, so did the intensity and the suspense. It is nearly impossible to read just a few chapters at a time. If \\"life\\" didn't interrupt my reading, I could have easily finished this book in one sitting.The character cast is strong, each having their own stern opinion on survival. It is easy to find a bond with at least one character and relate to them. I instantly bonded with Emma. She was remaining tough on the surface, but was frequently second guessing things in her mind. Which is easy to understand because in a situation like that, how do you really know what your doing is the right thing. She was strong-willed but was willing to show her scared, vulnerable side as well.I absolutely loved this book. It is a great read even for people that aren't familiar with this genre. It hooks you from the very beginning and will leave you wanting more after your turn the last page. Thankfully, we will get more because the sequel to Autumn, Autumn: The City was released Feb 1, 2011. I can't wait to see what else is in store for the survivors and The City.What I loved: The intensity of it. The awesome cover. The overall storyWhat I disliked: Nothing. Honestly, what's not to love about this book?!"},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"moody writes a tale of horror based on what happens when everything and almost everyone dies. just a handful of unlucky ones left have to decide how they are going to handle the apocolypse, the fight or flight syndrome. nobody has their guts ripped out for dinner or arms used for toothpicks. autumn is an emotional. scary ride that leaves you waiting for the next book"},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"Just finished this book and although it needs a better proofreader, it was really quite good. Really made me want to read the next book to see what happens next. Hope his writing improves, because I want to read more."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"Moody's book takes place in the UK and has a different set of the typical Romeo zombie. The characters are built up very well, and the reader can feel the tension, not only with the zombie, but between the survivalists as well. I think that Moody did a lot of research to make this book as realistic as possible. The only reason it did not get five stars was because I thought the book was a little slow in the middle section."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"David Moody's novel Autumn is a realistic account of the emotional upheaval and responses that might plague the people who survive a quick-acting pandemic, and who must then struggle for survival against those who have risen after having fallen dead.The dread from Moody's work is not the horror of blood and guts, but the slow, creeping psychological terror that must accompany being trapped within a structure while becoming increasingly surrounded on the outside by creatures that would like nothing more than to destroy you. The claustrophobia of the work is reminiscent of Romero's Day of the Dead and Matheson's I am Legend. Do not look to this novel for quick-paced action as this is not what this book is about, rather this is how the world ends for each person, individually."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I have to say, man, I agree with the \\"Boring\\" guy! Not to mention the fact that the writing style is very simplistic.I had to put it down when confronted with something along the lines of \\" after fighting for survival virtually every moment since the disaster had begun, a slice of good luck finally came the way of Emma , Michael and Carl\\" What's wrong with this, you say? Well, at this point in the story the only fight for survival these three charecters have faced is driving around in a van. Nothing at this point has threatened them, heck they haven't even run out of gas. This is half-way through the book, mind you.As a stand alone story, if you have never read any zombie fiction ...it still kinda sucks. If you have read basically anything else, say Brian Keene's \\"The Rising\\", for example, or Robert Kirkman's \\"The Walking Dead\\" comics then I have a hard time thinking you will like this light weight attempt that reads like it was written by a freshman in high school (albeit a freshman that probably made a fair amount of coin off of the ignorant masses. Someone said this is being made into a movie? Man, I'm in the wrong line of work!)One bit of respect for the author- this first book in the series is available as a PDF on his website so at least you don't have to pay for it. If you do like it then buy the rest of them because it is a pretty cool concept."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"David Moody's AUTUMN is brilliant. It's an unexpected journey that explores the emotional stability of survivors when faced with the realization that 99% of the population is dead. Left with only questions and an uncertain future, three survivors band together in search for some of life's basic needs and a futile effort to try to distance themselves from the lives they once knew.Although killed off by disease, the dead don't stay dead for long. At first they pose no threat; they're nothing but seemingly mindless bodies walking with no destination. Slowly, they regain some of their previous senses and begin posing a significant threat, if by nothing else than their sheer numbers.The dead take a back seat here, and in fact David never uses the word \`Zombie' even once. Instead of violence, blood, and gore, we're given an incredibly realistic insight into the emotional side of what it would be like to survive such a significant life-changing event. Neurotic emotions, crazed ideas, and uncertainty are of the norm, making even simple tasks like going to the bathroom and boredom become things that can drive a person to the brink of insanity.Final Verdict:I once saw a bumper sticker that read: \\"The hardest part about a Zombie Apocalypse will be pretending I'm not excited.\\" While I have to admit that running around blasting away at the undead with a sawed-off shotgun holds appeal, the reality of the situation would eventually sink in and put a squash to whatever short-lived thrill that provided. What's left would be the personal hell that David so availingly captures in his novel AUTUMN.Hands-down one of my favorite reads of 2010. DON'T MISS THIS ONE."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"Unlike his American counterparts, Mr. Moody doesn't go for the cranial shotgun blast style of zombie horror. His protagonists aren't heroes. They are socially awkward, chronically depressed and in a state of deep shock following the biblical disaster that has befallen the planet. This is the most realistic plague tale that I have read to date. A great book and I look forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I didn't care for this one very much. The zombies weren't very scary and the whole thing just kind of fell into a rut."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"So far, this is my favorite post-apocalyptic series. It is truly POST the apocalypse. Ths is what I enjoy: finding out what comes next. This series is inventive and well-written. if you stick through to the end of the series you will feel great satisfaction if the post-apocalypse is something you enjoy reading about. This series has just the right balance of zombie, zombie explanation, zombie science and survival. Some authors waste too much time explaining how we got here. This book offers us just enough explanation to enjoy the story of what comes next."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"Well I got as far as page 150 and was ready to toss this book. I couldn't let it beat me w/ 130 pages left so I read on. What happened is that the book actually started to pick up and became readable.If you can handle an overly long setup and zombies that do nothing for over 1/2 of the story then you may like this little tale.There are better zombie books out there (and lord knows there are worse ones) so if you just saw the dawn of the dead movie and want to try some zombie horror I would begin w/ The Rising or The Walking Dead (TPB but the best zombie fiction out there). I also hear Twilight of the Dead is good.For me I have read most of the stuff out there and find this book falls somewhere in the middle. I will probably pick up the next book but don't feel compelled to do so.If You are in the middle of the book and are wondering if the zombies will actually do something well just keep reading and around page 160 the story will begin to pick up and ends well."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I was quite disappointed after reading Autumn. Maybe it was the large anticipation I had incorporated when purchasing the book, thinking that post-apocalyptic scenarios were \\"my kind of thing\\" (and they still are). However, Moody's book was very poorly written. Not only did I encounter numerous grammatical mistakes, but there was absolutely no connection with the characters. It was almost like, \\"here are the characters, now you must try and relate to them and follow through with their overly obvious situations.\\" I felt no sympathy with Carl's death, or any other middle school -written events that occurred. Overall, this was a terrible book in the sense that there was no captivation whatsoever. Although the abysmal stance of Autumn, Moody is an amateur, and will hopefully progress in later writings."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I am mad at myself for wasting ten bucks on this book! The plot was slower than a turtle swimming in a pool full of yogurt. The characters were boring and I never felt any connection to any of them. The zombies were equally as boring. I grew weary of the snarky way the characters were in the beginning, when they were all still in the one depressing building together. I expected things to pick up after Emma, Mike and Carl struck out on their own but that didn't happen either.One of the best series I've read (zombie themed) was the \\"As the World Dies\\" trilogy by RhiannonFrater. Those books were fast paced, full of action and intrigue and the characters were interesting. Plus it also made you think about how mankind really WOULD react if some similar apocalypse occurred. I CARED about the characters in that story and immediately downloaded the second and third books in this series after reading the first. I WON'T be doing that with the \\"Autumn\\" series."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"I felt like I was reading the outline for the book and not the actual end result. Like if the author of the Dick and Jane series wrote a zombie story this is what it would be like. I kept on though despite the many, many frustrating and confusing misprints, typos and grammatical errors because I am in desperate need of zombie reading material. It was slow and annoying because the characters in the book seemed to all be like minded in the sense that there were always ONLY two options and never any more, and the zombies don't cause any threat at all until like the last 3 chapters and even then the threat is minimal.Why read a zombie novel only to have the story based on the emotions of the characters and their incredibly uncreative brains and not the trails and thrills of survival in a dooms day like setting? I mean that's what draws me to zombie fiction in the first place... I assume I am not alone in this.All in all I was very disappointed with the story and hope for more books to come out like Justin Cronin's The Passage and the Max Brooks novel World War Z. Also if anyone happening to read this knows of more books similar to the ones I just put out there please do me a favor and comment on this review with the info as I am always interested in quality zombie reading material!:)"},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"In less than twenty-four hours, billions are dead. The virus killed so fast that on one block a William Price was first to go and within five minutes his entire street had become a cemetery. Less than 1% of mankind survived the first wave. Those who do are in shock as they say good-bye to loved ones and in Britain they soon realize when no one responds to 999 or anything on the radio that civilization as they know it is over.Factory mechanic Carl Henshawe cannot believe his beloved wife and their little girl is dead. Computer company executive Michael Collins gives lecture to a class of teens ignoring him when he horrifically watches them die. Fighting a cold medical student Emma Mitchell skips class and goes to the nearby shop to buy food only to see the owner and other patrons die. The few survivors find one another at a dilapidated community center waiting for first responders who never come. Instead as supplies dwindle, the dead begin to reanimate. The noise of the living disturbs the undead and even loved ones are coming to silence those who have not changed; the only thing that stops them is their rotting flesh.This is an enjoyable cerebral zombie thriller in which David Moody looks deep into the souls of those who survived the virus; for instance others like Phillip struggle to move on pass a deceased loved one. Slowly the few humans find civilization stripped bare until the only thing left is whether it is worth the fight to stay alive. Though the story line is at times deliberately slow as Michael, Carl and Emma rotate internal pensive musings, readers who relish a different bite on zombies will appreciate the grim moody atmosphere of Autumn.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"Autumn is an amazing addition to the apocalyptic zombie genre.

In AUTUMN, the shell-shocked survivors of a sudden worldwide plague struggle to overcome their daze and find a way to avoid the living dead that are soon everywhere, attracted to sound, and violent. There is surprisingly little violence and gore and the characters often seem stunned by indecision at times, behaving exactly how real people would to such an impossible crisis, and setting up cathartic bursts of action that frequently had me on edge. Moody's vision of the apocalypse is dark, gritty, realistic, dirty, almost hopeless and entirely original. The zombies are utterly repulsive, almost rotting right off the page, and frightening due to their unpredictability. The result is an entirely different kind of zombie story that is unusually gripping."},{"Title":"Autumn","review":"David Moody creates a world of tension, stress and horror in this book. His style of writing is like no other and the atmosphere he creates is downright terrifying.

By containing the scope and objectives to the major leap from ad hoc (level 1) to repeatable (level 2) and from there to defined (level 3) you can concentrate on achieving firm milestones that will lead to these levels.Where other books on the CMM get sidetracked on nice to know, but not essential information, this stays on track, squarely aimed at achieving the targets. You get policies, process flows and procedures for each KPA, as well as a transition plan and questionnaires. In short, all of the important artifacts to get you from level 1 to 2, or from level 2 to 3. These artifacts cover the entire implementation cycle from how to start to final assessment.If you are serious about attaining level 2 or 3, not only will this book save time and prevent false starts and retracing steps, but the companion CD ROM, \\"HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE CMM - SOFTCOPY DOCS\\" will save even more time because all of the artifacts are provided in MS Word, Excel and PowerPoint formats."},{"Title":"Smart Moves: Your Guide Through the Emotional Maze of Relocation","review":"This book was recommended to me as my husband and I were embarking on a move that was VERY difficult for me.

The book covers every conceivable topic about the personal and emotional transitions that accompany a move, and was easy to read and enormously helpful. Make sure you pick up a copy if you or anyone else you know is making a big move!"},{"Title":"Smart Moves: Your Guide Through the Emotional Maze of Relocation","review":"As a co-author of this book I am obviously somewhat prejudiced, but thought potential readers might be interested in the book's origins. In the process of writing a chapter on the effects of relocation on children (available in the Handbook of Child Psychiatry, Vol 4 from J. Wiley)I was struck with the difficulty many children experienced following a move, and with the lack of resources available to help adults or children deal with the stresses of relocation. Some of the best research on the effects of relocation on adults had been done by Audrey McCollum, and so I contacted her and we began to work on a book that could help both individuals and families better prepare for and deal with the stresses of relocation. Nadia Jensen, with a doctorate in early childhook education, joined us to help focus on the needs of young children and on issues related to schools. As a cartoonist, and coauthor of several workbooks, I very much wanted to include cartoons to help lighten the mood and worksheets to help people carry out specific assignments in the process of preparing for their move. As a superb writer and storyteller, Audrey argued for an uninterupted text. Our compromise was to put a cartoon at the beginning of each chapter, and worksheets at the end of each chapter. If you buy this book, I would love to hear from you what you found most helpful in it and what you think we should change in the next edition. Good luck with your move. Stu Copans"},{"Title":"Smart Moves: Your Guide Through the Emotional Maze of Relocation","review":"This book is written for married couples with children considering a move -- particularly those who are relocating for employment reasons. Every chapter addresses 'his' needs and 'her' needs, making decisions as a couple, moving, adjusting, etc. There is a small amount of information for people making moves related to retirement. But if you are single or a single parent and moving (including the 51% of women in this country who are unmarried), this book will not address your needs or concerns.For those looking for a 'guide through the emotional maze of relocation,' this focuses only on the negative emotions that may arise with relocating. I expected that the 'emotional maze' would provide a more even-handed discussion of all of the emotions surrounding relocating, positive as well as negative, benefits to be gained as well as the emotional costs of moving. But this focuses on the stress, anxiety and loss related to moving and misses the opportunity to explore the excitement, discovery, and rewards that can also accompany a move. Disappointing overall."},{"Title":"Smart Moves: Your Guide Through the Emotional Maze of Relocation","review":"Dealing with the pain of moving involves more than just the move itself.

Peter Sacco dissects why we keep picking the same type of people only to fail all over again.I am a counselor residing in the San Diego area and work alot with abused women and couples in counseling. I also work as a relationship coach, mostly for women. I put this book right at the top of my recommendation list!Good reading."},{"Title":"Why Women Want What They Can't Have: Why So Many Relationships Fail","review":"I am very disappointed with this book. Seems like a thesis he may have written when finishing grad school, something you would write in the 1970's. Should have been titled Men Can't Change. Filled with typo errors. To imagine I would have stopped reading in the first Chapter, but thought I should continue since I had been planning on taking a course in which this book is a requirement. Now I am wondering if this book is being used for this class, because he is the teacher. I am seriously considering no longer taking this class, since if this is the book they are using, I wouldn't feel I would be getting a college level education, but rather a highschool level education. Repetitive on the fact that men can't change and that society made them this way, and when men interpret women nagging, they go off and cheat on their wives. I find this to be an insult to women, and not a way of changing behavior. A repetitious and not well written book I was expecting for a college class -- but perhaps useful to someone who has absolutely 'no clue' to understanding themselves, or the men who can't communicate.This is one of those books I would have loved to return and would have never bought at the store. Worse yet most of his book references date back from the 1900's to the 1960's some 70's and 80's few 90's. If you also include the fact that he uses two pages for a chapter title and two pages for a quote; with 17 chapters you'll have to deduct 68 pages from the actual number of pages of the book!Although I cannot deny that in the midst of it all, there is a very thin silver lining, on the need for change, by women of course, because he won't change...The book I'd recommend instead is Deborahh Tannen's \\"You Just Don't Understand; Women and Men in Conversation\\" an excellent book."},{"Title":"Flirting with Disaster","review":"Since I'm not familiar with the theatre I found all her books fun and full of suspense.

Kate, now confused and hurting is thrust into a relationship with another and again is plunged into a life and death situation of murder, mayhem and mystery.I feel author, Deborah Nicholson has truly outdone herself in this latest work. Her growth as a writer is extremely evident as she holds your thoughts captive in this read. She brings romance, mystery and adventure expertly into this work and intertwines characters in the storyline that are both loveable and repulsive. You never forget Cam, although he is not present through most of the read and you find yourself in the same emotional dilemma concerning heartstrings to him that Kate is feeling.This is always a mark of an excellent writer when they pull you into the mind of their character.You wonder about Kate; is her spirit truly one with Cam or will her heart belong to another? And who is after Kate and why?I have to say this is truly the best work by Deborah Nicholson yet; grabbing your attention and understanding of the story whether this is your first taste of this series or if you are reading along with each outstanding book as it is released. I honestly give this book my highest recommendation. It is one of romance, mystery, adventure and a storyline with heart. I believe we truly have another winner.

So if you really enjoy this work I highly recommend the other works as well.Alittle back ground, Philip Schaff (1819-1893) was a German Reformed church historian, born in Switzerland. He was educated at Tubingen, Halle, and Berlin, and later took a position as Professor of Church History at Union Theological Seminary, New York.Schaff bases his work on the premise that church history in order to be valid and valuable must deal with three factors:1. God through Christ,2. man as a responsible moral creature, and3. satan as a real being employing the anti-Christ as his agent at the end of time.For anyone intrested in this study but finds this a bit dry to read, might be intrested in the A&E; 2 DVD documentry: Christianity the first 2000 Years.

Both times, the core textbook was Williston Walker - comprehensive, but dry-as-dust. My college professor told us that if you really want to dig deep, read Philip Schaff's \\"History of the Christian Church.\\" I did - it took me several years, off and on, but I read all eight volumes.The volumes were published (and revised several times) between 1858 and 1893, except for volumes 5 & 6, The Middle Ages, written by Philip's son David Schaff and published in 1907 & 1910 (after Philip's death in 1893). David Schaff's work is every bit as thorough, but the writing is not up to his father's high standards. The series ends with Beza and the close of the Swiss Reformation.The scholarship is quite dated, especially Vol. 1, \\"Apostolic Christianity,\\" which is essentially a late-nineteenth century introduction to the New Testament. That said, though, the virtues of the work far outweigh its shortcomings.Schaff writes beautifully, and from a broad-minded, nineteenth century evangelical protestant position. All his prejudices are right out in front where we can see them. He extols the many virtues of the various branches of the Christian Church, and he unabashedly condemns its abuses. Yes, Protestants get the better treatment; but when they acted shamefully, Schaff says so and calls them to account (see his chapter on Calvin and Servetus). I disagree with him in places - he has little regard for any form of mysticism (a symptom, no doubt, of his milieu of high modernist rationalism).I love this work for two reasons: first, it's all here - every writer, every renegade, every little sect, every doctrinal controversy - Schaff doesn't miss a thing. And second, Schaff writes beautiful prose. This is history written with heart and soul.If you want a comprehensive, devotional reading of church history (and are willing to invest the time), I can't imagine a better guide than Philip Schaff.p.s. Free scanned versions of this set are available from several sources: one is Google Books; another is an excellent freeware program called Bible Explorer."},{"Title":"History of the Christian church","review":"This 8 volume set by Philip Schaff is a masterpiece. Scholarship in the 19th century far surpassed what passes for most academic writing today. Well the above review gives the index. A casual perusal will give you a hint of the riches in these books. I doubt anyone would read them through cover to cover, but I use them for reference. Want to find out more about how the orthodox understanding of the trinity came about? It's here. Want to find out how the church got so involved in government and politics? It's here. Want to read about how the papal system developed? It's here. As things come up in discusions, it's ok not to know once. But the next time around, you should of come here already to find out a least an overview of the matter. It's a great tool.Though the content is available online, I highly recommend the print version, as it is a lot of reading material and looks nice on the shelf. Like you know what you're talking about."},{"Title":"History of the Christian church","review":"Schaff's series is simply phenomenal. Why? Highly detailed work with a marvelous synthesization of human history and God's providence. Most Christian historians forget that history isn't about spitting out facts. History belong's to God and Schaff's great insight combines these important aspects to create a work that hides from nothing and reveals everything. His narrative is almost poetical at times. Schaff writes in a way that truly is beautiful. At times I wanted to read to my wife certain portions because it was so exquisite. It actually makes me disappointed in modern historical narrative.All in all, Schaff is fair in not supressing truth but being blatantly honest of the Church's history. Reading this series can be nothing short of having a powerfully captivating, realistically depicting, lovingly woven history of the Church. This series is a great aide to me in understanding why I am where I am at today, and where I can change to be faithful to the Word of God and His will for the Church."},{"Title":"History of the Christian church","review":"Yes, it is written in 19th century, and not by Bart Ehrman, or one of the fellas of \\"Jesus Seminar\\"But if you really need a grasp of centuries of Church History you cannot go without this one.I have two sets: one in English (one pictured), and one in Russion (one I currently read). You see, this is a solid work. Not surprising it was translated by Russian brothers and sisters ;) Solid works deserve to be translated and respected.Sure, it may not be perfect. But it should not be ignored.I really and sincerely would love to have a similar compilation by contemporary scholar(s), but I don't think such work exists. I hope Baker, IVP, or some other Christian organization would consider producing church history set similar to Bible Commentary sets. That is, compiled by multiple scholars with respective knowledge in their field, for each period. Similar to \\"baker exegetical commentary on the new testament\\" or similar. There are several good commentary sets, but not many Church History sets.Whatever the case, reading all volumes in this set will absolutely certainly increase your knowledge of the subject, and it is written with Christian attitude too.Again, not some Ehrman-Bauer boloney.Schaff breaks Church History into 9 periods. Three in early history, three in middle ages, and three in modern history.

This covers from the Apostles to the European Reformation and just after. I love it for referencing Calvin, Luther, Augustinianism, Arminianism, Pelagianism, etc. I am especially thankful for its notes on Moderate Augustinianism! Arminianism was not the first response against late Augustinianism, This set has much to say about the progression of and acceptance doctrines in the church over time. I highly recommend it for historical referencing. This also shows that current five point Calvinism was not what the Apostles had in mind, as the foundation for it began several hundred years later in the late third century at least(see volume three)."},{"Title":"History of the Christian church","review":"Want to know Church History this is the best resource for that. I am currently enjoying this set. Wow is all I can say"},{"Title":"History of the Christian church","review":"Let me begin by stating that I've read only the first volume of this set from cover to cover, having just sampled the others. My review is therefore a bit limited in its scope, particularly since the last volumes were written not by Philip Schaff but by his son, who may have imposed his own style and tone.Overall I liked the first volume, but as a history of the church it has too many weaknesses to earn a high rating. First of all, Schaff was too much of a Christian to write dispassionately. The book often lapses into what is closer to apologetics than to history, and at times you can almost see him holding his nose when he has to write about (ugh!) pagans. Even more objectionable in my opinion is the presence of numerous passages such as the following:&quot;As religion is the deepest and holiest concern of man, the entrance of the Christian religion into history is the most momentous of all events. [...] Jesus Christ, the God-Man, the prophet, priest, and king of mankind, is, in fact, the centre and turning-point not only of chronology, but of all history, and the key to all its mysteries. Around him, as the sun of the moral universe, revolve at their several distances, all nations and all important events, in the religious life of the world; and all must, directly or indirectly, consciously or unconsciously, contribute to glorify his name and advance his cause.&quot; (pp. 56-57)This is a panegyric on the Christian religion, not history. And yet Schaff tells us that &quot;The historian must first lay aside all prejudice and party zeal ...&quot; (p. 25)Another drawback of this work is its age: it dates from about 1900. Age is not an issue in some forms of writing, but it is felt in this case. For example, Schaff tries to refute a date of 170 AD for the composition of John's Gospel, as was maintained by the Tubingen school in Germany. Decades after Schaff died, it was noticed that a papyrus fragment dating from the first half of the second century in fact contains a few partial verses of John, proving that the 170 AD date is untenable (see Bruce Metzger, &quot;The Text of the New Testament&quot;). Thus, although events proved Schaff correct in his judgment, someone reading only this book would be unaware of the most persuasive piece of evidence. Also, the bibliographic references, which Schaff clearly labored so hard on, are of course over a century old.In summary, this work shows its age and is often tendentious. However, the reader can find in these volumes a treatment of almost every main personage and significant event in the history of the Christian church."},{"Title":"History of the Christian church","review":"First, let me admit that I have read onlyportions of Schaff's work, so the 4 starsare just a guess and s/b ignored. While Ihesitate to write a review of anything I'venot read, once again I'll make an exception.The reason is that I have read the firstfour volumes of Warren Carroll's \\"History ofChristendom\\" and especially recommend volume4, \\"The Cleaving of Christendom\\" for balance.If one sticks to non-Catholic authors, oneis in danger of reading only half of history.Also good for balance is Thomas Woods' \\"Howthe Catholic Church BUILT Western Civilization\\"(emphasis in original). Woods' book isdelightful because it is mere history andmakes no theological statements. However muchis does not threaten anyone's theology, itis quite upsetting to most people's view ofthe historical role of Catholics."},{"Title":"CAPRICCIO ESPAGNOL AND OTHER CONCERT FAVORITES IN FULL SCORE.","review":"Besides Capriccio Espagnol, opus 34 (1887), this volume contains the two following works of Rimsky-Korsakov: Dance of the Buffoons from Act III of the opera Snow Maiden (Snegurochka, 1887-82); and the overture Russian Easter, opus 36 (1888).

That is the case with me. Dover scores are simply the best asset to anyone learning composition/orchestration. They may have printing errors or articulation inconsistencies, but that is ok, because you probably won't be using these scores to conduct a real concert program, I would hope. The three pieces provided in this book are masterpieces of comp and orchestration, and have endless learning potential. You have the Bach, Brahms, and Beethoven, now its time to get into the wonderful world of Rimsky Korsakov. Anyone can get something out of this score, and for the affordable price, its the best deal of them all."},{"Title":"Pictorial Key to the Tarot","review":"I finally got the Rider Waite tarot and I was impressed with that, it was the first modern tarot card deck and it became the standard that all other decks are judged by. Arthur Waite was a master of the arcane and a famous person and Golden Dawn member from its heyday in the late 1800s and early 1900s. You could get this book just as a sampling of the greatness of the author Mr. Waite and the occult mastery he stood for. But as a referance for his own masterpiece the Rider Waite tarot it is indespensible and thee source for more information on the cards other than that given in the instruction booklet. The beginning of the book is a history of the tarot cards and then the meanings of the cards with pictures of each individual card. The meanings of the cards themselves take up one page each and the picture of each card also takes up one page each. As for the ease of reading, I would say if you can go to at least a division III university and pass English 101 or any other English class numbered 100 or higher, you could read almost anything. The thing about these books available for enjoyment that you can buy at bookstores is they don't use very big words, just technical information as it pertains to the sibject. Something like the 4 of cups if you didn't have a previous knowledge of tarot that might confuse someone. They do not use geeky versions of words, for example the word hate they would not use in a published book the word \\"animosity\\" as a synonym for the word hate. If you can read and enjoy Stephen King than you might like occult literature."},{"Title":"Pictorial Key to the Tarot","review":"Waite's pretentious as all get out, but he stresses that the tarot reader is &quot;Boss&quot;.

The descriptions of each card are confusing and vague. Some of the descriptions even contradict each other. Waite rarely touches on the symbolism in each card.The divinatory meanings behind the Major Arcana are non existent!The introduction reads like a boring history lesson and Waite's explanations of each minor arcana card comes off rather pompous. I've also noticed that in some of his descriptions when he references to other cards he refers to them by the wrong number.I really didn't enjoy reading this book. And after I finished reading it, I still felt like I didn't know anything about tarot cards.If you're looking for a well written, concise but descriptive book to help you learn about tarot cards I would definitely suggest Eden Gray's [[ASIN:0553277529 The Complete Guide to the Tarot]. It's enjoyable to read and well written.

Examples include unexplained symbols (symbols on charioteer's belt, the fool's clothings, and many others), desciption of the emptress being 'virgo intacta', etc.- Some of the cards' descriptions contradict, or at least appear to contradict, the pictures on the cards.- Waite borrows a lot from earlier writers, but then goes on to pass criticism on his sources and belittles them.So the book has to be read very carefuly, criticaly, and with a lot of patience. And those who do so *will* gain - the book is better than many of the instant tarot reading guides, giving truer and deeper information from the horse's mouth.I suggest people to read this book, but *not* as the first book on the deck, and preferably along with other material (e.g. books about the golden dawn, tarot history, or symbolism)."},{"Title":"Pictorial Key to the Tarot","review":"While Waites influence and authority in the esoteric world is without question, and equally without question is the massive influence he had on the art and practise of tarot, this book is not his finest work.'Pictorial Key' is tolarable as a simple catalogue of meanings (which now can be got at any number of web pages) and gives a simple spread it is deviod of any real explination of why and wherefore. It does not explain the principles underlying the construction of the tarot and the practical results that come with the understanding of those principles. I would even go as far as to say that Waite deliberatly obscured and provided misleading information, prehaps in order to keep his obligations of secrecy to the G.D. or his own Order.As a practical beginners text I would say look elsewhere for clearer texts that have expanded and illustrated what Waite has published in 'Pictorial Key'. For more advanced folk I would say the 'Pictorial Keys's best application would be to bury it in peat for several hundred years, dig it up and use it to light a fire. I gave it a rating of three purely for its historical importance. To rate it on a scale of usefulness would be to rate it several points lower."},{"Title":"Pictorial Key to the Tarot","review":"Rating this one is difficult. The rich symbolism of Tarot was forever impacted by the Order of the Golden Dawn, and A.E. Waite's &quot;Pictorial Key&quot; is a glimpse into that symbolism. Readers with a serious interest in occult Tarot will find this an essential text. Waite, though, considered himself bound by vows of secrecy, and mixes misinformation and blinds in his work to lead the &quot;uninitiated&quot; astray, so reading critically is a must. To make matters worse, his prose style is ponderous and leaden, deliberately overcomplicated and abstruse, less animated than Al Gore. However, modern tarot decks borrow and adapt from the Waite-Smith deck design; to understand the symbolism that underlies almost every deck on the market today (frequently symbolism the deck designers had no awareness of), this book is absolutely necessary. It won't be a fun read, but it *is* necessary"},{"Title":"Pictorial Key to the Tarot","review":"I got this book along with the Universal Waite deck. I was interested in the original book that A.E.Waite published along with his now-famous deck of cards.What I find interesting is that Mr. Waite states quite clearly that the Tarot never had any origins in Egypt, nor is it associated with other doctrines such as Astrology, Numerology or Kabbalah. His writing style is, at best, witty and sarcastic. He gives us the meanings of the cards (at face value) and leaves us to figure out the rest.Of course, Tarot has undergone several changes and has had several associations with all the abovementioned doctrines. The meanings have gone through a radical change; and correctly so, since all associations with the cards pictures and archetypes must change over time.All in all, it is a wonderful book for someone who is interested in the roots of Tarot - especially connected to his deck - which forms the basis for anyone who is interested in learning the Tarot.On a more personal note: I like the wit and sarcasm of Mr. Waite. Had I been alive back then, I would certainly have written to him personally about this!"},{"Title":"Pictorial Key to the Tarot","review":"There are tons of books out there on how to read Tarot, but get serious - they are all knockoffs from the master himself. Waite more than anyone, as co-author of the most frequently used deck in the last century, can take you into the mysteries surrounding the Tarot to help you better divinate the symbolism - especially if you are just developing your intuitive skills.

I have to say that if you are a beginner this book should probably not be the first of choice due to the reference-like short meanings for the cards. This is more of a condensed version.I do consult the book once and a while to confirm meanings and for different spread configurations but for the most part, it is and always has been reference only.Thanks, Vandella X"},{"Title":"Pictorial Key to the Tarot","review":"Having delved into modern tarot explanations, it was a blessing for me to come across this jewel from the creator himself. The reading was long, and long, and long, and boring. Only because I am the type of person that can run for 3 hours on a treadmill, did I find it also entertaining. The bottom line is though, who better to learn from then the creator of something.

That deck has, since 1910, become one of the most widely accepted and used decks of Tarot cards. The clarity and simplicity of this book accounts for much of that popularity.This Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by Arthur Waite of the Rider-Waite-Smith deck, was conceived to explain the complex symbolism in the pictures on that deck drawn by Pamela Coleman-Smith under Waite's direction and then published by Rider. In 1910, Waite's interest was standardizing the Tarot deck, justifying his scholarship, and explaining the symbolism for Tarot readers whom, he would assume, already broadly understood the cards' meanings. His assumption is that the (new or newly pictured) symbols rise from the meaning of the cards and his readers probably know the meanings.Today, beginners benefit from over 100 years of refinements by a large number of authors whose works follow Waite's original book. There are, therefore, MUCH better books for beginners. I teach novice readers using Sarah Bartlett's excellent Tarot Bible.If you are a serious student of the Tarot it is always helpful to return to the source and this is it. Therefore, I recommend this book for advanced readers and students as an important reference book to include in their Tarot library."},{"Title":"Pictorial Key to the Tarot","review":"A.E. Waite is a well-respected author in the study of The Mysteries. However, this book is not his best work. To be honest, I never could bring myself to do more than read sections of this book. I coul dnever read it straight-through. However, given the system of Tarot, flip-throughs are usually all you need, to discover what you need to know. There are many better books on the the subject of How to Study The Tarot, but this is a good Beginner's lesson. So many people try to make the Study of Tarot a &quot;cut &amp; dry&quot; issue (i.e., &quot;this is the way it is....&quot;)--however, in actuality, it is a life-long process of Study, Experiment, and Collection of Knowledge.

If you want a helpful introduction to FMEA, I suggest you buy The Basics of FMEA by McDermott, Mikulak, and Beauregard.The book consists of 13 chapters. The first chapter covers the legal approach to liability. Chapter 2 provides a general overview of FMEA. Chapter 3 is a glossary of terms. Chapter 4 talks about how teams use FMEA. Stamatis asserts that there are four types of FMEA: system, design, process, and service and these types are covered in the next four chapters.

Clear, concise: lots of good diagrams, very interesting satelite photos, excellent chapter summaries and really thought provoking practice questions.Starts with the basics (atmospheric dynamics) and gets into a little depth (ocean currents, no pun intended). This book is the perfect introduction to oceanography. But it's a tiny bit dated, published in 1989; not clear if it's been updated in its 1995 printing. We've learned a lot more about the oceans since then, especially Japanese research on The Pipeline: two thousand years to complete a single circuit.Our planet, while probably not unique, is a truly marvellously complex system. This book shows how the anthropic principle is operating, and the unlikelihood of finding another planet that would suit us as well, which is a strong argument in favor of terra forming.This book is the second in a set of three on physical oceanography.

Mike is asked to rescue the daughter of an important man friendly to the politicians and influential with them.

He has brought his new friends modern weaponry and military tactics so that these courageous tough fighters can hold their own with their enemies like Chechen guerrillas (see KILDAR).New Jersey Senator John Traskel asks Mike to do him a favor; Mike says no as American leaders tend to ask for favors, but vanish when the body count surfaces. Still Mike cannot refuse John's request as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee member explains that someone abducted the daughter of a big contributor, fourteen years old Natalya Fedioushina while she was visiting relatives with her mother in Moldavia, whose only export is sex slaves. The Senator only wants the teen located not extracted; Mike informs Traskel that will run about $5 million and probably be bloody without an extraction. However, tracing the young girl in the Baltics proves even more dangerous than Mike expected because of snakes back in DC manipulating the international sex slave trade.The latest Mike Harmon (make that Jenkins) thriller is filled with non-stop global action that never slows down until the final DC confrontation. The exhilarating story line is loaded with several major international subplots that nicely tie together, but can prove difficult to follow or for that matter to find a comfort spot to stop reading for the night. Mike is his usual irascible best when it comes to bullying authority figures and so kind when he relates with the powerless though in this tale he seems more apt to anger than previously in spite of his amusing retorts and asides regardless of the scenario.

These books have consistently ruined my work day and weekends, as I have found them impossible to leave. I cannot wait for the next installments and look forward eagerly to more installments of Ghost."},{"Title":"Choosers of the Slain (Paladin of Shadows, Book 3)","review":"Choosers of the Slain (2006) is the third novel in the Ghost series, following Kildar. In the previous volume, a heavily armed Chechen assault force of about 180 men was headed for Russia, but then was intercepted by a Spetznaz team and turned toward the Keldara region. Mike interrupted the militia training and took them against the Chechen \\"battalion\\". The Chechens got slaughtered and the Keldara got a live fire exercise to boost morale.In this novel, the Chechens provide the trained militia with another opportunity to practice their ambush and roadblock techniques. The survivors include two Russians who are traveling to a meet with the Chechens about \\"special weapons\\". Mike has the militia erase all signs of the ambush and awaits further events.Mike checks on progress at the brewery and learns that Garum has the building and machinery moving along nicely. Garum has also secured a booth at the convention of the International Association of Brewers and Brewery Distributors in Las Vegas. Now he needs a larger budget to transport materials to the site and to set up the booth. Mike agrees and even takes publicity photos for the brochures and other freebies.Mike is called to Washington by Senator Traskel to discuss the daughter of a constituent who had been kidnapped in Moldava. The senator provides some information and a filefolder of photographs and then strongly urges Mike to locate the girl. Mike agrees, but puts a price tag of five million on the operation.The senator identifies Yuri Smegnoff as the probable kidnapper. Mike takes four white vans of militia over back roads to Moldava. The intel section women pretend to be sex-slave girls and the men act as their guards. Once in Chisinau, Mike locates Smegnoff and the Keldara set up an intercept.This novel involves Mike and the Keldara even more heavily against the sex-slave trade. The militia spreads destruction everywhere they go, following leads onward to various sites in the Balkans. They also acquire additional girls as they go, liberating them from the gangs, pimps and other sex-slave dealers.The Albanian gang to which Smegnoff formerly belonged start looking for them. An ex-Spetznaz \\"security specialist\\" checks out the destruction and recommends heightened security measures. He also starts checking for possible hit teams.With his Washington connections, Mike manages to remove quite a few dud-heads in the various government agencies. Especially interesting was the way the CIA Station Chief in Bucharest was summarily evicted from his office. Probably just right-wing humor!This novel is not for the timid, nervous or intolerant. Blood still splatters everywhere and the sex is still explicit. It also contains some less explicit scenes about snuff-sex.Highly recommended for Ringo fans and for anyone else who enjoys action adventures about special operations.-Bill Jordin"},{"Title":"Choosers of the Slain (Paladin of Shadows, Book 3)","review":"If you haven't figured out by now that this series has a soft-porn, light-dominance thread to it and, likewise, that it's exalts a jingoistic (Ringo-istic?), male-action-figure view of the complexities of the MidEast situation and the \\"War on Terror\\" in general, then you wouldn't be reading the third in the series in the first place.What the Kildar books do have going for them is a reasonably-intriguing, well-thought-out if-I-were-King arc, as well as the more usual (for Ringo fare, at any rate) how-you-train-up-troops tropes.And a certain gritty-grimy-gutsy-romantic approach to the unsavory underworld of sex-slavery, as somewhat subtly (again, folks, for military adventure/escapist fiction!) contrasted with a jaded military guy's attitude to the \\"traditional\\" sex industry, as well as his own \\"struggle\\" to control, without entirely reppressing, his own urges toward sexual dominance.I have no particular reason to believe that Ringo's sexual underworld isn't composed of at least as much fantasy and wishful thinking as \\"his\\" vision of real-politik (which, let's admit, is not at all out-of-character for his chosen main character), but it's still an interesting new milieu to \\"explore.\\" Likewise, the fictional folk-ways and ethos of his lost tribe of liege-folk.I'm still with Ringo, here, overall, although I'd like to keep seeing each of the interesting aspects of this little exercise in world-building carried forward vigorously in part four.I don't mind a little sex for sex's sake, or a lot of action for action's sake, but the hub of this series is Mike's interaction with the little world of quasi-medieval, Third World characters for whom he has become responsible, and how those characters develop as they are brought out into the First World from which--as much as he hates to admit it--Mike hails and of which he is, in his own warped and troglodytic way, a representative.What I don't want to see is a lot of padding and backing-and-filling to paper over a plot that isn't developing any of the key components of our little world, however pleasant or perverse the bits of wish-fulfillment it's composed of."},{"Title":"Choosers of the Slain (Paladin of Shadows, Book 3)","review":"I've read that John Ringo basically wrote the books in this series over the course of a few months of frantic writing. I have not read the others, but this was a gritty description of commando style spy antics combined with almost BDSM sexual scenes.The military scenes and descriptions are solid. However, they couldn't carry the story and the overall plot just felt a bit thin. The sexual scenes felt almost forced at time and did not expand much upon the plot. I could see a male reader wishing he was the main character with his almost mystical ability to pleasure a woman and win her adoration, but in a way the scenes detracted from the characters and their impact.Perhaps I should have read books 1 and 2 first so I could get more into the story, but I was able to figure out the basic personalities of most of hte characters, even if I did not know how they became friends and allies.This is definitely a book that will only be enjoyed by a select audience. The sexual scenes will be considered offensive by some, but as always John Ringo's personal politics bleed into the politics of his writing. As a writer he has a great talent, but his works can end up seeming a bit juvenile due to his style and politics. This one fell into the juvenile category. I do not recommend this book to anyone. There are other better books out there."},{"Title":"Choosers of the Slain (Paladin of Shadows, Book 3)","review":"Choosers Of The Slain is an improvement over Ringo's previous effort in this series, Kildar. He has finished the long set-up needed to establish the characters base and all the additional cast thrown into the previous novel, and can get down to some nitty-gritty action.As he has shown, Ringo has a knack for military fiction. The urban battle scenes are great, and he even manages to pull of the more \\"stealthy\\" covert sections of the book, keeping the reader interested.The series is still burdened by the Authors incredibly overuse of sex, specifically aggressive fairly deviant sex. This series has such potential that it will never live up to unless the Author steps back from whatever daemons he is working through."},{"Title":"Choosers of the Slain (Paladin of Shadows, Book 3)","review":"I bought an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher. I actually liked this one better than the first one (Ghost) which had a few hackneyed cliches. (co-eds interested in BDSM? Gasp! How shocking! NOT!) This one focused on moving the private, sheltered militia group out and about in the 'modern' world, which was fun. Plus, it addressed human trafficking, which is a good issue (and one in which Might Makes Right ... Just Makes Sense) ;) Remember, This Is Not Science Fiction, exactly. Just a teensy bit of alternative history (in the same vein as the Belisarius series, but not the same time period) along with some men's Action Adventure and perhaps the funniest part, sex scenes written by a man. (Or, at least, from the male's perspective.) All in all, a good read if you're looking for something different from average sci-fi, and you like to vicariously kick butt."},{"Title":"Choosers of the Slain (Paladin of Shadows, Book 3)","review":"Great Book, I really enjoyed it.

He is a military action/adventure writer. The Choosers of the Slain is one of the books in his series about Ghost, who is ex military, going to college (UGA) on the GI Bill and comes face to face with a jihad plot. The entire series (five books) is action packed, and great reading. I thoroughly enjoy his writing and recommend him to everyone. In fact, I'm reading another of his books (a different series) now."},{"Title":"Choosers of the Slain (Paladin of Shadows, Book 3)","review":"Yup, as an earlier reviewer pointed out this book is brain candy. IMHO, awesomely good brain candy - but then, I like most of Ringo's books.It's one wild mixture covering a good collection of male fantasies - violence, sex, guns, women, good looking girls, a harem, the sex trade, more violence, money, you name it, it's all here. And it's tightly written, the pace moves along, there's plenty of action. Personally, I like every book in the series, this among them. It's one of those books - you love it or you hate it.....My recommendation - if you're a guy that likes sex and guns and talking with your buddies about \\"when I was in the Army\\" and going to bars to drink seriously (i.e., anything but wine....), you'll enjoy it.

Evidence of his progress is plain in this successor to KILDAR (2006), where his writing has demonstrated greater discipline and a conscious decision to keep to the action/adventure story line and resist the temptation to sickeningly overspice his manuscript with pornographic distractions.At the same time, the political elements in Ringo's \\"Mike Harmon\\" plenum have begun to show a greater level of contextual development, including insight into both international and domestic American relations that will eminently satisfy anyone who counts him/herself a regular Baen Books reader (and utterly enrage any shrunken-headed \\"Liberal\\" weasel who mistakenly stumbles into this Amazon.com Web page).For that alone, CHOOSERS OF THE SLAIN is well worth its price.The follow-on to this fast-moving and thoroughly entertaining novel is already in the final stages of development, and can be expected in late November 2006."},{"Title":"Choosers of the Slain (Paladin of Shadows, Book 3)","review":"This book is the sequel to \\"Kildar\\", and features a central character first introduced in \\"Ghost\\". I do not recommend reading it without at least first reading \\"Kildar\\".The series is a contempory military/sexual fantasy. A retired US SEAL who has become a feudal lord in the mountains of Georgia (the country) has trained his retainers as a military special ops force. They get hired to track down a particular girl through the sex-slave industry of Eastern Europe. Along the way they discover some explosive secrets and end up facing Albanian thugs, Russian ex-commandos, and rogue US Senators.There are many graphic scenes of prostitution, rape, torture, and bondage, as well as bloody street battles and assaults on fortified buildings. It is even more graphic than anything in the previous books. And unfortunately, the writing and the plotting are not as good as in the previous books.\\"Ghost\\" was a series of novellas and did not really have to pull off any complicated plotting. \\"Kildar\\" was well-focused on a specific task -- Mike Harmon/Jenkins taking the Kildera farmers and turning them into the \\"Mountain Tigers\\" special ops force. But \\"Choosers Of The Slain\\" attempts to integrate an overly-complicated political thriller plot with an overly-complicated special ops plot and manages to do neither especially well. Instead we end up with something that might be described as Tom Clancey with morally ambiguous kinky sex.Mike is still the most interesting aspect of the novel. He is a wolf who wants to be a sheepdog -- a guy who hates the sex slavers but keeps a hareem of prostitutes, a guy who likes to beat on women but also wants to protect their honor. He sees the conflict and is bothered by it, but tells himself that if he wasn't doing it someone else would be.But everyone else in the novel gives him far too much of a free pass, the Keldera are too perfectly good and competent, the opponents are too unambiguously evil and incompetent, and his support at the highest levels of the US executive branch is too noble and unstinting. In other words, it reads like a fantasy in which the entire universe exists to be a support mechanism for Mike.\\"Ghost\\" was audacious, \\"Kildar\\" was well-crafted, but \\"Choosers Of The Slain\\" descends into self-indulgence. If the next book is like this one, I'm unlikely to continue to be interested in the series."},{"Title":"Choosers of the Slain (Paladin of Shadows, Book 3)","review":"OK Ghost was great, Kildar was good, but this book is getting stupid.

Loved the plots and story lines. Finally through them all out (Yep, tossed one paperback and two hardcopy) as I realized as I was re-reading them, that the somewhat graphic sex (Dominance and Submission, and Harem Girls, etc) didn't really add to the story but sure promoted things I just don't like. The March Upcountry series with David Weber had boys and girls, and talked about sex, but was what I consider more normal for SciFi, and was not graphic, did not promote \\"alternative\\" sex. So while I enjoy the James Bond nature of the novels, I really can't recommend them to any of my friends, and wouldn't recommend them to anyone younger."},{"Title":"Choosers of the Slain (Paladin of Shadows, Book 3)","review":"And i got to say, that the tradition and style of John Ringo's writing kept me up all night reading the book on my computer.Choosers of the Slain is a continuing book about Mike Jenkins and his \\"life\\" and his effects on people who enter it as well as those that affect him. In Ghost, After retiring from the service Mike starts to use his college benefits and performs a daring rescue of American women held hostage, he gets his reward on the death of several \\"bad\\" people and lives a life of luxury and travels the world where he ends up in Georgia. \\"Kildar\\" begins with him purchasing a valley filled with farms and tenants.

I enjoy the books and feel that John Ringo doeas a great amount of research during the writing process."},{"Title":"Choosers of the Slain (Paladin of Shadows, Book 3)","review":"Such is the basic worldview of Mike Harmon, former SEAL and accidental medieval warlord. A lot of us in the uglier parts of the US military are there to channel our demons into something for the betterment of society. When your sole talent and love is plotting the deaths of your fellow men in as messy and artistic a way as possible, yet you're socialized enough as a human being to know it's \\"wrong\\", you might as well go where you're hunting for the betterment of mankind. I read this one right on the heels of Ringo's We Few, and saw elements of the conflicted Prince Roger in Mike. I know what it's like to want to kill someone so bad I could taste it, yet knowing it's just not cool to do so. Finding an outlet for those energies now that my active infantry days are drawing to a close would be nice. Too bad there's no valley of the Kildara out there for the rest of us old soldiers.While it's a novel that deals with the ugly truth of the international sex trade, it's true that Mike has his own kinks and falls into situations where he gets to exercise them. My wife, a conniseur of such fiction, rates one scene in particular rather highly.The trigger pulling portions aren't bad, but often soft on some of the details. SPR's aren't really explained for what they are, and I think there's too much use of the H&K; MP-5, then again I'm not an admirer of any 9mm SMG for beyond room use.The disclaimer in the front of the book, often overlooked, actually contains one of the funniest lines in the book."},{"Title":"Choosers of the Slain (Paladin of Shadows, Book 3)","review":"This was an even better read than Kildar.

The core store is sound and like the second book, it is a single story rather then three short stories the way the first book was. As with the other two books in the series, there are some fairly graphic sex scenes - a bit too much for my personal tastes as it happens - and lots of guns, violence, and women. Overall I enjoyed the book a great deal, but I do have to say that it wasn't as good as either the first or second book of the series."},{"Title":"Choosers of the Slain (Paladin of Shadows, Book 3)","review":"Yes, this book is brain candy. Potato chips for the mind. So what? Not every book has to be freakin' \\"War and Peace\\". Mr. Ringo gives us the ultimate adolescent fantasy -- a super-warrior with a harem, his own band of warriors, all the weapons & gadgets he wants, Presidential support, his own brewery, and millions of dollars. (Having read what I just wrote, I feel a strong urge to shout, \\"Dude! Chicks and money and guns! And beer!Awesome!\\" I'll try to restrain myself. Heh.)While the sex scenes are a bit overdone, the novel itself is quite enjoyable. I read it while stuck in an 8-hour plane ride; and I must say it was very entertaining. If you want a fast-paced, action-filled story that'll keep your interest, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Choosers of the Slain (Paladin of Shadows, Book 3)","review":"Ringo's Chooser of the Slain is another satisfying installment in the Ghost series. He continues to add to the history and culture of the Keldar and to add more events and action for the reader to explore.The Keldar have been successful thus far as they are returned to their Warrior Heritage and Mike Jenkins, former SEAL, is growing in his role as Kildar. The pace of the story seems to follow a familiar pattern of status update, new threat, preparation for the new threat, initiation of movement, steps to conflict, conflict and subsequent danger... I feel like I am quoting the troop leading procedures.My problem is that I feel like Jenkins is turning into James Bond who always gets the girl and comes out ahead in the end despite the losses and injuries he sustains. There are problems, true, friends get killed, true, but in the end it just seems like we know that he will be a hero and win. I guess that I want to see him break some new ground where his money and former SEAL skills don't automatically provide for a solution. That might make the story irrelavent....It's a fun series and this book is a great installment as he rallies his troops to follow a girl into the bowels of the sex slave markets of the Balkans and finds that the reasons he has been sent are as slimy as the people who traffic in young women.

This is a captivating spy novel that features many characters but focuses on Felix Maldonado who is a low level Mexican bureaucrat. Maldonado is portrayed as a sort of everyman who suddenly finds himself thrust into bigger than life circumstances. On a day when the president of Mexico is making an appearance Maldonado, who was looking forward to the day suddenly finds himself being involved unvoluntarily into an assassination plot. He is declared dead and given a new identity, a sly bit of writting to create another faceless citizen of Mexico. From here the novel takes off into twists and turns to unravel the mystery and Maldonados and others role in the assassination attempt. The introduction of a diverse cast of characters with intriguing backgrounds adds to the mystery. The secret agents,the seductive women, the Mexican politicians and Maldonado's love for three different Jewish women all intertwine to create a story of infidelities and political Arab-Mexican intrigue. Fuentes is his usual self, posturing political convictions via his characters to create a a rich story that has multiple meanings beyond the spy story. The masquerade and unveiling of characters is brilliant. This is another in a long line of superb novels by Carlos Fuentes. The information written over twenty five years ago is as relevenat as the headlines coming out of the Middle East today. The tension of the Middle East and the seemingly hopeless better future clash in this novel like the current political situation. Catch this novel for a good spy mystery ride through the Third World."},{"Title":"The Hydra Head","review":"Hydra Head is a mystery story, an immersion into a corrupt political world, and an exploration of different kinds of attraction between man and woman. Surprisingly, Fuentes in the latter part of the book ties up all the loose ends of the complex mstery. However, neither the characters, nor their motivation as it relates to the Mexican oil reserves, are realistic. The characters probably are not meant to be entirely realistic, Fuentes is more interested in their impact on the reader, and I was OK with most of them, Felix's spymaster/friend being an exception. Still, I wish the strategic interest in the exact amount and location of the oil reserves made more sense; e.g. reserves do not help alleviate shorter term oil shortages, unless they are in a place like Saudi Arabia where production can be ramped up quickly. The motives for the attack on the President made less sense to me than would a simple desire for more power. Despite that, \\"Hydra Head\\" is an interesting, powerful novel."},{"Title":"Teaching English: Italy (Teaching English in...)","review":"This book is 14 years old, but low-cost used copies are still available so it's tempting. I like to be fair and describe a book's assets (if any) as well as shortcomings (if any), but in this case there are very few of the former and an abundance of the latter. The author only had five years experience teaching privately and in language schools when the book was published, so there is no information about the current, widespread use of foreign \\"conversation\\" teachers in state schools, and very little about how to find work as a university instructor. More disappointingly, this book bows to the teacher-training business by repeating the myth that short certificate courses are precious if not indispensable in finding work in Italy.Among the inaccurate claims made is that finding work without a certificate is no longer (in 1994), easy because most schools have \\"wised up\\" to the virtue of short certificates. The author admits that it's possible to find work without a certificate, but such teachers \\"will probably be barred access to the established, reputable schools and better-paid company jobs.\\" (p. 3) The book's real message soon becomes evident as he describes the teacher-training courses sold by International House (the book's sponsor). Four-week courses cost about US$1,000 (1994 dollars), and provide teachers with \\"a good grounding...in English teaching.\\" A gross inaccuracy is the claim: \\"In Italy all employers will know what it [his favorite certificate] is...\\" That wasn't true in 1994, and it still isn't true today. In reality, there are many certificates sold by different companies, but the author warns readers against competitors.It's possible that in the very limited experience of the author's workplaces in 1989-1994, what he said may have been true. But Italy is a big and heterogeneous country and such generalizations are way off the mark. Short certificate courses (take your pick) are largely unknown and unappreciated by Italian students, teachers and administrators who do the hiring. The web is now flooded with salespeople selling certificate courses at various prices, so you shouldn't hope to impress anybody because you spent a lot of money on a short course! In all, this book contains about 16 pages of outdated information about finding employment, while the rest of the book consists of offhand advice on such things as travel, sports and other topics not related to finding a job.I don't mean to criticise the author as a person. He was, evidently, a humble teacher just trying to make some extra money by writing a book, and his claims were probably the consequence of careless reasoning rather than any attempt to deceive. However, International House has been in the teaching business for a long time so they should have known better than to allow their name to be associated with a book like this.

In the play Dr. Stockmann discovers that the new baths built in his town are infected with a deadly disease that requires they should be closed until they can be repaired. However, the mayor of the town (the Burgomaster), who is Stockmann's brother Peter, rejects the report and refuses to close the baths because it will bring about the financial ruin of the town. When Dr. Stockmann tries to make his case to the people of the town, the mayor counters by pointing out how expensive it would be to repair the baths and dismisses the doctor for having wild, fanciful ideas. At the public meeting Dr. Stockmann is declared \\"an enemy of the people\\" by the Burgomaster.To really appreciate this particular Ibsen play you have to look at it in the context of his previous dramas, because they all represent a conflict between the playwright and his critics. In 1879 Ibsen's play \\"A Doll's House\\" (\\"Et dukkehjem\\") was produced, wherein the character of Nora pretends to be a silly little wife in order to flatter her husband, who is revealed to be a hypocritical fraud. The idea that a woman would leave her husband and children was seen as being outrageous and basically obscene. Ibsen upset his audience and critics even more in his next play, \\"Ghosts\\" (\\"Gengangere\\"), an 1881 drama that again attacks conventional morality and hypocrisy. The topic is of congenital venereal disease but the true subject is moral contamination. Mrs. Alving has buried her husband, a degenerate who has left behind a son dying from syphilis and an illegitimate daughter who is probably going to end up being a prostitute. The play ends with Mrs. Alving having to decide if she should poison her son to put him out of his misery or let his agonies persist.Again, Ibsen was attacked for outraging conventional morality. The following year after \\"Ghosts\\" the playwright responded with \\"An Enemy of the People\\" and the character that is most identified with representing Ibsen on stage in Dr. Stockmann. The allegory is quite plain when the play is considered within the context of Ibsen's work during this period, although while Stockmann is portrayed as a victim there is a sense of destructiveness to his behavior. At the end of the play Stockman has decided to leave the town, but then changes his mind to stay and fight for those things he believes are right.As is the case with most of Ibsen's classic works, \\"An Enemy of the People\\" speaks to larger issues than those in conflict in the play. The debate is over the bad water pipes at the new baths, but the true conflict is over the clash of private and public morality. Dr. Stockmann is by far the most idealistic of Ibsen's characters, and that fact that he is opposed by his own brother, the Burgomaster, harkens back to Genesis and the fight between Cain and Able. As was the case with \\"Ghosts,\\" there is an ambiguous ending where what happens next can be seen as going either way given your own inclinations as a member of the audience.Both of the Stockman brothers are flawed. Dr. Stockman's idealism is at odds with the practical realities of the world in which he lives while the Burgomaster ignores ethical concerns. Ultimately, Ibsen is not forcing us to choose between the two but rather to reject both in terms of some middle ground. The Burgomaster is certainly old school, believing those in authority get to make all the decisions and that the people must subordinate themselves to the society. But he was the one who made the mistake of putting the new water pipes in the wrong place, so even his claims that he is looking out for the welfare of the community are dishonest. Dr. Stockman argues for individual freedom and the right of free expression, but his attempt to fix the problem ignores any effort at persuasion or building public support. He also seems to take pleasure in be able to show that his brother made a mistake. Still, in the end we have to favor the doctor over the mayor because his integrity is clearly stronger, while still recognizing that his idealism is tragically flawed."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People","review":"This powerful play is my first experience reading Henrik Ibsen and WOW! The conflict is timeless and the leading character Dr. Stockmann reminded me of Sir Thomas More.After I read the play I did not want to put the book down and wanted more. I flipped to the front of my edition translated by Christpher Hampton and read his nihilistic introduction. Mr. Hampton missed the whole point and somehow thought Dr. Stockman really WAS the &quot;enemy of the people&quot;. Hampton sounded like one of the townspeople from the mob in Act Four when he wrote:&quot;This is to simplify Ibsen's intent; because however sympathetic Ibsen feels towards Dr Stockmann's cause, he is too subtle and profound a dramatist not to know that there are few figures more infuriating than the man who is always right. Stockmann's sincerity, naivety and courage co-exist with an innocent vanity, an inability to compromise and an indifference to the havoc caused in the lives of his family and friends, as well as his own, by his dogged pursuit of principle.&quot;Hampton's edition is a nice size with print that is easy to read. I loved the story and the characters and I highly recommend it to all. I have lived the experience and have been &quot;the enemy&quot; so I understood Dr. Stockmann but I learned from Christopher Hampton and my own experience not everyone will &quot;get it.&quot;"},{"Title":"Enemy of the People","review":"Well written, and realistic. Thomas is a well-meaning but rather tactless environmentalist. His brother Peter is more concerned about Thomas making a fool out of himself than trying to fix the situation. Just like in real life, there are no easy solutions but there are plenty of alibis and irrational negotiations from politicians (&quot;If you'll just take back what you said...&quot;). The only friend Thomas really has is the reader."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People","review":"The action centres around a feud between two brothers -- Dr. Stockmann and his brother, the mayor of a small town in the northern part of Norway. The issue is the contamination of the local baths by bacilli supposed to cause typhoid fever. The Mayor -- (who is an impossible dolt, whose like can hardly be conceived to be a mayor in any European town) -- argues for piecemeal improvements in the bathing facility. Stockmann, whose name is roughly translated into &quot;The Chastiser&quot;, urges the drastic closure of the premisses. The disagreement escalates into a violent altercation, in which the angry townspeople, in support of their mayor, unite and denounce the self-willed Stockmann as &quot;an enemy of the people&quot;. Stockmann is presented by Ibsen as a fiery, stubborn, brutally honest egoist who would &quot;rather ruin his community than see it thrive on lies and fraud&quot; -- an embattled individual who sees himself as a champion of truth in opposition to the stupidity of the herd of cattle. The last act is a highly tense illustration of the follies and indignities to which anyone can be subject for daring to oppose the social norm. Ibsen has Stockmann eventually succeed in discovering that &quot;the strongest man is mightiest alone&quot;, though this is a naively Romantic notion, the consolation of the defeated in the light of the colossal ignorance of one's fellow beings. Overall, an interesting dramatisation of an individual's case against public opinion."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People","review":"I saw the play in London at Royal National Theatre and bought the script. (By the way, the same RNT production, directed by Trevor Nunn with sets by John Napier -- the same director/design team for Les Miserables -- with Ian McKellen in the lead role is coming to the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, July 14 to Sept 6, 1998. Hampton has created a new version not a literal translation of the late 19th-century classic play -- as Arthur Miller did some years ago. And it works perfectly as a great theatre piece should. The language feels modern and natural which makes the subject matter all the more vital -- particularly as our culture deals with the same environmental issues; and in many ways the same types of reactions from people in authority, including the engineering of mass hysteria and fear. The critic for London's News of the World said of the RNT production, &quot;a tale of corruption, greed and the responsibility of the press...as up to date as this morning's headlines.&quot; I agree. See the play, get the script."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People","review":"Henrik Ibsen wrote this play immediately after his play Ghosts was greeted by mass outcries (see my review of Ghosts). Rather than defend himself against charges of immorality, he pointed out that the multitude are wrong.Dr. Stockmann, a stand-in for Ibsen's views, wants to do the right thing, the moral thing, to tell the truth to the people of his town, a truth that they do not want to hear. He is the medical advisor of the town's health baths, baths that brings wealth to the community. He discovers that the bath water is contaminated because the town officials, against his advice, set the pipes in a wrong place, and the water flowing through the area is causing bathers to become sick. The cost of repairing the pipes is enormous and it would take two years to fix them. The doctor is stopped from revealing the problem to his community by the Mayor, his older brother, who was interested in his health, but not in the health of others, who insisted that the doctor be silent because the community wants the money that the baths will bring, doesn't want to pay the large repair costs, and leaving the baths unused for two years would result in a large financial loss to the community.Ibsen dramatizes the situation by making Dr. Stockmann somewhat flawed. The doctor naively persues his quest without using persuasive techniques to win over the town.The town newspaper and the home owners are behind the doctor until the Mayor explains the enormous loss to them. Then, as with Ibsen who described moral problems in Ghosts, the entire town turns against Dr. Stockmann and vilifies him, calling him a lunatic and an enemy of the people. He tries to explain that he is telling the truth, but the town people refuse to see it. The town argues that they are the majority and they determine what is right. This is reminiscent of the Christian philosopher Thomas Aquinas, who is not mentioned in the play, who insisted on holding the community and the church above the individual.Stockmann responds that in matters of right and wrong, the individual is superior to the will of the many. In a memorable line, he says, \\"A minority may be right; a majority is always wrong.\\""},{"Title":"Enemy of the People","review":"One of Ibsen's main themes throughout his works is the conflict between the realist and the idealist. Once again in this play Ibsen sets his conflict up beautifully. His main character Dr. Stockmann is realistically created, and opposed ironically by his brother the mayor. The fun truly begins when we get to watch the two brothers fight-one on the side of the public good, the other on the side of personal morality. Throughout the entire book, you question what makes each character tick, and the reading was really an enjoyable experience."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People","review":"Still being many years since this book was written by Henrik Ibsen, the subject covered is very relevant. I loved reading it again after a couple of decades since previous time."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People","review":"We are planning to see a performance of this play in a few weeks and since we had read it many years ago, we needed to reacquaint ourselves with the content. Amazon delivered it to my mailbox in two days. Ibsen's play is a profound and intricate study of characters, relationships, the environment and the economy."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People","review":"It is very ambitious to make a review of a book from Ibsen or other authors. Never mind, for those folks who are not familiar with this story, it is a must to read it. It happened in the past in a Nordic country, but the story could happen (and it happened already) in any place.However, regardless of the story and other details, the key concept is about the ideas of: courage, trueness, friendship, family, conflict of interests, ethics and many other fundamental life's concepts. It is a short book, therefore many people can read it, without considering it as a \\"waste of time\\". I saw the movie couple of year ago, but reading the book will help you to stop and think about the situations.In a nutshell, it is highly recommded to read this classic book."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People","review":"Ibsen is often revered as the father of modern drama, and his influence has been compared to that of Shakespeare's influence in 16th century England. This particular play is a treatise on Ibsen's ideology. In it Ibsen is putting forth his very liberal ideas and he does not spare anyone. Both liberals and conservatives are blasted in this play that points out clearly that any individual does not stand a chance if he tries to go public with his ideas, especially if those ideas go against the majority opinion. Yes, it is a militant play, but it is also a comedy that shows real pathos and warm humour."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People","review":"Henrik Ibsen wrote An Enemy of the People in fury, after how the critics treated his previous play Ghosts. He had expected the so called Liberal press to receive Ghosts with a some what greater understanding. Instead he found himself &quot;fighting at the outposts of thought&quot;, while the Liberal press were slaves of their subscribers' opinions and following them instead of leading them. An Enemy of the People were written with satirical intention, but became one of his most brilliantly crafted social dramas. I have read it several times and admire every page of it. Ibsen was ahead of his time then, and in many respects still ahead of our time. A solid five stars!"},{"Title":"Enemy of the People","review":"Ibsen's play, An Enemy of the People is a classic example of the decision that must be made between telling the truth and doing what is right. Dr. Stockmann faces an extreme moral delema. It really made you wonder; what would I do in this situation? Would you be able to trade everything (your position, money, house, and reputation) just to be able to tell the truth? Even though by not letting it out you could become very popluar. This situation is applicable to many situations in real life ranging from events happening at a high school to things in the government. Even though it was written 150 years ago, Ibsen's characters' problems are still reflected all over the world, making this play a must read for everyone."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People","review":"Dr. Stockman is portrayed as the protagonist who champions himself as the herioc individual who makes a bleak discovery about the community. He thunders to announce the new discovery against the wishes of his opposition Mayor Peter Stockman. Dr. Stockman is characterized as the man of nobility at the beginning of the play and as the plot begins to unfold the townspeople denounce him as an enemy of the people. Mrs. Stockman's character is portrayed as submissive. Will she patiently await the distruction of her entire family? Will Dr. Stockman sacrifice his personal beliefs for the welfare of his family?"},{"Title":"Enemy of the People","review":"This book is definitely not the most exciting book in the world. Enemy of the People has a specific point, a message it is trying to reveal. Dr. Stockmann loses the support of his entire town after finding out that the local baths are contaminated. Just to make things worse, his brother, Peter, is mayor and actually manipulates the situation to turn the press against him. This play shows how the majority is often wrong and, more importantly, that the strongest man is the one who can stand alone. What made this book lose a star is that, in fact, the first act takes a lot to finish because it appears to be so boring. I may have put this book away if I didn't have to read it. However the book quickly improves and, although it is never exciting, it is interesting."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People","review":"&quot;An Enemy of the People,&quot; by Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, has been published as part of the Dover Thrift Edition series (that's the version I read for purposes of this review). The Dover edition is a republication of an anonymous translation. The back cover data notes that the play was first staged in 1883.&quot;Enemy&quot; tells the story of Dr. Thomas Stockmann, a medical officer for his town's public baths. When he discovers that the baths are contaminated and pose a health hazard, he is led into conflict with his brother Peter, who is the town's mayor. The tension increases as the drama moves towards its conclusion.&quot;Enemy&quot; is an intriguing piece of literature. While reading it I was struck by how similar the story is to that of the classic film &quot;Jaws&quot;: in both stories, a political leader is at odds with an idealistic public servant who is concerned about a danger involving public waters!The play contains much thought-provoking dialogue. Ibsen looks at the interrelationships among politicians, the press, science, and the general public. His characters question issues of truth, authority, and majority rule. Dr. Stockmann begins as a noble character, but I thought he becomes too over-the-top and in some scenes is reduced to a shrill, dogmatic cartoon (especially when he delivers a bizarre rant about poodles and hens). I honestly wasn't sure what Ibsen was trying to accomplish in some of the doctor's more outrageous dialogue.Still, &quot;Enemy&quot; remains a compelling piece of art. For an intriguing companion text, try &quot;Inherit the Wind,&quot; by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, which has some similar themes and motifs."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People","review":"Have you ever watched a movie or play, and at the end of it you say, &quot;I don't get it&quot;? ---&gt; But everyone around you says it was the greatest thing they have ever seen... well, I will not pretend to be a pseudo-intellectual. Ibsen was way over my head with this book.Superficially the book was extremely interesting from the standpoint of: will one man be willing to stand up to a city when he knows what is right? In our story, the protagonist has discovered that the Norwegian baths are filled with a poisonous organism. However, when he voices this, the entire town goes against him because it will cost them economically, and they put the pressure on him to refute that which he knows is correct. From that standpoint - the book is excellent... and we are held to find the outcome.Where it lost me personally was when Ibsen went on his political diatribe. He further alienated me via his pages of discussion on liberalism in a manner that seemed conservative to me. Nevertheless, I enjoyed these speeches as well, and they admittedly felt more contemporary Republican than Liberal Democrat.In the end, I would have to recommend this book, but say \\"Feel free to not understand.\\" It is okay to embrace that not everything is clear, and at times his points are lost on minds as dull as mine.

Of all the incredibly beautiful images that could characterize northern Mexico, International Travel Maps bafflingly chose an out of focus, poorly composed and conceived photo that could have been taken almost anywhere. This is a photo that prominently features a propane tank, a bag of fruit and a baseball cap.Unfortunately, the information that this map provides is also lacking much of the detail most travelers will want on a basic trip to the region. For Baja California, which I know very well, many of the place names are out of date and many of the most important geographic features are inaccurately placed or even non-existent. I give it a star for the fact that it is the best thing going for the mainland traveler without spending a lot of money. There are many excellent maps for Baja California, such as The Baja Almanac and even the AAA Baja map and guide.

All this is nice to know, but it has nothing to do with how to practically get underway in the liquidation business. The only practical &quot;red meat&quot; advice I could find is to make sure one has business cards, a good business name, how to have fun with a warehouse, types of telephones that are nifty to have, how much money to pay for equipment in your office (not office equipment in general . . . like you were actually making a liquidation buy offer), and the importance of computerizing your liquidation business on a PC.For those expecting tricks of the trade and a Rolodex of helpful buyers, brokers, distributors, etc., you will be disappointed. The Appendix is very slim on this kind of information. The bottom line secrets of success Mr. Kulesza stresses in his book are intuitively obvious: ( 1) Buy goods cheap and sell them for slightly more money than you paid (2) Look for bargains to buy cheap. If you can't buy cheap, don't buy. (3) If you buy goods cheap, then work hard to find buyers before getting stuck eating tired, cheap, liquidated merchandise. The best advise the author gives is to find auction sales to buy. But only auctions which are not well advertised and that are poorly attended. So how do you hear about them if they're not advertised? The author offers no help here.This book is filled with glittering generalities and, I think, substantially fails to meet reasonable expectations of assembling &quot;all the information one will need to succeed in the liquidation business.&quot; If this book is the culmination of the author's lifelong experience as a liquidator, then its clear that the real 'hidden wealth' in the liquidation business lies in writing a book about it.

And that may be one of the biggest flaw of Death du Jour in which not too many characters really draw our attention or sympathy. Another particularity of this novel lies with the fact that the author sometimes yield to the pedagogical temptation. For instance, we are given explanation on how monkeys live or on how sects' are organized. Professor Reichs is not always far behind the author and it gives some pages that unfortunately break the rhythm of the plot.

I found both \\"Death DuJour\\" and its predecessor, \\"Deja Dead,\\" quite good. I like the second one a little better, as I feel Reichs has found her \\"voice\\" in Tempe's character.This book is a real whirlwind of complex plotlines, and there are times when Tempe is in Carolina that you wonder how in the world will these storylines converge? I think Ms. Reichs does a fine job in showing the relationship to all the different things going on. The mystery behind Sister Elizabeth is given a big clue in one of Tempe's dreams and although it certainly isn't the focal point of the book, it's inclusion demonstrates the vast amount of research Ms. Reichs' imbues in her works.Tempe's relationship with Andrew Ryan is an interesting one, kind of like two alley cats in heat, but I hope their \\"courtship\\" evolves; I think he's good for her.I agree with a previous reader that the addition of Harry, Tempe's wacko sister, is unnecessary; she reminds me of Marla in the Goldie (Diane Mott Davidson) series. Superflous, and not really essential. I think Harry's inclusion was to give Tempe a more personal interest in the cult aspect.I was totally surprised by whom the culprit was in this one, and even though in some ways, it's a little bit of a let down (there's one other person I feel had more motive), but hey, she's the writer.All in all, a book well written with some incredibly suspenseful scenes, a great knowledge of not only forensics, but cults, and religious propaganda.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.Can't wait to make some \\"Deadly Decisions.\\""},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Death du Jour was a decent follow-up to Deja Dead.

It made me long for a good old romantic historical novel - where have they gone?"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"In a church graveyard, Montreal forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance Brennan diligently digs up the remains of a nun who died in 1888. The church plans to bestow sainthood on Sister Elisabeth Nicolet. However, the marked site fails to contain the sister''s bones as for some mysterious reason they were moved to another locale. When she finds the remains, Tempe begins to feel that the good nun succumbed to foul play.At the same time, modern deaths due to arson and a teaching assistant disappearance have Tempe overworked. Still, the Tarheel native plows ahead to solve the century old mystery of Sister Elisabeth while helping with the current case load even as it draws her back to Beaufort, North Carolina.DEATH DU JOUR, the second Tempe tale, is as terrific as the award winning debut novel (see DEJA DEAD). Tempe remains a serene, warm (in spite of her always being cold) character and the support cast adds Canadian and Carolinian depths to the crisp story line. The subplots cleverly merge together, but it is Kathy Reich's' ability to describe in depth forensic tools and results (autopsies, etc.) without goring the reader with plot drifting that makes this work a winner. Instead, these graphic passages augment the entertaining tale with a ring of authenticity. Sub-genre fans will demand more Tempe tales.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"\\"Death Dujour\\" is the second novel in the Temperance \\"Tempe\\" Brennan series by Kathy Reichs. In this installment, Tempe's case stretches from Montreal to the Carolinas as young teaching assistant disappears, an arson fire attempts to hide the murder of 7 people and a long dead Catholic nun is about to receive sainthood.\\"Death Dujour\\" was an excellent read! The synopsis may sound a bit convoluted, but it's really not. This novel didn't grab me the way \\"Deja Dead\\" did when I first picked up the novel. I had to allow \\"Death Dujour\\" to progress a bit before the story became engrossing. Lots of surprises and twists in this novel. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"The author never addressed what went on (if anything) between Ryan and the sister. I have mixed feelings about Ryan and would have appreciated some clarification.Tempe.....she thinks she omnipotent; she barges in to situations with no regard for her safety or the other people she drags in with her.There is too much unwanted detail(clothes, food, geography etc.)and detracted from the story. I found the ending very boring.I do like Kathy Reichs. I've read a good number of the books in this series and really like some and others (like this one) not at all??"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"\\"Death Du Jour,\\" the second book in Kathy Reichs' Temperance Brennan forensic mystery series is set, as are most of her others, in Montreal and North Carolina. In this regard, fictional character follows creator, as both are also employed in both places. This book finds Brennan (and Reichs) expecting Montreal's winter to be slow in their trade, as everything's frozen over and under: but this will be the winter that proves unusual.The book opens with Tempe digging up a frozen old church near Quebec, looking for the bones of an obscure nun to whom the Church is considering granting sainthood. The bones are not where they should be. Regular readers may have noticed, it's always something with Tempe's digs. Either there are bones where they shouldn't be, or none where they should be. Or bones that are too new in an old burial site, or bones that are too old in a new burial or disaster site. At any rate, Tempe does find the bones, and, in a feat of forensics that I found fascinating, succeeds in establishing the identity of the nun's bones, and explaining the considerable mystery that still clings to them.There's also a subplot involving an arson, and another involving the sudden disappearance of a student from Montreal's well-known Mc Gill University. The latter somehow brings Tempe to the warm, welcoming beaches of North Carolina's Outer Banks, and even to a hotel at which I stayed several times. Fantastique!! But here I get unhappy. In this book's denouement, Reichs, like another female forensic author, whom I will not name, simply points to the mysterious cult and says: they did it. Authors, please understand: such an ending may reflect real life. But readers of mysteries do not invest the time and the money to buy and read books in order to be told: they did it. For our investment, we expect an actual murderer to be named."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I love this whole series, but this was the most difficult to read. Though the story of the nun's remains was interesting, it too got bogged down in what appeared to be a grab for suspense - that is, leaving details just beyond the reader's reach.It's certainly a very readable novel and as usual, the combination of facts about forensic recovery, and the on-again, off-again romantic life of Tempe, certainly hit the right balance. If you're a fan of the series, pick it up - but if you're new to these books, start with a different one, like Fatal Voyage (one of my personal favorites)."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Forensic anthropologist Tempe Brennan is back in Kathy Reichs's second novel. While working on a special project in Montreal, Dr. Brennan is asked for her help at an arson investigation to try to identify the remains of the deceased. Tempe will see a gruesome scene that is only going to get worse. She will be facing an apocalyptic cult that might have a hold on her sister, Harry.There is not much to say for this novel. The author relies heavily on coincidences as well as plot conveniences to tell the story. Every single body that this doctor investigates in the book will be related to the Montreal arson investigation. The author makes sure that Tempe meets all the principals in the case so that she can solve the crime. If one wanted something this simplified, they would just watch MURDER, SHE WROTE. This book was disappointing after a strong start with DEJA DEAD."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I love the writing. I love the books. I just sometimes find it a bit strange that the mysteries from Qu&eacute;bec *always* link back to North or South Carolina. But I have to say I'm glad, as Pat Conroy was the only person writing mainstream fiction set in that neck of the woods.The sense of place in these stories is remarkable, with just the right evocative details. The characters are finely-drawn and the plotting is rock-solid. The tension is just perfect. I recently buzzed right through my first two Reichs books with a great deal of pleasure. A very good read indeed.As a side note, I was a bit startled to find *myself* in this book. I've used the name Ivy Lee online for years, and I lived, until quite recently, near Beaufort, SC. That minor character was a bit of fun that made me wonder over and over if I knew Ms Reichs online! Just coincidence, I'm sure.Thanks for a brilliant bit of entertainment!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Sorry Cornwell, but Temperance Brennan is a lot better of a character than Kay Scarpetta. In Kathy Reichs's novels there are no soap opera whining periods like Cornwell likes to do. Dr. Tempe is on the hunt for a killer who burned down a house in Quebec. There were four people inside the house, all burned alive. As Tempe investigates, she is greatly disturbed to discover a possible &quot;cult&quot; connection. In this fast-paced novel of thrills and murders, Reichs takes readers on a hunt from Quebec, Canada to North Carolina to try to stop this group of evil cult members before they kill again. The only part that I didn't like about this novel was that in Tempe's free time, she investigated a century year old remains of some religious member at a local church. That part could have been cut of the novel. Overall, &quot;Death DeJour&quot; is a worthwile read!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"The book was extremely good with its careful detail to scientific facts. I think the story got off to a very slow start and it took the author quite a while of pages to explain what she wanted from the readers in the beginning but after that the story ran smooth like water and I just couldnt put it down. I would really recommend this book but beware for the light hearted the description of deaths etc is not to nice"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Kathy Reichs appearance as a mystery write was dotted with a dozen comparisons to Patricia Cornwell, who had already achieved considerable success with her string of Kate Scarpetta novels. The irony of this is that Reichs actually is the character she writes about, a forensic archeologist equally at home with analyzing the 100 year old remains of a potential saint or piecing together the shattered remains from a horrific fire. And while Dr. Temperance Brennan has her own relationship foibles and family issues, the holds not a candle to the goofiness that flows Scarpetta around.In this, the second novel in the series, Brennan starts out with the remains of Sister Elisabeth Nicolet - dead, buried, and reburied. She has been nominated for sainthood and the good doctor has agreed to examine and verify the remains. The corpse, however, conceals a genuine surprise, and the archeologist yields to the temptation to extend the investigation beyond the forensic into the history of old Canada, where plague and prejudice were bedfellows.The real mystery of the story starts with a group of bodies found in the smoking remains of a torched chalet and with the appearance of Temperance's sister Harry, who has suddenly become interested in a retraining and counseling program that has unexpected effects. When Temperance leaves Montreal and returns to Chapel Hill to teach for a semester she hardly expects this mystery to follow her. But that is exactly what it does, in the company of Detective Andrew Ryan who Temperance finds irritatingly attractive.This story is a tightly woven web with a terrible secret lurking within it. Everything Dr. Brennan values is at risk as evil and madness threaten to reach out and touch family and friends in a fatal pattern. By combine past and present in the novel Reichs manages to present a predictable plot in an unpredictable fashion. She will continue to build her characterizations in a realistic fashion which I find much more readable than the Scarpetta family of perpetual maladapts. Readers who are attracted to forensic investication while fine Death du Jour a treat."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I found the reading of Reich's first novel, Deja Dead, to be a bit ponderous but all the scenes of Montreal really stuck with me. Still, the slow pacing made me reluctant to read her second book. Now I've read it - and it has almost the opposite problem. I had no problem with inhaling it in an evening. But when it was over I was left feeling unsatisfied.Fundamentally, the flaw in this book is the huge use of coincidence. Everywhere Tempe goes she runs into murder (the Jessica Fletcher syndrome). OK, I can deal with that. But that she happens to stumble onto murders in different countries that are related? That her sister just happens to fall in the circle of the murderers? Just too much for my pragmatic mind...I like Tempe and her supporting cast. I'm just hoping that this is only a case of second novel fails to follow the big debut and that the third novel will be a dandy."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"After a year of false starts, I finally read &quot;Death du Jour.&quot; I found myself a bit disappointed. Kathy Reichs has been compared to Patricia Cornwell, but Kathy Reichs is no Patricia Cornwall. For one thing, Ms Cornwall writes exceedingly well. She was a journalist covering the police beat in Richmond before she began writing crime novels. Her books in some sense are extensions of these stories. Cornwall's writing is exceedingly original and based on real events according to our local papers.Although I liked Ms. Reich's first book &quot;Deja Death&quot; -- mainly because it took place in Montreal and had an exotic setting -- certain aspects of it bothered me. I found myself very irritated with Ms. Reich's second book. Ms Reichs books seem to consist of warmed over material from other books. While Reichs books may be based on real events, and I am sure she is a good nonfiction writer, she does not write fiction very well. For one thing, &quot;Death du Jour&quot; is far too busy. There are too many characters and not enough character development, too many plot twists and subplots and not enough development of the central plot.For me, one of the great attactions of Poirot, Morse, or Kay Scarpetta is the mental game. 'Du jour' is loaded with action but don't expect much of a mental game. Sure, I know police work is different from detection, but Cornwall does both--that's what makes her stories so strong.Also, I like a lead character I can identify with on some level. One appealing characteristic of Kay Scarpetta is her ability to reflect. All through her novels Ms. Cornwall has Scarpetta pull back and reflect. Often she does it over a meal she has prepared for her sidekick detective.Ms. Reichs character Tempe Brennan attempts to do this but even when she sits in front of her fire place she's nervous and twitchy and something is always happening, from break-ins to fires. Tempe Brennan is very nearly perfect, and she is far to active and she needs to cut back on the diet coke.Oh somewhere, someone might try to do everything Tempe does, but I seriously doubt they could do any of it very well. My willing suspension of disbelief gets pretty stretched with Tempe. How many times is she going to be beaten, mugged, burgled, and held prisoner. This is only book two and she's been pretty battered already. And, she's a fool at times. She deals with the worst sort of killer, and refuses to carry a weapon--give me a break.In &quot;Death du Jour&quot;, over a three week period, Tempe Brennan becomes involved in some facet or other of investigations into at least ten suspicious deaths. These bodies scattered from Canada to Beaufort SC. And Brennan is teaching a graduate course at UNC, writing papers for a professional conferences, investigating the bones of a supposed RC saint, and taking time out for a weekend getogether with her college age daughter. I was exhausted by the middle of the book. (And she jogs regularly!)"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Fans of the TV show Bones should be warned - it is only loosely based on the characters from the book. I've seen several episodes of the show (and not particularly enjoyed them) and had some problems reconciling what I knew from TV to what the author was telling me in the story. To be honest, I wish I'd never seen the show, I enjoyed the characters in the book far more.Character differences aside, I thought the book was very well plotted and paced. It draws you in with a small mystery, then leaves you hanging (though the more astute mystery readers will certainly be able to guess, it still makes you read to the end to be completely sure) while it wends its way through a completely separate main storyline. Granted, it's a little predictable. There aren't any of the completely out of the blue shocks or twists. But the writing is solid, the dialogue good, and I enjoyed the characters. Though it's not strictly what most would call a \`cozy', the formulaic plot and lack of shock value shoe-horns it into that category for me. Fans of a more nitty-gritty mystery may be assuaged by some of the slightly more graphic descriptions of death, but I doubt it is visceral enough to really appeal."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Doctor Temperance Brennan is back! In case this is your first meeting with her, all you basically need to know is that she's middle-aged, divorced, a recovering alcoholic, the mother of a college student, and one of the finest forensic anthropologists in her chosen home-city of Montreal. Although she was first introduced in Kathy Reichs' first novel \\"Deja Dead\\", there is no need to have read that to grasp the situation here.Tempe is haunted by the remains of an horrific murder/arson crime scene, in which aspects of the charred bodies put her in mind of a sinister cult. But as usual, no one in the police department (expect perhaps the hunky Detective Ryan) is prepared to believe her. From the McGill University to North Carolina, from blistering heat to the great Quebec Ice Storm of 1998, Tempe follows the trail of clues as they unfold.As usual, Reichs goes into extraordinary detail on the nuances of murder investigation and forensic examination that is sometimes fascinating, and just as often long-winded. In a similar vein, the \\"connect-the-dots\\" mystery story, in which Tempe attempts to draw together many seemingly-unrelated threads is often intriguing, but also marked by truly remarkable coincidences. What are the odds that a field trip with her daughter would result in the finding of a body that had a direct bearing on the case at hand? How amazing is it that Tempe's sister would become involved in the cult that she's attempting to hunt down? And how likely is it that the niece of one of the nuns Tempe is helping on a completely different case goes missing in mysterious circumstances? Of course, there must always be some degree of the suspension of disbelief when reading any story, but don't come to this book believing that it is a realistic (or even remotely plausible) storyline.The story is framed by the subplot of Tempe's identification of body of a nun that being considered for beatification; only when Tempe examines the bones she finds something extremely surprising about them - at least we are told this near the beginning, we don't actually find out what's strange about them till the final pages. The wait is rather annoying; it's as if Reichs didn't quite think her book was interesting enough and concocted a hook in order to ensure readers would go on to the finish.Basically, \\"Death Du Jour\\" is not as good as \\"Deja Dead\\", partly because of Reichs recycles many of her previous ideas here. Of course, if you haven't read \\"Deja Dead\\" it's not a problem, but those that have may feel an uneasy sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. In the previous novel, Temperance spent a lot of the time worrying about her flighty and irresponsible friend Gabby whose line of work had a direct influence on the case. Here Temperance spends a lot of the time worrying about her flighty and irresponsible sister Harry, whose (you guessed it) new hobby has a bearing on the case.So yes, it was unfortunately a step-down from Reichs' previous novel. However, I can't deny that it sustained my interest throughout, and despite a few overly grisly passages (especially on the graphic wounds inflicted on two babies) it's a decent holiday read."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Death du jour is Kathy Reichs second book. Here we begin in Montreal with Dr. Tempe Brennan, forensic anthropologist, searching for the remains of a Catholic nun who is being nominated for sainthood. That in itself would hav ebeen an interesting story for me to read about. But this quickly becomes a sub-plot of the book as our heroine is called to work on a case which consist of five burned bodies.These five bodies lead our herione on an interesting murder investigation where the bodies just start to continue to grow. This mystery is well written and tied up nicely by the end of the book. The conclusion of the first body we were introduced too, the remains of the catholic nun, are just quickly brushed over. And left me wanting to know more...Other then that, this is a good read.This book does give you a very good look inside of forensic anthropolgy. The author has a great grasp on the subject and is able to convey this to the reader in such a way that keeps you reading."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This was my first Kathy Reichs book...anyone who was compared to (hopefully early) Patricia Cornwell was worth a try! Plus, the author's occupation of forensic anthropologist had visions of fantastic story lines dancing in my head. Unfortunately, my expectations were never met. Tempe's (female protagonist) family tree and business relationships kept reminding me of those of Kay Scarpetta, and most everything about DEATH DU JOUR felt too familiar. I think Ms. Reichs missed a golden opportunity by spending so little time on the part of her book dealing with the exhumation of Sister Elisabeth Nicolet's remains. The nun's potential sainthood, linked somehow with the present-day cult activities found in the book, would have made for some fascinating plot twists indeed! The author's writing style is good; a little work on more original character interactions and more unpredictable plot lines should make her even better."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I loved this book. I think it was better than her first, which is excellent! She had action throughtout the book and kept your interest to the point you didn't want to put it down. And I lost sleep over this one. Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I didn't like Deja Dead, but thought I'd give Kathy Reichs another chance. I'm glad I did. This is a much tighter book than her first. It kept me on the edge of my seat. It took two books to make me a fan, but I am now."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I totally agreed with the review of &quot;Summer Bore!&quot; and I really almost couldn't finish the book. I think that she had a lot of knowledge and did a lot of research to write this book, but the plot is really slow. There are too much coincidents and some plots just don't connect. What makes it even worse is that the auther tried to connect what seemed so far-fetched plots. After we learned about some cult culture and main characters, the author had to use one sentence as a whole paragraph to explain how the story fitted into her research. At the end of the book, we just got all the expaination of the whole plots and how every character fits in the whole story. I hated this kind of spoon-fed story. I also don't care much about Dr. Tempe Brenna. Too bad for me. I had spent a lot of hours, after putting my two toddlers to sleep, to read a very disappointed book.No comparison to Patricia Cornwell's books."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Wow, this is definitely my thriller of this summer, forget Stephen King - this one will give you the creeps. Wonderful authentic and good researched - a definite page turner."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"When I purchased this book, I had completely forgotten that I had read &quot;Deja Dead&quot; two years before. It took 3 weeks to plough through this slow moving novel and I was tempted several times to just put it away. Her knowledge of forensics is commendable (she is an expert after all), but her knowledge of how to utilize plot and character needs much improvement. Needless to say, that is an art form of its own."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I read death du jour over a period of a week dring this summer, and after reading it, i can say that this is a fine book, but one that falls just short of being good. With a heroin which is essentially kay scarpetta for canadians, death du jour and deja dead resseamble a lot like patricia cornwell's novel........think about it. A feisty female heroin, a rugged cop and partner, a young daughter(or neice) a cult, a burned house, detailed ferensic analysis....the list goes on. Needless to say, this book falls into the been there done that category.The book is essentially saved by good, but predictable writing. The characters are more likable(except for harry...who cares what happens to her) then cornwell's, but reichs cant seem to find a style all her own, and the suspense isn't really there.In spite of all of this, you'll have fun reading death du jour, but dont take it to seriously. It doesn't brake any genre rules or offer anything to the table, but what it does....it does well."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I liked it. I'm trying to get all of the collection. These books keep me entertained when im passing time."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Kathy has a way of getting you drawn into the book like you are there watching everything happen.

Its about cults which does not really intrest me as much"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Death Du Jour is the April book club pick for one of the book clubs I'm in. This book club loves mysteries and Death Du Jour is an interesting one. Dr. Temperance Brennan is a Forensic Anthropologist that teaches at a University in Charlotte, North Carolina, and also works in Montreal during her breaks. It is during the harsh winter in Quebec that Brennan helps to discover the bones of Sister Elisabeth Nicolet, a candidate for sainthood, and also discovers a gruesome mass murder at a burning chalet. The mass murder becomes a larger web of lies that envelopes Brennan's entire life. She works with sexy Detective Andrew Ryan to solve the mystery.I really enjoyed this book. It was a fast paced murder mystery and I really enjoyed the anthropological insights. I'll admit that we didn't discuss it too in depth at book club today as one member did not read it. Death Du Jour is the second book in a series, but it was a good stand-alone novel.This review was originally published on my blog, Laura's Reviews."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This 2nd installment in the Temperance Brennan series neither disappointed nor amazed me. There are far fewer terrible similes, \\"to say I was cold would be like saying Lady Godiva was undressed,\\" but the plot was far too coincidental to be believable. Once again the novel concludes with a Scooby Doo summary, but the crime procedurals are accessible and interesting and the characters likeable. Sometimes. Perhaps that is why I am enjoying Reichs Tempe Brennan series. The lead character is so believably flawed. I am anxious to see what develops between Brennan and Ryan and I can't help but wonder how many novels it will take for Tempe to realize she should at least pack some mace in her bag before she goes wandering off alone in an attempt to assert her self-reliance."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"If you like the TV series you should read the books - so far this one is my favorite - other than the references to the New Orleans Hornets this book is great - Go Lakers!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"that so far her books are an easy read and I learn a little as I go. This is only the second one but I have enjoyed it as much as the other one. I am not easily drawn in to a book but so far she has drawn me in twice and I feel as if I am part of the story."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I absolutely loved this book!! I was a Tempe Brennan fan long before the TV show Bones. In fact, I was thrilled when I heard about - especially the stars. The character of Tempe Brennan is very well-developed: she has her flaws but she's also strong and good role model for later (when my daughter is old enough to enjoy this series). This was one of the first books I read, and I still find it a good read when I am bored."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Out of all her books that I have read so far this one is the most compelling and full of excitement! It was the first time in a while a book didn't put me to sleep as I was sitting in bed. What I loved about it was how Brennan couldn't get away from anything; murder, Ryan, weather (good and bad). It was, also, full of knowledge about how forensic entomology works and how it helps to determine PMI (which captivates me more and more). I can't wait to read the next one!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I so want Tempe and Ryan to hook upand they all most doit just keeps getting better the longer youread it"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I had the opportunity to buy the series of Kathy Reichs' books all at one shot, and, since I have the full series, it made sense for me to read them in order. I just finished her second book, Death Du Jour, and enjoyed it a little more than Deja Dead. There wasn't as much French (which really distracted me since I don't know any French whatsoever) and her descriptions of people, places, and things were not as wordy (although still could use a little editing). Reichs does a great job of letting the reader get to know (and like) her main character, Tempe Brennan. Her way of letting the reader into the thoughts and habits of Tempe reminds me of how Michael Connelly develops his reader's connection with his main character, Harry Bosch. I liked Death Du Jour and read it quickly, but it was a little farfetched that Tempe just so happened to have personal connections to Quebec, Charlotte, and Texas. And, although I appreciated that Reichs didn't leave any loose ends, there is probably a more interesting way to pull it all together than having Ryan, Tempe's romantic interest and homicide detective, explaining the outstanding items to her one after another in the last several pages."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Being a avid reader of Dr. Reichs, I'm in awe once again at this book. She interweaves characters and subplots into one main, terrifing account based on the real horrors of cults and religious groups in our everyday mist. She gives eerie details on people and turns your imagination into a grizzly movie theater. Her main heroine, Dr. Brennan would be an amazing, and VERY realistic character for a movie. This book is a perfect sequel and should be a bestseller as well as her other books."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Once again, Kathy Reichs has brought us a great novel. Her strong writing and knowledge of procedure have helped to make her novels very realistic. Tempe Brennan is back in Kathy's second thriller. Tempe is a forensic anthropologist, which means she studies bones to determine characteristics of the individual and sometimes their cause of death.For Tempe, who lives both down south in Charlotte and way up North in Montreal - her lives cross during, what seems to be a simple excavation and vacation with her daughter. Tempe is asked to unearth the skeleton of a nun and study it so that the former nun can be submitted for possible sainthood. During this investigation, Tempe's sister arrives to take a spiritual class and things seem to heat up between the sister's and Detective Ryan, Tempe's buddy on the force.Once Tempe returns home to her classroom and her daughter things begin to go awry. Ryan's investigation takes him to Charlotte while Tempe's life as well as that of her sister's may be in very real danger.One of the things that makes Ms. Reichs' books so interesting is the detail that she provides not only when discussing a dig but when writing the interaction between characters. You almost want to reach into the book and offer Tempe some advice. The other thing that makes her novels so fun are the twists and turns and the unexpected. I highly suggest beginning with Deja Dead as this is the second in the series but first time readers won't feel left out if they choose to start with Death Du Jour."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Although they cover much the same turf, it is almost not fair to compare Cornwall and Reichs, because Reichs can actually write well!!! I read two of Cornwall's books. I can't remember which because they were so forgetable. I read the first and thought so little of it, that I picked up the second just to see why Cornwall keeps scaling the best seller lists so handily. I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why. Cornwall's work is leaden, heavy-handed and predictable.Unlike Cornwall, Reichs creates full-bodied characters, real live people about whom you care. Reichs is witty and scary at the same time. She creates tension and holds your interest until the last page. The locale of Montreal is fascinating. It adds an international dimension to the forensic medicine/anthropology genre.I highly recommend both of Reichs' paperbacks. You won't be able to put them down, and you'll find yourself saying &quot;merci&quot; at the end."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Forensic pathologist Temp Brennan spends part of each year in North Carolina and part of it in Quebec -- investigating death. Usually her investigations find her examining bodies and bones of historical deaths or of recent deaths where normal means of pathological investigation aren't effective. Author Kathy Reichs clearly knows her pathology. Herself a practitioner, she makes her field exciting for the reader to learn about. In addition her character Temp Brennan finds herself in the midst of people who's deaths have been quite mysterious. Death Du Jour travels from uncovering the hundred year old remains of a nun who is believed to be a Saint to the sleaziness of a cult who might just be killing people as part of their worship. Temp Brennan isn't just a laboratory investigator. She is indeed one solid pathologist who is not particularly willing to let a case close without getting to the bottom of it. A fascinating world and a well told mystery."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I really enjoy reading Patricia Cornwalls books, and have read them all, so I was looking for something along the same lines. There are a few similarities (job description), but the writing styles are completely different. Cornwall's stories suck you in within the first chapter, and you feel a real affinity with the characters; Cornwall knows how to bring them to life.Reich's characters are flat. You do not feel as if you get to know them very well. They story line is not as exciting as Cornwall's either. with a little more character development and more suspenseful story lines, this author may have promise."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This was my first Reichs novel and I have never read Cornwell. I thought the story rivetting. I was late for work because I couldn't put it down, and was first to leave so I could get home and get stuck in. I have recommended it to everyone. I plan to read 'Deja Dead' and cant wait for 'Death Decisions' (nice touch to entice us with a few chapters at the end of 'du Jour'!) Tempe is an amazing heroine, the twist and turns of the plot exciting, the medical detail fascinating. The final chapter just ties the loose ends.Brilliant! Well done Dr Reichs! More please."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"After reading Kathleens first book I marked on my calander when this book would be out. I was not disappointed, another page turner and all night read. My husband also enjoyed reading both books.Tempe Brennan is great. I find forensic anthropology fasinating for getting clues to how someone died. The introduction of the entomologist for finding clues was also interesting. I had a hard time putting down both of her books, I had to keep turning to the next page to see what was next.I highly recommend both books. I wish I didn't have to wait so long for her next book (August) to come out as my husband and I are moving to Costa Rica in March."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, and stumbled upon Death Du Jour by accident. All I can say is: Better heroine and supporting characters! Better plot! Better narrative style! Better forensic details! Reichs also injects humour into the book, which is a welcome relief. For me, books don't have to be particularly realistic - I didn't notice all the coincidences. The book is gripping and flows well."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Look out Kay Scarpetta here comes Tempe Brennan!! I picked up Reich's first novel Deja Dead at the suggestion of a librarian. I am a Patricia Cornwell fan but after three chapters of Reichs' first book I knew I wanted to pick up her second. It was impressive and uniquely intriguing as Deja Dead.It was fascinating to read about how our &quot;neighbors to the north&quot; handled their homicides.The characters were well defined and complimented the book's main character Tempe Brennan. Reichs' clinical descriptions and scientific explanations of forensics and forensic anthropology was well done!I can't wait to read her next book to find out what new challenges Tempe has facing her. Perhaps Hollywood needs to consider a movie about Tempe Brennan?"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I started reading this book with some trepidation, because I am not a Patricia Cornwell fan. I am delighted I made the effort....this was a great book and I'm really excited about reading the first novel in the series. I found Reichs style of writing to be far more enjoyable than Cornwell and Temperence to be a more believable character than Kay Scarpetta. Also, Harry is a more enjoyable and interesting secondary character than Scarpetta's daughter. The story had twists and surprise connections/revelations at the end. I had a highly entertaining weekend while reading this book! Can't wait for more!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Once again I was bowled over by Kathy Reichs. She manages to give her readers a wealth of information without ever talking down to them. She weaves subplots together like a master. Though, sadly, she does at times, withhold information from the readers that she shouldn't. If it's told in the first person and our heroine knows the info or clues, then we should too, however this is just a niggling and minor complaint and didn't really take away from the book at all.The book opens with Tempe in a church graveyard. A long dead nun is being considered for sainthood and Tempe is charged with aiding the Church's investigation. The bones aren't where they're supposed to be, but Tempe can't give this her full attention, because she's quickly drawn into an arson murder case that's tied in to a university student from North Carolina who recently joined a cult, then disappeared.Mystery, danger, action, suspense all add up to a five star winner."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I have got hooked on Kathy Reichs books and was glad I found this one on Amazon. Hardcover new condition and it arrived in just a few days."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I enjoy all of the books I've listened to by Kathy Reichs. I've even accidentally bought 2 of them twic by mistake. If I find any more new ones, they will be on my shopping list."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This is the second novel in the Temperance Brennan series. Supposedly, because it's winter, work should be slow. Unfortunately for Temperance, it is not. She has a nun to identify and a house of burned bodies in Canada, and mysterious deaths in Charlotte. Not to mention that she has classes to teach, and a somewhat difficult sister to deal with. Still highly entertaining, and I really enjoyed the addition of some sociology elements to the story. A lot of similarities to the first one though and it all seemed to tie up a little too easily for me. All in all however very entertaining and I will definitely continue to read this series."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I have to admit...I was a little disenchanted with this book during the early goings. It seemed a little disjointed to me. Brennan is paid to discover the truth behind a local nun from the past who is held in high regard in Canada and is up to become a saint. From there it turns into a series of bodies found both in Brennan's regular home in North Carolina as well as her 'summer' home of Canada. In between, more bodies are discovered and Brennan, in a wrong place/wrong time scenario, is the one to examine the bones. So for a while I was scratching my head as to what this book was really about. The dead would be saint or a series of murdered piles of bones separated not only by hundreds and hundreds of miles, but in two different COUNTRIES.As it turns out, there's a method to the madness in this book and things come together slowly but surely. What's really at the heart of this book is more creepy than you're lead to believe during the first 50 to 75 pages.I really enjoyed this book once things started to come together. Without going too much into the true plot of the novel, Reichs sends Tempe on a continent spanning mystery that involves not only the bones of a long dead saint, but a series of brutal murders. Are the bones found between Canada and the southern US totally unrelated or is there something deeper at hand? What Tempe finds is very disturbing and all too real. That's what makes this a great read once you're really into it.Definetly looking forward to the next installment!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Temperance Brennon, forensic anthropologist, very different character from the television series. I am acutually glad that the characters are different, as well as the story.Bodies are turning up everywhere in this girl's life. Slowly connecting the pieces together to a brain washing cult. Brennon finds she may be in deeper than expected when her sister Harry goes missing and her own life is threatened.I loved the descrpitions of actions in this novel. Often things were so well described I felt like I was the main character. The plot unfolded in a way that surprised me but also left me dissapointed. Vague rushed tie ups in the last chapter left me saying \\"What?\\""},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"It's the middle of winter in Montreal and Dr. Tempe Brennan is realizing that even bitter cold does not stop strange death. Between searching for the bones of a possible saint and investigating a set of grisly arson deaths, she is not feeling very festive. And when she connects the deaths to the disappearance of a college student thought to be involved in cult activity, she is the only one to see the parallels. As the investigation takes her from Montreal, to the Carolinas and back, she wonders just how far reaching the influence of so-called cults could be. And if they could reach right into the heart of her family.I absolutely love Kathy Reichs. From her Temperance Brennan novels to the television show Bones, I can't get enough. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"As others have pointed out, this story is mostly a succession of hair-risingly unbelievable coincidences.Let me add that it includes a rather unappetizing make-out scene - God knows why! I have absolutely nothing against a female lead having a love interest, but it seems quite obvious that the author is not only inexperienced but also uncomfortable when it comes to writing love scenes. Oh well... Romance sells, I suppose, even if it's poorly written. The only good thing about the clumsy description is that we are spared the \\"insert tab A in slot B\\" part.The only plausible - and hence best - part of the story was the plotline about the old bones in the church, and that took up maybe 50 pages of the book."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I have read several of Kathy Reichs' books and pretty much loved them all, but this one had just too many coincidences to make this one the least bit believable. North Carolina, Quebec and Texas where Brennan works or has relatives just happens to be the 3 centers of cult activity involved in this caper. Then, Tempe just happens to be visiting the ape island on the day the bodies are discovered. sigh. Had it been almost anyone but Kathy Reichs, I might have awarded this book 2 stars. The book was fairly interesting and the action kept moving for the most part but the ending just came out of no where like the plot suddenly shifted into overdrive to get to the conclusion. The last hundred or so pages just felt rushed. Had this been the first Temperance Brennan novel I had read, I would probably give another one a shot. It wasn't terrible. Since this is like the fifth one I've read, I shall just chalk this one up to something of a lesser work and look forward to the next one, confident that it will probably be better. Kathy Reichs has a style I like and Tempe Brennan is a heroine I enjoy."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I have always loved Patricia Cornwell's books but her recent ones don't appeal to me anymore. Now I have discovered Kathy Reichs and I love her books!!! If you're a fan of the Bones TV show, try reading this!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"WOW, that's all I can say"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Reichs' latest book confirms that she has surpassed Patricia Cornwall in forsenic thrillers. She develops the characters well, but doesn't let them get in the way of the story. A good read."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I ordered 'Death du Jour' along with another mystery novel,'Black Notice', and the new WWII thriller, 'The Triumph and the Glory', from Amazon a couple weeks back and all three were great! I think Reichs is rapidly establishing herself as the prime contender to dethrone Cornwell in the genre. I'll have to wait and see how their next books are, but both their new ones get five stars from me."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"The reader from Charlotte, NC shortchanged herself by not finishing this book. Her review is inaccurate and misleading. It is her loss that she plans never to read Reichs again. This is a fabulous book, deep in detail and a joy to Montreal-philes, oui!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I got hooked on the storyline despite the repellant descriptions of decaying bodies and maggots. Kept wondering what the main character, Tempe Brennan, looked like. No description ever given. All the loose ends were tied up at the end, except how Ryan knew about Brennan's mugging. A recommended alternative to Patricia Cromwell's Kay Scarpetta, whose plots and charaterizations are getting weaker and weaker."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Gore yes, lots of information about autopsies and assorted other matters, rather too-clearly-fictitious characters ... It all adds up to a rather flat, dispiriting formula effort. If you just HAVE to know who's responsible every time you read of a fictitious killing, then you'll get through this, otherwise it becomes rather a drag."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This is what Patricia Cornwell's biggest competition looks like. This book was much better than Deja Dead and I have to tell you I have never had so many goose pimples in my life reading this. I also appreciated the author's sensitivity in dealing with animals. But this book royally kicks and I couldn't put the darn thing down for love or money, only because of job security! One of the best I've read in a long time, and I look forward to more, more more from this author. She does her homework well and never talks &quot;over&quot; the reader in explaining the technologies in piecing things together. The bad part is waiting for the next one!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Reich's second novel was a page-turner--a two-night read! There is no need to keep comparing her to Cornwell, she can stand on her own. Each deserve praise. Without them, what would we insomniacs do while waiting for sleep to overcome us? (Although both novels are &quot;thrilling&quot; enough to keep any early-to-bedder up past his/her bedtime.) I just wish she had more than the two novels. I'll be anxiously awaiting others!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This book hit very close to home ..I found myself \`\`THERE\`\` in this book.Of course it helps being from Quebec myself where this story is based.I cant wait to read the other novels by Kathy !!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"As riveting as &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot; or &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, Kathleen Reichs' &quot;Death du Jour&quot; takes up where Patricia Cornwell left off several books ago. The heiress to Cornwall's abandoned readers, Reichs pulls out all the stops in Death du Jour, weaving an intriguing yarn impossible not to enjoy. I loved it."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"The info on this audio book, Death du Jour (received from bordeebook), didn't indicate that it is abridged. I didn't like it much, partly due to her poor use of similes, partly because I got tired of the plot development. I didn't listen to the last 45 minutes."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"If you like the science behind forensic pathology, you'll get hooked on Kathy Reichs reading this book. The plot and characters seem rather unlikely - but no more so than most of the classic mystery writers - and the book carries you along rapidly. I read this in one sitting - I recommend it."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This is the second in the Tempe series, and it was not quite as good as the first. The story line tying where she worked in the winter to where she worked in the summer was just too coincidental for my taste. Made it unbelievable. But her forensic writing was still on top. Nobody does that better. No gratuitous gore! Overall, still a good read."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This is the first Kathy Reichs book that I read and I was not impressed. The story locations and plots kept changing constantly and there were many drawn out and boring areas to this book. Tempe Brennan though not an unlikable character does not provide a strong enough lead. I would probably attempt another Kathy Reichs novel but not one with Tempe Brennan."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"All the pieces are here in Reichs' second Tempe Brennan novel. The complication of her nephew does its job dramatically, and the end is more dramatic and complicated than in her first novel, which is a good thing. This is a step up and I recommend it for easy reading."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Great book, couldn't put it down. Move over Dr. Kay Scarpetta and Patricia Cromwell. If you like the Dr. Scarpetta books, you will like Temperance Brennan."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Another book by this wonderful author which was extrememly hard to put down! Her books are throughly interesting. Didn't take me long to finish this one! The story had me reading for hours! Great cases, great subjects, great people. Will be looking for the next winner!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"As a skimmer who can usually finish a book in a few hours, this book was the exception. The plot was well contrived, the characters highly developed and the ending not expected. Superb!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Kathy Reichs is a good addition to this kind of book. I have become hooked on Patricia Cornwell and came upon Reichs by accident.I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"just finished &quot;Death du jour and all i can stay is move over Cornwall, Reichs is here. what a read. read her first book &quot;Deja Dead, it was great but she is getting better. this is the kind of book to read on a hot day to cool down. can't wait to find out more aboutTempe and her cat, Birdie."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Forensic anthropologist Tempe Brennan is finally doing something she loves--helping determine the evidence for a prospective saint buried near Quebec. Despite the cold, she loves what she'd doing. Soon, however, far more recent death enters her world. For a time it seems that every place she turns, whether in Quebec, or home in North Carolina, she turns up another corpse--another murder. When the evidence begins to point to a link between the deaths and a strange cult that just might have caught her sister in its grip, Tempe feels helpless to do anything to prevent a new death wave that could make the current death of the day seem small.Author Kathy Reichs is completely convincing in her descriptions of forensic anthropology. The segments of DEATH DU JOUR dealing with the recovery of the prospective Saint, including both the science and Reichs' descriptions of the bitter cold of Quebec in winter ring painfully true. She adds page-turning suspense and the risks of both emotional and physical danger to Tempe to make the novel even more compelling.The amount of coincidence involved in the story, put me off to some extent. While a cult might well have branches in multiple cities, the odds that one forensic anthropologist would accidentally get involved in the activities of this cult in three separate areas stretches the reader's credibility. Fortunately, Reich moves DEATH DU JOUR along at a fast enough pace that you aren't given enough time to consider the improbability of some of Reich's plot elements."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This is the first of Kathy Reichs books I read (not the last).The author took me on a rollercoaster ride with wave after wave of terror and excitement. This book moves from one level of excitement to another and another at a dizzying pace. I found it most gripping and compelling. I will read all of this author's novels.A super read!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This is Dr. Tempe Brennan's second appearance and of the three Riechs books, I've read I liked it the best. The book opens with Tempe (in the cold Canadian fall) digging up the bones of a 100-year old nun who is being considered for sainthood (for her work during a smallpox epidemic). At the same time she is called out to a farm where a horrible explosion/fire has left a number of bodies to be identified. Finally, a young, nervous student disappears from a local university (suspected of joining a cult). As Tempe works away, her revelations send her home to North Carolina where more bodies are found and she begins to suspect that they are linked to the Canadian bodies. We learn more about Tempe in this novel as we are introduced to her sister Harriet, and she (Tempe) picks up a love interest (which of course, always makes our characters more interesting) - one that doesn't seem likely until it happens. The Dr. Brennan books are good solid murder mysteries with what seems to be the right balance of gore, mystery, and themes of societal relevance (cults, in this case). Reichs, as a forensic anthropologist herself, is very skilled in her pathologic descriptions. As one reviewer says so well, she, \\"she uses the science of death to reveal rather than to shock or startle.\\" And this makes for outstanding reading."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Kathy Reichs in Death Du jour repeats her performance from Deja Dead. Tempe Brennan is an interesting middle aged intelligent woman who helps to solve murders through her work as a forensic anthropologist. Tempe is a tough minded women who is sensitive enough to hate the &quot;death&quot; part of her work. Like many of us at this age she is undergoing mid-life crisis at multiple levels - love, relationships, work and self-esteem.The storyline is about cults - something which touches us all in our headline world. We have all read the horror stories. We have met enough zealots to know their potential for destruction on the path to righteousness.Book is fast paced and an easy read - which is my favorite kind. Although it is not the literary equal to another about forensic anthropologist - Anil's Ghost - this is no knock. I prefer to read about 5 quick easy entertainings to one literary gem."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"It's a pleasure to read a book by an author who has talent, pace, and plot firmly in hand. I would have given this novel five stars except for one thing; the heroine's career involves examining the remains of murder victims. The results of these examinations are recited in minute detail. Though this is more than likely fascinating fare for some readers, those of us who are a bit more squeamish about putrifaction, the insects that devour a corpse, etc - could do with less emphasis on these aspects. Nevertheless - a damn good yarn by a talented author."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Somebody recommended me Kathy Reichs saying she was entertaining and that her stories happened in Montreal, Quebec.I was intrigued and decided to read it. Wow! Her stories are interesting and you learn a lot from the studies of bones. I've read her first one and liked it but not as much as this one, it's really fast-paced and the characters are very interesting.I read in one of the other reviews that it was too coincidental, I tought so too, but again Reichs could have decided that some part of the stories happened somewhere else...it would have probably become too confusing.Being from Montreal, I really enjoyed the descriptions of the city in the books. You can tell she really likes Montreal and who can blame her... I live here no? ;)Seriously, it's a good story and you'll learn a lot so buy it and why not take a trip up here... hey we've got POUTINE! ;)"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Dr. Tempe Brennen is back again. This time there are two stories blended into one, and the transition is easy to follow. The bones of Sister Elisabeth Nicolet who has been dead for over a century, have been moved and tampered with, and a deadly house fire, which is suspected as arson, and a university teaching assistant who disappears after joining a cult. Homicide Detective Andrew Ryan, whom Tempe has had a combustive relationship with, in the past, joins her in the investigation. I enjoyed this book as much as I did Deja Dead. Tempe is an amazing heroine. the medical details are exact and accurate, the plot is exciting and has lots of twists and turns.This book really grabbed me from the very first page and held me on the end of my seat, and what a wonderful ride it was. I cannot wait for the next installment of Tempe, which will be Death Decisions. To entice us, Dr. Reichs gave a sampling of the new book in the back of Death DeJour."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Quite often a second book after a very succesful first one is a dissapointment. This one isn't!Ms Reichs turns out to be a real good writer. Even though the plot is by far not as strong and tight as her first novel, the writing is good enough to keep you on the edge of your seat; by times witty, by times reflecting and a good solid portion of well written thrilling scenes.I am as a reader quite happy to share the feelings Temperance has but I am also glad that we are not taken on the long soul searching journeys that her literary rival, Kay Scarpetta, takes us all the time.I hope the third novel is just as good and highly recommend this one for a quiet weekend."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This was a pretty fair book, but I have to agree with a lot of others on this that there were too many coincidences to make it really believable. The characters are good and finely drawn. I really like Tempe Brennan. The forensic information is wonderful. Hopefully, Ms Reichs will have a more believable story line next time. I will definitely read her again."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Having read and enjoyed Kathy Reich's Deja Dead, I was anxious to pick up her latest work. In addition to being a riveting mystery story, this book was a fascinating porthole into the world of forensic anthropolgy. As a direct of reading this book, I came to Amazon.com today to seek a number of books on forensic science, homicide investigation and forensic anthropology. Kathy Reich's book has stimulated me to learn as much as I can about this amazing science."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Toward the end of this novel, the lead character, Reichs' usual heroine Tempe Brennan, remarks on the \\"remarkable coincidence\\" of one of the plot points. By this point in the book, this is like pointing out to a rabid dog that it's got some spittle on its chin. This book relies on coincidence so fundamentally that if it were removed, it would fall into 3 or 4 different books with little or nothing to do with one another.Reichs is not a bad writer, and for someone who so clearly comes from a forensic background, is passably adept at character, plot and scene setting. She knows how to build suspense and intrigue, and never lets the technicalities of her lead character's profession -- a forensic anthropologist -- or the intricacies of her work, undermine the story.This book centres on Brennan's investigation of a religious cult that perpetrates a set of murders. There are lots of interesting points about how cults work, ritual murder and even large group awareness programs get in on the action. And, of course, several forensic investigations where we are treated to the processes of digging up bones, collecting maggots and bugs, and examining various grim bits of the human body.What undermines this book is that the first half is at least three different, unrelated stories; and the second is such a clumsy and outrageous merging of them into one, that one drifts from disinterest to incredulity. The jacket cover says this book is about the excavation of a 19th century nun's bones, and the mysteries therewith. In fact, this is just story number 1, which is of only tangential importance to the ultimate, main storyline.It is not obvious, even in terms of the world of Death du Jour, why Reichs needed all this intermingling. It feels like she started writing a travel journal, then stuck a murder into each of her ports of call, then simply declared that they all belong to the same overarching plot. In this context, each individual story feels derivative, and the grand plot feels like a desperate trick.A well-written and, at times, interesting book, which is ultimately unsatisfying and preposterous."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Kathy Reichs' second novel featuring forensic anthropologist, Tempe Brennan was a bit of a disappointment. Yes, it rattles along at a fine old pace. Yes, the forensic stuff is fascinating (and probably written with the most passion). Yes, the characters are round and well constructed. But talk about convenient. Even though this novel takes place in three states of America AND Quebec, the main protagonist just happens to be where the action is at exactly the right moment. And how about this main protagonist....She is so involved in her job, that she manages to cross every professional boundary known to man. (How on earth she manages to convince the Police to let her go to every bust they go to is anybodies guess!!) Everyone who knows her should be afraid (Very afraid), after all, her best friend got it in the first book and her cat and her sister get singled out for action in this one. This novel is just a little too trite to make any literary awards. It is certainly not for the squeamish. (Two of our readers felt physically sick, and one suffered nightmares after reading this novel) However, most of us read it through to the end. The biggest question we were left with is If a forensic anthropologist suffers severe head trauma (five beltings over two novels!) how long is it before she has enough neurological deficit to interfere with her job?????"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Oh dear. Another person steeped in his art/job/hobby writes a book so as to be able to brain-dump his hard-earned skill in the guise of literature on the hapless reader.This is a very poor novel. It is peppered with irritating coincidences and has long turgid passages that require teeth-gritting determination to wade through.In my opinion the heroine is unlikable and her angst fabricated in an attempt to give her some depth ... a device which to my mind fails. This is an attempt to out Cornwell Cornwell. Trouble is that Cornwell got there first and in the process exhausted the genre so that most people I know who were fans are now equally fed-up with her output.Perhaps it is a little unfair to denigrate Reichs because Cornwell's mother-lode is exhausted but even so, Reichs just don't cut it for me."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This was another love-hate read by Kathy Reichs. I enjoyed the story and will more than likely read her next installment (although I will probably borrow it instead of buying it). It wasn't great but it was a good read. I truly wanted to know whodunnit and why; however, there were a few stylistic hurdles to overcome.1. I guess my biggest problem is that the events in Reichs' story seem to be too coincidental and contrived. The characters seem to be puppets reacting instead of truly independent characters. I see her heavy hand directing them in every scene and it doesn't quite ring true.2. I don't think I like Tempe Brennan. She's rude, easily rankled, and always thinks she's right - without really showing any reason why I should think she is. I'm not convinced that she could truly take care of herself. The unavoidable comparison to Kay Scarpetta leaves me thinking that Scarpetta could take Tempe down in a hearbeat.3. There are a few scenes where Tempe gets all emotional and I'm supposed to feel her pain. Sorry, but I just didn't care. I wanted to, but I had no reason to shed tears about characters that weren't developed enough to make me care about them.4. As for the bad guys in the book, I have one thing to say: if you want to read a novel about a cult that is truly scary and doesn't just blow things up, read Kyle Mills' _Storming Heaven_."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Death du Jour lives up to its name and Kathy Reichs lives up to our expectations. This was a great Forensic book and was one of those \\"I Can't put it down\\" books. I really enjoy reading these books and think that anyone who has liked Patricia Cornwell will love these by Kathy Reichs."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"It's winter in Quebec and Dr. Temperance Brennan, forensic anthropologist for the province, has a lot to deal with besides the below-freezing temperatures as DEATH DU JOUR, the second novel in Kathy Reichs' Temperance Brennan series, begins. Tempe has been called to exhume the remains of a nun, Sister Elisabeth Nicolet, who lived a century earlier and is now being considered by the Catholic church for sainthood. But there's a problem: The bones aren't where they're supposed to be. When Tempe and her crew finally do find the bones in a strange, small coffin buried in the recesses of a decaying church on the property, Tempe discovers another complication: The nun may not have been who the church thought she was.Later that same night, Tempe gets an urgent phone call from one of her coworkers: A residence is on fire north of Montreal, arson is expected...and there are victims: seven of them, and two are babies no more than four months old. Tempe is being called in to examine the bodies.Two days later, an 18-year-old pregnant prostitute is discovered hanging naked from a tree in a suburb of Montreal with strange bite marks and slashes all over her body. Cause of death: mauling by canines.Meanwhile, Tempe continues to investigate the history of Elisabeth Nicolet, and her search takes her to McGill University to the office of Daisy Jeannotte, a charismatic and strange Southern transplant who specializes in religious studies at the university. Daisy's assistant, Anna Goyette, reacts strangely when Daisy catches her talking to Tempe. A week later, Anna disappears.To top it all off, Tempe's sister Harry has arrived in Quebec and enrolled in courses with a company called Inner Life Empowerment, which promises to cleanse the mind and body to prepare them for cosmic awakening. Harry, a flighty and difficult woman to live with, further complicates Tempe's relationship with Detective Andrew Ryan. Needless to say, Tempe, who is in Quebec only until spring break ends at UNC-Charlotte, where she teaches anthropology, has a full three weeks of investigation and exhumation--and she looks forward to going home to relax.But when she arrives at her home in North Carolina, more work is waiting for her. Two bodies are discovered on a research island off the coast of South Carolina, and like the prostitute in Montreal, the cause of death is found to be mauling by dogs. Furthermore, links are discovered between these two victims and the arson victims, all leading Tempe and Ryan, who has come down from Quebec to aid in the investigation, to a mysterious commune far back in South Carolina's low country. And now, Tempe hasn't heard from Harry for weeks, Elisabeth Nicolet's history is beginning to take shape, Tempe's relationship with Ryan is beginning to heat up, and Tempe herself is threatened once again as her investigation leads her closer to the truth--and closer to discovering how she can save her sister.So, obviously, there is a lot happening in DEATH DU JOUR. Reichs' second novel has an intricate plotline, but not as convoluted as you might think. Her writing is clear, her details pertinent, her formula expertly crafted. Readers of DEJA DEAD will recognize Tempe's ironic narrative voice, and Reichs expands on her heroine gracefully in this follow-up novel. We meet more of Tempe's family--her sister, her nephew--and learn more about the other half of her job as a member of the faculty at UNC. She emerges as an honest and believable heroine with secret motivators and a colorful past.Some other reviewers seem to find the coincidences that occur in DEATH DU JOUR off-putting. And they're right to point out the coincidences: They abound in this book. The fact that the case expands from Quebec to the Carolinas--the two places Tempe lives--seems far-fetched. And it is, of course, downright unbelievable that ALL of the cases Tempe is working on are somehow linked. But that's why Reichs has written a fictional novel rather than an autobiography. That's why Tempe is a Reichs stand-in in these novels: Fiction gives a forensic anthropolgist a lot more liberties (and opportunities) than does fact. Who says a novel--especially an exciting murder mystery like this one--has to reflect real life? It doesn't. So yes, monumental coincidences do occur in DEATH DU JOUR, but those coincidences are overshadowed by above-average writing, a vivid heroine, and an exciting plot line. They are overshadowed by interesting information about how entomologists use insect analysis to determine date and time of death, descriptions of skeletal reconstruction, and stunning prose taking readers from the warmth and peace of the Southeastern coast to the frigid chill and eerie darkness of a Northern ice storm. DEATH DU JOUR is a triumph, an exciting, sprawling, intricate novel full of surprising twists and unforgettable characters. Reichs' formula is working so far! One thing, though: It's about time for Tempe to get a gun."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Forensic pathologist Temp Brennan spends part of each year in North Carolina and part of it in Quebec -- investigating death. Usually her investigations find her examining bodies and bones of historical deaths or of recent deaths where normal means of pathological investigation aren't effective. Author Kathy Reichs clearly knows her pathology. Herself a practitioner, she makes her field exciting for the reader to learn about. In addition her character Temp Brennan finds herself in the midst of people who's deaths have been quite mysterious. Death Du Jour travels from uncovering the hundred year old remains of a nun who is believed to be a Saint to the sleaziness of a cult who might just be killing people as part of their worship. Temp Brennan isn't just a laboratory investigator. She is indeed one solid pathologist who is not particularly willing to let a case close without getting to the bottom of it. A fascinating world and a well told mystery."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I bought a batch of Kathy Reichs' books for my wife, simply because we both enjoy the Bones TV series. This is the second of the books I've read, and I have to say that if it weren't for the connection with the TV show, I wouldn't bother with these books. They're mildly entertaining, and the science is good, but the writing is not great. These books are not riveting page-turners. I'd term the writing \\"rather amateur\\".As some other reviewers have brought up, the reliance on improbable coincidences to connect up parts of the story reaches absurd levels. There are other idiosyncrasies of Reich's writing style that others pick apart better than I could. But it's those coincidences that get me.I'll read another book or two, simply because we already have them. Maybe the writing in later books improves just from practice?"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"In Death Du Jour, the second Temperance Brennan mystery, Kathy Reichs proves that she's not just a flash in the pan.Forensic anthropologist, Temperance Brennan, splits her time between Montreal and Charlotte, North Carolina, working with law enforcement and teaching. She's in Montreal when a gruesome discovery is made--three bodies are discovered after an arson fire. But it appears that the victims may have been dead before the fire was set. At the same time, she is helping the Roman Catholic Church identify the bones of a nun who is being proposed for sainthood. In doing some research for the church, she stumbles upon some information that provides clues to the arson. Before assembling all the puzzle pieces, Brennan (with the help of Detective Andrew Ryan) will go from Montreal to Charlotte to Beaufort, South Carolina and back to Montreal.Reichs provides her readers with an education they won't receive from other authors. In Death Du Jour, she goes into great detail about how the many insects found on a body can be analyzed to discover the time of death. She also gives us a mini-lesson on cults including types, a history of cults, cult leaders, and those who would be attracted to cults.Reichs' books follow along with Brennan's personal life, and we're introduced to Peter (the husband she's separated from) and her sister, Harry. We also witness the growing attraction between Brennan and the handsome Ryan. Although you don't have to read these books in order, it does help with continuity.I'm not much of a television watcher, but I may just have to catch Bones, the series that is based on the character of Temperance Brennan."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"There is a rule of thumb that no novel should have more than one significant coincidence, and it's a shame Kathy Reichs never heard of that principle. In this novel, the protagonist just happens to be personally affected by seemingly unrelated events in South Carolina, North Carolina, Texas, and Quebec, and it just so happens that each of these subplots tie in to each other culminating in the grand climax. After the first couple chapters, it was painfully obvious how the author had structured the plot. In any mystery where the protagonist is not a law enforcement officer, there is dilemma in plot construction of how the protagonist gets his or her information. It is at this point that Reichs has dropped the ball: Coincidences spanning three states and one Canadian province are not a solid foundation for a compelling novel.Reich's previous novel had appeal because of the Montreal setting, and because the specialty of 'forensic anthropologist' provides an interesting vehicle for a murder mystery. Those types of 'hooks' may succeed with a writer's first novel, but are not enough to sustain a second novel, especially when compounded by such difficulties of plot construction."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This book is not bad, but it needs a little more work. She has a good start on her characters, but they need a little more work so that they have more depth or something as they seem a little superficial. Maybe it is because I have read and enjoyed so many of Patricia Cornwell's books and, as they are both about a woman who is in forensics or pathology, I unconsciously compare them and I shouldn't because they are very different heroines.The book is about a woman who splits her time between Canada and North Carolina who examines dead bodies. A lot of the story has been told by the other reviewers so I won't go into too much detail except to say that she looks into the death of a century old woman that nuns want to make into a saint and many mysterious deaths that are extremely gory. It keeps you on your toes and is packed full of murder and hayhem."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This was the second Kathy Reich's novel I've read - the first was Fatal Voyage. Although I've read these out of sequence that doesn't seem to be an issue so feel free to start whereever you like!Fatal Voyage was set purely in the Carolinas; this one is divided fairly evenly between Tempe's alta-egos - the Southern Belle and the French Canadienne ;) and is more involving for the change of scenery. Tempe starts with the exhumation of a 19th century nun, though her tale doesn't mingle much with the rest of the story. We quickly discover that not is all that it seems with the discovery and, my one major gripe, is that we're not told what it is that Tempe has found. For me mystery novels are better when we are given the information as the hero / heroine discovers it. In this case it would have added to the mystery if we had known what, exactly, was so puzzling.Anyway, Tempe quickly gets drawn into the main story - the hunt for the brutal killers of a family in Canada. Bodies are dropping everywhere and, at first, there's no indication that they are connected. Are they? Tempe seems to think so and the hunt around Quebec and the Carolinas heats up.Of course, Tempe cannot hunt this quarry without herself becoming a target herself. But is her sister a target this time too?As before, Kathy Reichs skillfully weaves these various events into one compelling story that keeps the pages turning and the mind ticking. Great!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I thought Kathy Reich's first book &quot;Deja Dead&quot; was a quick, fun read, but a little sloppy. Given that the killer kept changing the method by which he killed, it was a wonder that Tempe Brennan actually solved the crime. (Aren't serial killers supposed to be consistant?) Anyway, the atmosphere was good and I'm a sucker for anything about Montreal. Which leads me to &quot;Death du Jour.&quot; What a surprise to find Ms. Reich in such firm command of the genre in just her second book. She juggles several (try five) different story lines so successfully, you would think this was fifth or sixth in the series. Brava! I dare you to put this one down."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This was the second book of Kathy Reichs that I have read and I couldn't put it down. If you want to be drawn in to your reading this author will do it."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I was on vacation and ran out of reading material on my last day so I &quot;picked up&quot; Kathleen Reichs Death DuJour at the bookstore. What a delight. This was like reading one of the original and better Patricia Cornwell books (before some of her more recent disappointing scriptures). I had not read anything of Ms. Reichs, but will be ordering some on Amazon for the future. The characters are good, the story detailed and interesting and the book a real winner."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Kathy Reichs is definitely an author that bears watching. She has succeeded in writing an absolutely wonderful follow-up to her first novel Deja Dead. In fact, it could be said that this novel is actually better.I found the storyline absolutely riveting and I was hanging on every word as the plot unfolded. The novel contains fascinating details regarding forensic anthropology and entymology that are actually quite interesting. As well, the antagonist is much more insidious and inherently more evil than in Reichs' first novel.The only slight drawbacks are the passages dealing with forensic detail. Although very interesting, at times the reader feels as if they are in a college classroom listening to a lecture. In addition, the entire plot centers around a coincidence so completely unrealistic that the reader must be willing to suspend disbelief for the last few chapters of the novel. However, these are very minor flaws in an otherwise very enjoyable novel. This one is a definite keeper."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I really like Reich's style. The fact that she's a real life forensic anthropoligist gives great credence to her work. I've read all 3 of her books and each is just as interesting as the previous.I hope to read more about her undercover friend in future publications. Just like Kay Scarpetta, she needs a social life!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This was a fantastic book! I have read Kathy Reicht's previous novel &quot;Deja Dead&quot;, and I wasn't overly impressed. She seems to really have improved her writing style since her first book. This story is full of suspense, and you feel like you're experiencing everything that Tempe is experiencing. The characters are very real and her attention to detail was good. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery. I had trouble putting it down! Can't wait to read her next book!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Dr. Kathy Reichs has certainly grabbed my attention with this novel and the previous &quot;Deja Dead&quot;. In part she writes about her fascinating world of forensic anthropology. And Reichs can make it even better by telling the story of her protagonist's role and the other people she is involved with to solve these horrific murders. Last year I refused to read her books. I was too chicken to read what I thought would be a lot of blood, gore and sensationalism. Here I am this year recommending her books. There is a geographical coincidence in this story which I find hard to believe, but I enjoyed the story so much, I ignored that part. So if you like Patricia Cornwell (I don't) try Reichs anyway. Much more humanistic in many ways."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I really enjoyed Dead du Jour. It's a classic multi-murder mystery with a smart, interesting female protagonist. Brennan is a forensic anthropologist who is a professor in North Carolina and who works for the police in Canada. The setting changes between Canada and North Carolina, which gives a nice variety of outside influences on the plot (ice storms in Canada, a swampy monkey island in NC). There is a love angle between Brennan and a Canadian detective, Ryan (Will they or won't they?!) There is an interesting subplot about the bones of a nun that the Church wants Brennan to dig up and analyze. If you read the first novel in the Brennan series, you will certainly like this novel--it's even better. Brennan gets along with people better in this novel, there is the love interest with Ryan, and the annoying Claudel from the first novel is barely in this story. After reading this book, you'll want to go and get the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"A friend passed Deja Dead along to me a few months back, and I have been anxiously awaiting this 2nd book ever since. I am happy to say I wasn't disappointed. I started it on my lunch hour and finished it in the wee hours of the morning. Kathy Reichs is one of the best new authors that I have read in a long time and I hope that she has many more Dr. Brennan books yet to come."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I had seen Reich's first book but had not read it. However when I came across this one I decided to try it. What a pleasure!! Everything came to a halt while I started and finished &quot;Death du jour&quot; in one day. Tempe is an appealing and refreshing heroine and the different strands of the story - a house fire which kills a group of people, the mystery of the possible saint's remains, the odd behaviour of the commune dwellers, the monkey island....... Altogether an excellent read! I dashed out to get &quot;Deja dead&quot; and am now absorbed in that one. May Reichs write long and hard."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I thought Reichs had potential with Deja Dead, and sure enough her second novel is a big improvement. If you were disappointed with P. Cornwell's last book, this is a great alternative. Plus there's a better love interest for the main character. This author will be around for a while!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I won an advanced reading copy of this book and absolutely loved it! Kathy Reichs has been compared to Patricia Cornwall, but I think Reichs is better. There were several mysteries within the one book and all were totally unpredictable. The main character's job (which is apparently the same as Reich's) sounds absolutely fascinating. Totally recommend this book! I've gone back and found her first one too and can't wait to read it."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Death Du Jour has all the elements that made the first story so interesting and is less bogged down in some of the details of Montreal which made Deja Dead a little hard to read. This story flows. Ryan is back and hotter than ever and even Claudel shows up briefly to make me smile."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"In a church graveyard, Montreal forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance Brennan diligently digs up the remains of a nun who died in 1888. The church plans to bestow sainthood on Sister Elisabeth Nicolet. However, the marked site fails to contain the sister''s bones as for some mysterious reason they were moved to another locale. When she finds the remains, Tempe begins to feel that the good nun succumbed to foul play.At the same time, modern deaths due to arson and a teaching assistant disappearance have Tempe overworked. Still, the Tarheel native plows ahead to solve the century old mystery of Sister Elisabeth while helping with the current case load even as it draws her back to Beaufort, North Carolina.DEATH DU JOUR, the second Tempe tale, is as terrific as the award winning debut novel (see DEJA DEAD). Tempe remains a serene, warm (in spite of her always being cold) character and the support cast adds Canadian and Carolinian depths to the crisp story line. The subplots cleverly merge together, but it is Kathy Reich's' ability to describe in depth forensic tools and results (autopsies, etc.) without goring the reader with plot drifting that makes this work a winner. Instead, these graphic passages augment the entertaining tale with a ring of authenticity. Sub-genre fans will demand more Tempe tales.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Kathy Reichs uses too much narrative for my taste. The main character, Tempe Brennan, is not particularly likeable and it is not clear why she chooses to do some of the things she does. For instance, what was the point of the &quot;mugging&quot;? Why didn't she at least tell Ryan about it? Maybe I would understand had I finished the book. I feel betrayed by her weaving me into her life and then killing her cat. I am not an activist but I don't understand a writer who feels he/she needs to kill an animal for what? Shock effect? I understood the reason for the other deaths - even the babies - which were remote and had some purpose to the plot. But to make the reader feel warmth and love for Birdie, through her writing in both books, and then kill him? I didn't feel it worth my time to finish the book. Nor will I read another of hers."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I always enjoy Kathy Reichs books. The forensic parts are amazing to me and I particularly like her realtionships with her sister, her daughter, her cat, and most of all Ryan.The mystery part kept me on the edge of my seat. Because I do know something about cults, I found the plot to be right on--even though I was hoping things might turn out a bit differently.It's always great to read one of these books when Reichs is describing winter in Canada.Because the heroine of my books is also named Tempe, I feel very close to Tempe Brennan.Marilyn Meredith, author of the Deputy Tempe Crabtree series, the latest being Wingbeat."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"In book two of the Kathy Reichs series involving Temperance Brennan, Tempe finds herself with dead bodies on two continents. Upon examination, she begins to find unusual similarities that link these deaths. But how can the victims be so far apart and yet somehow be related? What evil force is at work here and who can stop it? And how is a nun's missing niece tied to the destruction? To top it all off, her eccentric sister from Texas has gone missing in Canada in her quest to \\"find herself.\\" Tempe must deal with whether some evil has touched her sister or whether this is just another installment of her sister's flaky personality.The murders in this book follow Tempe from Montreal to the Carolinas in too far fetched a pattern. Wherever this woman travels, bodies pop up that no one but her can possibly deal with. As an anthropologist it is logical that she would find herself dealing with skeletal remains, but it is completely unbelievable to find that as she travels between her two homes that the bodies keep piling up and no one else is available to conduct the investigation.Again Tempe is a heroine that is difficult to like. When asked to assist with the deaths she whines internally about how she had other plans and really doesn't want to be bothered. When she finally relents, she has trouble associating the clues that she sees. There are terrible lines illustrating this such as \\"that kindled something...in my memory cells, but when I tried to bring it up the spark went out.\\" Another: \\"The mental itch was back. What was it? Why couldn't I bring it to the surface?\\" Yet 100 pages later she is magically pulling it all together and making extrodinary leaps and bounds toward solving the crimes of the century.This is my second attempt at Kathy Reichs. I already own the next two books in the series, so I will read them eventually, but it seems as though this set of novels is a huge disappointment with ridiculous plots and an unlikable heroine."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This book was boring and poorly written. The plot was weak and obvious, but worse than that, the writing was simplistic and choppy- very hard to read. I always finish books that I start and this one I almost put down. I only finished it, by skimming because the reading was so choppy, because I had already bought it and couldn't return it. No character development, no characterization of the characters at all, and the dialogue is flat and boring and only serves to advance plot. Descriptions don't describe-they tell in short sentances, or they lecture. I'm a scientist and I found this book boring and annoying!This is my second Reichs novel. The other was better, but I won't be coming back. Save your money and your time!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Cults and Canada... I should've loved this. But it was hard to get into (though reading with the cricket on TV or with music on probably wasn't a good idea). I also didn't quite understand the business of exhuming a dead nun in relation to the cults. Still, Dr Temperance Brennan, forensic anthropologist, is a character to follow. But I'm hoping that she stays in Canada, and doesn't duck out to the US again. I'm bored with American settings. (B+)"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"In reading Kathy Reichs first book, I understood that this being a first effort, it was still an excellent book. With Death Du Jour, Ms. Reichs' starts to strut her stuff. The author had me hanging on to every page. Ms. Reichs moves her characters smoothly along with a very good and tight plot. Her character development is great, giving you little peeks into their private lives. The author doesn't bore you with a lot of medical or personal details, just enough to help the reader understand what is happening and why. Ms. Reichs is obviously a very intelligent person, but smart enough not to put her readers to sleep with her knowledge. I look forward to reading more about her heroine, Tempe Brennan and the rest of the characters. All of which, are very interesting and fun to read about. I highly recommend this series to any one who enjoys a good book."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I got this book for pennies used from the library. I really enjoy the T.V. series bones based on this series of books. This book starts out pretty interesting. The author did have a few of those moments where she over explains things and makes the book drag on as if just filling the pages with words to fill the pages and I had to start carefully skipping several paragraphs to avoid the boredom. Good reading mostly until she seemed to just slap an ending on the reader that just did not seem to fit very well. I agree with the other reveiws stating book starts out good and then drops off and becomes less interesting. This is the first Kathy Reichs book i have read. I think her editor has let her down on this one as he/she should have caught it. But I guess they are just in it for the money ?"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This book went more in depth with the character of Tempe Brennan. It allowed the reader to see and feel the murders through Tempe's eyes and to understand that she is not a cold, unfeeling character, rather she intensely feels for each of the victims in the crimes she is working on."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This author is so much fun to read. She write so well that it doesn't take much to lose yourself in the story."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Damn, I purchased the series but can't seem to get into them. Boring character and I was so prepared to love her."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Right from the start I was kept in suspense and I just could not put it down , very well written"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I expected more from this novel. I read the first book in the series and really enjoyed it. Even though I am not a fan of the TV show Bones, I wanted to give the author a fair shot.I was actually somewhat bored while reading the book. It seemed to me that Ms Reichs video taped her idea for a book. The she sat down in front of her word processor and typed, literally, everything she saw or heard on the video tape. Far too much superfluous information to maintain my interest.I also felt the storyline was disjointed. Yes, she does bring it all together in the last 50 pages, but the individual plot lines were too far askew. Had the different storyline been better written, it might have scored 4.5 stars. To me, this is a less than skilled attempt at a novel. My wife has read all of her books and enjoyed them. I will give Ms Reichs the benefit of the doubt and read another."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This is the first mystery novel I've read, an I really enjoyed it.

I find Ms. Reich's complex plots with all their twists and turns undaunting, and in fact, much more enjoyable than some of the other writers in this genre that seem to apply a cookie cutter approach to their prose. I especially like that Tempe is well rounded and that as readers, we have a better understanding of this character because of the writer's penchant for detail. Whether it be as an anthropologist, or as a woman, this character is fully drawn and very compelling. Because of this, I can forgive some of the author's unrealistic circumstances into which Tempe often falls prey. The growing relationship between her and Rayan is well developed. I doubt, however, that there is any sort of smooth ride ahead for these two. I'm about to start #3, and I can't wait!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I am a forensic mystery junkie. Love Scarpetta and Lincoln Rhymes, never miss CSI, and am fast becoming a fan of forensic anthropologist Tempe Brennan. Death du Jour is the second book in this series. The characterization of Tempe is fleshed out a bit more in this book, as we learn more of her personal life. We meet her sister Harry, her daughter Katy is a bit more visible and Tempe looks to have a love interest. But the main draw is the forensics, and we get a lot of it in this book. Flies, pupua, beetles, bones, entrance and exit wounds, etc., etc., it is laid on in almost every chapter. Although the cult storyline is a little far fetched, I read this book in one sitting, longing to have all the connections tied up. Looking forward to the next case, Deadly Decisions."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"In the vacuum left by a diminishing Kay Scarpetta came Temperance Brennan. With &quot;Deja Dead&quot;, I thought I'd found a replacement. Certainly &quot;Death du Jour&quot; began well: I enjoyed the writing--interesting characters and wonderfully evocative and detailed description. I curled up on the couch and turned myself over to a pleasurable reading experience. And it almost was...until the last quarter of the book. When Tempe's (whoever dreamed up that name?) sister becomes a part of the cult, and the unrelated threads all begin to be braided together in one unbelievable coincidence which spans Canada, the Carolina, Texas, and Belgium, and when the description of the final rescue bogged down in unnecessary detail--then I found myself dozing off and hoping that the book would be over. After all, I reasoned, I'd read 350 pages, and I could make it through another 100.But I sure was bored and fed up with the superficiality of the plot and innundated with biological and anthropological data. I'm glad the weekend is over! I can only wave two stars."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I was riveted to this book and really picking up speed until I reached about dead center of the book. Then POW! Ms. Reichs throws ridiculous, implausable coincidences to salvage her complex plot. I was really in there with her until her ridiculous plot links. This a mystery that detectives must dream of. I call it the &quot;follow the dots&quot; scheme that result in a staight line honing in on a places the heroine just happens to be even if they are literally a thousand miles apart. Thus I hurled the book into the air, it fell to earth I care not where!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"While &quot;D&eacute;j&agrave; Dead&quot; was okay, &quot;Death Du Jour&quot; was definitely in another class.

I had to drag myself away from the book and when I arrived back home, I started reading again almost before I'd closed the door.It's been some time since I've read a book that equals &quot;Death Du Jour&quot; in suspense. The pages turned quickly and while, admittedly, coincidences kept piling up it didn't diminish my reading pleasure.I am subtracting one star for the gruesome murder descriptions. But that may be my problem as I read one of those while having breakfast ...Ms. Reichs, keep 'em coming, I can't wait !"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Though I enjoyed &quot;Death du Jour&quot; more than Patricia Cornwell's latest (pathetic) effort, I think I've reached saturation point when it comes to reading long descriptions of autopsies... I'm starting to wonder if &quot;Hannibal&quot;'s pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance scene isn't a case of Thomas Harris poking fun at Cornwell and Reichs.On a personal note, a friend died in the Solar Temple mass suicide and I found Reichs' treatment (or rather, perhaps, rip-off of that event) painfully superficial.In &quot;D&eacute;j&agrave; Dead&quot;, she showed she could write better than Cornwell, while fairly obviously appropriating all Cornwell's &quot;raw materials&quot; (just as Cornwell had appropriated all Thomas Harris'), but &quot;Death du Jour&quot; looks like Reichs only had one book in her.Time for a new &quot;genre&quot; I think."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I really enjoyed Deja Dead. Death Du Jour however seemed to be forced, frenetic, and padded. I felt there were a hundred pages in the middle that were rather experimental in style. Does the author gain some personal redemption discussing for a page why she did not spend the evening with her x-husband. Do we need all of the cliched discussion of the south and draped Spanish moss ending in probably one of the worst sentences to be published this year: \\"The tide of time itself ebbs tardily to the eternal sea\\"? (p. 170). This is not the dialog of a forensic anthropologist.Hey, I am not a professional critic. I have never read Patricia Cornwell. I eagerly await another tale of forensic sleuthing from Kathy Reichs who I'm sure has a great story to tell. Now just tell it!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I really enjoyed Deja Dead, Kathy Reich's first novel, and thought it was better than anything Patricia Cornwell had done in a while. But in this book, the plotting is just lazy. Brennan finds bodies related to her case while on an outing, the cases just happen to have ties near each of her homes-- Montreal and Charlotte, NC, someone from one case asks her help in finding someone and THEY also are part of her other case... and I thought it was bad when in the Robert Tannenbaum books, Butch and Marlene's cases are tied together coincidentally! At least they are only dealing with Manhattan, not half the Northern Hemisphere! This is like the Hardy Boys finding out they are really working on their dad's case, but at least Bayport is a small town.Especially irritating is the way information is withheld from the reader, while every chapter ends with Brennan's jaw dropping, her shivering in horror, or giving us foreboding that something bad is about to happen. Really? I think we expect that in a THRILLER!Also, the parallels with Cornwell are too much to ignore. Scarpetta's niece is an FBI trainee, Brennan's daughter wants to be a profiler (just how many of those ARE there, anyway?). Both have hot and cold relationships with cops. Maybe this was rushed because of the debut's success."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This book really gripped me. I was on the edge of my seat, biting my nails (as she picked at her's). This offering is one that I could not wait to finish and it left me anxiously awaiting her next book. Much better than anything Cromwell has done so far."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"As I think has been pretty adequately stated in the other reviews, this book has a really annoying trend of making every character who walks across the page end up being involved in the crime. That suspension bridge of disbelief shook and crashed about the time that we figure out that her relative from another state is also involved. I think that this device was meant to highlight the frightening nature of cults, but instead it just makes the reader think that Reichs doesn't know how to write a plot.On the other hand, she clearly knows forensic medicine, and is a good enough writer to bring forward information about that career in a way that interests the reader. I also think that if you gave Temperance a halfway decent plot, I might even like her as a character. The trouble is that when everything around her is so contrived, it's hard to care about her as a person.I hope in her next book she takes some of her obvious talent and aims it at the plot."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Has some merit - but only in the serious bits that analyse bodies and chemicals etc. The rest is a lot of old tosh.Why do American writers have to fill their books with inane and pointless descriptions of the dinners they are cooking and eating; or the wonderful coffees they are drinking? Here are just two examples from this little book:Chapter 12: \\"I scrubbed two potatoes and put them in the toaster oven, then washed lettuce, tomatoes.....etc....\\"Chapter 27: \\"I went onto the patio and snipped off basil and chives. Then I cut chunks of cheese,. took two eggs...etc ...etc\\"Do I give a fig about what this silly writer likes to eat? Answer = No I bloody well dont.The book is thoroughly punctuated with food commentary like this - it is so American - the thought that the reader must be reminded of the lovely grub that exists in the world - to help them read right to the very end. These culinary diatribes are literature's \\"comfort breaks\\" - Oh My Gawd.....it is pathetic.As the killer creeps into the house with a dagger - we are reminded that our heroine likes bagels and cream cheese take-outs....No British writer would dumb down in this way....to bring the kitchen sink (as well as \\"Joe's Amazing Pizza Parlour\\" or \\"Eddie's Awesome Ice-cream Emporium\\") into the exciting drama of death and destruction.It is very banal and trivialises the story.Even the one sex scene read like painting by numbers instructions: he put his hand there - she put her palm there - and his tongue did this.....etc..... then he cocked up his leg and gave out a gasp - and she cocked up her leg and gave out a sigh.Oh - Pell-eeezeI did not like this silly book and I will not be reading any more KR offerings....and her choice of food was dull as well.So American - bland, bland, bland - with fries on the side and mayo too."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I have not read any of the authors other titles but I decided to try this from the good reviews. I felt that it lacked pace until the last quarter of the book and found myself skimming through pages just to find something of relevance to the plot.

Really quite dull in my opinion."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I recently reviewed Kathy Reichs' first book and thought it was bad, very bad actually. But because Kay Scarpetta's new one wasn't out yet, I read this one. Again we see our heroine Tempest going through a load of cases, connecting them and saving them. Cool. What Mrs. Reich did better this time: the case is more believable than in the first book. But still: the character is pretty flat, the relationship of the protagonists is way off the standard we came to love with Patricia Cornwell, especially Mother &amp; Daugther. BTW: I knew before I opened the book that Tempest would get a kick over the head after leaving a something. And, yessss for three points, she did. I fought through to the end and then threw the book around the room because I hated myself for reading that far.

Books do not need all that to make a good story, it is very distracting"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I have decided to read the Tempe Brennan novels in order. The first in the series, \\"Deja Dead\\" was quite disappointing. Even after getting over the VAST differences between the TV and novel versions of Tempe, the book was unevenly written, tedious through the middle third, and predictable all the way to the end (almost from the start). In this book, Ms. Reichs seems to be hitting her stride.Although Tempe is still excessively emotional for my taste, in this book she \\"plays by the rules\\" and doesn't go off and do the \\"stupid\\" stuff that she does in the first book. Additionally, the character of Detective Andy Ryan (the \\"Booth\\" character, for \\"Bones\\" fans) is much more fleshed out, and the love/hate relationship between them begins. There is a lot more forensic science in this book, and much less tedious \\"case work\\". We are introduced to an entemologist and social psychologist who add their expertise to the scientific mix. The story is fast-paced throughout, and I was unable to put it down for the last third of the book.I DO have agree with some other reviewers that there is a bit too much coincidence driving the story line. There are three independent story lines: a house fire in Montreal, bodies discovered in North Carolina, and a visit by her sister that have a little too much in common to be completely believable (I'm being intentionally vague so as not to ruin the story for those who have not read it). Everything ties up nicely (if a bit predictably) in the end, but a lot of that is because of Tempe being in just the right place at the just right time. There is a completely independent \\"historical\\" mystery running parallel to the primary story that is interesting in it's own way, but ultimately not really needed.All and all, though, this was a very enjoyable read, and I am anxiously looking forward to the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"A suspenseful story with details that enriched my understanding of forensic anthropology. Unfortunately, it is just too much of a coincidence for Dr. Brennan to have discovered bodies in two countries that just happen to be related to the cult her sister just joined. I don't think I'm spoiling anything by revealing that to you because after the third chapter any mystery reader of average intelligence will come to the same conclusion. It's a little irritating how Brennan keeps stating that something is niggling at the edges of her brain, but she can't put her finger on it. I was like, \\"Duh, your sister's in the cult.\\" Seriously, it's pretty obvious. I'm not sure whether we're meant to pick up on it, but both my husband and I did.I still enjoyed reading the book, even though I pretty much knew what was going to happen. Brennan is a sympathetic character most of the time, and her developing romance with Ryan is worth continuing to read the series for."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"The second book in the series was wonderful, somehow it was even better than the first which I found to be a bit long and overly wordy ( yet enjoyable never the less) this left me hungry for more, what better in a continuing story line than a hook line and sinker type of feeling, reading \\"Death du Jour\\" made me crave the next book right away. I almost never read a series one after another, I give myself a break because it's always better to crave the next than get stuck in a similar story and feel like I'm reading an eight hundred page book. That said I can't recommend Kathy Reichs enough, she knows what she's talking about and she engages the reader rather than making me feel like I'm standing on the site and observing, I couldn't wait for a free moment to sit and read, on the train, during lunch, before bed, you get the gist...Its winter time and Temperance finds herself working on a misplaced nun coffin, along the way she gets called to examine the victims of a fire, this of course is no ordinary accident, what fire victims after all have execution style bullet wounds in their head? Clues from her work place and a nearby university reveal that something foul is going on, as usual Tempe gets mixed up into a situation that puts her life in danger, her character is so well written that the reader feels her victories and her falls with great flair. I loved solving the mystery alongside of her, tracking strange disappearances and wondering what happened to the mutilated bodies, traveling and picking up clues and forming opinions of a bunch of zany characters, for those who love gristly deaths, mystery, clues, realistic characters and engaging dialogue this is a real treasure, I hope this series has thirty books in it by the time she's done because deep down I want to read them all. I liked the realistic element of danger, in the previous book her close friend meets with a deadly end so you never know when someone is going to exit the story, it keeps you on your toes! I also enjoyed the bit of romance developing, it made things a bit more interesting, and trust me, it's not nauseating, it adds to the depth of the book. This was another nice read from Reichs and I can't wait to dig right back in.- Kasia S."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Let me preface my review by stating that this is my first Kathy Reichs book. It will most likely be my last. I felt as though I was reading a CSI book written by Tom Clancy - way too technical. However, that may be the audience for which she is writing.The first 2/3rds of the book was dull, slow, boring and disconnected. As Ms. Reichs builds to the climatic end, I felt as though it suddenly jumped to 120 mph which did not lend itself the ability for the reader to get a mind picture of what was happening.If you like technical writings (sometimes even in foreign languages), this is the book for you. If you are looking for an entertaining mystery to read, I would suggest you look else where."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This book was written much better than her first. When you get towards the middle of the story it was hard to put down."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Death du jour is the second book in this series and begins in Montreal with Dr. Tempe Brennan, forensic anthropologist, searching for the remains of a Catholic nun who is being nominated for sainthood. The investigation is continued as a side thread throughout the book, a nice subplot to help Tempe pass the time. We are quickly introduced to the main plot: what is the connection between the deaths of several adults and babies in a rural Canadian farmhouse fire, and the bodies discovered on a secluded monkey research island in South Carolina? Tempe returns \\"home\\" to North Carolina, leaving her sister Harry in Montreal at a self-enlightenment seminar. Harry brings considerable angst to Tempe throughout the rest of the book. I enjoyed the virtual tour of Charlotte, North Carolina, having been there recently, but it didn't seem as detailed as Reich's descriptions of Montreal.The main plot brings Montreal detective Andrew Ryan to Tempe's turf in the Carolina's, where things heat up between them with a moderately graphic make-out scene. I enjoyed meeting Tempe's ex-husband in this book, and spending more time with her college-aged daughter. I love learning new things when I read fiction, and this installment of the Tempe Brennan series teaches the reader about the lifecycles of the flies and beetles that flock to a dead body. We also learn about life in Montreal in the late 1800s during a smallpox outbreak. Of more relevance to the main plot, Kathy Reichs puts forth theories about the formation of cults and their techniques for attracting and retaining members. Following the pattern in the first book, the action is just approaching climax when Tempe is injured and the book wraps up with a stilted question and answer session. Overall, I would say I enjoyed the first book, Deja Dead, more than this book, but I'm not yet discouraged and look forward to picking up the next tome.--Lynellen.com"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"The story dragged on and didn't get going until late in the game, loved Deja dead, Death Du Jour, but this one didn't work for me."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Meet Tempe Brennan--she is a forensic anthropologist who divides her time professionally between Quebec, Canada and Charlotte, NC.

The crimes are recent, the perpetrators frightening, and the suspense gripping. But the main characters are likeable and much less tortured than Cornwell's protagonists. Kathy Reichs, herself a forensic anthropologist with a boatload of credentials, offers up plenty of technical detail about the nitty gritty of forensic work, interesting settings in Montreal and North Carolina, a dose of religious fanaticism, and a character who is easy to identify with and root for. This isn't great literature, but it's a pretty good way to spend an afternoon."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This is my second book by Kathleen Reichs after Deadly Decisions.I could not enjoy any of them because the author cannot focus on a single subject. It is difficult to establish what she intends to do when she writes, first Temperance unearths a nun corpse while paying a service to a church, then she suddenly switches and is summoned to investigate the bodies of an old lady and two babies found murdered in a house located in a frosted area of northern Canada, then she flies down to an island full of wild animals in North Carolina and another dead body appears, finally she brushes with a cult.Reichs opens many roads she does not travel at all, and the main idea seems to make a contrived connection between the bodies found in Canada and North Carolina, besides no interesting characters appearOn the other hand, &#65533;Death du Jour&#65533; features a neat prose and very interesting is the way Temperance Brennan through the author forensic experience proceeds to survey the corpses in order to establish their gender and age based on findings in the shapes and scars of the bones, these sections of the book will delight science fans, but that is all that is worth of merit"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"For the first 25 pages I was enthralled by the writing and the forensics. Then the coincidences piled up: 1. In Quebec, Tempe investigates the fiery death of a family (later found to be killed by a quasi-religious cult.) 2. In a totally separate storyline, Tempe is asked by a nun acquaintance to find the nun's missing niece ... who JUST HAPPENS to have links to the first murder. 3. Weeks later, Tempe's relaxing on an island off the Carolina coast when she JUST HAPPENS to discover the buried bodies of two murdered women. Guess what? This new crime JUST HAPPENS to be related to those murders way up north in Quebec. 4. Tempe's troubled sister, living in ANOTHER state, JUST HAPPENS to have recently joined the same murderous cult responsible for all these murders! Tempe doesn't have to pursue the investigation -- the clues just come flying to her from points all over North America. I am amazed that so many self-described mystery buffs do not even comment on these faults in their reviews. Did they not notice them? Or are they so dazzled by the forensic details (which are indeed excellent)that they forgot the basics of a believable plot?"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"A different kind of professional female sleuth with the feel of non-fiction fiction. The author is a real-life forensic anthropologist for the State of North Carolina, and is also a professor at The University of North Carolina. The author's character has been divorced, has a 'wacky' sister and a grown-up daughter,is working for the Province of Quebec and teaches at university as well. Dr. Temperance Brennan, the first person narrator, has co-workers who hate her and a male detective who irritates and attracts her. Real excitement is constantly being created because the distractions caused by her personal life interfere with her sleuthing, which the reader can figure out by a few minutes. Despite the University credentials of both character and author, the book is very readable and fast. If bone science doesn't give you the creeps, I suggest taking this book with you on summer vacation. (There is a lot of snowing in the book,a mental boost if the sun is getting too much.)"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I bought the author's 1st book, Deja Dead, because I was glad to have found another female medical examiner protagonist similar to Cornwell's Dr. Scarpetta. Still, Deja Dead (Reichs' 1st novel) wasn't as good as when Cornwell is at her, now, occasional best. Death Du Jour, being another Dr. Brennan novel, was a very welcome sight. Then after reading Death Du Jour you see there is a definite improvement over Deja Dead. Reich's story telling skills have improved considerably; now the author really communicates with, and grabs, the reader - she keeps the book moving. I read so many books and not many lately have kept my attention as this one has. If you were iffy with Deja Dead give it another chance with this book.My only gripe is her wacky sister. Not only was there absolutely no need for her but she took something away from the story and the main character. They are way too different and not believable at all. But not for the sister's appearance I would have rated it 5 stars.I'll anxiously await and will buy Reichs next book (new character or not) when it comes out. I hope the author doesn't feel the need to constantly inject family members into her story as Cornwell has done; ruining many storylines by focusing on the neice (a consensus among all my reader friends). We all want to read about the character and her unique professional encounters not her relatives.Congratulations to Ms. Reich on an excellent and intelligent read."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Generally I do not read a lot of narrative prose, but when I do my preferred genre is the murder mystery. My friend Mo recommended Kathy Reichs' Death du Jour to me because of my interest in the sciences and anthropology. I have to admit the book sat on my shelf for about 3 months before I finally got around to examining even the cover, but when I did the author's professional credentials engaged my attention. Dr Reichs is a forensic anthropologist trained at Northwestern University and employed by both the state of North Carolina and the Province of Quebec as an expert in forensics and by the University of North Carolina as a professor of anthropology. Her expertise is definitely reflected in the content of the novel. After reading the first few lines of the book I was hooked. So much was this the case that I finished it in the space of a single afternoon.Each of the characters is a real person with a distinct personality. The heroine Tempe, a forensic anthropologist--who is much as I imagine Dr. Reichs to be herself--is clearly defined as an individual. She has a past and a present and family relationships and problems much as we all do. Her sister Harry is not simply a carbon copy of the heroine. She too is an individual.The mise en scene of the action in both Quebec and North Carolina are vividly recreated for the reader. One can almost feel the damp bone-chilling cold of a Canadian winter and the balmy days of a southeastern coastline. Incorporating the little details of activity such as specific restaurants eaten at and things ordered there, specifics of the medical examiners' offices in Montreal and how the character proceeds with her work there add verisimilitude to the narrative. It is abundantly apparent that the author knows her setting and her topic with the thoroughness of the professional participant as opposed to the diligent journalist. To a certain extent, there is a rather more graphic description of each of the deceased than in many mysteries that I've read with a similar format, but there is no attempt to make the subject particularly sensational, just very, very real.Dr. Reichs' writing style is engaging and carries the reader along swiftly. The central characters are likable and human, much as those of Rita Mae Brown who's mysteries I tend to read just to &quot;visit&quot; old friends. Dialogue is realistic and is not gratuitous and designed to fill space but forwards the story well. Furthermore, it is well tailored to each of the individual characters, contributing to their three dimensional quality. Their mannerisms in speaking, their use of dialect all create a sense of &quot;real people.&quot; The rhythm of the words encourages the reader to keep moving smoothly to the denouement.My one and only complaint would be that the conclusion of the story of Sister Elisabeth Nicolet, the threads of whose history is woven through the main theme, is not quite as interesting as it might have been and leaves one feeling rather more distracted than entertained.Certainly a mystery worth reading. If nothing else, you'll learn a lot about what forensics."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Deja Dead, i dont think, was quite the thriller everyone made it out to be. It was good, yeah, probably meriting about four stars, but it was not THAT good. It wasn't as good as debut as Boston Teran's, Minette Walters', Patricia Cornwell's. However, with this second novel, she really packs a punch.The chill of the canadian weather really pervades the story, working its way into the writing and feeling of the story. It is brilliantly evoked, and works well with the nature of the book itself.Being a huge Cornwell fan, i have to say that i do believe Tempe to be better company. She is less driven (some would not take this as a plus) she is more well rounded, and she is a bit more interesting. Her relationship with Ryan develops well and interestingly.The plot is a cracker. Which is something Reichs is excellent at. All of her books from here on in have absolutely fantastic plots. Deadly Decisions has a great plot, but is still a weak book, but Fatal Voyage has an absolute stunner of a plot. Grave Secrets, her next, looks to have one as well.While this plot is not quite as good as that of Fatal Voyage, it nearly is. It is intriguing, exciting, haunting, complex. If anything, too complex. (That is the thing Deadly Decisions suffered from.) The conclusion is great.A cast of great characters, some great writing, a great atmopshere, great forensic detail, and a brilliant plot make this book well worth a read."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"After the disappointment of Patricia Cornwall's latest books, I've greatly enjoyed Kathy Reichs new series, which features Tempe Brennan, a forensic anthropologist based in Montreal and Charlotte. In this book, Charlotte and other parts of North Carolina are much more central to the story than in Reichs' earlier Deja Dead.The plot is entertaining and you'll learn a few things along the way that you probably didn't really want to know about maggot life cycles.Although I found Death du Jour not quite as terrifying as Deja Dead, it's a definite page turner. Recommended for the non-squeamish...but don't read it when you're home alone."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Bought myself a Christmass gift... What a great gift it was! I truly know my taste... If you loved D&eacute;j&agrave; dead, you'll love Death du jour. Same style, another great story with Tempe Brennan. These books are not to become classics of course but they are great as evening or weekend relax reading session... Dr. Reichs always grabs me with her descriptions of forensic work. You see a professionnal describing her job. She shares through Brennan her love/hate of that difficult task. I loved that story. I'm from Montreal, one of the city where she works and reading these storys put me right inside them. Wonder if I didn't see Brennan and Ryan fighting to make it through the bad weather while I was working during the ice storm... Of course beeing from Montreal, or Charlotte for that matter, you cannot but be pulled into the story in a way no other people can. But if you live outside those cities, I still recommend Death du jour. Good plot, very well witten with just enough suspense and insight to make this book another page turner. I read it in two days. That is bad. Now I'm waiting for the next one..."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This is more like it.I admit to being somewhat disappointed with Kathy Reichs' first foray into the medical thriller and couldn't really see much which differentiated her heorine, Dr. Tempe Brennan, from Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta.Brennan's second appearance in this book is vastly better and Reichs has crafted an interesting and gripping thriller with an interesting storyline, great plot twists and sufficient technical detail to keep the reader interested. Once again, I am thrilled to see a mainstream author using a Canadian city - Montreal - as a backdrop. In this case, Dr. Brennan is faced with a number of apparently unrelated murders which eventually lead her into the paths of a strange cult - shades of Quebec's Solar Temple cult. Reichs has clearly spent a lot of time gathering details on these sorts of organisations which, when combined with her medical and anthropological knowledge, create a wonderfully detailed storyline.Tempe Brennan is clearly becoming a character in her own right and I can only hope that Kathy Reichs continues to develop these interesting and unique storylines for her books. Admittedly, there will always be comparisons with Patricia Cornwell but this book clearly shows that Reichs is now establishing her own form and doing so quite successfully. This will never be considered great literature but nontheless, it is a highly readable and highly recommended thriller."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"After her explosive entry into the thriller arena, Kathy Reichs slowed down a bit with this, her second foray into the life of forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan. The plot is not as taut, the writing not as spare, and the characters less finely drawn than in her debut novel, &quot;Deja Dead.&quot; Nevertheless, this is still a fun, fast read. If not as suspenseful as the first book, it still weaves a scary tale of a shady cult whose members, including infants, keep turning up dead.Temperance is a fascinating character and a welcome change from her fictional counterpart, Kay Scarpetta. Unlike Scarpetta, however, Temperance (Tempe), whose duties include teaching at the university level, is fond of lecturing. In Book 1, there was a highly technical and interesting discussion of all the different cuts that can be made to human bones, and why their differences matter. In this book, there is an informative but truly nauseating discussion of maggots and blowflies and their lifecycles on human cadavers. Strong stuff; not really necessary to the plot, but hey, I'll never look at a fly in the same way again.The problem with this book is that, at this early stage in the series at least, Reichs seems very uncomfortable with the human side of her characters. She can write about maggots devouring dead human flesh for pages at a time, but give her a love scene and she falls apart. Her stilted description of a sexy encounter between Tempe and her &quot;partner in crime,&quot; hunky police detective Andy Ryan, had me laughing aloud--not the intended response. Equally unbelievable are Reichs' descriptions of Tempe's flighty sister Harry, and Harry's son Kit.That having been said, I still strongly recommend this book as a good, fast-paced read, and a welcome addition to the crime genre. I'm more than willing to let Reichs get her sea legs, especially when I can also enjoy vivid descriptions of Montreal during a brutal winter, and North Carolina at its balmy best."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Anyone who has read Kathy Reichs can see her hitting her stride as an author. Her main character, Tempe Brennan, splits her time between the Laboratoire de Medicine Legale de Montreal (and my french never sounded better!) and the University of North Carolina - Charlotte. Though a forensic anthropologist, the obvious comparisons to Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta are almost inevitable. But, to my mind of late, Tempe brings much more to the table. She is not as whiney as our Kay and the secondary charcaters are much more believable and founded in reality than the stereotypes who support Dr. Kay these days.This novel runs parallel plots with the excavation of a long dead nun who is up for beatification, an arson induced house fire, and the disappearance of a college assistant, that takes Tempe from Montreal to the Carolinas. This all leads her to the pursuit of a cult and, through the course of the novel, gives us some flicker of insight into what can get people to sign up for places like Jonestown. Like her discussions on pathology, Ms. Reichs doesn't use the vast amount of material she has acquired about cults to shock us, but, rather, uses it to move the pace along quite well.We also see more insight into Tempe herself than we did in the first book. We gain (better) insight into her relationship with her sister - both as a sibling and as a rival. And we also get a better focus on her relationship with her daughter. Once the story moves to the Carolina's, we see, dare I say, even a more sexy Tempe. This all makes her character much more believable and maybe much more vulnerable. More like you and me and so we tend (and want) to root for her.So, why not 5 stars? I found the exacavation of the nun fascinating and, quite frankly, was waiting for it to be tied in neatly with the cult. That never came to be. Still, this was a very good read and held my interest through out. The kind of story you read by a roaring fire with a brandy or maybe sitting under an umbrella on the beach. But, if you read it on an island off of South Carolina, you might find yourself looking over your shoulder.

Should have brought in the romance more, I doubt I will read the latest effort."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"To the avid reader, there are few things more disappointing than a good tale poorly told. Regrettably, this is precisely what we have in _Death du Jour_: a potentially gripping plot replete with clumsy writing and more distractions than direction.Reichs has borrowed so heavily from the Patricia Cornwell formula that it is tempting to say that the two authors are indistinguishable. However, that would be to sell both authors a bit short. While it is true Reichs' character, Temperance Brennan, is indistinguishable from Cornwell's Scarpetta in all material aspects, Reichs' prose contains none of the easy, flowing grace that propels readers to the climax of a Cornwell story. This is really a shame, for Reichs has an immense talent (superior to that of Cornwell, by the way) for conceiving of a tale worth telling.The tale told here initially takes the reader down a path that reads like that of the rather dry journal of a forensic anthropologist unearthing the bones of a long-dead religious figure. This introduction, interesting only for its subject matter, reveals the art and science behind forensic recovery efforts. While this is interesting, it is hardly enough to sustain the interest of even the marginally demanding mystery reader. Thankfully, this (as it turns out, irrelevant) introductory jaunt is ended rather quickly as the real plot gets underway.With the help of Andrew Ryan, a similarly dogged and clever Canadian detective, Brennan works the Canadian crime scene of a deadly house fire that leads to a charge of arson and a need to follow clues leading back to a strange commune in the Carolinas. Brennan's seemingly odd dual citizenship becomes instrumental in the unraveling of an intricate mystery involving numerous disappearances and murders. For in the travels between the Laboratoire de M&eacute;dicine L&eacute;gale in Montreal and her home in the Carolinas, Temperance Brennan begins to piece together the clues surrounding the disappearance of several University students and a possible connection with a mysterious cult. Along the way, the duo uncovers colorful characters and interesting plot twists, but the mediocre writing is simply too much of a consistent and genuine distraction in the telling of this otherwise captivating tale.As the story concludes, we learn of all the details behind the murders, as if motivation and critical particulars were an afterthought for the author. This anticlimactic recitation of crucial facts is indicative of the stylistic and structural problems throughout the book. In the end, Reichs simply demands too much of a leap of faith from her readers. There is far too little pay-out for the investment that readers make in taking this ride with her at the helm. It's an investment I'm not likely to make again with this author, and that's a real shame because she does spin a good yarn."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"The product was actually in better condition than described, arrived before the promised delivery date. I will use this bookseller again."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Kathy Reichs, Death du Jour (Arrow, 1999)Death du Jour is the first book I've read in 2003 that made me want to not put it down until I had turned the final page. It's well over twice as long as most of the novels I've read over the course of this year, and yet it took me less time than many of them to get through. It does have its problems, but readability is certainly not one of them.Temperance Brennan, a forensic anthropologist who divides her time between North Carolina and Quebec, is in the latter province as the story opens, sifting through the supposed grave of a nun who is being proposed for beatification. Things don't go as planned. Not long after she gets home, she's called to the scene of a devastating house fire to check out a few more bodies. Things don't go as planned. She gets caught up in the twin mysteries of the nun and the house fire, and off we go.The best thing about the book is its compelling readability. Reichs makes her work unputdownable through throwing clues, monkeywrenches, and events at the reader nonstop from the first chapter till the last. There's never a let-up, no pause for breathing. And this in a novel that tops four hundred pages; it's like making an Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick that runs six hours. Few people are going to try, fewer still will succeed. Reichs manages it well here.The bad thing about the book, and yes, there is one, is its predictability. There are many points in the book where something happens and it's obvious to the reader how the event connects into the whole puzzle, even while it escapes the police, the main character, and everyone else in the novel. When it comes right down to it, the mystery isn't really much of a mystery; it's more a police procedural than anything else. Or it would be if it weren't trying so hard to be a mystery.Still, that's not a reason to dismiss a book that hooks a reader this quickly and this decisively. Death du Jour is the perfect way to kill a weekend, a fast-paced, easy read that will make the hours fly by as you wander through the world of Tempe Brennan. ****"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Having greatly enjoyed &quot;Deja Dead,&quot; I really looked to Death Du Jour. Unfortunately it is a complete disappointment. I found the story overy contrived and coincidental. The characters were wooden. Frankly, the whole thing seemed like a bad movie where no one had the courage to ask &quot;why, this story.&quot; In summary, don't bother with this lousy novel."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"It was a really satisfying read. There are a lot of gruesome details...it helps that the author is a forensic anthropologist herself.I read parts of the book alone at night and made myself scared thinking someone was watching me or going to break into my apartment while I was sleeping. After numerous attempts at trying to read before bed and getting too scared to carry on after a page or two, I finally decided to stick to reading during the daytime.The only things that slowed me down with this story were the French words. I could have done without them, but I guess Reichs was trying to keep things real since part of the book took place in French-speaking Canadian cities.I really enjoyed the chemistry between Tempe and Detective Ryan. I'm anxious to see that relationship develop throughout the rest of the series which I will be reading."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I really wanted to like this series and this second one has left me still uncertain as to whether or not I care to continue discovering more about this character. There is just too much going on. I must say, I would rate these higher if the woman, Tempe, was even halfway close to human. The things she does and survives are incredible. I'd have collapsed after page 10. And she jogs. LOL It kind of defies belief that any one person could be involved in so many different things all over the country and actually between TWO countries as well (Canada and USA) and she has more friendly experts and backups that she can call at a moment's notice than any other character!! I don't like when she leaves things hanging through the book, for example about the nun/saint. She knew something on page 20 or so that she could have just stated. Also way too much bug detail, I don't care about forensics THAT MUCH. I'll try one more. Recommended with reservations."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I'm not a huge fan of Bones, I like Kathy Reichs, and I love the clinical language used in her books. Unfortunately, I get so hung up on the silliest of details. In this entire audiobook the reader actually mispronounces a word and for about 5 minutes I was stuck on that & had to jump back to listen to what I missed. Otherwise, though I'd rather have the time to read them, this & other audiobooks are great for the busy."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Like all of her other \\"Bones\\" novels, this one is another page turner. These books are hard to put down."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Tempe Brennan starts out her second adventure exhuming a grave at a small church. Tasked with identifying the bones of a nun, she's just getting adjusted to the Montreal weather. In the middle of the night, she's called onto the scene of a terrible fire that turns out to be rife with murder. As Tempe works on her two cases, she also returns to her Stateside home and continues being drawn into a macabre web featuring a cult. At the same time, her sister is exhibiting strange behavior after her latest divorce.Kathy Reichs is a practicing forensic anthropologist who has somehow found the time to write bestselling fiction. Lately, her life has also led to a television series called BONES. Although the Tempe Brennan of the television show is little like the Tempe Brennan of Reichs's novels, they're both worth reading and/or watching. Max Allan Collins has written a novel based on the television show.I really enjoyed the forensic aspects of the novel, but there were several instances where I almost felt bowled over by everything that was going on. Tempe's relationship with her sister, Hari, is dead-on and accurate, feeling very real and very troubled.However, DEATH DU JOUR also felt hurried and too relaxed at the same time. There was a lot going on, but it took a while for everything to come together.Kathy Reichs is still turning out one of the best forensic series out there, and I'm a fan of the television show. DEATH DU JOUR is a fun, educational read that mystery and crime scene fans will enjoy."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"While this was a good book, I was slightly dissappointed with it. There is alot happening, which is good in the sense that you won't be bored, but bad in the sense that it is very easy to lose track of characters. I enjoyed the book overall, but I must say that the ending was a bit to neat for my taste. Murders from two countries, two states, and Tempe manages to be present at the unveiling of all of them? And this is all tied to a case that Tempe is working on from roughy 100 years ago? A good book, has some flaws, but still overall a good read."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"This book will keep you on the edge ok your seat right up until the very last page!!!!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I think that this was the first Tempe Brennan that I read and may likely be the one I've enjoyed the most. Tempe's relationship with Andrew Ryan starts to form and they 'dance' around each other, knocking heads as each does his job. You get a real feeling of the cold of Montreal to your bones as Reich's sets the scenes and the atmosphere and you see Tempe as a real person, a pathologist who's also sleuth, and the confusing life that Tempe lives as she commutes between Montreal and North Carolina. I think that what I like best about Reich's is that she builds her characters carefully, each has a real personality and as you become immersed in the plot you truly feel that you're in there among them. Read this, and then grab hold of the others! You'll become addicted!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Reichs does a nice job of weaving this story together. It was a little slow in the beginning, but came on strong late in the book. If you like stories about forensics, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"In her debut novel \\"D&eacute;j&agrave; Dead\\" Kathy Reichs introduced the character of Temperance (Tempe) Brennan, a forensic anthropologist who spends half her time practicing in her hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina and the other half in Montreal, Quebec. A series of murders and bizarre findings led Tempe to go undercover and explore Montreal's seedy underworld of drugs and prostitution. In \\"Death du Jour\\", Tempe seeks to uncover the mystery behind a devastating house fire in St-Jovite that killed 4, including 2 infant babies. It is soon discovered that the cause of the fire is arson and all signs point to a dangerous cult as being the culprit.As ususal the main strength of a Reichs novel is the believability of its protagonist Tempe Brennan. Tempe is a truly complex character of many emotions that are felt thoughout the novel's engaging first-person narrative. The synergy between herself and detective Ryan is irresistible and reminiscent of Mulder and Scully from the X-files except this time the female is the believer and the male the pessimist. This is a very technical and academic work of fiction with in-depth descriptions of forensic procedures, fossil descriptions and coroner reports. In technical terms the author certainly knows what she writes about since she practices forensic anthropology herself, lending the novel a high sense of genuineness. I found to be most fascinating the in-depth knowledge of cults that we learn throughout, both fictional and historical such as the Solar Temple cult. I was also impressed with Reich's ability to describe the bitter cold of a Montreal winter, having lived there myself I thought she was bang on with some of her descriptions. The climactic final pages take place during the throes of Quebec's devastating ice storm of 1998 and the descriptions are done extremely well, amid a breakneck pace.As much as I enjoyed \\"Death du Jour\\" in my opinion this novel is not quite as good as D&eacute;j&agrave; Dead. I was disappointed that the French Canadian flavour of the first novel was not as omnipresent and found that the book lost a bit of its steam once the action shifted away from Quebec and into North Carolina. My major beef is that there were way too many wild coincidences; Tempe's sister Harry, who lives in Texas has just registered for a new course that happens to have a field work assignment in...you guessed it Montreal! The house fire in Quebec has links to a cult in the U.S. Where in the U.S.? Why in the Carolinas, right by Tempe's hometown! There were many other improbable links that felt somewhat insulting to a seasoned mystery reader like myself but did not ruin my enjoyment of the novel too much. I found Death du Jour to be very entertaining. It fell short of the accomplishment of her debut novel but with \\"D&eacute;j&agrave; Dead\\" Reichs had set herself a very high pedestal to keep up with. Death du Jour was certainly good enough to make me want to keep reading more Tempe adventures."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I've read one ridiculous, boring, outlandish, improbably plotted, terrible book by Patricia Cornwell. I vowed never to read anything by her again. Then I found Kathy Reichs' Deja Dead. I couldn't put it down! Since then, I've been eagerly awaiting her next book and was not disappointed by Death Du Jour. The characters are believable, the plot complex. I thought for sure I knew who the bad guy would turn out to be and I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong! I can understand the comparisons between Reichs and Cornwell, but there really is no comparison. Tempe Brennan kicks Kay Scarpetta's butt!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I enjoyed Deja Dead so much I went out and bought Death du Jour. The second read was just as good if not better. Reigh's second time out is definitely showing plenty of growth. I had a hard time putting the book down. Once I finally finished I could not help but reflect on different issues and circumstances of which she wrote of. A thinking novel that lingers on! Yet, not a day later after completing the novel, I am thinking &quot;when is the next novel to be published&quot;. I can easily live the novel as I have walked each street Temp speaks of. I am a native Montrealer and now reside in the South. Reigh's takes me back to a time and place that was good and then throws be back into the present. Reigh's is really on it when it comes to Montreal. It's exciting. I truly like the idea of sequels and I am impatiently awaiting her third.

What more cane one ask from an author?"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I didn't think Kathy Reichs could surpass Deja Dead but Death du Jour is an exceptional book. It kept my interest from start to finish. She has, in my opinion, surpassed Cornwell. She goes into great detail when explaining forensic anthropology which I find fascination. She also brings her characters to life. I look forward to her next book!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I was very excited to finally get to read Death Du Jour, and while I wasn't disappointed, I was expecting more. The setting and the crimes were great, wonderfully thought out with great descriptions, but I felt the story lacked the emotional depth that Deja Dead had. But I did read Death du Jour all in one sitting, so that says something about the quality!"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I'm only on page 59 but I'm enjoying this book very much. I like the meticulous step-by-step way Reichs describes how bones are packaged and prepared for transportation. Very interesting.I will, however, be a nit-picky reader and point out that in the paragraph on page 52 about the hockey game on TV that Don Cherry's commentary takes place after the FIRST period, not the second period as Reichs says. Maybe this is something only a Canadian (and hockey fan) would notice but it is quite important for realism. In Montreal, hockey is akin to religion for many people..."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Reichs has really scored a hit with this one.I found myself putting it down to get in the shower, and toweling off afterwards with it in one hand..(my personal test for an absorbing book.)I think she equals Cornwell, and although her sister is even less appealing than Cornwells niece, There is less time spent on her so I did not feel that detracted from the story in any way.. Way to go Kathy Reichs"},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"Reich's first novel was merely compelling reading. Death du Jour is an outstanding piece of fiction; a masterfully woven tale which includes religion, cults, and the evil that persons do! This latest installment in the trials and tribulations of Temperance Brennan is bound to entice her reader to dig deeper into one of two areas: psychology or forensic sciences. As a student of forensic anthropology, it makes me proud to see such a factual representation of this discipline from a woman in the field."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I live in Montreal and my friends and I have been waiting for this book all winter. Now that I have read it (in one sitting interrupted by a few naps and pots of tea) it was definitely worth the wait. Kathy Reichs gave a slide lecture on her forensic work at Victoria Hall in Westmount the other night and it was fantastic. Anyone who has the chance to hear her should go. Both books are gripping and scary. We in Montreal are thrilled with Dr. Reichs' success as we claim 1/2 of her for ourselves."},{"Title":"Death du Jour","review":"I can't help but compare Reichs to Cornwell. Death Du Jour is much more grisly than anything Cornwell has written. But the clinical detachment Reichs uses makes it more of a learning experience than a total gross-out. I really enjoyed Deja Dead and Death Du Jour, I only wish we knew more about Ryan and Claudel. . .maybe next time. It's an excellent book, nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Witnesses: The Highlights of Hearings Before the Warren Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy","review":"Highlights of Hearings Before the Warren CommissionThis 1965 book of 634 pages has the selected and edited testimony of The Witnesses who appeared before the Warren Commission Hearings. The \`List of Witnesses' on pages 616 to 625 give the names from the 15 volumes that were edited into the five chapters of 615 pages. Page 626 has the \`List of Exhibits' whose 64 pages are found between pages 306 and 307. The \`Index' is on pages 627 to 634. The \`Introduction' by Anthony Lewis says a Commission was created to solved the confusion created by \\"the assassination and its aftermath\\" (p.vii). It would report its findings and conclusion as far as the truth can be known. This was done ten months later.The 26 volumes of the Warren Report had 15 volumes of testimony and 11 volumes of exhibits, a total of more than 17,000 pages. This book presents the highlights of the 26 volumes for the general reader (p.viii). They show human drama with a range of emotions from sorrow to humor, from a President to a striptease dancer (p.ix). Oswald \\"was never satisfied with anything\\" (p.x). Is the assassination of a politician something with \\"no rational purpose\\"? The 26 volumes had no structure. The witnesses' testimony was in order of appearance. The exhibit volumes were in the order they were received. [There was no index!] The editors organized the selections into five chapters. Chapter 1 tells of the planning for the trip to Dallas and the assassination. Chapter 2 describes the arrest of Lee Oswald and his connections to the shooting. Chapter 3 tells about Oswald's life. Chapter 4 has the story of Jack Ruby, a local businessman. Chapter 5 tells why security failed and how it can be improved.Mrs. John F. Kennedy was the first witness. \\"And my husband never made any sound\\" (p.3). John B. Connally heard a sound then was hit in the back (p.19). [The second shot.] Then he heard the third shot. \\"He never uttered a sound at all that I heard\\" (p.120). Exhibit 33 is the statement from the Administrator of Parkland Memorial Hospital, \\"TOP SECRET\\". Marina Oswald's statement is Exhibit 993. Exhibit 2585 is a review of the book \\"Who Killed Kennedy?\\". Oswald's friend in the Marine Corps tells of Lee's favorite book, \\"Animal Farm\\". \\"Is it really?\\" (p.248).The conclusion said there was no conspiracy, only a lone gunman. This was the desired result. Jack Ruby was just another lone gunman (p.x). But in the following decades a majority of Americans no longer believed in the lone gunman theory. The House Select Committee in 1978 concluded there were four shots based on the new evidence of an audio tape. Who was the second shooter? After 46 years we'll never know; those who knew will never talk. Are assassins merely failures, victims of a delusion, and malcontents (p.xi)? There is no mention of John Wilkes Booth, a popular and famous actor of that era. Or the politician who assassinated the governor-elect of Kentucky in 1899. There is no mention of the Method of Operation for an assassination. The use of a pistol usually guarantees the assassin will be seen and captured, but fanatics want this recognition. A professional will use a rifle so he can make his escape and then collect his payment (if he survives). Any politician has enemies or rivals who may profit from his legal or extra-legal removal."},{"Title":"The Witnesses: The Highlights of Hearings Before the Warren Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy","review":"The Witnesses - Warren Commission Hearings, NY Times EditionThis 1964 book has the selected and edited testimony of the witnesses who appeared before the Warren Commission Hearings. After the assassination of JFK and the murder of his accused assassin President Johnson appointed a commission to inquire into the facts and make them public. Their only aim was the truth: there was no conspiracy, only a lone gunman. This conclusion has been challenged ever since; most now believe the truth will never be found.Oswald was \\"profoundly alienated\\" they said (p.x). He criticized the capitalist system in the United States, and the Communists in the Soviet Union. [But isn't it true that no society is perfect?] The Warren Commission concluded that Oswald \\"failed at almost everything he had ever tried to do\\" (p.x). Except to hit a moving target that was 59 to 89 yards away with no known rifle practice! JFK's body was removed extralegally from the hospital before experienced physicians could perform the required autopsy (p.xix). What a difference that would have made! If JFK spoke after the first shot what does that suggest? \\"There are those ... who continue to have basic doubts about what happened ....\\" Since this book only provides the highlights of the Warren Report no one should draw any ultimate conclusions. Really?The testimony of Dr. Charles J. Carrico begins on page 83. There was a 5 by 7 cm \\"defect in the posterior skull, the occipital region\\", \\"an absence of the calvarium or skull in this area\\". They had no time for a complete examination for all small wounds. There was a small wound 5 to 8 mm in size below the Adams apple, an even round wound (pp.88-89). Arlen Specter asked a hypothetical question: if JFK was struck from the rear and the missile struck no bones could it have made the round puncture wound? Dr. Carrico said \\"it could have ... under the circumstances\\". That is contradicted by known facts. \\"Typically, wounds of entrance are neat round holes. Wounds of exit are larger, ragged, torn, and bloodier\\" said LeMoyne Snyder in his book \`Homicide Investigation'.The \`List of Witnesses' on pages 616-625 names the witnesses in the first 15 volumes. The \`List of Exhibits' gives the number of the 64 pages bound between pages 306 and 307.I believe the method of operation denotes a conspiracy. A rifle allows the assassin to escape before they figure out where the shot came from. A \\"lone gunman\\" will use a pistol because he doesn't care if he is caught. The attacks on Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley, Teddy Roosevelt, FDR, Truman, Ford, and Reagan were from \\"a victim of delusions\\" (p.xi).Some people object to \\"eyewitness\\" and \\"earwitness\\" testimony as being less dependable than other physical evidence. Yet they claim somebody did see Oswald at that sixth floor window! If people heard multiple shots coming from more than one direction it is dishonest to try to explain away this reality and ignore their unbiased comments. The fact that a shot from the front killed JFK is proven by the entry and exit wounds seen in Parkland hospital in Dallas by experienced trauma doctors. Governor Connally was indeed adamant in saying he was hit by a second bullet after the first hit JFK.David Wrone's book \\"The Zapruder Film\\" says that Oswald was the person photographed by the doorway after the first shot was fired. Two persons were using movie cameras across the street from that building, and neither shows Oswald or anyone else by that sixth floor SE window! Finding a rifle and shells on the sixth floor then only mean they had been planted earlier. Some say the fragments and explosive head wound could not come from a copper-jacketed military bullet since they are not designed to fragment. This is required by the Geneva Convention.The proof of a cover-up is the Warren Report itself which did just that. The proof of a conspiracy is the use of a sacrificial double to provide \\"shots from the rear\\" for the less experienced doctors in Bethesda. David Lifton's book called attention to these differences in wound locations."},{"Title":"The Witnesses: The Highlights of Hearings Before the Warren Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy","review":"As most researchers are well aware, \\"eyewitness\\" and \\"earwitness\\" testimony is very often the least-dependable type of evidence to rely on with respect to relating it to a particular crime that has been committed. And that rule of thumb must also apply to the 1963 John F. Kennedy assassination case as well.With respect to the earwitnesses who heard the gunfire resound through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963 (the day when JFK was murdered by a single rifleman, Lee Harvey Oswald), there can be no question that there were varied accounts of exactly where in that park-like Plaza the gunshots had come from.Many witnesses thought the shots had come from the now-famous \\"Grassy Knoll\\" area in front of the President's limousine; while even a larger percentage of witnesses heard shots from the direction of the Texas School Book Depository Building to the rear of the car (a building from where Mr. Oswald was physically seen firing a rifle at the President, and a building wherein Oswald's own rifle was discovered 52 minutes after President Kennedy's assassination).So, which of the earwitnesses are right and who among them is wrong? Or, are ALL of these witnesses to be considered \\"correct\\" in a sense, in that shots were fired from both the front and the rear of Kennedy's vehicle?The answer to that last question is an undeniable (and provable) -- No.The reason, in my view, that both \\"camps\\" of earwitnesses (\\"front\\" vs. \\"rear\\") cannot each be accurate when it comes to what they heard is due to an often-ignored, overlooked, or buried statistic concerning these same earwitnesses -- i.e., the number of them who heard shots coming from MORE THAN ONE DIRECTION. ......http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/images/shots4.jpghttp://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/earwitnesses.htmThe above chart and associated link provide information about the Dealey Plaza witnesses who had an opinion as to where they thought the gunshots had come from on 11/22/63.The figure that is most-often overlooked or ignored by conspiracy promoters is the very telling \\"Two Directions\\" slice of the earwitness pie. That hunk of the pie is skimpy to be sure -- a mere 4.8% of all earwitnesses.So, that indicates that more than 95 out of every 100 witnesses who offered up an opinion on the matter gave testimony to the effect that they heard gunshots coming from just a SINGLE, solitary direction in the Plaza that Friday in 1963.That's an astoundingly-high percentile of \\"One Direction Only\\" witnesses IF there had actually been, as most CTers believe was the case, several assassins firing weapons from various and scattered locations throughout Dealey Plaza that afternoon.Now, again (for the sake of total fairness here), I should stress once more the inherent UNreliability in many cases when it comes to witness testimony. However, when you take more than 100 total earwitnesses (104 to be precise, based on the above-referenced links/data) located within a (very small) area of the shooting event in Dallas, and you come away with an overwhelming figure like \\"95%+\\" in favor of gunshots coming from just a single direction, such a large majority tends to merit more serious consideration and reliability.Two witnesses who never varied in their \\"What Direction?\\" testimony were two of the six people who were actually riding in the same car as assassination victim JFK -- John and Nellie Connally. They had absolutely no doubt whatsoever that all of the gunshots they heard had come from \\"over their right shoulder\\" (from the direction of the Book Depository Building). Governor Connally, who was severely wounded and nearly killed by one of Oswald's bullets in the attack, was particularly adamant in his belief re. the direction of the shots. Listen.....http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/connally.ramIn my view, the best way to arrive at the probable truth re. the JFK murder is to TOTAL UP the physical and circumstantial evidence (including all witness accounts) and gauge what is most likely to be true.And once the evidence is gathered together in one place ..... Is it MORE likely for several shots to have totally missed the car and all potential victims -- AND for virtually everybody in the surrounding vicinity to have mistakenly identified just a SINGLE location as the source of the gunfire when there had actually been two or more sources -- AND for the vast majority of these same witnesses to have all been in error when they said to have heard only \\"three shots\\" fired; with less than 9% of all witnesses actually hearing a number of gunshots (4 or more) that CTers need to have fired in order to have a prayer at debunking the One-Assassin conclusion reached by the Warren Commission and subsequent investigations? .....http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/images/shots3.jpg-- Or: --Is it MORE likely that only a single killer from behind JFK's car was firing a gun in Dealey Plaza that day .... with one of his shots missing the car completely, while two bullets hit victims inside the vehicle?The vast bulk of both the physical and the circumstantial evidence revolving around the events of 11/22/63 leads in only one (irrevocable) direction....and it's not toward \\"conspiracy\\". It's toward a single killer on the 6th Floor of the Book Depository....a killer by the name of Lee Harvey Oswald with rifle #C2766 in his hands.Given the totality of the ballistics, witness, and autopsy evidence, no conclusion other than a \\"Lone-Assassin\\" one is even possible. Evidence such as:1.) Oswald's rifle being found in the TSBD (on the \\"Death Floor\\").2.) Oswald being physically seen aiming and firing a rifle from the Depository.3.) Three bullet shells from Oswald's rifle being found in the TSBD.4.) Two bullet fragments from Oswald's rifle being found in JFK's limousine.5.) A huge majority of witnesses hearing exactly \\"three\\" shots fired.6.) The official autopsy report verifying the fact that no frontal shots hit JFK's body.7.) The lack of ANY \\"non-Oswald\\" bullets being found anywhere within a country mile of the assassination scene or Parkland Hospital.8.) And the previously-discussed very important statistic of LESS THAN 5% OF ALL WITNESSES HEARING SHOTS FROM MORE THAN JUST A SINGLE LOCATION (with this figure being only slightly higher via any pro-CT chart/graph of this same nature, such as the one purported by conspiracy author Josiah Thompson, who posits a \\"Two Directions\\" witness figure of only 6.3%, which is still an amazingly-tiny % if gunmen had really been blasting away from two or more distinctly-opposite locations in Dealey Plaza).** = And the \\"silenced weapons\\" argument is a silly one for conspiracists to use to try and combat that low percentage of \\"multi-location\\" witnesses (unless those same CTers wish to jettison completely their long-held belief that some witnesses really DID hear some gunshots from the Knoll area) -- because what kind of brainless plotters would be \\"silencing\\" only SOME of the frontal gunshots, but not others? That's just dumb.What that high figure of \\"All The Shots Came From The Same Place\\" witnesses is telling me is -- Dealey Plaza played some tricks with the sounds of Oswald's three Depository shots, making it difficult for some people to isolate the true source of the gunfire.Yes, the \\"bowl\\" of Dealey Plaza played tricks on some witness' ears -- BUT: it would seem as if the Plaza didn't play \\"Multi-Directional\\" tricks with respect to the SINGLE location of the gunshots heard by practically every witness (whether it be a \\"front\\" or a \\"rear\\" witness account). To say that it did is to believe the unlikely scenario that would have had virtually everyone in the whole of Dealey Plaza, no matter where they happened to be positioned within the Plaza, being the victim of the very same \\"Shots Only SEEMED To Come From One Place But Actually Came From Two Or Three\\" sound trick that day in 1963.This is tremendously important when evaluating ALL of the individual witness testimony. Why? Because, via such nearly-100% \\"One Location\\" earwitness accounts throughout Dealey Plaza, it is possible then (when all the post-assassination physical evidence is taken into account as well; i.e., the back wounds on the victims, proving that at least SOME shots came from behind the car) to come to the following obvious conclusion with respect to those \\"All Shots Came From The Knoll\\" earwitnesses -- They HAVE to be wrong.The fact that the \\"frontal shot\\" witnesses had to have been dead-wrong when such witnesses claimed to hear shots from ONLY the \\"front\\" is all too obvious, and I'm always baffled by CTers who give the \\"directional\\" testimony of such witnesses so much weight and credence, as if it was \\"proof of conspiracy\\". It certainly proves no such thing. In fact, it actually goes a further distance to proving JUST THE OPPOSITE. ....Because if those witnesses REALLY were correct about hearing only shots from ONE location (the Grassy Knoll or any other perceived locality), it HAS to mean (given the physical evidence of KNOWN bullet holes in the victims' backs) that there were NO SHOTS at all from the front, and these witnesses merely were in error re. the source of ALL of the gunfire.I would certainly not be happy (at all) if I were Gerry Spence, or some other lawyer who was attempting to defend Lee Oswald against the charge of killing the President by himself from his Sniper's Perch in the TSBD, and was confronted with a pie chart that looked like this (once again linked below). I think I'd take my Stetson hat and head for the door (at least with respect to this particular portion of the case about what the witnesses heard or didn't hear). .....http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/images/shots4.jpg..... And if that chart were to be revised to include a separate category for \\"3 Or More Directions\\", then we'd unquestionably see a 0% figure placed inside such a \\"3 Directions\\" pie slice. A thin slice indeed, to the point of total non-existence even.**** = But, according to what many a-CTer actually believes, such a \\"Three Directions\\" option SHOULD most definitely be included in such a witness poll, due to the claim of many theorists that there were at least THREE different shooters firing away at JFK on November the 22nd.Names such as Oliver Stone, Jim Garrison, and Robert Groden, among many other so-called assassination \\"experts\\", would fit into the \\"At Least 3 Gunmen\\" category. And yet not a single witness that I am aware of claimed to hear shots from that number of distinct locations. THAT fact, all by itself, tells us quite a bit about whether or not Mr. Stone's \\"6-Shot, 3-Shooter, Triangulation Of Crossfire\\" theory (put forth in his 1991 motion picture) has much of a chance of being a correct and accurate assassination scenario.When sorting through all of the above, which of these things is more likely to be true regarding the murder of John F. Kennedy? ----A vast multi-shooter, 4-plus-shots-fired conspiracy?-- Or: --A solo nutcase in the Book Depository getting lucky and killing the President using his own rifle?--------------I think that former Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi summed up the JFK case best, when he said the following in 1986:\\"Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of President Kennedy. The evidence is absolutely overwhelming that he carried out the tragic shooting all by himself. In fact, you could throw 80% of the evidence against him out the window and there would still be more than enough left to convince any reasonable person of his sole role in the crime.\\" -- V.T. Bugliosi"},{"Title":"Return of the Naked Chef","review":"I don't know if this book preceded the other Jamie Oliver book, \\"Naked Chef Takes Off,\\" but it's the SAME BOOK.I bought this for my wife, thinking I'd found a J.O. book she didn't already own.

We have had the pleasure of enjoying the lamb curry, the fantastic roasted chicken, the roasted fillet of beef rolled in herbs and wrappped in prosciutto, risotto of radiccio, bacon, rosemary and red wine, linguine with pancetta and clams (one of my favorites) and the strawberries marinated in balsamic - just to name a few. They were all simple to make and turned out wonderfully. One of the things that I like about the recipes in this book is that they are almost fool proof; even if you make a litte mistake, they are still going to turn out great. An older copy of this book is called The Naked Chef Takes Off. Both books have the same picture on the front and contain the exact same content, but the publisher has now changed the title for some reason (a complaint of the previous reviewer).

I wanted to see what Aldiss could do with his short stories, but was only met by the drab title \\"The Book of Brian Aldiss.\\" Now, while it is very self-descriptive, the title itself lacks any imagination whatsoever... and actually somewhat reflects the amount of depth and detail within the collection of nine stories. If it weren't for the sillier stories, the entire collection would have been a long drag. But I find Aldiss' refreshing whit to be interesting, as is his more serious novels.Comic Inferno 4/5 - The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Robots investigates partners Birdlip and Freud and their respective robots Hippo and Bucket. A quirky story with odd behavior, odd dialogue and an even odder plot. 37pgsThe Underprivileged 3/5 - Corbis and Safton migrate to a dream-come-true planet but are weary to accept official welcome. Fairly open story with predictable circumstances. 16pgsCardiac Arrest 2/5 - Morbid and delusional Tindale plans to give an American longevity secret to the Chinese but is constantly delayed by a Hong Kong gang. Dragging spy \`thriller' with intermittent delusional rants and a terrible ending. 28pgsIn the Arena 3/5 - Javlin and Awn must team-up to defeat alien opponents in an alien coliseum. Good background plot but is, again, fairly straight forward. 10pgsAll the World's Tears 4/5 - Psychodynamician Smithlao anger-preps client Gunpat before finding additional material to anger him with.

This book tells a delicious and fulfilling tale of one Sweet Dream Pie and what happens when people indluge in this enormous pie. Through colorful and rich pictures and such descriptive words as: &quot;clouds of powdered sugar, a chocolate tornado, or a thick, sweet syrup bubbled and oozed down the sides,&quot; Audrey Wood allows the reader to feel as if they too are enjoying a piece of Ma Brindle's Pie. Come and allow your dreams to indulge in a piece of Sweet Dream Pie."},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Pie","review":"For parents who like to read aloud, this book is an absolute must. The story and characters are brought to life by vibrant, fun illustrations, and the story is equally entertaining to children and adults (doesn't everyone know at least one &quot;Pa Brindle?&quot;). Audrey Wood is an outstanding story-teller."},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Pie","review":"This work by Audrey Wood and Mark Teague is probably one of the best read-aloud books for group readings around. It is a pure flight of fantasy but set in a neighborhood that most kids can relate to quite well. There are families, quirky neighbors, plenty of dogs, cats and other pets involved and of course there are dreams.Early one morning, before dawn, on Willobee Street, Pa Brindle lit a lantern and led Ma Brindle up to their dark attic. There they found an old and ancient trunk covered with cobwebs. Pa begs Ma to cook him a special pie; \\"just like the one you made me long ago.\\" Ma is not so sure that is a good idea because Pa had eaten too much that last time and pointed out to him that his dreams had not been all that sweet. Pa though begs here and she finally relents. In the trunk there is an enormous mixing bowl, a great rolling pin, a gigantic pie pan, and a small brass bell. Pa promises Ma that he will be good this time.The elderly couple take the contents of the trunk to the kitchen and Ma begins to make her \\"special\\" Sweet Dream Pie;\\" this quickly becomes a project that sort of includes the entire neighborhood in one way or the other and as the day progresses, stranger and stranger things begin to happen.Finally the pie is finished and Pa, along with the help of a neighborhood boy, hauls the pie out into the yard were everyone begins to eat...despite Ma's warnings. But the pie is oh so good! You cannot eat just one piece! At last the pie is finished and all go home for a good nights sleep as they are suddenly very, very tired!Oh my!And the dreams begin!Between some very, very descriptive writing and some wonderfully bold art work, this book is truly a trip into another world; a dream world full of delicious surprises that tickle the imagination. The boarders of reality and imagination blur with each turning of the page as the \\"sweet dreams\\" begin roaming the night.I get a kick out of reading this work to groups of kids. The text is filled with wonderful adjectives that make the story leap from the page and the pictures are large and bold enough to be seen by a large group, while at the same time being extremely detailed with little scenes stuck here and there. You can view the art work here several times and find something new with each viewing.This one was first published in 1998 and I do hope it is around for many more years to come.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Pie","review":"This is one of our all time favorite books. The art is great and the story is a blend of magical and kooky that delights children and grown-ups alike. When it was my turn to be a guest reader at my daughters K class we went through all our books (which took two days) and this is the one she chose for me to read. It is so refreshing to find a book that appeals to me as much as it does to her and that is fun to read and not painful. If you've choked your way though enough insipid fairy, kitty, and princess drivel to last you a lifetime (and haven't we all?) then you might want to give sweet dream pie a try.*** We discovered last summer that softened ice cream, fluff, food coloring and assorted candies and jimmies could be swirled into an oreo crust to make a quite passable sweet dream pie for home consumption, though my daughter was a little annoyed that it didn't actually cause her to halucinate a monster with people feet ;)"},{"Title":"Sweet Dream Pie","review":"Tired of reading train book after train book to my railroad-obsessed 4-year-old, I picked up this book at the library.

The pie is clearly magical - every move the Brindles make to bake this pie is echoed on the street. When they roll out the dough, everybody falls off their bed onto the floor. When the oven is on, the street is hot. When they blow on the pie to cool it off, a breeze picks up in the neighborhood.All the neighbors (except the little allergic girl) are invited to have a single slice of pie - but they eat too much, all of them, and promptly fall asleep, causing wild dreams to go up and down the neighborhood in a totally non-frightening way. The dreams are eventually swept away, and everybody gets a good night's sleep.The story and the illustrations are wonderfully detailed, as I said.

The theories of universe creation, galaxy and star formations, etc., as well as the supporting evidence are presented in full. Speculations on the future, as well as alternative theories to the big bang are briefly covered as well.The book's difficulty and the fact that it resembles a textbook is the only reason why I downgraded my recommendation from 5 stars. Silk wastes no time and space, and pummels you with facts and theories from the onset, with little in between. The textbook feeling is also conveyed through the author's completely objective tone throughout. This may even seem frustrating to some, especially in the early chapters when Silk presents dozens of competing theories and observations, without even a hint as to which is more likely or which he himself supports. Nevertheless, he does proceed to elaborate on all the major theories and specifies which currently carry the most support in the scientific community and why.Overall, I highly recommend the book, especially to those who are not new to at least the basic ideas of cosmology. Others will need to be a bit patient as the reading is quite dense -- Silk packs about a 1000 pages of info into 400 pages of text; inevitably you may need to re-read certain parts at times in order to follow the logical flow and development of presented theories. I found the observational data to be too technical sometimes as well, and just took the author's word that it supports the theory forementioned."},{"Title":"The Big Bang: Third Edition","review":"I am quite sure, that there is no better summary of Big Bang than Joseph Silk's text. I classify it on the border, between popular and science book but a bit more as a scientific (more for studying then for reading).If student wants to learn how astronomy and computer simulations has been used to develop this most important and crucial cosmological theory, she/he should not miss this book.Formation of the Earth and life as well as SETI are briefly covered.It creates exclusion for books by Hubert Reeves, Robert Kirshner, George Smoot, Igor Novikov, Martin Rees, Alan Guth and Donald Goldsmith (please refer to my Listomania List). Silk explains with absolute efficiency and coherence without parallel to other science writers. It is the book I would have selected if I had been asked to take just one with me on uninhabitable island.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Big Bang: Third Edition","review":"The Big Bang, 3rd Edition Reviewed by: Chris McKinstry, VLT Operator.This book is about the best introduction to the Universe that one could hope for. I think of it as a giant and highly detailed Scientific American article (including the illistrations and colour photographs.) This updated classic (2nd edition is 11 years old,) is both current and complete (it contains the most recent findings dervied from Hubble and VLT observations.) It even has a VLT picture I helped take of M104 that was released to the public just last month.As with all good introductions, the math is in the background (actually in chapter notes at the end of the book) making this book accessible to everyone."},{"Title":"The Big Bang: Third Edition","review":"I truly believe that this is the only book you need to read. It has all the concepts, theories about the story. Densly written and every sentence has concept, theory in it. Starts with the history of cosmology and continues with Cosmological Models, Origin of Galaxies, theory of Galaxy formations and star formations and future of the Universe. Inflation and other theories are all covered to the extend that space allows. What I liked most in this book is that it covers everything and you do not need to read ten books to get the idea complete. For more technical oriented person, book has Mathematical section at the end describing the concepts with formulas. Author always gives brief description of concepts and usually he explains any conclusion with reasons so that if you can not derive the conclusion by yourself there is the reason.This book together with Kip Throne's beautiful book on Black Holes will make it complete."},{"Title":"The Big Bang: Third Edition","review":"Joseph's Silk's The Big Bang is one of the finest science books ever written for the educated reader. If you have ever wondered how the universe was born and how it evolved, this book is an invaluable key to understanding these questions. Mr. Silk's prose is very understandable and he clearly explains the myriad topics of modern cosmology. After sketching the origins of modern cosmology; he takes the reader on a dazzling journey which covers evidence for the big bang, the first millisecond of the universe and the primeval fireball, cosmological models, formation of stars, origin and evolution of the galaxies, origin of the heavy elements, the future of the universe, and alternatives to the big bang. The book contains mathematical notes to assist the perplexed/inquiring reader, a detailed glossary, and suggestions for further reading. In addition, the book is richly illustrated with numerous black and white photographs, charts, and diagrams. My favorite diagram is the one on page 98 which depicts alternative big bang models. And on page 96, Mr. Silk clearly lays out the Friedmann equation which is the fundamental equation of big bang cosmology. There is also a center section of beautiful color photographs. And best of all, Amazon offers the book for only $13.95; a bargain at today's prices. I have read several introductory works on cosmology and the big bang but this one stands alone. In summary, this is an excellent expository work on cosmology and the modern big bang theory. If you have any interest in this topic at all, you must have a copy of this book."},{"Title":"The Big Bang: Third Edition","review":"Very informative book about the broad knowledge base science now has on cosmology. But I felt it was too inconsistent in its appeal. Never really written in a style that I could relate to. It starts off well, but the last few chapters were difficult to finish. That material was not nearly as interesting as the beginning stuff. But he definitely knows a lot about Cosmology. I just can't relate to his style of communicating that knowledge.Try Calibrating the Cosmos for a much better read."},{"Title":"The Big Bang: Third Edition","review":"I've read quite a few books on astrophysics, cosmology, etc., and this is one of the most poorly written books I've come across. It's too bad, because the writer is trying to be current and thorough. But he doesn't know how to write clearly, his grammar is terrible, he skips steps in his explanations, jumps all over the place, and leaves you wondering \\"what in the heck is this guy trying to say??\\". Not recommended."},{"Title":"UNDER A NEW SKY","review":"Perhaps one of the most touching books on Russia that I've ever read.

Volunteering at a suicide hotline to develop his communication skills and aid his job as a marketing manager for Bodyalternatives.net, Tony discovers that dealing with the emotional backlash of suicidal callers is the least of his problems. Tony is uncomfortably attracted to the seventeen year-old volunteer Shahla, and when her friend and hotline listener is murdered Shahla pulls him into an investigation despite his inclination to leave things to the police. As the two track down their weirder callers and fellow volunteers all the way to Vegas Tony must also cope with his irritatingly immature roommate and confront his growing suspicion as to his college friend's involvement with the murder.Cook has created a very engaging hero in Tony, who realizes that has to grow up fast as he encounters the pain of the callers and sees just how much that he himself has to lose. Shahla is at times wiser than her years while still flashing glimpses of being a teenage girl, and her impulsiveness nicely contrasts with Tony's reserve. This is a very entertaining mystery that builds up speed and takes the reader along to its surprising conclusion."},{"Title":"Hotline to Murder","review":"Not long after Tony Schmidt joins the Central Hotline in Bonita Beach, California, Joy is found murdered. Both are listeners-people who man the Hotline and talk to the callers. Tony pairs up with Shahla Lawton, another listener and Joy's best friend.They begin working many shifts together. Since Tony and Shahla work at the Hotline, they find they can often get information the police are unable to obtain. But instead of turning everything over to the police, they begin to follow up on much of the information themselves. Partly because the police don't seem too receptive to the information and partly because of privacy rules.They begin looking into some of the inappropriate callers and others with a connection to the Hotline to determine who might have had a motive to kill Joy. There are many strange people and they have to sift through information to determine if the person is just having trouble or if they might have a motive to have killed Joy.Tony and Shahla put themselves in many very sticky situations and find themselves in peril more than once as they work to uncover the identity of the killer.This is a great story. It moves along quickly and keeps you guessing as to who committed this murder and why. There are plenty of red herrings and things happen regularly that made me change my mind continuously about who I thought did it.I really enjoyed getting to know Tony and Shahla. Even though Shahla is only a teenager, she is such an integral part of this story. Their relationship is terrific. I hope there will be more books with these two main characters.This story is well crafted and the California setting terrific.

I had issues at certain parts. 1)Tony is a mid 30's male that sometimes is lusting after a soon to be 18 years old female. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Even though their relationship was platonic, her mother not knowing him pretty much allowed him to have free rein with her. 2) What appears to me to be the gratuitous reference to 911. 3) Having a character who has never spoken with, had history or experience with the \\"nanny\\" in this story allude to a nanny in California being a Spanish speaker. Not all nannies are Spanish speakers. Not all nannies speak Spanish. These are a few of the instances where I shook my head.Overall it's not a bad book. It was fun.

The author does a marvelous job of describing the Southern California beach city setting, so much so that while driving on Sepulvida two months ago, I saw a drab three-story stucco commercial building and simply knew that it must be the building that houses the call-center. Also typically Southern Californian, the car chase contained endless minutes at a jam-packed intersection with the driver cursing himself for chosing the wrong route.Overall, Hotline is an entertaining story that keeps the pages turning."},{"Title":"Hotline to Murder","review":"I was probably a third of the way through the book when I realized I had read it before.

Total waste of time, can't believe that the type A in me wouldn't just let me quit half way through.

Yet it wasn't until many years later that I read his own account \\"Of Plymouth Plantation\\" which was written during the years 1620 - 1642. The sense of adventure and human drama found in this book are very gripping despite the often florid style of language used at the time. Once can't help get caught up in these people's struggles and imagine how difficult it must have been for them in so many ways before during and after their treacherous 2 1/2 month sea voyage. I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in history as it was written concurrent with what was happening and by someone who was instrumental in creating this history. One does not have to be directly descended from the Pilgrims to find this story compelling. Also look up Cotton Mather's biography of William Bradford written in 1702 and \\"William Bradford: Plymouth's Faithful Pilgrim\\" by Gary D. Schmidt."},{"Title":"Of Plymouth Plantation","review":"William Bradford was the start of our family in the country. I enjoyed reading his story in his own words.

I have waited all my life for such a true and complete movie of the Pilgrims of Plymouth.It's available in DVD here at Amazon. I just bought 3 more...to give to my children and their kids for Thanksgiving...and it will be shown here after our VERY traditional Thanksgiving dinner.We all benefit from the sacrifices and perseverance of the Pilgrims.

It promised black lesbian characters/story set in a different time (the late-50s/early 1960s...I'm not sure why the previous reviewer said early 1900s/1920s Harlem Renaissance). In actuality any lesbian content could be compiled into about 2-3 pages out of the entire book (which was a disappointment for me). Further none of the characters, including the main character Sunshine/Kali, were likable. The author did not make me feel for any of them, except perhaps briefly at the very end.To the author's credit it was well written, though the multiple storylines that did not come together until the end got annoying."},{"Title":"Her, Second Edition","review":"This book is not &quot;Color Purple&quot; or &quot;Harlem Nights&quot;: anybody that is trying to read a simple narrative about black lesbians or the Renaissance will not find it here. Muhanji's characters come from various race, gender, and sexuality backgrounds. This book has twists and turns that may surprise those not up for the challenge of this reading. I didn't particularly love this novel, but I do think Muhanji has talent and will go places one day."},{"Title":"Siouxsie and the Banshees: The Authorised Biography","review":"I bought this book and couldn't put it down! This is one of the best books out there about Siouxsie and the Banshees! These are interviews with Siouxsie along with members of the band and other important figures. They (Siouxsie and others) tell the stories about the band's history, the songs/albums, etc. If you're a Siouxsie fan - you have to get this book! Another good book for a Siouxsie fan (and its hard to get) is Ray Stevenson's Siouxsie and the Banshees Photo Book. Get this book and the Photo book!"},{"Title":"Siouxsie and the Banshees: The Authorised Biography","review":"I just finished this and I enjoyed it immensely. Yes, there could have been more pictures, or color pictures, but the &quot;dish&quot; was terrific. Written in interview snippets with band members, associates and friends, you get a clear picture of what was actually going on with the band and behind the scenes while we were all busily worshiping Siouxsie.I learned plenty from things I must have missed reading up on since first stumbling upon the Arabian Knights video around 1981, up to and including their sad break up in 1995...Who knew that behind Robert Smith's back he was unaffectionately referred to as &quot;Fat Bob,&quot; or that PEEPSHOW was fueled most specifically by cocaine, that FEAST was hammered out in two weeks, that Siouxsie ruled the band with an iron fist (well, you HAD to know that). I still worship the music, but now I appreciate the humans who created it, whiny and childish as they seemed at times.It's a great read, I love Siouxsie's occasional foul mouth and the fact that she had the audacity to have been photographed for the cover of the book in a Burberry blouse. And you'll have fun at the end of the book highlighting all the gigs you actually saw and horrified at how many you allowed yourself to miss. (Discography and extensive index included)"},{"Title":"Siouxsie and the Banshees: The Authorised Biography","review":"I have a casual interest in Siouxsie and the Banshees and recently decided to add their 'best of' to my CD collection. On a whim I decided to get this biography to find out the stories behind some excellent songs. I must say how impressed I was with what I learned about the band and the personalities within. I can sum it all up by saying it's a story of chance, hard work, an over-whelming desire to be different, drinking, a seemingly never ending succession of guitar players, more drinking, some drugs, persistance and artistic integrity. With more drinking! Starting from a point of not even knowing how to play their instruments right through to crafting some song arrangements which are quite exquisite, Siouxsie and the crew really made their mark. This book delivers a blunt and to-the-point account of how they managed it. A very interesting read for anyone whose single buying years started in the late 70s and who has an interest in the late punk/new wave/pop genre."},{"Title":"Siouxsie and the Banshees: The Authorised Biography","review":"This is one book I just can't put down. I fell into the Banshees quite by accident in 1984, having discovered them via their connections to the Cure's Robert Smith. Hyaena was my first purchase, and although I felt like something of a \\"Johnny-Come Lately\\" fan I have followed them ever since. This great book tells the warts and all story of the band, from their chaotic, what-a-shambles beginings through their many trials and tribulations, to their ultimate break-up and unfortunate reunion. For fans this is a MUST. If, like me, you have always assumed that Sioux's last name is Dallion, as is it spelled in many alternative rock source guide books, then you will learn that it's actually Ballion. And that's just the begining."},{"Title":"Siouxsie and the Banshees: The Authorised Biography","review":"As a long time fan, some of this was old news, but there were lots of interesting tidbits I knew nothing about. My biggest complaint is the lack of photos, and those featured here are basic black and white ones most fans have seen (if you have Ray Stevenson's Banshee photo book you are sure to recognize them). A band as colorful as the Banshees should compile quite a treat for the eye. Maybe they will do that for the next book! I hope!"},{"Title":"Siouxsie and the Banshees: The Authorised Biography","review":"First, I have to say I highly recommend this book to all Siouxsie fans as you're bound to find several interesting tidbits about the band, the songs, tours, etc. However, be warned - this is not all new material. Paytress basically picked &quot;the best of the best&quot; from prior interviews and arranged the snippets so that it appears that the band all sat down together and told their story to him. If you have been a long time fan and followed them closely over the years, chances are you've already read most of what's in the book. Most of us already know about their infamous 100 Club debut, their ever-changing guitarist line-up, and how some of their more famous recordings such as Peepshow came to be and it's all rehashed here. What I found most fascinating were the parts of the book detailing the later years of The Banshees leading to their breakup and details surrounding their various side projects such as The Creatures and Sioux's duet with Morrissey. Additionally, I had no idea how much turmoil this band endured in terms of finances, poor management, etc., and it was amazing how they continued to plow through it all. All in all, it is a decent chronicle of one of the most under-appreciated bands of our time and worth the read even if some parts will be old news."},{"Title":"Siouxsie and the Banshees: The Authorised Biography","review":"Rock biogs are a motley lot, and I think I make a good benchmark reviewer for this as I like a lot of the Banshees early stuff, but always got the impression Siouxsie was a bit of a punk prima donna. I was pleasantly surprised by this, as it's nicely put together, a good read, and I left with a great deal more respect for and understanding of Ms Sioux and crew. It's not going to change your life - punk's had far too many unrealistic aspirations laid on its shoulders by scene asskissers over the years - but this book's both an entertaining and informative take on all things Banshee."},{"Title":"Siouxsie and the Banshees: The Authorised Biography","review":"I have loved Siouxsie and the Banshees since discovering them in high school, so of course I was eager to read this book when I heard it was coming out. After reading it, I have to say that it wasn't as enjoyable as I thought it would be. The reason for my discontent lies in the fact that, maybe unlike a lot of fans, I am less interested in reading about the making of the music, i.e. the mechanics of the songwriting, which instruments they used, which producers, etc, than I am in reading about their lives as people, their personalities, their likes and dislikes, their personal lives, what drove them to become who they are, stuff like that. This book contained a little of that in the early chapters discussing the Banshees' biographical information and a little later on, but most of the rest of the book contained lots and lots of info on stuff that I found I didn't really care about. It is not that I am completely disinterested in the nuts and bolts of the music, all the moving around, and all the shows they played, but I found that after I finished the book (and I had to push myself to keep reading as I regularly found myself lost in trying to remember which producer was which and so on), I felt that I didn't really \\"know\\" Siouxsie any better than I did at the beginning. To me, she has always represented the ultimate punk ice queen, visually stunning yet unapproachable, unattainable, and, yes, cold. Even as a fan, I always felt that she was someone that I could not really relate to although I thought her musical output was genius and I admired her. I was hoping this book would change my mind about that and paint a more complete picture of who she is, but it didn't really (basically, I'm saying that I always hoped that she would turn out to be more than the super haughty b@#$% she always made sure we believed she was). I wanted more about her, less about the band, and I didn't care for the \\"oral history\\" writing style with the snippets from interviews pasted together. The pictures also left a lot to be desired."},{"Title":"Siouxsie and the Banshees: The Authorised Biography","review":"I was fearful that this Book, even though &quot;Authorised&quot; would have Minimal Participation from the Boys &amp; Siousxie. I am Proud to Be WRONG! They Fully Participated, it really should be Called a Band Autobigraphy. A Oral Narrative that Tells Many sides to a Complicated History. I was Most Happy That Siousxie's Unique Perspective on the World Remained intact! She is a True Hero in the Music World! It does also what Great Books about Music Should do: Inspire you to Listen again with new appreciation of the beloved work of a Great Band. One I have Loved for a long time.

I also Sing the Praises for this Wonderful &amp; entertaining Book!"},{"Title":"Siouxsie and the Banshees: The Authorised Biography","review":"The author of this bio does a great thing.
