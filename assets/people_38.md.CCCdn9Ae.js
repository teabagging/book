Bowditch","review":"I read this classic aloud to my children. It was the winner of the 1956 Newbery Medal.Carry On, Mr. Bowditch is the historical fiction novel that is based on the real Nathaniel Bowditch, an amazing mathematician whose brilliance changed the nautical world. Although he dreamed of pursuing his academic dreams, his father could barely afford to feed him and arranged for his nine-year apprenticeship as a bookkeeper to Ropes and Hodges, a ship chandlery. Determined to make the most of it, he spent every spare minute with his nose in a book, often long into the night. When he came across a topic that he didn't know, he studied everything about it and then wrote his own books. Some of the books that he wrote were about rope-making, sail production, caulking, and navigation. At the age of 16 years, he wrote an almanac that covered the period of 34 years from 1789 to 1823 and included \\"the regular things,\\" such as: The sun's rising, setting, declination, and amplitude. He did not think it was a big deal, saying it was \\"just mathematics.\\" He was brilliant, to say the least.Because all of the great scientific books were written in Latin, he decided to teach himself Latin by using both Latin and English bibles as guides to painstakingly translate word by word. He then translated Isaac Newton's Principia from Latin to English, which was the best book for studying astronomy.A man named Dr. Bentley often visited Nat, presumably because he could see Nat's genius and offered membership into The Salem Philosophical Library. It was a private library started by a group of men, which housed only the best scientific works. They were so impressed with Nat's intellect that they waived the usual membership fee of 50 pounds. As a member, he would be able to borrow these scientific books for study.When word came that Ropes and Hodges was to be sold, Nat could hardly contain his excitement. He thought that his time had finally come to be free of his apprenticeship so that he could go to Harvard, but his spirit was dampened when he found out that his apprenticeship was transferred to the new owner.After his apprenticeship was completed, Nat was offered a position as a Ship's Clerk aboard a sailing vessel. He took along his books so that he could still study. When he found an error in one of the calculation tables in Moore's Practical Navigator, he became angry and disgusted because sailors depended on the accuracy of those calculations. He took it upon himself to work each mathematical table in Moore's book and found over 8,000 errors!Nat discovered a way to calculate a lunar reading, and he taught all of his shipmates. He felt that they all had the potential to become first mate if only they knew how to navigate! Although the Captain was puzzled as to why Nat would take the effort to do so, he said that never had a crew been less trouble, so he told him to, \\"Carry on, Mr. Bowditch!\\" Because not everyone possesses the same academic strengths, he often had to adapt his methods to teach different people. He decided, then, to write his own nautical manual that would: Have the correct calculations so that sailors would not have to rely on Moore's Practical Navigator, define all nautical terms so that even a layperson could learn, and contain logarithmic tables of all the trigonometric functions so that all a sailor would need to navigate would be a knowledge of addition and subtraction.Nat's book, The American Practical Navigator, was first published in 1802. The book has been updated a number of times over the years, but it still is carried on board of every commissioned U.S. Naval vessel!My children and I really enjoyed this book! Nat possesses such persistence and perseverance, two admirable qualities that I want for my own children. Even though he was not formally educated, it did not make him any less intelligent. He was passionate about his studies, and you would have to be to teach oneself different languages and advanced mathematics! There is quite a bit of sadness throughout the book, as a number of people in Nat's life die. It seemed that someone died in nearly every chapter! Still, our spirits were buoyed by Nat's resolve to achieve his goals despite the tragedies that befell him."},{"Title":"Carry On, MR. Bowditch","review":"A little background from wikipedia: \\"Nathaniel Bowditch (March 26, 1773 - March 16, 1838) was an early American mathematician remembered for his work on ocean navigation. He is often credited as the founder of modern maritime navigation; his book The New American Practical Navigator, first published in 1802, is still carried on board every commissioned U.S. Naval vessel.\\"The book starts out when Nat is six years old, looking to perform a good luck ritual before their family moves. They've had a string of bad luck, and he's hoping the move will change things.It doesn't. Nat has to leave school at age 10 to help his father's business, and because of his excellent math skills, at age 12 he is indentured for 9 years as an apprentice to be a bookkeeper for a ship chandelry. His dream was to go to Harvard, and being indentured made that impossible. Feeling pretty sorry for himself, on his first day one of the other workers told him, \\"Only a weakling gives up when he's becalmed! A strong man sails by ash breeze!\\" (Translation from ship terms - \\"Only a wealking gives up when the winds aren't blowing! A strong man sails by rowing!\\")That simple statement changes Nat's perspective. He no longer waits for good luck. He studies to educate himself, then teaches others.I enjoyed reading it alone, but it's definitely on my list to read with my children."},{"Title":"Carry On, MR. Bowditch","review":"Not only is this Newberry award winner based on the life of a real man, Nathaniel Bowditch, but it is also very interesting and exciting to read. Taking only moments for you to become totally engrossed, Carry On, Mr. Bowditch places you directly in this gifted mathematician/astronomer's life during the early 1800s. Complete immersion in this epic story makes you hardly want to set the book down until you have finished reading it.Carry On, Mr. Bowditch is quite a refreshing book, which describes life at sea in fantastic detail and realistic fervor. Set with strong emotion and rich character development, this information-filled book is not overly long, and can be read through rather quickly.Throughout the story, Nathaniel remains true to his morals, and not only does he save many lives, but he also achieves a meaningful life and a wonderful family of his own. If it is adventure, intrigue, and impact you desire, Carry On, Mr. Bowditch is the right book for you."},{"Title":"Carry On, MR. Bowditch","review":"My brothers and I read this book for our literature class, hearing it was a good and famous book but never having read it before. It was better than I had anticipated, especially considering it came from the point of view of a character whose true loves were mathematics and the sea, neither of which I share with Mr. Bowditch. Even still, Nat's story is a compelling one, filled with the hopes and dreams of a boy as he becomes a man. Nat Bowditch goes through many trials as he tries to find his purpose in life. It's the story of a brilliant boy in a young free America who, coming from a poor family background, was not able to finish his education or go to a college. He is instead indentured as a young man, and later goes off to sea, but the sea is where he shows his true potential. Teaching the once considered inept sailors how to navigate using what he calls, \\"a matter of simple mathematics\\" he changes the world of navigation forever. Time and time again Nat is tested and tried by circumstances that seem to want to hold him back, but time and time again Nat holds true making this book a great example of perseverance. I recommend this book to any who want to learn more about navigation, perseverance, or are just looking for a good read. -L. West"},{"Title":"Carry On, MR.

Anyway, I asked a lot of people and Cal Berkeley's students (including Ph.Ds) about this Bowditch street. Surprise, nobody seems to know who or what Bowditch is.

Pathetic use of word choice, the whole plot was extremely dull. The most annoying part was how \\"perfect\\" Mr. Bowditch's life is (was)! Everything just goes his way- even his enemies end up looking up to him in the end! NO ONE acts this way! Oh- his perfect life? Well the only un-perfect part is that probably half his fmaily dies. Before you scorn me for saying \\"perfect\\" when he had all this loss- it really didn't seem to hurt him that much. Everyone felt sorry for him- so all the more he gained. He didn't even seem at all sad. The book would be like \\"And his poor, dear sister died of whatever\\" and he would be all \\"oh, I'm sad. :( Oh well, better get back to being happy ol' me again!

Bowditch","review":"Carry On, Mr. Bowditch contains absolutely fascinating background information about Salem and navigation in the 1700s, providing a valuable context for Nathaniel Bowditch's contributions to maritime navigation and allowing the reader to more fully understand just how remarkable and important they were.It is quite inspiring to read how Nathaniel Bowditch, who experienced many traumatic events in his youth and childhood, made such a meaningful - albeit a bit obscure today - contribution to mankind by rewriting the book on Maritime navigation. While he had excellent intelligence, he did not have much luck in his early years, and his accomplishments are largely due to his dogmatic perseverence to educate himself against all odds.My favorite parts of the book described his ocean voyages - how he solved various problems of navigation and how he won the allegiance of the motley crew of every ship he sailed on.My children are not old enough yet for this story, but I look forward to the day they are."},{"Title":"Carry On, MR. Bowditch","review":"Jean Latham's 1955 Newbery award winner is an easy-to-read fictionalized biography of the early life and career of Nathanial Bowditch of Salem. Set in a proud Massachusetts sailing village and on the high seas, the story rolls along like a Yankee trader: now billowing ahead, now becalmed, now swamped yet often riding triumphant swells with exotic cargo. How a youth denied a Harvard education literally rewrote the book on 18th century navigation, thus making the ocean safer for all sailors.Since the storyline must obey the facts, the author operates under some literary constraint. The stout-hearted protagonist suffers repeated family losses, yet he clings to his ideal of an accurate book, which captains can trust and will save lives the world over. While indentured in a ship's chandlery, Nat cherishes his dreams of higher education, teaching himself mathematics, astronomy, navigation and three languages.Nat's genius for detail and swift mental calculations of figures make him a wonder in an age when most sailors relied on gut instincts (Lead, Log and Lookout,)for the common man clung to his inbred superstitions, rejecting fancy book learning from mere lubbers. It took a Yankee youth to identify the fatal errors in Moore's sacred charts. Young readers will appreciate Latham's extensive dialogue and the excellent b/w sketches by John Cosgrave. Read as Biography or Maritime History, this book breezes along like a trim Yankee clipper."},{"Title":"Carry On, MR.

Rather than letting his new life depress him, he began the process of educating himself. He found he had a talent for math and navigation, and became a famous navigator at sea. I could not put this story down, even though it was written a long time ago and is a historical novel."},{"Title":"Carry On, MR. Bowditch","review":"I first read this beautifully and simply written book when I was about ten and it immediately became my favorite. I identified with Nathaniel Bowditch in many respects - my name is also Nathaniel and I also love math - but still he amazed me with his intense desire to learn and persevere through struggles.I learned alot from this story. I was fascinated by Nathaniel Bowditch's amazing brilliance (writing an almanac as a teenager and doing insanely complex math problems in his head), his hard work (studying multiple languages from books), and his humility (teaching sailors math and navigation, giving them confidence in themselves). Amazingly, he did all this though his life was full of struggles. For me, someone who already liked to learn, this story powerfully reinforced just how exciting and valuable it is to gain more knowledge and then pass it on.Today, about 10 years since I first read this book, I still love to read it. The title of \\"favorite book\\" has since passed on, but something still excites me about the impact one man can have because he dedicated himself to learning and to helping others through what he learned. That's a message young people, especially those already excited about learning, need to hear. And that's why those kids need to read this book."},{"Title":"Carry On, MR.

Nat's dream is to enter Harvard and get a degree. However, that dream is cut short when his father sends him to be apprenticed to a bookkeeper because he cannot support Nat. Even this apprenticeship cannot stop Nat from learning. Using his position to his advantage, he uses the books around him whenever he has time. He comes across Newton's \\"Principia\\" He discovers, chagrined, that it is written in Latin, which he cannot comprehend. He tackles this problem by using his memory of the Bible and comparing it with a bible written in Latin. As he slowly but surely translates Principia, he develops a love for languages.Carry On, Mr. Bowditch is a book that inspires us to never give up our dreams no matter how bad our situation is.

They all live in Salem, MA with their mother, father, and grandmother. I think that the author, Mrs. Lathem, was trying to tell us that even a genius can have some emotional times too.

Bowditch","review":"Nathaniel Bowditch is incredibly intelligent. In school he did problems on his second day that even the most advanced students couldn't do. When he was very young his mother passed away, followed by his grandmother three months later. When he was twelve he was signed up as an apprentice by his father. As an apprentice he was not allowed to go anywhere unless he was given permission. He learned all about book keeping and navigation, and his intelligence rose. When he was released nine years later, he was given a job as bookkeeper and second mate on a ship. He ended up rewriting \\"Moore's Navigating Guide\\" because it had thousands of fatal mistakes, which had cost the lives of numerous sailors. He was eventually promoted to first mate and eventually became captain of his own ship. He also had taught the sailors on most of his ships navigating, and discovered an easier way to use navigating devices. Carry on, Mr. Bowditch by Jean Lee Latham is a great book about how determination can get you anywhere.This book was good because it had a human side. Nat was sad when his Mom died. Nat also got caught up in work often, and sometimes this would help him to take his minds off things. No matter how hard things got for Nat, whether humiliation or distress he kept on going which made him seem very human. Also in the book you could see how they impacted him because this book told his entire life and he would reflect on the things he had done later on in the book.I liked this book because it told Nat's whole life. In this book you really got to see how he matured while he was at sea, or with his marriages. You got to grow up with him and that made it seem really personal. You saw him go from a child to a young adult, and a young adult into a man. It made the book a lot more interesting than the books about certain events.This book was interesting because Nathaniel achieved so much. When I was finished with the book I felt proud of him. He had sailed into Manila harbor as the first man from Salem to do so. He had corrected numerous mistakes in the prominent sailing manual of the time. Nat discovered a new, faster, and more efficient way to work lunars. He taught sailors how to do everything he knew how to do, and many sailors became second mates, first mates, or captains of their own ships. Nat popularized book sailing, or sailing using graphs and tables which was thought to be very dangerous before then.This book was great because it had a lot of action. Whether sailing though a storm or struggling through the loss of a family member, this book kept me on the edge of my seat. Nat's life was filled with achievements (plus some bumpy roads), and it was exciting o watch his purpose in life fall into plan. This was just an overall great and exciting book.G.

Bowditch","review":"Winner of the 1956 Newbery Medal for Children's Literature, Jean Lee Latham's Carry On, Mr. Bowditch tells the fascinating story of Nathaniel Bowditch, the author of the all-around and famous reference book for sailors, The American Practical Navigator, also known as The Sailor's Bible.Endowed with a keen intellect towards mathematics and hard science, Nathaniel Bowditch was unable to foster those inherent gifts in an academic setting, most notably, Harvard University, the school of his dreams. However, due to his poor economic circumstances, he had to cast his academic ambitions aside and grow up fast, ultimately becoming an apprenticed servant to the wayfaring lives of sea captains, crews and schooners. Though not in a classroom setting, Nathaniel Bowditch continued on with his self-education after work, analyzing and scrutinizing the navigational tools and mathematical charts of the time. With his real-world experience, love of math and science and acute meticulousness for navigational accuracy, he realized that the available instruments and graphs that sea captains were using were seriously flawed, so detrimental, in fact, that they were in part (with the aid of nature) primarily culpable in the unnecessary deaths of those who made their living by the sea. With that epiphany, he went about correcting long-standing errors that many held to be flawless. With his vast mathematical knowledge and newfound emancipation as a ship's servant, he compiled and wrote the definitive and still-in-use reference book for sailors, The American Practical Navigator.In the book, Latham portrays Bowditch not as an entitled academic snob who feels he has been wronged by life; quite the opposite. He is depicted as earthy, approachable, generous, curious, quiet and patient. He comes off as one of the quiet friends in the the group of rowdies who you just naturally embrace because of his inherent decency and good character. Considering the numerous deaths of Bowditch's loved ones throughout his lifespan, Latham could have described him as a severely wounded soul bogged down with life. But perseverance and passion do ring supreme in this impeccable children's book, for it showcases many sterling qualities-via one simple yet complex historical figure-that we would like out kids to be imbued with: perseverance, self-reliance, a love for math and science, determination, inquisitiveness. And a whole lot more. Even as an adult, Carry On, Mr. Bowditch, for me, was an eye-opening, fun and learning experience, a nautical yarn that evoked schooners, wharves, tallow candles, stories, adventures on the high seas, but most significantly, the vitalness of math and science in our academic and independent curriculum. A stellar read for kids and adults as well as being a deserving winner of the Newbery Medal."},{"Title":"Carry On, MR. Bowditch","review":"Set just after the Revolutionary War period, tall sailing ships sailed around the world, trading spices, clothing, machines, and ideas, young Nat Bowditch grew up in Salem, Massachusetts, part of a family of sailors. When he was only 12 years old, he was indentured at a Chip Chandlery - a sort of hardware store for ships and sailors. While there, he discovered that he had a knack for learning on his own.When he was sent on an errand to look something up in Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, he discovered a whole new world of interesting things to learn about. However, when he got to the advanced math, he became stumped because the Cyclopaedia only skimmed over the subject rather than diving deeply into it. To solve his questions, he was given the loan of a copy of Isaac Newton's Principia\\" to learn the math, but it was written in Latin. To learn Latin, Nathan began with his Bible, John 1:1, \\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\\" He then read it in Latin, used a dictionary to look up words he didn't know, and moved forward. Once he became sufficiently comfortable with Latin and the Bible, Nathan started in on Principia - he would work to translate each word of a sentence, and then had to figure out what the sentence meant!By the time Nat was 21, and at the end of his indenture, he had learned quite a lot about many different things. He was offered a job with a group of men who were going to survey the countryside around Salem. His great success with this job landed him his first opportunity to sail on a ship, thus beginning his several trips across the oceans and around the world.Everyone depended on Moore's Navigator to know where things were in and about the ocean, but because of the huge number of computations in each table and the large number of tables in the book, no one had ever checked the math. Therefore, for many years, ships and sailors had been killed by the sea because of the mistakes found in Moore's. Nathaniel Bowditch set out to check each computation so that corrections could be published, but by the time he found 8000 mistakes, he decided it would be easier to just write his own book. \\"It's a simple matter of mathematics!\\" he'd say.Nat included in his book, The American Practical Navigator, simply worded instructions to use a sextant, the definitions of ship words, how to navigate a ship, a new method of \\"taking a lunar\\", as well as all the various tables that go with each. His goal in writing the book was that anyone who could follow the instructions and read the charts, along with do simple addition and subtraction, could navigate confidently.Today, the American Practical Navigator, or \\"Bowditch\\"is the standard for ships and sailors around the world. It is an easy-to-read reference book that is interesting and understandable. Regularly updated, it has gone through at least 75 editions since 1802, when it was first published. \\"Bowditch is carried on the bridge of every U.S. Navy ship and should be the mainstay of any serious navigator's library.\\" (http://astore.amazon.com/idrathebesail-20/detail/0939837544)Carry On, Mr. Bowditch is one of my personal all-time favorite books, so I was especially happy to re-read it for this assignment.

The science of navigation by star and lunar sightings had finally arrived.When the Manila galleon was busy plying the route to Mexico laden with spices and silk, the ship from Salem called the Astrea, and a few others, sailed to the other side of the world carrying with it the first cargoes of abaca that ever reached the east coast of the United States. Without Bowditch aboard and his genius for mathematics the navigation relying solely on dead reckoning would have been next to impossible, if not downright hazardous for any merchant to make a profit. A wonderful story about sailing ships and the courageous men that manned them during the time of sail."},{"Title":"Carry On, MR. Bowditch","review":"This is a story of a life that impacted the world. Through poverty Nathaniel Bowditch was unable to go to Harvard and had to grind through a nine-year apprenticeship but throughout that time he kept up his study of mathematics. Because of his mastery of mathematics he was able to navigate without reliance on sun or stars making the seas a safer place for all the sailors in the world through the publication of \\"The American Practical Navigator\\". This story of a little known giant of history is full of interest at many levels. Boys and Girls from ten years upwards would find a this a fascinating and inspiring read."},{"Title":"Carry On, MR.

The book isn't totally repeated. He does have some new information in it that wasn't mentioned before, like there's this one chapter and it has different prayers you can say to the God and Goddess, but I would think a serious Wiccan could make up their own spells/prayers since there's more feeling to it.I'm not saying this book is bad.

Aside from some practical info like advice to reading and compiling information from various sources (as much of what solitiaries learn are typically from books), and two well-done chapters about Goddess and God, it just in no way compares to the beauty and heart of the first book.His other books on natural magic however, are wonderful!

Cunningham seemed more cordial and open-minded in his former book. In reading the second book, bear in mind that Wicca is a very personal religion.

He makes it clear that he is not against group innitiation, simply that it is not necessary, and his suggestions for self-innitiation were designed for those who do not have the luxury of a teacher and coven to join. His references to &quot;what feels right&quot; are in regards to designing rituals and such details as wearing a robe, or going skyclad. He also discusses other practical matters like unprepared rituals, being too sick to perform a ritual, and what level or secrecy you should have about your practices.The second section is mainly how to pray to the god and goddess, and some information on rites and magic.In the 3rd section cunningham has outlined how to go about beginning your own tradition (something common for a solitary to do, by choice if not necessity) without losing sight of what wicca is. In the section on tools he stats that &quot;If you created a tradition that never utilized any of these tools, it probably wouldn't be Wiccan.&quot; (p106) So it's very clear that he is mindful of what wicca is, and makes sure to be clear about how much originality is allowed before it stops being wicca. It even has advice on teaching and questions you should ask yourself before agreeing to teach someone.This book is very straight-forward about what wicca is and how to make wicca truly a part of your life, even without a coven. Coven members might find this an interesting read, with a few good ideas for covens to use, but the book is very clear that it is teaching those that have no teacher."},{"Title":"Living Wicca: A further guide for the solitary practitioner (Llewellyn's practical magick series)","review":"I found this book (as well as it's predecessor &quot;Wicca,&quot; also by this writer) to be both accessible and practical for the solitary witch. Cunningham was a prolific writer with dozens of books to his name, even though he died (sadly) several years ago in his 30's. There is a reason for his popularity: he was a good writer and understood his Craft. He was also a good teacher, able to explain many complex ideas so he could reach the broadest audience.This book would be like a Wicca 102 course, a good extension of his introductory &quot;Wicca.&quot; He delves more deeply into the inner life of the Witch in this book, having gone over the basics very effectively in &quot;Wicca.&quot; He reviews these but does not go into the depth of &quot;how-to,&quot; but more &quot;why-to.&quot; Cunningham realized that not everyone who is interested in Wicca or is a practitioner has access to an established coven and therefore, access to one-on-one training by a High Priest/ess. (Even Raymond Buckland, the &quot;father&quot; of modern-day Wicca in the US has come to recognize this.)&quot;Living Wicca&quot; is a must-have, in my opinion. Cunningham goes over dedication rites, holidays, magick symbols, and much more. If you have an open mind and heart, Cunningham will definitely ring true."},{"Title":"Living Wicca: A further guide for the solitary practitioner (Llewellyn's practical magick series)","review":"This is not an instructional book like its predecessor was, but rather a small tome of useful and reassuring advice about such things as secrecy, doing ritual while you're ill, teaching and so forth. The chapter on the gods is especially well-written and will be of great use for those coming from backgrounds that have given them negative feelings about the god, and I agree with Cunningham when he says that it's your choice whether to worship the goddess only, but for balance, it's best to include both deities. It also includes many pages of easy-to-draw symbols for use in your book of shadows and solid information about and examples of ethics to include in your book.

Addressing such questions as \\"what should I tell my friends and family?\\" and \\"should I practice while I'm sick?\\", this book acts as more of a practical guide than an informational tool about the Craft, and to be honest I am not quite sure how necessary it is. It answers some questions for beginners, but questions that are all about practice, and none about history or technique. I originally bought this book because it came highly recommended to me as a good follow up to Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner\\", but these are two quite different books, and \\"Living Wicca\\" is in no way a continuation of where Cunningham left off.

Ask any magical person and all they have is praise for Scott Cunningham. That is very rare.Scott Cunningham was versed in all sorts of magic. His specialty was Wicca. This book continues were his book \\"Wicca for the Solitary Practitioner\\" left off. since many Wiccan and magical practitioners in fact have no access to an actual coven are reliant upon self teaching. The solitary practitioner will have to develop his or her own Wiccan tradition while sticking close to the original Wiccan foundation. Scott Cunningham gives the beginner a foundation with which to build there own tradition.The solitary Wiccan will have to be self taught. Scott Cunningham give the neophyte the tools for such an endeavor. There are 4 basic tools for the lone practitioner. The first one is study. The lone Wiccan can read books to get their information. Books can take you pretty far as can a teacher or high priest but remember this eacch has it's limitations and both can only answer so many questions. The next tool is thought. Think for yourself and question everything. The next is prayer. pray to the God and Goddess for guidance when you are perplexed. Lastly experiment. Do the magic and see what works for you.What about illness? Should you do your rituals when you are sick? Sickness affects individuals in a variety of ways. The common sense approach is to modify your rituals accordingly and if you are seriously ill enough you may have to skip out. As an individual practitioner you will read up on many things. Gonna have to weed through it and decide what works best for you.I have taken a lot of material and wrote it down in my book of shadows. Some of it i have modified for my own personal use. Here a general outline for a self initiation.Self intiation1) Purification2) Alter Set Up3) Cast Circle and call quarters4)Invoke Goddess and God.5)Symbolic death of the old self6)Pray to Goddess and God- a dedication7) Cakes and Ale-Relaxation8) Thank the Goddess and God and open the circle.Many people will talk about learning Wiccan Mysteries and how most books do not teach the Wiccan mysteries. One does not need to be taught Wiccan mysteries directly. Simple observation of nature can teach you a lot. Watching an apple grow then fall from the tree and go through the process of decomposition and eventually sprout into a tree can teach us about the cycle of life and death. Scott Cunningham fills this chapter with plenty of examples.The part I liked best about the book was the sections dealing with prayers to the God and Goddess. I have copied several items down and modified them for my own use. Scott Cunningham informs us that the Goddess and God dwell within each of us as they do without. We need to pray to the God and Goddess and regularly as well as leave offerings.

I can testify that this book contains all the bnasic knowledge you need to become a Wiccan or magickal practitioner.

This book is completely devoid of any useful content.Do we really need a whole chapter discussing whether or not we should practice ritual when we're bedridden with illness? Apparently this subject is so important it deserves a whole chapter, I would have thought common sense would have answered it.This book is also characteristically well padded out with 26 pages of oversized drawings of Scott's symbol ideas, such as a water drop for water, or a heart shape for love &amp; a candle for....a candle! Is this really necessary information? I think not.Now you have all this important information you're supposedly ready to start your own tradition! Step one of course is choosing your tools, but first you must find out that &quot;the cup holds wine&quot;, &quot;incense is burned in the censer&quot; &amp; that the &quot;bell is rung at certain points&quot;, heavy stuff!Ritual design follows &amp; armed with the knowledge that red &amp; black are good colours for Samhain and that pomegranates are particularly seasonal, you can construct your Sabbats. It apparently doesn't matter that you know practically nothing of the meanings behind them, just so long as your colours are right.Although the blurb promises that by reading this book you will &quot;add depth &amp; great spiritual meaning to your rituals through the knowledge of the Wiccan mysteries (those are covered in 4 pages), I can't see that the suggestion of &quot;eating bread at Lughnassadh&quot; particularly fulfills that vow.Once all this is out the way you can learn the beliefs of Wicca (or what Scott percieves they are anyway) in all of 4 pages, this truly is the philisophical look at witchcraft promised in the blurb.You've created your Book of Shadows, so what next? Well it seems to be assumed that you are ready to teach &amp; spread your trite shallow tradition with others. It apparently doesn't matter that you don't know very much because Cunningham believes &quot;you already know more about Wicca than many others&quot;.In short this book is absolute trash. It's a waste of time, money &amp; energy. If anyone really believes that once they have read this they are following anything even approximating Wicca, then they are sorely misguided. If however you are looking for a decent starter book then I suggest In The Circle by Elen Hawke, where you will find the basis for a truly informed practical Craft."},{"Title":"Living Wicca: A further guide for the solitary practitioner (Llewellyn's practical magick series)","review":"Very good book to have on hand.

Not given to overly technical and confusing aspects of Wicca.I also found the information to be very reassuring to one who was somewhat intimidated by the presumed intricacies of the unknown.This book dispels a lot of misconception about Wicca and the perceived connection with the occult.Overall I found his book to be the perfect companion to a novice of Wicca or the individual simply seeking to expand his or her knowledge of this misunderstood lifestyleI have since purchased Mr. Cunningham's follow up book on the subject for more in depth knowledge on this fascinating subject."},{"Title":"Living Wicca: A further guide for the solitary practitioner (Llewellyn's practical magick series)","review":"This is a informative good read.

Scott Cunningham goes over Prayer, gives some ideas on how to do a ritual when you don't have access to all you're tools (like in a hotel room while on a trip), basic ideas on forming your own tradition, and bringing Wicca into your everyday life. I loved reading this book and recommend it and its predecessor to anyone. I can't wait to read it again and again! This book should be required reading for everyone interested in Wicca."},{"Title":"Living Wicca: A further guide for the solitary practitioner (Llewellyn's practical magick series)","review":"This book addresses no well-defined audience. The writing style assumes Wiccan background knowledge that solitary Wiccan novices will not have (knowledge that this book and its predecessor do not provide). Yet this book's discussions are not very useful for experienced Wiccans. This book is disappointing compared to Mr. Cunningham's excellent first book &quot;Wicca: A Guide For The Solitary Practitioner&quot;.In this book Mr. Cunningham is careful (pp. xi, 87, 124, and 138) to state that he is assisting solitary Wiccans who lack access to Coven teaching resources. He also states that solitary Wiccans must carefully incorporate basic Wiccan principles into their worship. The reader wonders if Mr. Cunningham's first book was criticized for its free and open writing style.Chapter 2, &quot;Secrecy&quot;, strongly discusses a controversial Wiccan topic. Here Mr. Cunningham acknowledges past persecution of Wiccans, and discusses his own past dealings with non-Wiccans. He also discusses the role of secrecy in magical activities.Chapters 3 through 7 deal with everyday Wiccan practices. Chapters 8 through 11 deal with Wiccan prayer and provide example prayers. These chapters' discussions are weak.Chapter 12, &quot;Magic and the Solitary Wiccan&quot;, deals with raising energy within the Circle and with directing it outside the Circle. This chapter's discussion relates primarily to Wiccan Coven members. Mr. Cunningham acknowledges (pg. 78) that the solitary Wiccans has few energy-raising options.The remainder of this book addresses creating and documenting your own Wiccan tradition. Mr. Cunningham discusses the Wiccan Goddess and the God. His Wiccan God discussion assumes an alienation of affection not reflected in his first book or in other Wiccan literature. Mr. Cunningham also discusses ritual accessories, ritual design, and traditional Wiccan beliefs and rules (with example Sets). He discusses creating your own Book of Shadows. Mr. Cunningham ends with an excellent discussion concerning if and how One should teach Wiccan beliefs to others.This book includes a comprehensive listing of Wiccan symbols (pg. 154). The book also includes a number of good and concise Suggested Reading lists (pp. 103, 125, 148, 180, and 185) and an excellent Annotated Bibliography.Mr. Cunningham's first book allowed a Wiccan true novice to create a free and open Wiccan tradition. This book is organized similarly, but its discussions are incomplete and would confuse a Wiccan novice. In addition, this book so stresses Coven membership that Wiccan novices might question the validity of solitary worship, defeating the book's stated purpose."},{"Title":"Living Wicca: A further guide for the solitary practitioner (Llewellyn's practical magick series)","review":"I am grateful that Scott Cuningham has written so many wonderful books to assist us with our journey towards a focused and personal relationship with our spiritual Deities. I love books with indexes because I like to study the same subjects in many books all in one session. Most of Scott's books are indexed. This book has helped me develop a meaningful and comfortable circle-casting. I use both this book and &quot;Wicca, a Guide for the Solitary Practitioner&quot; the most of all the books I have. I believe that more study and knowledge by reading many books on the subject has helped me to develop my Wiccan practice in accord with my intuition. Scott promotes intuitive practice. The seasonal festivals are not complicated which I appreciate. I also use &quot;Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Crystal, Gem &amp; Metal Magic&quot; quite often. Thank You, Scott for your contributions."},{"Title":"Living Wicca: A further guide for the solitary practitioner (Llewellyn's practical magick series)","review":"While this book doesn't break any huge new ground from his previous &quot;Guide For The Solitary&quot;, I think Cunningham's intent was to, once the reader has digested this tome, have you decide if the Wiccan way is for you or not. Even considering buying it, the reader is obviously delving deeper into the subject matter, and Cunningham's prose, enticing in its simplicity and honesty, makes that decision-making process easier. I'd recommend this book to any almost-Wiccan deciding whether to take the final step, and dedicate yourself to it."},{"Title":"Living Wicca: A further guide for the solitary practitioner (Llewellyn's practical magick series)","review":"I'm sure I'm in a minority here but here's my $.02... I made the mistake of reading this book AFTER 2 months of reading Wiccan 101 books. What does a publishing company do when a book sells like hot cakes? Take what was edited out of the first book and release it as a sequel with &quot;more information&quot;. This book has little valuable information that you couldn't get in more detail from books like 'The Craft' by Dorothy Morrison, and 'To ride a Silver Broomstick' by Silver Ravenwolf. If that was the eagerly awaited sequal to Wicca: Guide for the Solitary Practitioner, then I'm not impressed. It was full of general information that should have been in the first book to begin with.What aggravated me the most(and I see it's endemic of a lot of Wicca 101 books) is that whenever Mr. Cunningham would bring up an interesting subject or there'd be a prelude to something that you might not have read in any other book, there'd be this cop-out clause &quot;these mysteries will be revealed to you in due course&quot;. One might think that everything practical to magic literally falls out of the sky during meditation, in which case, what's the point in buying these books?Read this book and/or the preceding one if you have never read a book on general Wicca or you need literature written in a 6th grade format. If you have been reading for some time, don't get suckered into buying it. There really is nothing new or in depth in these pages.The only reason why I didn't give a 1 rating is that the writer is a respected author...but as this is my first book by him, I'm very disappointed. Hopefully 'Earth Magic' will be better..."},{"Title":"Living Wicca: A further guide for the solitary practitioner (Llewellyn's practical magick series)","review":"This book was very instructive when I first began my exploration of Wicca. As it suggests, I read it after Cunningham's &quot;Guide for the Solitary Practitioner.&quot; This book has a little overlap with the first one, but for the most part, it picks up where the other left off. You will essentially learn how to make your own tradition in Wicca. Cunningham recognizes that many of us are solitaries and that we may not feel comfortable being bound to worship in the way a particular coven or individual dictates. For many of us, this is what helped drive us away from &quot;mainstream&quot; organized religion. Thus, in this book, you will learn some of the traditions of Wicca, the meanings behind certain rituals, elements, etc. Upon learning these things, you are encouraged to take in and, if you like, modify the traditions to your particular comfort level or ability -- e.g., it's difficult to hold a rite on a mountain top if you live in a high-rise apartment in NYC. To be sure, this is an introduction. Should a student of the Craft want more detail and is ready to move on, I would recommend Eileen Holland's recent publication, &quot;The Wicca Handbook&quot; and Raven Grimassi's superb award-winning book, &quot;The Wiccan Mysteries.&quot; Both are excellent sources of information in your study of the Craft."},{"Title":"Living Wicca: A further guide for the solitary practitioner (Llewellyn's practical magick series)","review":"Cunningham is a very talented author, and Living Wicca is one of his greatest books. It is devoted to the Solitary Practitioner, helping the individual to create your own tradition, develop your relationship with the God/dess, ritual design, create your Book of Shadows, and even perform a self-initiation. There is a great chapter on Wiccan beliefs and &quot;rules&quot; that translate the Laws of the Ordains into plain language that is much more accessible to the beginner. At the end of this book, you will have a greater understanding of the everyday practices of Wicca, as well as a deeper connection with the God/dess"},{"Title":"Living Wicca: A further guide for the solitary practitioner (Llewellyn's practical magick series)","review":"In this follow up to his very successful handbook \\"Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner\\", Scott Cunningham expanded on his original material and gave the solitary practitioner more information, more material to build on and further encouragement to practice as they are inspired by their Deities.The book opens with a \\"Note to Traditional Wiccans\\". His original book, published in 1988, seemed to threaten many Traditionalists. This book, published in 1996, has a note to let them know that he never intended to attack their ideas or ideals, but rather he meant his books to be general access to those who are not part of Traditions, covens or to those who do not have access to traditional training.This book is broken into three sections; learning, practice and your own tradition. Scott advances the solitary path and gives guidance to those who want to pursue their spirituality even further.The first section, learning, contains the secret tool of self-teaching: Study, thought, prayer and experimentation. He is careful to explain that no two people learn the same way, and that we should experiment with the learning process, using hands on experience in determining how we best learn and how we should proceed with our studies. He uses his usual \\"Scott Cunningham\\" style of simply stating his material, making it easy for anyone to follow as he progresses. There is a discussion on secrecy in our practice, \\"Should I do it while I'm sick?\\" and the taking of magical names. Much of this will sound too easy or very unimportant, but Scott Cunningham seems to anticipate the questions of the inexperienced practitioner who does not have the benefit of someone to ask these questions. There is no stupid question. And this is the approach Scott takes.There is a section that addresses Self-Initiation. Again this is brought up because of the controversies that came about from his first book. Scott tries to clarify what he means by \\"Self-initiation\\" as he took a lot of flack from the Traditional Wiccans on this. However, in true Cunningham style, he manages to make it very clear what he means, and though it seems redundant to place this in the second book, he does so, and includes another short ritual which can be easily adapted to make it your own.Scott goes into the \\"Wiccan Mysteries\\" in this book as well. This material was once taboo to discuss outside the coven or tradition. Scott took up that challenge, in order that the Solitary Practitioner could add these to their practice, to make the spirituality deeper and have a better connection with their Deities. Discussion of reincarnation, the realization that the God and Goddess are part of us just as we are of them, that there is joy in every event that life has to offer and that mysteries are not really mysteries but self realizations make this section a real eye opener. And it is all discussed in delightfully simple and beautiful language.There is also discussion on incorporating Wicca into our everyday life, how we see \\"Karma\\" and the \\"Three Fold Law\\" and how magic fits into all of this. There is an explanation of the Wiccan Rede \\"Harm None...\\"From study comes practice. Scott looks at prayer, what it is and how to make it effective. He gives examples of prayer and chants, rites of thanks, simple Wiccan rites, creating the circle and raising energy. All essential parts of our practice simply discussed and laid out so you can just pick up the book and go.The last part discusses creating a tradition for you. Following the model of Traditional Wicca, Scott suggests how you can keep to the basic aspects that comprise the path of Wicca while molding it into a practice that speaks specifically to your personal spiritual needs.He is careful to discuss that there are basics that comprise the religion of Wicca, but there are also elements that allow the practitioner to bend the framework a bit so it meets the their needs. This is key to Wicca; it can evolve as we evolve, always addressing the practitioner, yet remaining in a form that is easily recognizable as Wicca.Scott carefully goes over these elements, showing where you can pull things to make the traditions specifically yours, yet having it remain always identifiable as Wicca. Discussions include Deity Concepts, tools, ritual designs, beliefs and rules. Some of these sections include Suggested Reading lists, or tables of correspondences to aid you in your choices. There is further discussion on Wiccan Symbols, Books of Shadow, and passing on your tradition. There is also a chapter on Living Wicca; walking the walk as well as talking the talk. The book concludes with a glossary and a bibliography.What Scott Cunningham started to do in his first book is continued in this second. The path of the Solitary Practitioner, in the Tradition of Scott Cunningham, is developed even further, giving the practitioner more food for thought, more direction and additional instruction in how to live as a Wiccan in today's world. The book is a good follow up to the first and is again a book that has been lovingly dog-eared and held dear by those who follow the Solitary path. boudica"},{"Title":"Living Wicca: A further guide for the solitary practitioner (Llewellyn's practical magick series)","review":"If you are looking for an extended primer on traditional Wicca as a living spirituality, Living Wicca is a must have. I have been practicing Wicca for 10 years, and I still refer to this book periodically for inspiration and reference. Living Wicca delves more into the ethics of being a Witch, living as a Witch, teaching, finding covens, and ways to create and expand your own Tradition and Book of Shadows. Scott Cunningham's books are must haves in general, but in particular Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner and Living Wicca are essential for a basic understanding of the Craft and for those who are curious about whether it's right for them or not. Scott was extremely instrumental in making Wicca more visible in America and helping us to become more accepted as a spiritual people. Unfortunately, Scott passed into the Summerland in March of 1993, but his works and spirituality live on. If it hadn't been for Scott and the two books I mentioned, I never would have started on this path. As with any religious book, it serves an informational purpose, but should not be considered as the &quot;only&quot; way. Also recommended reading: Starhawk's &quot;Spiral Dance&quot;, Silver Ravenwolf's &quot;To Ride a Silver Broomstick&quot;, Ann Moura's (Aoumiel) Green Witchcraft series, and books by Z. Budapest.

This is a great shame, because its predecessor is a good introduction to Wicca. Living Wicca seems like less of a guide to developing a Wicca of one's own, and more like Wicca the Cunningham Way. The author loops and swirls and writes all over the place save directly and coherently. It's my conviction that a fledgling Wiccan would be far better off working their imaginations than being spoonfed by this book. Oh, and if you look closely, you might notice all of the white space in the pages. It's true, this book has nothing much to say."},{"Title":"Living Wicca: A further guide for the solitary practitioner (Llewellyn's practical magick series)","review":"Cunningham is a wonderful author who takes a look at intermediate aspects of Wiccan culture. This book explores a variety of topics other books tend to either forget or just not mention. I was even suprised to find a chapter of tools of learning and also suprised to find a chapter on teaching Wicca to others. His chapters on prayer are good and include a variety of excellent prayers, but one may feel that Cunningham seems to think that if one does not put deep thought into prayer, the god/goddess will not hear him or her....which is not true, although there are effective methods of prayer. Part three (there are three parts to this book) is a one of a kind, truely incredible. It speaks on how to create your own tradition. It is probably a one of a kind for I have seen no other book with this type of information. Truely amazing, but ones who are not interested in starting their own tradition may honestly get bored with the abundance of information. One last note, the chapter on simple Wiccan rites and rites in emergency situations and away from home is truely incredible and is well worth the read. Cunningham is right, a Wiccan ritual can be held anywhere! Those that are not beginners will probably love this book.PS: One bizarre note: There were actually a few mistakes in this book, I don't know why, a few grammar errors and missing text. I am just wondering if Cunningham was alive to see it get published and one more thing, in my eyes, Wicca is monotheisitic, there are others like me too, and Cunningham should have mentioned it instead of calling it a Polytheistic religion, which it is, but still, not necessarily."},{"Title":"Living Wicca: A further guide for the solitary practitioner (Llewellyn's practical magick series)","review":"It is a good book, but he repeats a lot of stuff from Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner.

As always, Cunningham's direct, to-the-point writing style lends itself to ease of understanding. Overall I don't think it is as strong a work as his first book, only because it really isn't \\"all you need to know\\" about moving to the next level--this isn't a bad thing! I personally found his chapters on Diety Concepts and on Ritual Design most useful, but I certainly wanted to find other resources to complement them, and I think that's the case with most of this book--it doesn't stand alone very well.

The other half of those interviewed were still SME majors as seniors, and planned to graduate with a degree in natural science, mathematics or engineering.Both groups of students voiced serious criticism of the deliberately competitive, grade on a curve, &quot;overwhelm them and weed them out&quot; approach that is widely used in teaching freshman and sophomore courses in SME-track curricula, particularly calculus, physics and organic chemistry.The authors found it very difficult to predict which students had switched out of SME-track majors and which had stayed using any of the stay-vs-switch criteria commonly cited by SME faculty members, which include native ability, willingness to work hard, college grades, gender, ethnic background, and high-school preparation for college-level work in the sciences.Rather, they found that the chief distinguishing characteristic of those who did not switch was the individuals' willingness to put up with the mental and emotional abuse heaped upon them by this &quot;drinking from a fire hose&quot; approach to instruction in their freshman and sophomore years.These conclusions fit well with my own experiences at a major West Coast research university, as a white male undergraduate with a 750+ SAT verbal score and a 700+ SAT math score (without any special &quot;prepare for the SAT&quot; courses of any kind) who had graduated in the top 5% of my West Coast suburban high school class. I switched out of the SME track at the end of my sophomore year for several of the reasons cited in this book, and graduated two years later with a liberal arts degree in a field that had taught me to think critically, not memorize by blind repetition. Then I returned to the SME track later as a graduate student (no easy feat!) after I had had time to revisit the concepts thrown at me willy nilly in those first two years and see what they were good for. Today, I'm a registered professional engineer with an engineering master's degree, doing quite well in my field.Based on this book's carefully assembled results and my own experience, I have avoided sending any of my children to my alma mater as freshmen or sophomores.Instead, I have recommended that they do as my younger brother did. He did his freshman and sophomore work at a good community college, then transferred to a small state college with a very limited graduate program for his upper-division courses. Next he earned his master's degree at my alma mater, then went on to another nationally-ranked graduate program for his PhD. At each institution, he found himself in the group of students that enjoyed the focused attention of the faculty, and his SME learning experience was far, far superior to mine.Read this book. Think about it carefully. Then plan your educational strategy to avoid being &quot;weeded out&quot; by SME faculty who don't want to admit that you exist until you have put up with two solid years of cheerful neglect and brutal abuse."},{"Title":"Talking About Leaving: Why Undergraduates Leave The Sciences","review":"This book documents the tragic exit of great talents from the natural sciences that results when overdriven undergraduates lose sight of the fun and sense of wonder that are at the heart of the most successful scientific careers.Making &quot;Feynman's Lost Lecture: The Motion of Planets Around the Sun&quot; (David and Judith Goodstein, 1996) and &quot;Anno's Mysterious Multiplying Jar&quot; part of the required reading list for all entering freshmen--and giving them the chance to discuss these books with lively professors who have managed to retain their own Feynmanesque senses of fun and wonder--would be a helpful antidote for this."},{"Title":"Five Mountains: The Rinzai Zen Monastic Institution in Medieval Japan (Harvard East Asian Monographs)","review":"Not everyone wants to explore the history of Rinzai Zen as an Institution - but, if you do, Martin Collcutt's study is a veritable treasure trove. Potted within its pages (382, excluding the index and bibliography), you will find fascinating references to just about everything of significance concerning the formation of the 'Gozan' or 'Five Mountain System' - its precedents in Sung China, its patrons and supporters in Japan, the temple builders, key figures, secular and religious, all the regulations, and all the myriad processes involved in the maintenance of these inter-linked temple complexes.Even at their best, studies like this can be tedious, in places, but this well informed account is never dry. It explores macrocosmic factors, and surveys microcosmic details. Collcutt conveys an almost organic picture of the entire complex of processes - social, technical,human and spiritual - which brought the 'Gozan' system into being and made it a living entity. While all of this was ultimately directed to one end - the spiritual life nurtured in the Sodo or monks hall, Collcutt's study makes us keenly aware of the managerial and administrative skills required to run such large complexes. Rather like their equivalent in medieval or late medieval Europe, these monastic institutions virtually became thriving 'businesses'- running large landed estates, even employing hired labour. Beating the Medici family to the game by several centuries, the Chinese Buddhists were the first people to print paper money - and lend it at interest. As with the European monastic institutions, corruption and worldliness sometimes took over. Similar traits sometimes characterised life in the Japanese temples. Collcutt's study can be statistical in places, but this is always tempered by the human interest - the notable figures and events which have shaped life in these temples. It details the virtues, vices and the vicissitudes, which have left their mark upon the Gozan system."},{"Title":"Five Mountains: The Rinzai Zen Monastic Institution in Medieval Japan (Harvard East Asian Monographs)","review":"Most readers who come to this text are, no doubt, overly familiar with the more playful spiritual intensity of Japanese Zen, whether it be through the writings of stoic mountain hermits (say, Dogen); the peripatetic musings of hip flask, sake swilling outcasts (say, Santoka Taneda or Ryokan); the no nonesense monastic types (say, Hakuin); the earthy, gritty advice for living in the modern world (say, DT Suzuki); or even the American literati influences (say, Gary Snyder).Far fewer readers, however, will be familiar with the logistical organization of Zen temples in Japan. As esteemed Japan expert Edwin O. reischauer writes in the brief preface, \\"It is ironic that Zen philosophy, which is commonly charaterized as being beyond words, has inspired millions of words in English print, whereas Zen instituions, though vastly important in many aspects of medieval Japanese civilization and in no way beyond description, has drawn so few.\\"Indeed.Yet, does a book about the logistical organization of Rinzai's Gozan (\\"Five Mountain\\") temples sound boring?Perhaps. But let me tell you: this text is anything but boring! Author Martin Collcut takes a seemingly mundane subject and delivers a delightfully informative product that will not disappoint even the most discerning reader. Moreover, he neatly ties the development of the temple system into the existing socio-political milieu of Medieval Japan.Quite frankly, this is a dream book for a Japanese history \\"otaku\\" (lit: \\"buff,\\" or worse, \\"nerd\\" or \\"geek\\") like myself: clear and detailed but highly readable, unlike so many other academic texts.Lastly, I do not think you need to have too much knowledge of Japanese history or even Buddhism for that matter, as Collcutt does a great job of keeping the reader informed and up to date. Roughly speaking, there are three main branches of Zen in Japan: Rinzai (founded by Eisai), Soto (Dogen), and the lesser known Obaku (imported by Chinese monks in the Tokugawa Era). This book, of course, focuses on how the first, Rinzai Zen, which mirrored the organization of its \\"five mountain temples\\" on the Chinese model (and literally had main temples on five mountain sites).Though this book is full of details, it exceedingly engrossing at every turn. I wish I could give it 10 stars.Buy it today!"},{"Title":"Retirement Bible","review":"Introduction. Aiming to be a one-stop source for all things retirement related, the Retirement Bible largely succeeds in accomplishing its goal. Presenting sound and authoritative advice in a well-organized package, the book is appropriate for anyone at any age who is interested in planning for that important yet often neglected milestone in life: retirement.Traditional retirement plans. The book begins by covering the media-ignored pair consisting of Social Security and pension plans. Despite the chapter title of \\"Gambling on Social Security,\\" the author takes an overall optimistic perspective on the matter, arguing that the system will still be around a century from now due to political forces. That being said, the recommendation is wisely made that the rising generation's \\"best strategy is to plan for less.\\" On the subject of pensions, the author chastises the media for rarely mentioning the topic, even though almost half of private-sector workers still have them.Finding expert advice. The book next presents--in rather excruciating detail--a full three chapters on locating and using financial experts of various kinds. While the information is essentially useful, I felt the subject could have been covered in a single, pithy chapter. However, the author presented a well-formulated case for taking advantage of the experts. For most services, the author's apparent bias is toward the CFP designation, and fee-only planners are recommended.Common retirement vehicles. With a solid foundation to build upon, the retirement vehicles themselves are introduced, starting with 401(k)s. I particularly enjoyed the section titled \\"The Six Worst 401(k) Mistakes.\\" It presented in no uncertain terms the landmines that can explode in one's face when dealing with this common retirement plan. Additionally, a great review was provided of the standards that a high quality 401(k) should meet.When it came to IRAs, I felt the author assumed too much foreknowledge on the part of her readers. She talked a great deal about IRAs but never quite said what they are. Likewise, the explanation of IRA rollovers was given too early and was confusing. I also found the separate chapter solely devoted to inherited IRAs to be unnecessary, overly specialized, and ultimately fruitless.Stocks and mutual funds. The Retirement Bible beautifully explains stock picking and its related jargon. It is mildly conservative and declares that market timing is a waste of time. In short, the advice is to \\"Buy and Hold and Hold and Hold.\\" In one of the author's shining moments, she gives the best explanation I have ever read of how economic factors like interest rates and inflation affect the stock market. She further acknowledges that individual stock investing is not for everyone; nevertheless, thoughtful advice is provided on creating a balanced portfolio this way.As one thus might guess, the author raves about mutual funds. In particular, she expounds upon the virtues of index funds many times throughout the book. Mutual funds and other investments with high expense ratios are her greatest enemy, it seems, and on their heels are unnecessary taxes.Bonds. This area has always confused me, and the Retirement Bible was perfect on this point. It began at the ground level, stating that \\"a bond is an IOU.\\" The book pointed out that guessing interest rate movements is essentially pointless and recommended laddering bonds. Rather than being content to leave bonds as the only fixed-income investment to choose from, the author also wisely discussed alternatives.Withdrawal tactics. In a smart move, the author sets up realistic expectations for her readers in saying that many assumptions must be made in planning for cashing in one's retirement funds. Unfortunately, to mitigate the uncertainty of retirement planning she goes overboard in repeatedly extolling the virtues of Monte Carlo simulations at least three times throughout the book.General comments. As alluded to above, the author's overall approach to investing is to be risk averse without being overly constrained. \\"Trying to outsmart the market is futile,\\" she proclaims. While the subject is certainly debatable, I for one concur with her feelings. Likewise, I agree with the constant touting of index funds as the major core of a person's portfolio; I will follow this advice.Despite the reality that the author does \\"take sides\\" in certain instances, one of the Retirement Bible's strongest points is its simple and unbiased approach. In fact, the constant barrage of \\"Advantages of...\\" and \\"Disadvantages of...\\" sections almost becomes a clich&eacute; as one nears the book's end.As also mentioned earlier, the author sometimes assumes too much foreknowledge of her readers. In the chapter called \\"A Primer on Trusts,\\" for example, the fundamental definition of the term trust is never provided. Additionally, some terminology is simply used in a confusing manner. The terms bond and fixed-income investment are frequently used as synonyms even after the author has just finished explaining how utilities, convertible securities, preferred stock, and REITs are types of fixed-income investments.Another interesting quirk I noticed about the book is a slight but noticeable bias toward recommending certain companies over and over. Specifically, these were Vanguard, Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price. While the ostensible reason for this practice is that these institutions are low-cost leaders in their field, I still found myself getting the feeling at times that other companies out there had to be offering some useful services, as well.Finally, the most major suggestion I would make to the author is to include a chapter that \\"ties things together,\\" so to speak. At times, one feels as if stocks, funds, bonds, IRAs, 401(k)s, and the like are being discussed within a vacuum. I would have greatly enjoyed a chapter that brought the concepts together in a more meaningful manner than what is already provided.Conclusion. Though not a perfect book, the Retirement Bible for the most part lives up to its name. It covers a wide range of subjects while presenting simple, easy-to-follow advice that likely fits well with the risk profile of the average investor. It is, therefore, a fitting bible for retirement planning."},{"Title":"Retirement Bible","review":"LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY is a terrific wirter who has written a book that combines remarkable readability with comprehensive coverage of financial aspects of retirement. As in her prior book THE UNOFFICIAL GUIDE TO INVESTING and her most recent book THE INVESTING BIBLE, she puts her journalist's skills to good use having thoroughly researched this subject and written for a spectrum of readers ranging from those first approaching the subject to those already quite sophisticated.While lots of others have written about calculating how much you need to have (or to save) for retiremeent and about stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, she covers these beautifully but also covers oft neglected topics: finding the right financial experts, investing and spending strategies during retirement, a nice introduction to estate planning and trusts, managing the family dynamics of inheritance, and the role of charitable giving in retirement income and estate planning. She has also included a thorough and well researched &quot;resource guide&quot; listing by topics the best of names, addresses, phone numbers, and website addresses for further help and study.Just how good is this book? Good enough that we've given it as a present to good friends who also hope to one day retire comfortably."},{"Title":"Retirement Bible","review":"This book truly is one of the most comprehensive books on retirement I have ever read. The book is written in an easy-to-read format and helps make complicated areas more palpable to absorb. Areas of great information include, managing your cash flow in retirement (The &quot;Trinity Study&quot;, very interesting,) strategies for 401(k) and IRA Rollovers and the implications of certain actions. If you are saving for retirement, nearing retirement, or in retirement, I would keep this book around as a reference. The book does need to be updated for the changes to the Required Min. Dist Rules.

While the Retirement Bible is written for all ages, I appreciate the speciic advice for retirees like myself. I particularly liked the chapter that's devoted to investing strategies for those already in retirement. Usually the books I've seen at the store assume that you've got 25 or 30 years to save.

The chapter on inherited IRAs made me worry that I may inadvertantly shortchange my kids if I don't get my act together."},{"Title":"Retirement Bible","review":"I bought this book after hearing Lynn O'Shaughnessy speak up in the Bay Area and I'm very glad I did. I've been able to find the answers to all sorts of questions I had about retirement, including what I should do with my 401(k) when I leave my company shortly. I was pleasantly surprised to find chapters in the back of the book on estate planning, trusts and philanthropic giving.

O'Shaughnessy's investment advice is excellent and the writing style is very easy to read.This is one of the most comprehensive books on retirement planning and investing I have seen. My hat is off to O'Shaughnessy for putting together such a comprehensive book.As an experienced investor, I was familiar with most of the material in this book. I did learn that 1974 was the year Congress changed the 403B laws allowing teachers the right to invest in mutual funds. Until that point, teachers were stuck investing in annuities which are high cost and full of penalty fees.She also does a good job of over-viewing the many types of trusts. She explains the different types of trusts in \\"English\\" the regular person can understand, versus legalese.I was disappointed in the lack of material on asset allocation. There is some simple charts on risks associated with portfolios made up of various mixtures of stocks and bonds. There is very little material covering the various types of asset classes, their correlation with each other, how these correlations change over time, and how to decrease risk using combinations of asset classes. This book was written in 2000, and at that time asset allocation was not yet a popular subject with investors.Also since the book was written in 2000, before the 3 year stock market crash after the Tech Bubble, she paints stock market investing with a relatively rosy picture.She does a very good job of sprinkling \\"buyer beware\\" alarms throughout the book. Some of these include high cost annuities, sales people pushing annuities to teachers in 403B's versus mutual funds, commissioned brokers who sell products that benefit them and not you, risks of early retirement buyouts, and insurance salesman with magic solutions for single versus dual life retirement pension payouts.All-in-all, a great book for investors on how to plan for retirement. Some of her \\"buyer beware\\" alarms could easy pay for the cost of this book many times over.I would suggest companion books to supplement this book including:The Richest Man in BabylonBogle on Mutual Funds: New Perspectives for the Intelligent InvestorThe Millionaire Next DoorThe Four Pillars of Investing: Lessons for Building a Winning PortfolioA Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing, Ninth EditionThe Coffeehouse Investor: How to Build Wealth, Ignore Wall Street, and Get On With Your LifeThe Bogleheads' Guide to InvestingWealth: Grow It, Protect It, Spend It, and Share ItAll About Asset Allocation."},{"Title":"Retirement Bible","review":"I just love this book.

I learned that my investment choices were mediocre and that I was paying way too much money for them. I'm in the process of switching my money to Vanguard, one of the ideas from the book.

This book is a must if you keep mice or are thinking of getting a mouse.D.S"},{"Title":"Mice: A Complete Pet Owner's Manual (Pet Owners Manuals)","review":"This book is an invaluable resource for anyone thinking of purchasing mice for pets, whether you're a first timer or an experienced mouse owner. However, there are two trouble spots I'd like to point out first:- Concerning the section about \\"mouse condos\\": Biefeld asserts that a simple flat table with no walls of any sort can make an excellent home for mice. I strongly advice against this. Many mice will jump off the edge of tables regardless of the height to the floor (especially in their \\"jumping stage\\"), and sometimes mice are, quite simply, clumsy, and will tumble off the edge of ledges involuntarily. A cage / aquariaum will serve your mice much better as a home.- Biefeld also somewhat idealizes the concept of taming your mouse, stating that playing with it while young will make it so comfortable with you it will want to be picked up. This is simply not true. You can play with a young mouse in the gentlest fashion and still have it scurry away from your hand for the rest of its life. Also placing your hand / finger motionless in front of a mouse in a cage is often an invitation to get bitten. Not that this should discourage you in any way; it's simply instinct. But don't expect your mouse to become like a dog.Other than these points, the guide is fantastic. Covers almost every area you could possibly need, including mouse anatomy and nutrition, breeding habits and pregnancy, genetics, mouse behavior and social interaction, different types of mice, and various other areas. I find myself constantly going back to the book to look up one thing or another. Highly reccommended if you own or are going to own mice."},{"Title":"Mice: A Complete Pet Owner's Manual (Pet Owners Manuals)","review":"Bielfeld's books isn't bad. It has more depth than most of the books on mice out there. It isn't written for elementary school students acquiring a first pet who might have been reading only 1-3 years. However, this still isn't sufficient as the only book you'd need if you have pet mice. While it goes into genetics, the material is not helpful (either for someone just starting out with no understanding of genetics or someone who is past the basics and wants more information about genetics and mice). The information (and drawings) on mice condos is entertaining but very misleading--it is not true that mice won't leap/jump to the floor (I've seen them do it plus youngsters in the \\"flea stage\\" accidently take some great falls). So the housing section has problems. Some of the more basic questions that a first-time mouse owner would want to know (how much to feed mice? what kind of bedding to use?) this book ducks. While there are a lot of pages on breeding, they are of no use to either a first-time owner with an accidental litter wondering how to keep the pregnant doe healthy or what to do/not do with the litter or someone interested in intentionally mating mice for several litters. While there is an extensive section on healthcare and disease, I found it to be of no use because it's so general. Common problems mouse owners may often encounter aren't mentioned while other issues I haven't seen in 3 years of mouse breeding are covered.In summary, this book has more detail and depth than many of the other mouse books out there in the mass public. But is insufficient as a sole resource for first-time mouse owners. And those seeking more advanced information (on genetics, care of colonies, breeding) will be disappointed by the lack of specificity."},{"Title":"Mice: A Complete Pet Owner's Manual (Pet Owners Manuals)","review":"Here is my 8 year old daughter's review.

Well-written concurrent Ada programs can be extremely portable and support multi-core and multiple processors automatically. This book explores, in-depth, the concurrent programming (\\"tasking\\") part of the Ada language. The authors then show how the concurrent programming facilities of Ada are augmented by the language to support real-time programming. These standard real-time facilities are state-of-the-art, extending, for example, beyond the POSIX real-time facilities in their expressive power.The book first establishes the necessary foundation for understanding concurrent programming by explaining the possible problems (e.g., deadlocks and race conditions) and highlighting some of the mechanisms traditionally used in concurrent programming, such as semaphores and message-passing.The tasking part of Ada is then covered in full detail, necessarily including interactions with some other parts of the language, such as exceptions, but also including interactions with the Ada object-oriented language facilities. The implementations of a number of reusable concurrency abstractions serve to illustrate the use of the tasking features.The authors next lay another foundation, this time for scheduling in real-time systems, and show how Ada directly supports the common approaches. Both fixed-priority and dynamic-priority dispatching are supported by Ada and these are covered in detail. Ada 2005 also defines a number of time-related abstractions, such as a monotonic clock and timing events, and these are also covered completely. As in the concurrent programming part of the book, a number of reusable abstractions are implemented; in this section they illustrate the real-time language facilities. A discussion of the popular Ravenscar Profile, adopted by some other languages, is included.No language is perfect and Ada is no exception. The tasking part of Ada 83 was particularly controversial in the domain of real-time systems. Ada 95 addressed many of these issues and added some new ones. Ada 2005 does the same. These issues are not ignored in the book.I own 46 books on Ada (not counting older editions of some of them), gathered over 27 years of applying the language. Some are excellent and some not, but this one is highly prized. I highly recommend it to professionals and students alike."},{"Title":"Concurrency in Ada","review":"Ada has been one of few languages which provides facilities for concurrent programming, but readings for the feature had been limited.

The fact that his ex-friend Mr Schneider was cast in a starring so early in his career is a bone of contention that the author should really deal with.When reading the book it is good to remember that the author and Mr Schneider at the time were both between 18 and 20yrs old. Mr Jensen left Hollywood at 20 and admits that he didn't keep in contact with Mr Schneider and so cannot know what sort of man he would really become. Since Schneider found fame so early it would be a real feat of accomplishment for any young man to keep both feet on the ground and come out of the sudden plunge into the spotlight unscathed. Some room has to be given for the boy to become a man. Mr Jensen even goes so far as to criticise Mr Schneider's mother for supporting him financially before his role in the Dukes (a period of a maximum of a year since he gained the part at 18) and for being heavily involved in her sons life, while his own mother charged him rent therby forcing him to a day job while John was free to attend auditions. Real sour grapes. He also trivialises Johns work with the Childrens Miracle Network Telethon by calling him nothing more than the 'host' of the show. The book appears to have been given enough facts to give this authors bias view of the 'truth' some credability.As I said earlier, the book has very little to do with the Dukes and appears to have been given the title to sell more copies. The only refrences to the cast is to applaude the acting of the older cast members,some of which he admits have never spoken more than 10 words to him, and to put the context of the show down. In the later parts of the book he refers to the show as embarrasing and obviously cannot understand why it was, and still is, so popular. He also claims that Catherine Bach (Daisy Duke) cannot act at all. If you want to but this book as a Dukes fan I do not recommend it since there is no other information about the show contained in it.On a final note, the books selling point of it being the true story of \\"sex, drugs and intrigue\\" is covered by the author telling us that he and John Schneider never took drugs and John was laid alot due to male teenage hormones, and fame going to his head (or other places!)."},{"Title":"Trespass In Hazzard County: My life as an insider on The Dukes of Hazzard","review":"This book should have the title \\"How to Insult a Friend:My Life as a Jealous Companion of John Schneider\\".

The entire book gives examples of his belief that he is more talented than John Schneider. First this author is jealous of the fact that John had help from his mother. He states that she paid his bills. He's talking about a time when John was going to high school and doing summer stock theater. I would hope that his mother would pay his bills while he was this age! He won the role of Bo Duke when he was barely 18. What is this author talking about?He states that John had talent and charisma, was star quality, in 1975, at age 15. But then when John became a star he writes repeatedly that John's acting was awkward, wooden, and mugged. He can't understand why their agent sent John to audition for the \\"Dukes of Hazzard\\" role and not him. Apparently the agent knew who had the talent and this anthor still hasn't realized his limited potential.Before the \\"Dukes of Hazzard\\" audition this author states that John had a beautiful, rich, baritone singing voice. After he became jealous the author claims that John was not successful after the \\"Dukes\\" - his movies bombed and he only had minor hit records on the country charts. He doesn't tell the fact that John had many country hits in the top ten, four hit #1, and even had a #1 album! The author also states that John became a host for the Children's Miracle Network Telethon. He is more than a host. He and Marie Osmond were the cofounders. There's a big difference between being a host and a founder! This author writes as though John's current role in \\"Smallville\\" is so minor that it shouldn't be mentioned. Why then was he considered for an Emmy nomination for this role?If you are looking for a book about the \\"Dukes of Hazzard\\", this book isn't about that series. If you are a John Schneider fan, this book isn't for you. If you are someone who just wants the facts, this book isn't for you either. If, however, you want to know how to insult someone because they have more talent than you and you can't accept that, then this book should be high on your list.In my opinion every copy of this book should have been in that outhouse with Luke's car magazines when Bo Duke blew it sky high with that dynamite equipped bow and arrow!"},{"Title":"Trespass In Hazzard County: My life as an insider on The Dukes of Hazzard","review":"I've been a casual Dukes of Hazzard fan for a while and always enjoyed the show. It wasn't Shakespeare but certainly wasn't meant to be, and it had a fun, lighthearted quality. When I saw this book at a friend's I thought it would be interesting but instead it was just sad. The author, also an actor, was a schoolfriend of John Schneider ('Bo Duke') and came to Hollywood with him as a sort of personal assistant. The two men shared an agent, and Jensen is clearly still miffed that Schneider and the agent did not contact him for the Dukes audition intially. He says he 'might not have gotten the part' but in his put-downs and harsh analysis of Schneider it becomes pretty clear that he feels he would have been the better choice. He details some promiscuous behavior on the part of Schneider, who was in his late teens and early 20s at the time, while also describing what sounds like an emotionally abusive relationship Schneider was in with a Hollywood starlet (Schenider was the victim), but other than that the 'teaser' of this book - sex and drugs - makes it sound as though the Hazzard stars were the ones indulging, which they were not. While Jensen is a decent writer and some of his descriptions about his time in Hollywood are interesting from the standpoint of one of the many low-level actors there, he clearly has some pain and hurt from his broken friendship with Schenider, and as in all such situations it very much colors his view. The book isn't bad, but it is sad in a lot of ways, and it also reads as quite biased against Schneider and some of the other Dukes cast and crew. Anyone wanting some Dukes on-the-set info is probably not going to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Trespass In Hazzard County: My life as an insider on The Dukes of Hazzard","review":"I had been reluctant to read this book. After all the Dukes of Hazzard is my all-time favorite television show. I have wholesome, pure image of the actors and show and would like to believe that they are all decent people. Being such a die hard fan, I decided that I needed to know the truth.The description on the back cover of the book states: Richard Jensen's \\"Trespass In Hazzard County is the shockingly true story of the sex, drugs, intrigue, petty jealousy, back-biting, infighting and inflated egos on the set of The Dukes of Hazzard.\\"After reading, I breathed a sigh of relief. Jensen did not deliver the juicy details that he promised. The entire book is about the friendship Jensen had from 1975-80 with Dukes star John Schneider, barely mentioning the other Dukes co-stars.I expected to read about Daisy Duke sleeping around the set, or Boss Hogg doing lines of coke off the General Lee. Instead he just bashes Schneider page after page.The sex? Jensen writes about Schneider having sex with female after female. What a shock - an 18-24 year old television star (or simply enjoying lots of sex! How scandalous! The drugs? Schneider and Jensen attended many Hollywood parties and witnessed frequent drug use. However Jensen says they both turned down any offers. Very outrageous!Petty jealousy? The guilty party is Mr. Jensen himself, using the entire book to grind his axe against Schneider, who got the part of Bo Duke and rose to superstardom while Jensen could barely get small roles. He continuously critiques Schneider's acting abilities, forgetting to realize that the show failed without fellow Duke boy Tom Wopat and Schneider after their walkout over merchandising. (Everyone is quick to forget the awful Coy & Vance episodes)Overlooking the tiresome bashing of Schneider, the thin book doesn't offer much to keep the reader's interest. Taking breaks between giving another uninteresting comment about Bo Duke, Jensen writes about boring times he met celebrities.If you are a Dukes of Hazzard, John Schneider, or TV fan, the book doesnt offer much to you - I would suggest not buying it. However if you are a fan of mediocrity and bitterness, the story of Richard D. Jensen's friendship with John Schneider would be a nice quick read.Perhaps Jensen could have titled the book, Tresspass in Hazzard County: I Used To Know John Schneider!"},{"Title":"Trespass In Hazzard County: My life as an insider on The Dukes of Hazzard","review":"John R. Schneider's mom, Shirley Conklin, asked me to post this review on here for her. Since I already have a review posted, I had to ask a friend to post this one.Phyllis HinkleRe: Richard Jensen's book \\"Trespass in Hazzard County\\"To introduce myself: Shirley Conklin, John R. Schneider's momI read Richard's book a couple of years ago and felt like I was reading his autobiography with derogatory remarks about John thrown in here and there. John and Richard were good friends in high school, both dreamed about going to Hollywood...whereas John went to every available audition and would take any part no matter how small and even help clean the theater and sell tickets, I think Richard thought someone would knock on his door and he would be a \\"star.\\"Richard spent a lot of time at my home...he and John were fun to be around, acting, playing guitars and I honestly believed Richard would make it in \\"Show Biz\\" but as a comic. When John got his break on \\"Dukes\\" and they moved to LA he probably paid Richard's way out, I don't know but anyhow John gave Richard and his wife a paying job of answering his mail...the volume was unbelievable. This gave Richard his chance to follow his dreams. John got Richard a part for two \\"Dukes\\" shows if I remember correctly. John hadn't been there long enough to make demands for Richard and did all he could for him...it was Richard's responsibility to pursue his own career in \\"Hollywood.\\"Richard wrote his book as he saw things. Instead of being happy for his friend he was bitter and jealous, trashing him in every way he could. Trashing John was bad enough but his attacking me, John's mother, shows what kind of degenerate he really is. If you read this Richard I am ashamed of you that you would sink so low. I treated you like family and encouraged you in your endeavor as I did John. I don't see your name in the TV Guide nor on the Marque at the theater. Instead of blaming John or myself, blame your own inadequacy for lack of pursuing your dream.Those of you that are die hard \\"Dukes\\" fans would be interested in a wonderful book about the \\"Dukes\\" first five episodes filmed in Conyers, GA. \\"The Roads Back to Early Hazzard\\"...by Jon Holland.....ISBN: 978-1-4196-6384-0....another no.

The author does have the word trespass correct though, the book is about trespassing in personal lives and making a profit off it. The tone is bitter, jealous, and mean-spirited against the show, actors, and it's crew. All he does is put them down...and all they did was help him out. It reads more like a personal attack. Let's see, they were 18 at the time, kids, now he's over 45 and comes out with a book? Give me a break. He should have kept his own issues to himself. I feel for the actors and crew on this one. I'm glad I don't have \\"friends\\" like this. For you Duke fans...I'll use this book to \\"line my rabbit cage\\" as Luke once said. I think that says it best.

All this book dose is put down this show and it's actors."},{"Title":"Trespass In Hazzard County: My life as an insider on The Dukes of Hazzard","review":"If Jensen were a racehorse, someone would put him out of his misery. The same courtesy should be extended to unsuspecting readers of his book.If you are or ever have been a fan of TDOH or any of the actors involved in the show, ignore this book completely. The book does not tell you about the show, its actors, stunt people or stunts. Instead, the author, who was friends (ha!) with John Schneider when both were in their late teens, has an axe to grind - and grind it he does on John Schneider's back the entire length of the book.Jensen is a bitter, vengeful author (he fervently believes that he would have been a much better Bo Duke and will probably go to his grave bemoaning the fact that he didn't get the role that John Schneider made famous). He is jealous of John's success.When push comes to shove, the author really doesn't have much nice to say about anyone associated with TDOH or very many people in general... not even his own mother. Jensen finds fault with most of the actors who spoke to him and belittles their talent at every turn. He also manages to find fault with those who barely spoke to him.Jensen makes a habit of name dropping throughout the book. He mentions every single \`famous' person he has ever crossed paths with in his lifetime in a miserable attempt to make himself sound important and worldly.While the facts Jensen presents may be true, the author bases his book's focus on a young Schneider's mistakes and indiscretions while glossing over his own (like his infidelity). He will compliment Schneider one moment and then tear him apart the next.What is most troubling and disturbing is that all the events that Jensen presents happened so long ago (roughly 25 years) and many lives and the people living them (including John Schneider) have changed tremendously yet the author finds it necessary to rehash the past.Obviously, Jensen resents Schneider and just about everything associated with the Dukes of Hazzard and his book comes off as nothing more than a grown-up (debatable) man's bitchfest.P.S. I only gave the book one star because leaving it blank was not an option."},{"Title":"Trespass In Hazzard County: My life as an insider on The Dukes of Hazzard","review":"The title of this book is very misleading. Mr.Jensen speaks very little about the actual show and alot about John Schneider in a very negative way. This book is nothing but Mr.Jensen bashing Mr. Schneider. It is sour grapes. I won't even try and resell this book,I'll use it as kindling."},{"Title":"Trespass In Hazzard County: My life as an insider on The Dukes of Hazzard","review":"I have read the book, while I had seen a few of the reviews years ago I decided against it then. I got a tablet and it was cheap so I gave it a shot. I did try my best to like it and find good in it. In the end I have to agree with the negative reviews here. The whole book was very negative about John mainly, though everyone gets the ax at some point. Richard comes off as very upset that he did not make it as big or bigger than John and that John did not do enough to make him big. While I understand it is Richards point of view. It is not one that even tries to look at all sides or to give credit were credit is due, aside from a few very small places. In short this book was a cash in. At the expense of everyone Mr. Jensen met, spoke to, or saw from a distance. The positive reviews try to gloss the bad parts over and in a point or two they may have a leg but its very thin and wooden at best. I can not recommend this book to anyone even my worst enemy."},{"Title":"Trespass In Hazzard County: My life as an insider on The Dukes of Hazzard","review":"I haven't actually read the book, but Mr. Jensen picked me up when I was hitchhiking in Tucson.

I really felt mislead after reading the advertisement for the book. It should be retitled something else. It primarily deals with the author's friendship with John Schnieder and how it came to a very bitter end. Over all it was not what I anticipated or expected and I was very disappointed.However, it is well written and does make for some intereting reading, just not about the Dukes of Hazzard the show."},{"Title":"Trespass In Hazzard County: My life as an insider on The Dukes of Hazzard","review":"\\"Trespass In Hazzard County: My Life As An Insider on the Dukes of Hazzard\\" is the most interesting Hollywood memoir in years! Author Richard Jensen details his years working in show business in general and on the hit TV show in particular. Conversational in tone, the book reads as if Jensen is sitting in your living room telling you the story of his experiences with the sex, drugs and intrigue in Tinseltown. \\"Trespass\\" doesn't pretend to be an analysis of the Hollywood culture. Instead, Jensen tells his personal story, and his stories are alternately hysterical, shocking and sad. Dukes of Hazzard fans will find this book an eye-opener!"},{"Title":"Trespass In Hazzard County: My life as an insider on The Dukes of Hazzard","review":"I have to admit that I was disappointed, being a John Schneider fan, that he is a complete jerk! I admire the author's courage for being able to walk away from Hollywood and all the craziness that comes along with it. This book is an interesting read. It made me look at the show in a different, more informed light. I just cannot understand why it has gotten such low reviews. Every dukes fan should buy it just to bring themselves back to reality. A note to the author: Richard, I just saw the Carnival of Thrills that came out on Season 3, and you were awesome!"},{"Title":"Trespass In Hazzard County: My life as an insider on The Dukes of Hazzard","review":"While the suggested title in the title review might not be a perfect choice, it offers a far clearer picture of the book you are thinking of reading.Any Dukes fan who picks up this book and thinks they are going to get to read something about their favorite show is going to be sadly disappointed that the entire writings concerning the Dukes and the cast contained within the 170 page book can easily be read sitting in a drive thru line with one car ahead of you. That is, if you are hoping to read about anything or anyone other than John Schneider.This book boils down to being nothing more than the temper-tantrum of a fourty-something year old who has been holding a grudge for twenty-plus years because one of his best former friends, John Schnieder, made it big in Hollywood and he didn't.Page after page concentrates on every fault he finds with Schneider, from his acting skills, his looks, his attitude, to his taste in women. In short, the author describes himself as being better than Schneider in every way, from convincing the reader he would have been a better actor, had better taste in women and so forth.Ironically as the president of John's fan club, he criticized the club as having been put in place to do no more than to swamp unsuspecting members with unsolicited advertising, to more or less use John's name to sell. Well talk about the pot calling the kettle black! Jensen has slapped \\"Hazzard\\" onto the title of his autobiography and used it to sell his book!Also, he insults the show itself, saying in one portion that 'no talent was needed to star in the Dukes'. This coming from the man who, again, twenty-plus years later, continues to bemoan his agent in the book for not having sent him to the Dukes audition! If he thought so lowly of the show, why the grudge?It also appears that Jensen is quite upset that John didn't do more to help him in his Hollywood career, an agreement they had supposedly both made as struggling actors in the event that 'one of them should make it big.' John did get him the guest roll on the Dukes in the 'Carnival of Thrills' episode, and also offered him a part in his tv movie 'Coming Home', so he was making effort. But John was a young, a new star in Hollywood and I doubt there was much more he could have done to promote Jensen's career other than help him get these bit parts. What was he supposed to have done? Go to the Dukes directors and say 'Hire Jensen as a permanent cast member or I quit?' Of course, after reading this, I wouldn't have been suprised if Jensen HAD wanted that!To Jensen's credit, he does include some of his personal photos of John that are nice to see, and gives you a glimps of John's early high school theater days. For these reasons it was worth it to have the book. But if you really want to read about the show, you'd be far better off picking up a copy of 'The Dukes of Hazzard: The Unofficial Companion' by David Hofesteade."},{"Title":"Trespass In Hazzard County: My life as an insider on The Dukes of Hazzard","review":"I don't understand the bad reviews of this book. This entertaining book gave me a lot of insight into the background of the Dukes of Hazzard. Parts of the story are a little sad, but overall it was a lot of fun to read. I've always enjoyed books that tell the true story behind the scenes, instead of the version that is filtered through the studio PR department. I was particularly interested in reading about John Schneider's early days as an actor, before he hit it big at such a young age. This book was fun and fascinating, and it is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Trespass In Hazzard County: My life as an insider on The Dukes of Hazzard","review":"I bought this book thinking it was an expose' on Hollywood and it was that and more. Jensen writes very well, telling his story in a voice that made me think he was sitting in my living room talking to me. Dukes fans, like me, will be shocked at some of the tacky behavior of John Schneider (Bo Duke), especially the way he treated Jensen, who was his friend. The rest of the Dukes cast fare well in this memoir, especially Sonny Shroyer (Deputy Enos), who Jensen says is actually a terrific actor. There is a lot of humor and alot of introspection. The saddest part is the end where Jensen writes, \\"I left Hollywood and no one noticed...\\""},{"Title":"Trespass In Hazzard County: My life as an insider on The Dukes of Hazzard","review":"The Dukes of Hazzard fans who dislike this book completely miss its point -- that a friendship between two actors who were friends and equals died when one of them became famous and then believed his own publicity. Jensen is an excellent writer. He tells a heart-felt tale of how his best friend became the beloved \\"Bo Duke,\\" and in the process relegated Jensen down from the status of friend to the status of slave. All of the stories ring true, and his sincere introspection about how success spoiled John Schneider make for gripping reading. Jensen could have written a book trashing Schneider, but instead praises his talent at length and then contrasts the genuineness of his talent before he became famous and squandered that talent because of his ego and bad management decisions. The fans who trash this book are doing so unfairly. This book is an honest -- indeed, brutally honest -- look at how Jensen went to Hollywood thinking he would find work alongside his friend and instead found that he was trespassing in John Schneider's world. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Trespass In Hazzard County: My life as an insider on The Dukes of Hazzard","review":"This is a book that all fans of the Dukes of Hazzard should read. Jensen tells stories about the show that you will not find anywhere else. Although some fans of John Schneider may not like to learn about some of his flaws, they will enjoy hearing the stories about Schneider's youth and especially about how he became a star before he was out of his teens. Jensen and Schneider were best friends as teenagers and they started their acting careers together, so Jensen is in a unique position to write on this subject. Some of the book is rather sad, especially reading about how the friendship between Schneider and Jensen deteriorated and eventually ended. I enjoyed this book more than any other \\"Hollywood insider\\" book I have read.

He has the same theoretical and intellectual presence as Malcom, Martin, Carmichael, etc. In Open Mike, a series of interviews Dyson gave, I found that I was surprise that anyone could speak this way from the hip. I often wondered if he'd practiced what he had to say. Then I heard him speak at the State of the Black Chruch conference in Detroit, MI 2003.

But as it occurs, many acadamicians (i.e. Adolph Reed) have questioned his scholarship, and even if he is a serious intellectual, suggesting that his writing tends to gravitate toward petty motives that deal with popular culture and the commercialization of societal issues. Nevermind that one of the most noted philosophers, Antonio Gramsci proposed the notion of the \\"organic intellectual\\" as one who could arise from the people but never become so esoterically connected to some ebony or ivory academy. That is Dyson--the organic intellectual--and we Dysonians appreciate him as a defining intellectual acrobat regardless of the commentaries put out by PEDANTIC scholars who resist mainstream culture, pretty much because they, themselves, fail to identify with it.But still, Dyson answers his critics with Open Mike, a scholarly enterprise of the highest order. The book is a collection of conversations on philosophy, race, sex, culture and religion, that definitively evinces the \\"seriousness\\" of Dyson's scholarship. Dyson effortlessly registers his deepening intellectual and moral convictions on every subject from poststructuralist theory to the polyrhythmic structures of African American musical traditions and from Nietzsche's view of God to the prism through with Nas analyzed black social plight.As Mark Anthony Neal stated in the foreword, \\"Open Mike is a critical beat-down!\\" I recommend that this scholarly contribution be digested by every intellect for its complex exploration into the various layers and dimensions of black radical discourse, politics and ethics. And I even further, invite all general readers to add this book to their reading appetite, as Dyson's consistent flow and vivid portrayals are sure to delight your thirst for an impassioned discussion of the social dynamics that affect us all."},{"Title":"Open Mike: Reflections on Philosophy, Race, Sex, Culture, and Religion","review":"I respect dyson as an intellectual and his rhetoric is awesome however this book kinda sucks.A couple of the chapters are great the others not so much.I started to read like a normal book from front to back and realized I would not be able to get through it like that.I read chapters according to what sounded interesting.Black fists and the chapter on mlk and tupac were pretty good but the rest was just a drag.Dysons rhetorical flow and debates are top notch but his books have been a letdown to me."},{"Title":"Open Mike: Reflections on Philosophy, Race, Sex, Culture, and Religion","review":"The book has some very interesting point of views, but Mr. Dyson seems to go to great lengths to use words that display his higher level of education than the average person.

I'm inspired that when I have children I would wish to do the same, have them see the world and appreciate and respect it.edited:As someone who has several of Rick's books, I've developed a shorthand to talk about his work. Now a fellow reader gently reminded me that I actually didn't talk about the book. Well, I did and I didn't. I touched on the family dynamic, which I feel is the true focus of the book. It even states it on the front cover: \\"Chef-Dad, Teenage Daughter, Recipes and Stories.\\" It's to show that all generations need to learn to cook too. That pretty much sums it up. What's a little different about this book is that it's not simply about Mexican cooking but also comfort food cooking from where Rick hails from. The book gives both their points of view about the recipes included in the book, and comes across like the show Rick has that his daughter's featured on One Plate At a Time. For example, Rick will write a more full introduction and background of a recipe and then his daughter will write about her memories when she first came across the food, or how simple it is to prepare. Her entries are usually not as long as her dad's. I was impressed on her making the mole with another young person. I don't know if they were trying to get the younger hipper crowd to read the book, but maybe Rick should simply have Lanie come out with her own small mini-book about her own favorite recipes and/or places, and what are her recipe favorites to entertain with targetted towards the young single and broke crowd. Chronicle Books tends to make the cutest looking books. Maybe they could publish her book. Just a thought. Now - Please make sure I get a cut of the money you guys make off my idea! *LOL* Color photos throughout. The recipes are pretty straightforward, averaging 5 or 6 ingredients and most ingredients are accessible at your local or ethnic market. There are sections that may be helpful to a first time cook, such as \\"Four Steps to Growing Three Herbs (On the Windowsill)\\". Basil, chive and thyme in this case. A little blurb on how to knead dough.If you watch his show One Plate at a Time, his daughter's on it quite a bit and this is like a book version of it. I would recommend this book to those starting out with cooking, whether teen, adult or elder. It doesn't talk down to you and gives you helpful starting tips on what to have in place and done BEFORE any cooking is started. Very easy read."},{"Title":"Rick and Lanie's Excellent Kitchen Adventures: Recipes and Stories","review":"Mix family dynamics, personality, food, and travel, and dish up an entertaining, humorous and, yes, useful father/daughter cookbook venture. Rick, chef/owner of the Mexican restaurant, Frontero, and his daughter, Lanie, 13 (younger when they began the project), eat and cook their way from Mexico to Thailand, by way of Oklahoma, France and Morocco, with side trips to Spain, Japan and Hong Kong. The occasions are family vacations or celebrations and the cooking is done in relaxed settings with friends. Each chapter begins with essays by each of them describing the travel and food experience, from shopping and cooking to bad roads and old memories. Rick's tend to be more rhapsodic and reminiscent; Lanie's are sassy, direct, and funny. Each chapter also includes \\"five cool CDs\\" to play while cooking, like Johnny Cash for barbeque and Kahled for Moroccan food.Each attractively designed, well-organized recipe starts with a brief intro from both authors. Rick's include cultural background and cooking tips; Lanie's are conversational and opinionated. For example, Rick describes choosing exactly the right peppers and accompaniments to a tapas of Spanish Ham Salad. And Lanie says: \\"This tastes exactly like an Italian sub without the bread.\\"It's a teaching book with \\"do this first\\" boxes included in each recipe and thorough step-by-step directions. Lanie (who likes steak tartare but isn't crazy about raw tomatoes) often describes the experience of cooking, the taste sensations, and her personal ratings. The dishes, from breakfast to dessert, are mostly simple classics: Huevos Rancheros; Bangkok-Style Chicken Satay; Moroccan Meatballs (cumin) in Tomato Sauce; Tartiflette (French potato and cheese supper); Hickory House (his parents' barbecue restaurant) Deviled Eggs; Pad Thai; Potato-Leek Soup with Bacon; Profiteroles; Chocolate Truffles. There are a few more complex, or at least time-consuming dishes too, like Crispy Meringue Shells with Ice Cream and Fruit Salsa (France), an Oaxacan Red Mole, and Chinese Pot Sticker Dumplings. Color photographs throughout accent the recipes, the ingredients and the people.This is a book for anyone who'd like to cook with their kid (Lanie has cooked all of these recipes) or enjoys a wide variety of thoughtful classic recipes, or just likes to laugh while reading about food, families and travel."},{"Title":"Rick and Lanie's Excellent Kitchen Adventures: Recipes and Stories","review":"\`Rick & Lanie's Excellent Kitchen Adventures' by Rick Bayless and his daughter is the third kids oriented cookbook I have reviewed and I am very pleased that I gave the earlier two books by Emeril Lagasse and Rachael Ray only four stars, as this volume by Bayless and daughter has really shown us how such a book should be done.To be sure, Bayless and daughter have done the book where the child is a mid-teenaged daughter who has been around the cooking all her life of a world-class teaching chef. Therefore, the book does not address all the important safety issues involved when you put kids into the most dangerous room in the house. But, this is definitely a book with which a cooking minded teenager could connect. That is, if the kid is a good reader, this is the book you want to give them.The book is made doubly interesting in that the Bayless family are great travelers and have a long and interesting history of family in the food service industry. This sets up one of the two main themes of the book by setting each chapter in a different location around the world, some of which are very familiar to the Bayless clan and some of which are being seen for the first time.The five venues are a combination of the obvious and the unexpected. The first is (big surprise) a trip to the southern highlands of Mexico and the Oaxaca valley which is one of Bayless' favorite parts of his favorite country. This chapter is spiced up by a side trip to Peru and an essay in ceviche recipes. The second location, small town Oklahoma may be a big surprise to most of us until Bayless tells us the story of his parents who ran a very successful barbecue restaurant in Capitol Hill, Oklahoma. The highlight of this chapter is Bayless' attempt to write out his parents' recipes from the \`Hickory House' restaurant with very mixed results when his family gathered together to make the recipes from paper rather than from memory. The third destination is France, almost as predictable as the trip to Mexico. This chapter is spiced up with culinary side trips to Italy and Ireland. The fourth venue, Morocco and southern Spain is not to surprising to foodies, as the Moroccan cuisine is one of the most distinctive centers of Mediterranean cuisine next to Italy and Provence, especially after the attention paid to it by Paula Wolfert's books. The fifth venue, Thailand, with side trips to Japan and Hong Kong are only a surprise in that Thai cuisine is about as different from Mexico as you can get. There is not even the distant connection in play between Japan and the West Coast of Latin America that fertilized the development of ceviche.The main format of each chapter is that Rick introduces each locale with a relatively long narrative of why this venue was chosen and the family's general reaction to both the familiar and the unfamiliar. This is followed by a similarly long take on the same location and events by Lanie. And, Lanie provides a very clear counterpoint to her father's take on things. She clearly did not show the same enthusiasm for raw fish and goat barbacoa, a classic dish of southern Mexico. Both speakers do a great favor to the reader in picturing all the ups AND downs of their travels. One of the most surprising events was the failure of a world class chef and his food experienced family to recreate his parents' recipes from Bayless interpretations of these dishes. On the other hand, one of the most gratifying experiences is when Lanie makes a very difficult mole with no help from dad, and the result is very successful.Each recipe is also presented with a headnote from Rick, followed by Lanie's take on the same recipe. An important aspect of all these recipes is that, on the one hand, none of the recipes are simplified for the adolescent amateur. On the other hand, the recipes are not pictured as the very best exemplar of the dish. The \`Hickory House' cole slaw recipes are a perfect case in point. The recipes are not important because they are the greatest cole slaw recipes around, they are important to a family which produced a great chef who writes about them as part of his legacy. Therefore, this is a cookbook that is meant as much or more for reading as for cooking. But that doesn't mean the recipes here are not worth your effort.There are a lot of recipes for classic comfort food here. In addition to the cole slaws, there are great recipes for biscuits, chocolate cake, guacamole, pasta with both marinara sauce and pasta with a pesto sauce, crepes, truffles, gazpacho, paella, potstickers, poached salmon, and potato leek soup.This is by far my first choice for a first cookbook to be given to a teenager or near teenager with an interest and a talent for cooking. Bayless and clan are far more successful in conveying a passion for cooking than most of the cute moves by other writers. I think Lagasse and Ray are just a little less successful in that they are writing with a voice for very young readers, except that this material will be interpreted by adults for the youngsters. Thus, the material will not hold the adult's interest long enough to involve the kids. Ray and Lagasse have done good books, but Bayless has done something better.Highly recommended for all foodies, teenage and above."},{"Title":"Rick and Lanie's Excellent Kitchen Adventures: Recipes and Stories","review":"How many kids get to grow up, travel and publish a cookbook? We the purchasers get to enjoy this achievement.Famous Mexican chef Rick Bayless teams up with his teenage daughter Lanie to provide a 230 page beauty filled with their trips to Peru, Oklahoma, Mexico, Morocco, Thailand and France. In each destination they each relate their highlights and lowlights of the trip. Lanie's are so cool, e.g. \\"Eating in Peru basically means eating potatoes ... my dad bought two of EACH One, 'Research,' he kinda barked at me--I mean all I did was ask politely WHAT he was doing. He didn't even seem to care that it took an hour.\\"This is getting some great cooking basics, plus intro to this family's favorite recipes, and exposure to other culture's culinary creations. Both Rick and Lanie comment on each, so you get both perspectives: gourmet chef and teenage daughter. There are sidebars which provide great tips and even suggests for CD listening as well as what to buy when in a Mexican grocery, how to grow three popular herbs indoors. Great, unique, well thought out fun stuff to read and cook with. There is also a limited mail-order source listing for ingredients, music and cooking supplies.Some great recipes which most family will dig into include: Lime Zest Ice Cream with Mexican Caramel; Vegetarian [or not] Soft Tacos with Guacamole; The World's Greatest Chili; Grilled Pizza with Goat Cheese, Green Salsa and Bacon; Chinese Potsticker Dumplings; Moroccan Meatballs in Tomato Sauce.All this done beautifully with prose and great photos and layout.

Renowned Chicago chef Rick Bayless,who's recently sworn off rumors that he'll be cooking it up at the White House, collaborates with his daughter in a culinary journey. Bayless' Mexican restaurants are favorites with the soon-to-be First Family, and his cooking is for President and everyday people alike.In \\"Kitchen Adventures\\",Rick and Lanie explore the cuisines of France,Mexico,Thailand,Morocco,and Peru. It's pleasant to see they don't delve into the usual Latin American cooking. Peruvian cuisine is underrated--and as Lanie jokes-it's all about potatoes! There's a delightful familial interplay throughout the book.\\"Kitchen Adventures\\" is a sonic pleasure as well. The Baylesses recommend world music to play while cooking. There are A LOT of Putumayo compilations.

Since this is the book that led me to Christ, it has a very special place in my heart. The chapter entitled \\"What Must I Do To Be Saved?\\" will bring you to your knees. Until reading it, I never really knew how to repent, and give my life to Christ. That, at the ripe old age of 18, and after attending churches for years. But not only is it invaluable for guidance in salvation, it covers about every doctrinal theme from the Bible you can think of. Long a prized possession in our family library as a child, the stunning illustrations are like none you've ever seen before.

It is universally recognized as the &quot;Bible&quot; of rocket propulsion theory and practice, and remains the fundamental and basic text for everyone seriously engaged in this complex field of research and development.Sutton's book should be the very first purchased for anyone who wants to learn and understand the ins and outs of both solid and liquid-fuel rocket propulsion. No other book even comes close."},{"Title":"Rocket Propulsion Elements: An Introduction to the Engineering of Rockets","review":"It is always a pleasure to find a comprehensive overview of a field that can be understood by a non-specialist. I cannot testify as to how useful Rocket Propulsion Elements would be to an aerospace engineer, but for a technically inclined amateur like me it is a wonderful book. One of the things I like best about it is that it mixes theory with practical examples. It give a clear idea not only of the principles of rocket propulsion ,but also of the current state of the art. I was expecting this for the field of chemical rocketry, but I was delighted to find explanations of more obscure technologies, such as electric rocket of various types. I only wish that there were books this good in every field."},{"Title":"Rocket Propulsion Elements: An Introduction to the Engineering of Rockets","review":"It is hard to believe that a technical book could keep me up until 2 in the morning, but this one sure did. The basic principles of rocket science are not at all confusing, nor are they incomprehensible, when presented in this manner. The authors really want to teach, not just show off their knowledge, and this book has reached that goal. I actually understand what the rocket scientist is doing, what they are up against, and why it takes multitudes of experiments, trials, and special materials to take a payload to space. The math is basic, yet encompassing, and anyone with a high school education can understand &quot;THE&quot; esoteric subject of our times. Authors Biblarz and Sutton are brilliant educators."},{"Title":"Rocket Propulsion Elements: An Introduction to the Engineering of Rockets","review":"The seventh edition of this book is absolutely amazing!!! It presents the material in a clear and concise manner without losing the reader. This book provides up to date information about every type of rocket propulsion system from solids and liquids, to hybrids and exotics. It also includes sections on design and trade studies for different systems. Of particular interest to me were the sections on hybrid propulsion and liquid engine injector design. This book is highly recommended to anyone interested in rocket propulsion design and analysis! 5 stars indeed!!!!!"},{"Title":"Rocket Propulsion Elements: An Introduction to the Engineering of Rockets","review":"This is the definitive &quot;text book&quot; for the subject of rocket propulsion. Its coverage of the subject is both broad and detailed. Probably a third of the book can be understood with no more than high school level physics and mathematics. The remainder requires some exposure to undergraduate level mechanical engineering, mathematics and physics, e.g. integral calculus, thermodynamics, etc. This book is in its 7th edition and it shows. The authors have a clean, precise, almost mechanical writing style that you would expect in a highly evolved technical work of this type. I do have one minor bone to pick with this book. The authors have clearly spent their lives doing rocketry in the mega million dollar world of NASA, General Dynamics, etc. Most of the graphs and diagrams emphasis big, big, rockets, e.g. graphs focusing on thrust chambers that operate at 5000 p.s.i. I suspect that most readers are either university students or individuals involved in experimental rocketry. Those that fall into the later category might benefit from better coverage of rocketry done with less exotic materials, fuels, and operating parameters. That minor weakness aside, this book covers in its 700 or so pages, everything that has been learned in the field of rocketry in the last 70 years and it presents this material at a fairly detailed technical level. It is therefore the book against which all others in the field will be judged."},{"Title":"Rocket Propulsion Elements: An Introduction to the Engineering of Rockets","review":"This review is specifically for the kindle version. This is currently my textbook for my Master's course, so I was initially delighted that the book was offered in kindle format. My gripe is not even that some of the illustrations and tables are extremely difficult if not impossible to read - that I expected. However, the kindle edition has a high amount of typos that are not present in the print versions of the book. The worst cases are the homework problems at the end of each section, where the kindle version has incorrect values or required information is simply missing. Sometimes equations are missing vital pieces, like square root symbols and exponents. I only know this because I'm taking the class with a friend who bought the print version of the book. If I went purely off of the kindle text, I'd be failing this class! Also, since all the tables and equations are input as images, the benefit of the kindle search function is useless. The book is not designed for linear reading, and the extremely long lag in searching, highlighting, and moving back and forth between different sections is very frustrating. Finally, the price for this kindle book is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. For the terrible quality of the conversion, they charge just $10 less than a brand-new, hardcover version. You can get a used copy for at least $15 cheaper than this bordering-in-useless copy. Bottom-line: go with the print version."},{"Title":"Rocket Propulsion Elements: An Introduction to the Engineering of Rockets","review":"The readability of this book makes it a good investment for aspiring rocket engineers.Just be aware that this edition has a lot of typographical errors.

This book can help you.Do you want to know how to design a monopropellant rocket. This book CAN'T help you.I am an American who was fortunate enough to have a rocket propulsion summer internship at the Moscow Aviation Institute back in 2000 when I was an undergrad in aerospace engineering at the University of Illinois. As I hadn't taken a full semester rocket propulsion course yet I bought this book for the trip since it was used in a senior level course. After arriving I proudly showed this great tome to my researchers to which they scanned it for 20 minutes and replied, \\"This book is great if you would like to look at pictures and read stories about general rocketry, but it doesn't explain at all how to engineer or build anything, so it is worthless.\\" I passed this off as hubris until they gave me a couple of the old Soviet books on rocket engineering full of detailed performance characteristics and equations which were horribly lacking in Sutton. Even with my nonexistent Russian they were more useful than \\"the tome.\\" Unfortunately I wasn't able to bring their engineering books back with me, but trust me, I was ashamed I had wasted money on Sutton. I ended up not even using it as a door stop. I can hope future versions will get technical but don't count on it. If it hasn't managed to do it in 50 years since it was first published, it probably won't happen. Instead I expect just an updated cover every couple of years with maybe a few pages added here or there.In short there is about ZERO engineering educational value in this book. I would almost bet that most of the \\"great reviews\\" are those who are mentioned in the credits of the book. You can usually tell because they stick to generalities about how great the author is, or how this has been the seminal work for the last 30 years, blah blah. How do you get more good reviews that say nothing? Put out a new edition and thank different people each time. Utter drivel.Amazon needs to clear out it's cash of 3 sentence book reviews that contribute nothing to learning about the contents of the book review. That would leave about 2 reviews of this epic picture book.A far and away much better choice that actually focuses on engineering and design isModern Engineering for Design of Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines (Progress in Astronautics and Aeronautics).

When I finally picked it up as a cure for insomnia, I managed to make my way through 2/3 of the thing before finally falling asleep. This book is marvelous. I had no idea what was involved in real rocket science, but quite a bit. Vibration physics, thermodynamics, chemistry, injectors, turbopumps... The book would make a wonderful practical course for, say, a senior physics student, to test his knowledge of different fields. I was also struck by the elegant simplicity of the models which were actually used to design the rockets we use today. This is no cookbook of differential equations for finite element analysis and doing what the idiot box says; this hearkens back to when engineers used slide rules, and designed things they really understood. The elegant results for nozzle shape, driven by thermodynamics (I had no idea why rockets had big nozzles like they do), and flame length estimators of rocket thrust alone were worth the price of the book.I had no idea it is still used as a textbook for rocketry (I have the second edition from 1956), but it doesn't surprise me terribly. The lucidity of the writing and derivations made this almost inevitable. I'm sure there are more practical books in Russian, but there aren't in English, so this one will remain a classic until Americans begin to do real rocket science again."},{"Title":"Rocket Propulsion Elements: An Introduction to the Engineering of Rockets","review":"When as a young physicist I started working on rocket nozzle design most of the material in this book had to be dug up from a paper here, a book there, or else it simply wasn't known.

And besides nozzle design, here in information on virtually every aspect of rockets from the design to the propellents, from concepts to testing. Most of the book is on conventional liquid or solid fuel chemical rockets, because that's where most of the action is today. There is a new chapter (from my older edition) on electrical propulsion.The book is suitable for use as a textbook for either a one or two term course, or as an introductory book to an engineer now moving into the field, or as a reference book for the experienced. It is especially good to use when you need to come up to speed on some area of the business where you don't normally work.The one weakness of the book is the lack of discussion on computers either in terms of engine control systems or of the design software that is avaiable.

In addition the book includes a small set of color thumbnails for photos of common pediatric diseases and skin conditions.Overall, the readability of the book is excellent and many of the topics are explained very clearly, for example, the endocrine chapter explains the spectrum of adrenal diseases in under 5 pages, highlighting the important points of Adrenal Cortical Deficiency, Adrenal cortical failure, etc. Each major topic includes epidemiology, pathophysiology, history and physical, diagnosis and treatment sections that makes each section very readable.The chapters are subdivided into major topics, that cover topics in short, succint, easily digestible paragraphs, and are supplemented by many graphs, tables and charts. I did find a few of the graphics in the cardiology chapter a bit dated, and it would have been nice to have seen a more consistent graphic style throughout the book. In addition, since most of the photos are in black and white, some of the finer details are difficult to see, especially chest x rays and skin findings.Some chapters seem more geared toward patient care than board review (which doesn't mean they not well written) and spend more time in detail that is not likely to be emphasized on the boards. It would have been nice to have included &quot;boards pearls&quot; or &quot;hot topics&quot; or &quot;frequently tested material&quot; more heavily highlighted in a book that is written for board review. Most of us are looking for a &quot;First Aid for the Boards&quot; type of book for Pediatrics, and this doesn't quite fit that mold. (There is probably no easy &quot;shortcut&quot; type book on the market,yet)At the end of many of the chapters and sections are a handful of review questions to grill you in the basic subject areas. While most of these test relevant material, the question style is not exactly in line with the style of the Pediatric Board Exam.That being said, this book makes a terrific general study guide. There is currently no other book available that does so much in as little space. You're not going to be able to read or carry around a Nelson's when you study for the boards, so this book is good for the major topics of each subspecialty.In addition, this book provides many easy to read a chapters that highlights many important subspecialty areas. More available on the Medfools website. This quality makes it a great &quot;pre-read&quot; before each subspecialty elective in pediatrics that you may complete during a Pediatrics residency."},{"Title":"The Cleveland Clinic Intensive Review of Pediatrics","review":"Having just taken my board exam, I can see that this book had the most bang for the buck. No other review sources gives you pictures, radiographs, graphs, EKGs and questions in a single book. And the content is definitely representative of the exam -- I recognized one picture because it came directly from this text!The questions in this book very similar to the actual exam, including those pesky \\"all of these are true EXCEPT\\" questions. There are detailed explanations provided for the answers. And this is the only text that gives sample growth charts (also something that shows up on the exam) and actually gives a useful table of developmental milestones (since the boards will inundate you with development questions and will frequently make you split hairs -- other review books are inadequate for milestones).The coverage of nutrition, sports medicine, and ethics is inadequate. I wish they had a side by side table of all the types of anemia and their associated indices (plus the normal ranges for those indices) -- I don't know why none of the board review books have this considering its importance.To be honest, because I bought far too many review books, I didn't end up using this as much since it seemed too much like a text and seemed overwhelming. I ended up primarily using a more portable book in bullet-format (Last Minute Pediatrics). But part of the reason it looks so big is because it is actually three books rolled into one -- a review book, a question book, and an atlas. Looking back, I can see that it was a good resource and I feel comfortable recommending it as a sole review tool if you don't mind reading a paragraph format. I'd recommend this to anyone considering Medstudy -- this is a better value and has much better pictures.This is definitely not a standard pediatric reference text, nor it is meant to be. The boards are are more likely to test you on Waardenburg syndrome than on reflux.Pros:*Representative context*Excellent pictures, sample growth charts, and EKGs -- guaranteed to get you a few easy points on the exam*Practice questions with similar format to exam and in-depth answers/explanations*Good value (considering comprehensive content)*Pathophysiology explained (also tested on boards)*Single book for content, questions, and pictures*Superb table with developmental milestones -- a major component of exam*Feel like you are actually learning by reading it rather than memorizing endless lists or silly mnemonicsCons:*Looks and reads like a text*Least up to date review book (published in 2003)*Not easy to skim (mostly in text form, rare bullet points)*Some topics inadequate: sports medicine, nutrition, ethics"},{"Title":"The Cleveland Clinic Intensive Review of Pediatrics","review":"This book is billed as a study guide for the boards. I am basing my review on this fact. If you are a medical student then this may be a sufficient pediatric source. Maybe...I thought the Cleveland Clinic name would give this book some essence of quality. But I was sorely disappointed. I am currently studying for the pediatric boards, and I have found this book to be the most useless of all my sources. I will cite some examples here, but to enumerate all the faults would take too long.The endocrinology section only reviews thyroid, PTH, and adrenal disorders. There is no mention of diabetes mellitus! The only time the words \\"Diabetes mellitus\\" are used in this book are in a small table entitled \\"Risk Factors for Invasive Pneumococcal Disease in Children\\"The nephrology section has only three parts: fluids and electrolytes, proteinuria and hematuria, and hypertension. That's it. Where's the ONLY mention of renal failure in this book? As one of the secondary causes of peptic ulcer disease. That's it. How about urinary tract infections? Mentioned only in passing as a cause of hematuria. No management discussion whatsoever on either of these VERY IMPORTANT topics.Gastroenterology - more glaring deficiencies. GE reflux, one of the most common conditions in infants - NOT EVEN MENTIONED. It's not even in the index. Peptic ulcer disease? Again - nothing.On the positive note, the parts it does cover are well written and easily understood. It just has too many (WAY too many) important topics absent to be deemed a reliable source. There's even two pages covering \\"approach to an adolescent\\" ... which is strange considering this is supposed to be a short BOARD REVIEW book.Consider \\"Pediatrics - Just The Facts\\" as an alternative review book that is about the same size as this one. For a review book, it is way and above The Cleveland Clinic Review. Good luck."},{"Title":"The Cleveland Clinic Intensive Review of Pediatrics","review":"I purchased 6 different review books, and this was hands-down my favorite. It is very clearly written, and it provides a bit of background/pathophys to help things make sense but then focuses on what is most important to know. It is true that it is not complete (and I can't help thinking that the ideal peds board review book has yet to be written), but no review book will be--there is enough info in here, and it is sufficiently focused on what is important for the Boards, that if you learn what's here then you should be in good shape."},{"Title":"The Cleveland Clinic Intensive Review of Pediatrics","review":"I am a recent pedi resident graduate who is preparing for the 2009 board exam. This book came highly recommended from several colleagues. However, I have been underwhelmed with its usefulness as a board preparation source.Most of the chapters are well researched and written. Some are repetitive and poorly proofread. But my biggest complaint is that no one seems to have read the content specifications that the board publishes. If you are going to thumb through this book in the bookstore, go to page 62 and read about Foreign Bodies and Caustic Ingestions. Rather than having board-germane content, it reads more like a review article, enumerating who reported what, in which journal, which year, how many patients....all a bunch of irrelevant nonsense for me in my limited time.If you have the board specifications in your lap at home (it previously came as a separate booklet with the PREP study questions), go to p 123 and read about adrenal disorders. Again, this section is replete with information, but probably not stuff that I need now.On the whole, this book has an identitiy crisis. It is trying to both be a prosiac form of board review and a general pediatrics text at the same time. I already have the general text on my bookshelf. I wanted to buy the board review book.Lastly, as other reviewers have pointed out, maybe they focused so intently on being an \\"Intensive Review\\" that some of the relevant content (e.g. type 1 DM) got left on the editing room floor."},{"Title":"The Cleveland Clinic Intensive Review of Pediatrics","review":"Good review book that is easy to read. I agree with the other reviewer about it lacking a review on a few fundamental topics such as diabetes mellitus and sports medicine. Recognizing that, I looked elsewhere for review info on the missing subjects. In general, it is a fairly comprehensive review. I am giving it five stars for its 'readability.'I only read this book and sailed through the recert. exam - probably the last time for me, praise the good lord! For those who are about to take the exam - there were a fair number of questions on sports injuries - acromio-clavicular displacement, shoulder dislocation etc, as well as smoke inhalation injuries! Also read up on vaccinations for international adoptions.

Everything was nicely laid out (bullet format); actually gives you a lot of tips for the exam & ways to remember specific facts. Not sure I passed yet (just took the exam yesterday), but would definitely recommend \\"Laughing Your Way\\" over Cleveland clinic. [also, MUST do some PREP questions from AAP - helped a lot]. Having just taken the exam, then flipping through the Cleveland Clinic book (to see if it would have helped me at all), I have to say it would have been a waste of my time to go through the book.

While it's set in present day Scotland, author William Meikle infuses it so many 30's and 40's elements that one can wonder why he didn't just set his story during that time period to begin with. Derek Adams is a Glasgow private investigator and he fits the image we all have of noir detectives: smart-alecky, drinks too much, smokes too much, and has a dingy apartment that doubles as his office. You can practically picture a ceiling fan that rotates far too slowly to provide even the slightest breeze. And of course into his office walks a mysterious, dark-haired dame, wanting to hire Adams. Sure, it hits on every clich&eacute; in the genre but Meikle is so earnest about it you hardly care. It's obvious that Meikle reveres guys like Chandler and Hammett so who can fault him for that.Fiona Dunlop wants Adams to find a rather strange looking amulet that was stolen from her home. She gives Adams very little information other than a picture. When Adams takes the picture to a professor friend of his he finds that this is no mere trinket. The Johnson Amulet is thousands of years old and is virtually priceless. Borrowing elements of Howard Carter's discovery of King Tut's tomb, we learn the history of the amulet discovered in the early part of the 20th century. The amulet is traced back to the ancient priest kings of UR and its discovery was aided by an old, wizened Arab who appears mysteriously. Derek now knows there is much more to this case than meets the eye. He begins to investigate local antique dealers and fencers, piecing together more and more about the amulet, but everyone he comes in contact with seems to quickly die a horrible death putting Adams in the spotlight of the local police.When Adams tails one prominent antique dealer to an out of the way country estate, he is witness to ceremony of black magic that calls forth a horrific creature from some damnable plane of existence who is intent on getting the amulet back. But for what purpose? Derek's friend soon finds evidence that the amulet may go all the way back to the Great Old Ones who ruled the world long before man and specifically mentions Cthulhu who lies dreaming in his ocean tomb waiting to walk the earth once more. In edition to Cthulhu, Meikle makes mention of Abdul Alhazred, writer of the Necronomicon and later describes a swirling black mass and the playing of a crazed flute which is reference to the idiot God Azathoth.Now Aided by Fiona Dunlop and her husband, both practiced in the arts of magic, they have to stop this group from using the Amulet to open the way to the Old Ones and reverting the earth back to its primeval origins.Despite all the Mythos elements, and they do come hot and heavy in the last of the book (the final showdown takes place at Arkham House!) at its core this is really a detective story and could largely have stood alone on those merits. Hardcore Lovecraft fans may find that Meikle dealt with the Mythos elements a little too loosely but then they are a hard group to please anyway. Meikle was writing a detective story with horrific and Mythos elements, not a Mythos story per se. As such I think it worked very well. It moves fast and at 197 pages it's a quick read. The characters may not be the most original but don't worry about it. Sit back and enjoy the ride.Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"The Midnight Eye Files: The Amulet","review":"In short, I really enjoyed this book. It started off like a typical private detective story: down-on-his-luck P.I. gets a visit from a beautiful and mysterious woman...the case seems straightforward enough, just find a missing family heirloom. The story quickly spirals into a crazy, weird story with occultists and scary gangsters, horrific murders and terrible things materializing out of noxious mist. Awesome Lovecraft tones and tie-ins...I loved it all. I liked the main character even, because Meikle really made this guy real. I'll definitely be buying the next one."},{"Title":"The Midnight Eye Files: The Amulet","review":"The Midnight Eye Files: The Amulet is a newly published book by Willie Meikle. Fortunately for us, it looks like the start of a new series. The publisher is Black Death Books. It is a standard sized trade soft cover, 197 pages that's all story, no introduction or author's notes. The cover art is by KHP studios, with no specific photographer credited. It shows a world weary gumshoe, cigarette in hand, with a femme fatale in the background. My favorite touch was the Elder Sign ring. Production qualities are good with maybe 1 typo. There may have been a few Glasgow references or language that I missed, but the prose was both accomplished and accessible. In fact, Mr. Meikle's knowledge and characterizations of Glasgow made the book spring to life. It is only $15.00 with free shipping if you order $25 worth of stuff. All in all well worth the money!I must admit I approached this book with a bit of trepidation. I really was not won over by Island Life, a title by Mr. Meikle from a few years ago. I actually gave my copy away. I need not have worried. The Amulet was a triumph and I hope the beginning of a beautiful friendship with private eye Derek Adams. Maybe I was a sucker for it because my all time favorite movie is The Maltese Falcon, hands down. I just love all those old Bogart flicks. Schizophrenically, I've never read a Raymond Chandler, even after reading reams of Doc Savage, Tarzan, Ludlum, Clancy and other potboilers. Maybe I'll mosey to the bookstore and give them a gander, as Chandler is treated reverentially by Meikle.To explain how the mythos fits is I have to include some mild spoilers, so stop now if that is going to bother you.Derek Adams is a down on his luck 250-per-day-plus-expenses gumshoe in Glasgow, what little time he isn't chain smoking he spends getting drunk. Or at least drinking really hard. Man if I had 10% of what he downed in this book I would be completely incapacitated for weeks! In walks a knock out dame with a case and it is trouble (it always is isn't it?)! It seems there is an amulet from ancient Ur, of the image of a terrible tentacled demon. It was unearthed in an archeological dig decades earlier, perhaps under nefarious circumstances, under the influence of a mysterious ancient Arab. The amulet has been stolen from its current owners under suspicious circumstances, with a mysterious ancient Arab needing sighted around the fringes. What follows is a well paced story of Derek first doing some basic PI work, and some flashbacks to the dig at Ur. Mutilated bodies start piling up, the local police start hassling Derek and it becomes obvious some supernatural agency is involved. After the mystery is largely solved, the book's last 50 or so pages turn into a sorcerous confrontation between the amulet's owners, a scholar and Wiccan witch, and those who want to use its power to open the gates of reality to awaken Great C'thulhu. The demon of the amulet is not a specific mythos entity but is a creation of Mr. Meikle, called the Gatekeeper (unless I missed that somehow it is an avatar of Yog Sothoth). A creature with starfish like tentacles on the top of its head seems like one of our old friends, and there may be an oblique reference to Azathoth what with all the piping going on. The climactic confrontation takes place in the depths of a forbidding place called Arkham House. How much more mythos can it be? Of course, however, it is not really a mythos story except maybe the last bit. It's really more a detective novel. Naaah, not a detective novel. A gumshoe novel.So here, in stream of consciousness format, are things I liked and my one quibble. I really like the first half of the book. This isn't CJ Henderson type stuff, at least not a first. This is more like James Ambuehl's The Pisces Club with break neck action and humor intermingled. There is a real patina of gritty Glaswegian reality, lending richness and depth. I loved the stock PI novel characters. But I was distressed when so many of them ended up among the victims! I liked that Derek was not a superman, not even a real tough guy type. But he pursued this case like a bulldog. And non-existentialist mythos fans will be quite pleased by the way the good guys put up a fight with ultimate evil. I also liked the events at the end leading up to the confrontation if not quite so much as the first part of the book. I hope Derek rethinks his end of book decision to give up the PI business. I guess I'll just have to wait and see where Mr. Meikle takes us.Now my one quibble, such a tiny thing but it always puts me off in a mythos book. HPL is mentioned as an author of fiction, and yet his mythos is the backdrop for the horror elements of this story. HPL writing reality passed off as fiction is a plot device I just don't like. This was one tiny part of a short sentence. It didn't detract in any way from my enjoyment of the novel. I just couldn't help noticing it.I don't know if Derek Adams will cross paths with minions of the Great Old Ones again, or if his further adventures will be along other arcane avenues. Whatever he does, I'll be along for the ride and you should too. I also want to explore some of Mr. Meikle's other books too, particularly his Watchers series. The Amulet is recommended to mythos fans, gumshoe fans, Meikle fans and fans of a good yarn."},{"Title":"The Midnight Eye Files: The Amulet","review":"The first book of the Midnight Eye Files, The Amulet, blew me away. Seriously. This book and author is the perfect example of why indie authors can be just as competitive and awesome as authors from the Big 6 Publishers. Blending elements of the classic hardboiled detective story (think Philip Marlowe, Mike Hammer, and Sam Spade) and nightmarish legends and monsters straight from the mind of H.P. Lovecraft (C'thulu anyone?) and you'll have a pretty good idea of what you're in store for.As most people know, I'm a huge Jim Butcher fan...Harry Dresden, the wizard P.I. from Chicago, is one of my favorite fictional characters. Meikle's detective really isn't anything like Dresden at all. He's no wizard. Heck, the only magic trick he knows is seeing his cigarettes and booze disappear. No, he's just an ordinary guy who's been hired to find a most extraordinary object...an amulet that opens a portal to another dimension. A dimension where the creatures inside want to come through. And Derek Adams has to figure out a way to stop an evil cult from doing just that.With a mixture of intense action scenes, smart and witty dialogue, good looking femme fatales, and horrendous monsters with one too many tentacles growing out of their head...this book is a rip-roaring good time. I can't wait to read the rest of the series!"},{"Title":"The Midnight Eye Files: The Amulet","review":"the result is usually a literary trainwreck. Noir has become a pale shadow of it's former glory. And no subgenre has suffered more than Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.Until William Meikle.Here is an author who obviously respects both genres and has produced one of the finest cross genre novels I have read in years.I think H.P. himself would agree.5 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"The Midnight Eye Files: The Amulet","review":"William Meikle is one of the most versatile writers working in speculative fiction today, mostly because he isn't afraid to embrace the pulp sensibility that made the genres great. Here he combines the skill of his mystery/PI work as evidenced in The Road Hole Bunker Mystery and combines it with Lovecraftian myth and magic. The damaged PI may seem a little familiar but Meikle's Scottish spin brings it to fresh life and yields a heady mix of reality and fantasy. If you haven't tried Meikle yet, this is a great place to start."},{"Title":"The Midnight Eye Files: The Amulet","review":"It's Phillip Marlow with a supernatural Cthulhu twist. I enjoyed it and my husband loved it. He insisted I order the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Midnight Eye Files: The Amulet","review":"Tight, sharp, and cynical, Meikle's characters are brilliantly portrayed. Sure the main character has a fascination with Humphrey Bogart that borders on obsessive, but it's okay, it works here. Why? Because he is the quintessential detective you imagine every P.I. to be. His wit is quick, his obvious blindness to his client's motives is at the end - legendary, and his heartache and empathy is palpable. Perfect. What wasn't perfect was the secondary characters' dialect.Now, I understand Mr. Meikle is British, but some of the casts' dialogue became more of a mystery than the case itself. In fact, in order to save my sanity and my need for all things orderly and clear, I had to skip over a few of the interactions between Derek and the locals. Other than dousing us in the local slang, Meikle's style of writing is nostalgic, baroque, and spellbinding. Never has an author had me so caught up in his mystery that I forgot to smoke. Mr. Meikle, you may just be literary Nicorette.While the outline to the story is not wholly original, the fleshed out plot is. Formative and intelligent, this story has it all: Mystery, horror, lost-love, and friendship. In other words, it could become a classic. Now, don't go getting the idea that this is some creampuff book; it's not. But I do have to admit the horror is sparse. In fact, the blood count is shamelessly low, but that's okay, the supernatural elements carry this book into the genre nicely.Sultry and casual, the story moves at a languid pace. Starting at a near crawl, the pace increases with a progressive speed that leaves you breathless before it's over and done with. Pure Lovecraft, the atmosphere is dark and disturbing with just a hint of decay. You can smell the cheap gin and cigarettes, but there's an underlying aftertaste of mold."},{"Title":"The Midnight Eye Files: The Amulet","review":"Derek Adams is such a stereotypical Private Investigator - he's got a colourful history, drinks too much and smokes. He's always getting on the wrong side of the local police, and he's actually a mess.So, when Fiona steps into his office, looking for someone to find a missing piece of jewellery you wonder why, on earth, she chose him. It's like watching a crash in slow motion, you can see things coming, watch the body count mount up and still there are those slaps round the back of the head that shock.If it were just a detective ramble this would still sort of work, but the added element of demonic Cthulu adds a dimension that will either have you riveted until the very last word, or it'll give you nightmares."},{"Title":"The Midnight Eye Files: The Amulet","review":"Take a sharp, wry Private Investigator story that adds in the colour of some of Glasgow's seedier locales, some well crafted historical backdrops that set up the current events and add a final wollop of sanity-snapping Chthonic fiction. With me so far? Good, just don't give in to the chanting, it's your only hope.When PI Derek Adams, a smart opportunist kept upright on a diet of Nicotine, Caffeine and Single Malts, gets a visit from the seductive Fiona Dunlop, what starts as a simple Treasure Hunt for an ugly but seemingly priceless Amulet gradually descends into a torturous nightmare that drags Adams to the Void beyond the World, where unspeakable horror awaits.At no little cost to Adams and his friends, as well as Fiona and her husband Andrew - both adepts of the Arts themselves , Adams fights to overcome first his disbelief, and then his common sense (Flee!) in overcoming the mysterious group of hooded practitioners of the Dark Arts who are bent on using the Amulet to break the barrier between the World and the Outer Dimensions to free their Master. There's plenty of horridly hypnotic chanting whenever a summoning takes place - but you know to ignore that.Featuring the summoned creature of the Amulet, a hideous implacable demon from beyond, whose full horror would take half a page to describe, the richer of Glasgow's Antique Dealers, a few criminal contacts, two thuggish police detectives who finish each other's sentences and have a particular dislike of Adams' methods of Investigating, a standing order of Nicotine from Jo the newspaper man downstairs, and plenty of cursing his useless choice of car, Adams rolls from one lead to the next, pulling himself inexorably towards the final precipice of sanity, all the while wishing himself away and safe again before the madness ever started.Unputdownable (I do like that pretend word) - The Midnight Eye Files is a fantastic Lovecraftian journey that mixes terror (oh, yes, the Terror), with a witty and clever PI story. I can't wait to get stuck into the other Files to see what else Adams (un)wittingly gets himself into.So enjoy, spread the word and remember: don't give in to the chanting!!"},{"Title":"The Midnight Eye Files: The Amulet","review":"On my shelves or in my Kindle, there are many books I started.

If you like old time detective stories in the line of Ray Chandler I think you'd really enjoy this book. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good detective story with supernatural elements."},{"Title":"The Midnight Eye Files: The Amulet","review":"William Meikle, by his own admission, was heavily influenced by the pulp and noir aspects of the American PI movies and fiction of the 1940s in the creation of his Midnight Eye series. Derek Adams, the Glasgow PI featured in The Amulet and two subsequent novels, wears the mantle well, ensconced in a halo of cigarette smoke as he slides along a whisky trail waiting for a femme fatale to walk through his door. Neither he nor the reader has to wait long as she makes her appearance on page two.As the standard trope goes: she is trouble and he knows it, but that doesn't stop him. She wants him to find an amulet that was stolen from her house. Despite her perceived lack of full disclosure, his uneasiness with the photograph of the amulet, and his misgivings about being able to uncover a stolen piece of jewelry, he, of course, takes the case.Derek's cynical, world weary nature and wry sense of humor echoes the acting of Bogart and the writing of Chandler as he propels himself headlong into a case that will test his resourcefulness, perseverance, and sanity. Derek soon learns that the amulet is much more than just another ugly piece of jewelry and that before he can consider this case solved, he will gain first-hand knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos as The Big Sleep meets \\"At the Mountains of Madness.\\"Derek's best friend and former schoolmate provides insight and research into the origins of the amulet via expedition journals and newspaper accounts as well as moral support. But he and the others who come into contact with the amulet do not escape unscathed.While supernatural noir is not as unusual a subgenre as it was once, Meikle has still managed to weave a unique tale. This can be attributed to his skill in crafting the character of Derek Adams. Derek seems like a familiar character decked out his trench coat, cig hanging from his lips, as he visits a colorful array of characters around Glasgow. But Derek is more than the stereotypical PI. His emotional baggage has made him fiercely devoted to his friends and truly horrified by death. He makes up for not being the smartest or toughest PI in the world by being bulldoggedly determined to set things right.The other thing that separates this book from the standard fare is the city of Glasgow. Meikle brings Glasgow to life in a way that almost makes it a character itself, very different but reminiscent of the role Calcutta played in Dan Simmons' debut novel Song of Kali.The Amulet moves along at a brisk pace, with Derek being directed both overtly and covertly by his femme fatale to a climax that tests the limits of the PI and his client and her husband as they battle to keep evil at bay. Whether or not Derek can claim victory at the end, he will be forever and unequivocally changed.I encourage you to pour yourself a couple of fingers of whisky and visit Meikle's and Derek's Glasgow some evening as the shadows grow long."},{"Title":"The Midnight Eye Files: The Amulet","review":"Thank you Mr Meikle.

From age 2 until 12, I never grew tired of the stories, or the pictures. We must have read this picture bible about 10 times, front to back, and my little sister and I would always beg for at least 3 or 4 stories every night. I give this book full credit to the fact that I know the old and new testament like the back of my hand. I recently joined a ladies' bible study, and have had several people commend my knowledge of the bible (especially the stories from the old testament). I credit this book fully, and would recommend that EVERY child have this version to be taught a very accurate portrait of scripture, in language that they can understand at any age. I am sure that by now, the pictures probably seem so \\"old fashioned,\\" but if it could captivate myself and my little sister at such an early age, then I am sure it will continue to do so for children in today's generation. It will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Read-N-Grow Picture Bible: A 1,872-Picture Adventure from Creation to Revelation","review":"I had this Bible as a young child, but haven't thought about it in many years (I am nearing 30). Now, looking for a good picture bible for my 3 year old, I was increasingly disappointed in the selection. Most were either too simplistic in their telling of the Bible stories or took too much liberty in the retelling. I like the matter of fact presentation in this Bible. The pictures are simple and realistic. I remember poring over this Bible as a young child. I can't wait to do that again with my little ones!"},{"Title":"Read-N-Grow Picture Bible: A 1,872-Picture Adventure from Creation to Revelation","review":"The Bible pictures are neat for my son to see as I read it to him.

Enjoy a copy with your family too."},{"Title":"Read-N-Grow Picture Bible: A 1,872-Picture Adventure from Creation to Revelation","review":"Since buying this Bible in 2004, we have constantly used this bible in our family worship times. My kids (4) love it, and even try to swipe the bible at times so they can look at the pictures and see what we're reading about tomorrow.We've probably been through this whole bible 4 or 5 times, and my only complaint is the bible did seem to start to fall apart quicker than we'd like. We did lots of patch work with packing tape and it's good to go for now.I like the comic book format, but I especially like that the stories are not washed down \\"story book\\" versions. You feel like you are reading the original text, and they leave very little detail out of the stories.I really wish they could make it bigger, and better. Unfortunately you can't hit every story, but it does have a lot of stories you would never find in other watered down bibles. For example, tonight we read about Joash the boy king. How many other children's bibles have anything about Joash?I definitely recommend this bible, I've been to the bookstore many times looking for something similar and have yet to find it."},{"Title":"Read-N-Grow Picture Bible: A 1,872-Picture Adventure from Creation to Revelation","review":"We read this to both of our girls when they were small 20 years ago.

He would fall asleep looking at the pictures every night (for some reason we were in a phase where we left the light on for him). He pretty much memorized all the pictures in the book, because he would absolutely pore over them! That one is in pretty bad shape, so I'm buying another one. I'm planning on cutting the old one up and using some of the pictures to make cards to use for my pre-schoolers to put the story in order and also to use to do a Bible timeline. This has one story with 12 pictures per two-page spread. Longer stories (like Joseph, the Exodus, etc.) are told in several parts, so there's no skimping."},{"Title":"Read-N-Grow Picture Bible: A 1,872-Picture Adventure from Creation to Revelation","review":"I purchased this for our son when he was about 10.

It's taken quite a beating over the years, but I now read it to my 5 and 3 year old every night. We usually cover about 3-4 stories. They love it and look forward to it over night. There is a picture for everything couple sentences, so I just point my finger to whatever picture we are on and they have something to look at while they listen. I'm really amazed at what they remember when we review. For example, I asked them what God had said to Moses from the burning bush. I was kinda looking for \\"tell Pharoh to let My people go,\\" but my 3 year old yelled out \\"take off your sandals and go get your brother!\\" (both things God also said) So this is giving them a great intro to more of the details.We have several different children's Bibles, and I like them all for different reasons. I wish this one was able to tie things together more. For example, last night we read intricate details of the articles in the Tabernacle, but there is no explanation about the New Testament parallels, not even later in the book. \\"The Big Picture Bible\\" does an excellent job of bringing out God's redemptive plan, but it also has really childlike and simplified illustrations.

What I liked most was the depth and accuracy of the stories. While reading it to them, it allowed for a lot of further discussion at about every age level they were at. We had others and used them in the church nursery, but this is worth the price. When it was time to get a gift for my niece and nephew, this was a no-brainer.

The text is accompanied by a plentitude of profusely drawn diagrams, that easily show the reader the task to be done or the point being made.The text is actually fairly minimal, in a style that may not necessarily appeal to some of you. There really is not a set of chapters of traditional text. Rather, Binder has chosen almost a slide show format. Each page is dominated by a diagram and bullet points therein. At the bottom of the page are a few short paragraphs expanding upon the diagram. This approach has the virtue of focusing your attention on the diagrams. The visuals are indeed strong.

Now back in print, it's a chance for all sisters to read this book and really understand the meaning of sisterly love.Amy is ten and a half, her sister Laura twelve. They don't look alike and don't act alike either: Laura's a bookworm, Amy is loud and boisterous. She makes friends with the wrong crowd, Laura's friends are mainly her books and her refuge isn't the schoolyard, it's the library.But they share something in common. Mama's coming home from the hospital after a long stay, and both girls are excited to see her again. But when Mama comes home, she's changed -- and Laura and Amy aren't used to the changes. But through it all, they learn just what it's like to have a sister that looks up to you or you look up to her, and how they are friends underneath all that.Glad it's in print again -- you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Amy & Laura (Amy & Laura Bks.)","review":"This last book in the Amy and Laura series, sort of wraps up the first two books. The chapters alternate between both Amy and Laura's point of view. Amy and Laura may be sisters, but they are as different as night and day. Laura is heavy-set, shy and awkward, and Amy is scrawny, gregarious and outgoing. Laura is smart and Amy is, well, a lazy scholar. Laura has always protected Amy from bullies, and done her homework for her. I first read this book when I was 11. I had seen it in my friend's hands in 3rd grade when i was 8 and was interested, checked it out later but didn't really get into it. One day I was in a used bookstore with my mom and she handed me a book called &quot;Amy Moves In&quot; and I recognized the name and the picture of the frizzy-haired girl on the cover, and the author's name, Marilyn Sachs. And my name is Amy, too. My mom remembered me reading Amy &amp; Laura, so I started that series. Later I bought this one at Dalton Books and really enjoyed it. Amy has a mean teacher and Laure takes up a bicycling interest and becomes hall monitor, and is too busy to help Amy with her assignments. Both sisters discover new things about each other and themselves, and the ending has lots of surprises; I only wish Sachs would continue this series. It is so good."},{"Title":"Amy & Laura (Amy & Laura Bks.)","review":"This story about two sisters living in NYC in the late 1930s has aged very well (with the exception of the photograph on the cover of the pictured edition, which makes the two girls look younger than they are in the book and not much like \\"themselves\\" if you ask me! Phooey on that, stick to the original line art!)Older sister Laura is the clumsy, bookish intellectual, while younger sister Amy is prettier, more outgoing, but also heedless and a lazy student. As the story begins, the girls' beloved Mama, who has been in an accident, is coming home from the hospital, but she's \\"changed\\" - still physically disabled and in a wheelchair. The girls also have to cope with the daily grind at school, including Amy's \\"mean\\" new teacher and the threats of the school bully, Veronica Ganz. The book shows both girls learning new things and breaking out of their established roles, as clumsy Laura learns to bike ride and Amy becomes more successful in school. Naturally, this growth doesn't come without conflicts, and the sibling rivalry and resentment over the changes in the household is very realistically portrayed. Even if you haven't had a sister, you'll understand the feelings portrayed because the author does such a nice job of explaining them."},{"Title":"Amy & Laura (Amy & Laura Bks.)","review":"A great ending to the three part series.

Know this now that it is no &quot;Little Women&quot;, or other sisterly-love books, and only that it is a work of Marilyn Sachs, who is not a popular author. The book takes place in the late 1930s' in New York. The Sterns', mostly Amy and Laura Stern, are the main characters in this book. They're different as night and day, but one thing makes them grow together. And that's Mrs. Stern, who got hit by a car... but lived.... and has come home as a whole different mother to the girls.... which causes problems. Amy is having trouble in school with a teacher that is extremely cruel. Laura's now hall monitor, and her main problem is Amy. Amy can't stand it when Laura won't help her anymore with schoolwork. Laura learns how to ride a bike and almost kills herself. What are they to do? Things get worse in the final chapter. Amy gets a great grade on her progress report - which makes Laura feel as if she's the jealous one now - and that she's not smart anymore, and the brains of the Stern family have escaped from her and into Amy's brain. Laura's report is fine, too... but somehow that's not good enough for Laura... and she gets ANGRY. Amy gets angry too, when she realizes how much Laura doesn't &quot;care&quot; about her anymore and would rather ride her bike - and Laura just explodes about it, saying that if Amy's so smart, why is she so stupid, which makes Amy just feel so angry she can't be so &quot;outshadowed&quot; anymore, so instead of saying that she's not stupid but Laura is, she scratches up Laura's face, which makes Laura hit Amy hard, which makes the girls end up rolling on the floor and pulling hair and biting. There is no exact ending to this story, but you would enjoy this story if you had a sister."},{"Title":"Native Stranger: Black American's Journey into the Heart of Africa","review":"This is quite possibly THE best non-fiction book I have ever read. It is a triumph of superb, lyrical writing and devestatingly honest philosophical reflection. It is a travel book, certainly - Eddy L. Harris, the author of (to my knowledge) four stunning &quot;exploration&quot; books like this one, travels through Africa top to bottom - but so much more.Harris not only explores his terrain, he explores its people, its customs and the reaction he gets from Africans. At the same time, he explores his own inner being: what did he, as a Blackamerican, expect to get out of Africa? What did he really come to understand? And so on. As much as the book is about Africa the continent (and the reader is treated to descriptions of villages, recreation, transport, jungles, wildlife, etc.), it is about skin color, people, race, generosity, need, pride, and everything else that makes people human.The description was beautiful and powerful: I would put the book down for the night, and when I started it again, would be transported instantly back to where Harris was and what he was experiencing, without any sense of a break.This book deals with the generosity of a people who have nothing, thje patient endurance of a people who have been trampled on for centuries. This is not to say that the book was a typical liberal interpretation of the Third World; nor were Harris' experiences as a black man what one might expect. In fact, Harris' honesty was astounding. He described his neuroses about germs (and how he had to get over that in a hurry!), his anger at the condition of the African people, his sadness and pity at the tyranny of black officals. And in South Africa, he found not only a peace which he did not expect, he even felt so overwhelmed he retreated into a formerly white-only luxury hotel, an oasis amid the poverty of the black population. This, of course, was the source of further inner exploration about his guilt and his place as a black man, but an American - a true &quot;Native Stranger.&quot;All"},{"Title":"Native Stranger: Black American's Journey into the Heart of Africa","review":"This book was greatly informative of what modern Africa is like. Many of us have misconceptions or just a vague knowledge of the so-called &quot;Dark Continent&quot;. Harris opens it up for us. I found his courage and his adventurous spirit to be both touching and inspirational. My imaginings manifested themselves this year when I treked through Spain on the Camino de Santiago- where I met with and engaged the culture, the elements and my own will. The process of discovery and adventure outside commercial tourisim is the REAL way to travel. With travel we change the way we think of where we live ... this book encourages this philosophy and will hopefully provoke people to take some time and go off to discover something. I encourage all readers to discover this book. It will challenge you and the enrichment you recieve may surprise. Thank you, Harris."},{"Title":"Native Stranger: Black American's Journey into the Heart of Africa","review":"The first three fourth of the book was amazing. The author painted a clear picture of the places he visited and the people who lived in the places he visited. I was, however, at times a bit annoyed by his failure to go beyond poverty and corruption to find the many positive images of the land and the people. I am an African who was born and raised in the continent ...and although living in the west has improved my \\"economical situation\\" I would not change the memories of my childhood for anything.I also felt that Mr. Harris rushed through the last couple of chapters of the book. They lack the detailed imagery as well as the enthusiasm that was exhibited for the first three fourth of the book.Still, I thought this was the best travel book I read on Africa."},{"Title":"Native Stranger: Black American's Journey into the Heart of Africa","review":"I found this book as I was looking for a travelogue on Africa before I went there. What a delightful surprise it was. I loved it. I've gone on to read everything that Eddy Harris has written. His self-aware, honest reflections of what he is thinking as well as experiencing are a great read. And as a person academically trained in \\"cross-cultural sensitivity\\", I thoroughly enjoyed him saying very \\"unsensitive\\" things that any American has to really be thinking in some of his circumstances. I gave this book to my sister who has no interest in Africa and she liked it as much as me. It's just a fun (and educational!) read."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"This is an excellent account of the Russian Revolution told in story form and should be included in your study of the Revolution. The author was an American journalist and active participant in the American Labor movement aiding strikers in Paterson, NJ. In 1919 he chaired the meeting which founded the Communist-Labour Party, later the Communist Party of the U.S.A.. There is no such thing as an \\"objective\\" and neutral study, all sides are bias, so this book should be read with the so called anti-communist accounts to balance this study out.There are a lot of details and yet it is told in story form. I think the other book to read on this subject is the History of the Russian Revolution written by the source itself, Leon Trotsky. Also Trotsky's book, The Revolution Betrayed. Then you can go to writings of Lenin. I found a short book on a couple of essays by the German Socialist and contemporary of the Socialist movement, Rosa Luxemburg, is very significant as an analysis. In this she criticizes much of Lenin and Trotsky's centralization as opposed to opportunism and the disbanding of the Duma and so forth, an excellent read! There are also quite a few modern books on the Russian Revolution as Richard Piper and others. This book is an excellent place to start and should not be excluded in this study.This book as scores of statements Reed took from the many of the Bolshevik - proletarian and the bourgeois newspapers, documents, announcements and decrees of Kerensky and the provincial government, short conversations with Bolsheviks, Cadets, Cossacks, Mensheviks, proletarians and bourgeois alike. What I found so helpful is that Reed, as an sort of neutral in between person, was able to interview many of the opposing sides."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"Having just finished John Reed's great work of historical journalism I would call it compelling, articulate, a page-turner, etc. It is unfortunate that Reed died so young and was unable to see what his idealistic heroes set loose upon Russia and later the world. Reed was undoubtedly a good man and I don't mean to discredit his character, just his logic.That aside, this work is fascinating in that it presents so many of the pivotal events in the formation of the Soviet Socialist system from the point of view of someone who was right there while it happened. Add to this the fact that he was an American and thus understood the American sensibility and you have a work of near genius. For the average American reader, this work must have been illuminating for reasons of its style as well as its content.Reed does have obvious bias in favor of the Bolsheviki, indeed Trotsky is portrayed as a demigod, but he is able to sympathetically depict the plight of the nation of Russia near the close of WWI and enlighten the reader to the numerous causes of the Revolution, and why it must have seemed so inevitable and right to those who experienced it.Overall a stunning work of journalism and history, highly worth your time."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"Although Ten Days That Shook the World is clearly totally biased towards the Bolsheviks, it is still an interesting read. It does an excellent job of revealing the dramatic side of the Russian Revolution, and it gives the events of the revolution the sort of immediacy that can only be achieved by on-the-spot reporting. There are also many facinating quotes and interviews with leaders, like Trotsky. It is an engaging and exciting book, and it is very well written.However, it is not really ideal (never mind ideal, it is pretty useless) for a research project or for real information. Unless you are pretty familiar with the events of the revolution, it would probably be confusing (he uses many terms without really explaining them and is VERY detailed). Furthermore, the book was written by a dedicated believer in the regime right after the event occured. Reed did not have the benefit of hindsight in writing his book - and he was blinded by his faith in socialism. Some of the events in the book are somewhat inaccurate, and Lenin and Trotsky are totally idealized! One thing that shows how biased Reed was towards the Bolsheviks is that Lenin himself states that the book is an accurate depiction of the revolution. This would seem like a good thing, but actually, when the revolution is depicted in way that is favorable to Lenin, one thing is for sure: it is completely inaccurate! For instance, the book leaves the reader with the impression that the Bolsheviks had planned the revolution much more carefully than they did in reality (it was more a lucky break than anything else).Nevertheless, this book is irreplaceable as a first-hand illustration of what the revolution was like.

Reed shows a lot from the point of view of the Bolsheviki. A very fascinating twist that sets it apart from other books on the subject. First-hand experience gives Reed great subject matter and accuracy. Pick this one up!"},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"Reed's exciting and excited eyewitness account of the Russian Revolution of 1917 is a valuable historical contibution to understanding that momentous event. Reed was &quot;into&quot; the revolution more than any foreign journalist at the time. As an active sympathizers, he was full of nervous energy that comes from the expectation of something wonderful and inevitable. The Messianic hope of Marx was to be realized. Communism was supposed to triumph and usher in a totally new era of human relations.Reed does get bogged down in details at times. For example, when he describes the multitiude of Russian political parties that operated in 1917 in a fragmented society that was coming apart at the seams. Reed would later die of typhus in Russia. His ashes were interned in the Kremlin wall, an honor reserved for the select few friends of the government or those who contributed towards its establishment or strength.Reed succeeded in conveying the atmosphere of anarchy, ferment, excitement, and struggle. I think that the ideological promise of the Revolution--classless society and workers' paradise--was a hollow hope. Yet it did accomplish an important historical transition: old political structures (monarchy, tradiditional aristocracy) were wiped out, and after the civil war, the new industrial society was born. The Russian Revolution was a transition to the modern world, which is full of struggle and tragedy, and not a portal to Earthly paradise as Reed and communists had hoped."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"More characters than a Tolstoy novel!This book has changed the way I read history -- it is more rewarding to read history than to read about history.John Reed's first person account of the Bolshevik Revolution has allowed me to formulate my own theories on how a political and social theory can reach critical mass and change the world and transform a nation.The revolution seems to have been like a wildfire or mania fueled by an unceasing supply of newspapers, propaganda and reports. The Russians would read anything and out of all of the varying ideas it was Lenin's that held sway. An amazing occurrence of political Darwinism.It is a stirring read in these ambivalent times and I do not think that Reed's intent was subversive, merely journalistic. This alone must have scared the pants off of the western capitalist class of the time.In light of what Russia is experiencing right now it holds the fascination of watching a car accident."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"\\"Ten Days That Shook The World\\" is an often confused and pedantic book designed to serve a murderous cause, so much so in parts it reads like \\"Helter Skelter\\" if written by Squeaky Fromme. But beneath the surface lies a worthy piece of history written by a journalist whose eye for detail and complexity is sometimes the equal of his partisan passions.John Reed writes here of the October Revolution of 1917, in which the Bolsheviks, hardline communists who played but a small role in the popular overthrow of the Czar months before, \\"soared...from a despised and hunted sect... to this supreme place, the helm of a great Russia in full tide of insurrection!\\"The October Revolution (which actually fell on November under the old Russian calendar Reed follows in this text) was not then a battle against monarchy but against fellow socialists, moderates like Alexander Kerensky who were continuing the Czar's war against Imperial Germany in hope of securing a peace agreement Russia could live with. Meanwhile, Russians suffered and died, and thus a cry went out to replace Kerensky. It was led by Bolsheviks like Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky, who claimed Kerensky was selling Russia out and demanded he be thrown on what Trotsky vividly called \\"the ash-heap of history\\" along with all other socialists who would conciliate with Russia's middle class. And what to replace them with? Why, the Bolsheviks, the only group who could be trusted with power of any kind. Naturally, when they got it, Trotsky signed a peace with the Germans even Reed termed \\"disastrous\\".It's tempting to review the revolution here more than the book, especially as Reed saw this book as a \\"how-to\\" manual for the Western proletariat. But \\"Ten Days\\", after a dry and extended set-up, develops an energy as it follows in often touching vignettes the ten days when Kerensky's regime was decisively overthrown. It was written in a famously short time and published in 1919, when the story was still fresh and before the Soviets had a mind to rewrite their own past to eliminate discordant voices and inconvenient friends.Reed, as others note, seems everywhere here; talking to Trotsky, eating potato soup with Bolshevik soldiers from a common tub, sweating illiterate sentries checking his passes, even at one point meeting counter-revolutionaries in their hideout while a rightist leader, \\"for whose arrest the Military Revolutionary Committee would have paid a fortune\\", sits writing on a toilet.One notes throughout this book a tendency for Reed to ascribe to the common man of Russia one voice, a voice that unfailingly corresponds to the Bolshevik cause, never mind that there were a number of other parties enjoying vocal support. Such emotional declarations are approving noted, as is the derision heaped on those who speak differently. The people often appear as one collective mass, whether walking contemptuously past a church where they once worshiped or telling Reed that the only thing worse than being under the Czar is capitalism.But Reed is too good a journalist to leave it there. The fact is \\"Ten Days\\" now and then, almost offhandedly, poses a number of questions that would become uncomfortable to Soviet dogma. At one point, after Kerensky is sent running for good, a question about freedom of the press is raised, by a Bolshevik no less. Trotsky answers that such freedom has no place in a Revolutionary society, because newspapers can be used as a tool of bourgeoisie oppression.\\"Who's oppressed now!\\" Reed records a voice crying out. \\"Cannibal!\\"Cannibalism is what happens with revolutions all too often; it did here. Reed may have been on the wrong side, but in moments like this he cuts through the propaganda and tedium to deliver a message worth heeding."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"This is Jack Reed's well-written but highly partisan and pro-Bolshevik eyewitness account of the Russian Revolution. Reed's Soviet Socialist biases drip from every page like an oily coating, and this may irritate readers who are not quite so utopian as was Reed. TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD is all but useless as an objective history of the event, but it is extraordinarily useful as a subjective interpretation of the birth of the first Communist state, and therefore, it is an interesting, fascinating, and valuable document well worth reading."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"A classic study of the Bolshevik Revolution in October/November, 1917 in Russia. Truly an excellent vision of the struggles that workers faced at the time from the inherently oppressive capitalist and feudal capitalist system. A blueprint for today's communists which demonstrates the urgent need to smash the capitalist state and to dispose of private property. The facists will hate this book as it shows an example of their inevitable demise through their own self-interest"},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"John Reed's book, \\"Ten Days That Shook The World\\", presents a challenge to well-meaning scholars of the October Revolution everywhere. The continuing debate over comrade Reed's accounts of the events of the socialist triumph over the bourgeois Kerenskyite oligarchs has been overshadowed by the present-day temporary setback experienced by the Communist Party of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and its struggle to resume its true and rightful place as the vanguard of the international proletariat. As Engels wrote in his classic work, \\"Materialism and the Apostasis of the 18th Brumaire\\" (Progress Press, Moscow, 1957), the inevitability of achieving a worker's state is far from a seamless upward trail, and will, from time to time encounter momentary challenges and obstacles thrown in the path of progess by counter-revolutionary and capitalist elements.How does the proper historian view Reed's work? Clearly, as comrade V. I. Lenin wrote his original introduction to \\"Ten Days\\", Reed was at his best in reporting on the empirical reality of the proletarian movements inside Petrograd. As comrade Lenin and others later commented, Reed could be excused as a \\"revolutionary journalist\\" (a bourgeois conceit, of course) for failing to correctly observe the deviationism underlying the Plenkhavites and so-called moderate Socialist Revolutionaries, not to mention crypto-anarchists and other undisciplined romantic individualists. Reed erred in not uncovering the Menshevik centrist trend in the Russian Social Democratic movement, lead by Trotsky and Bukharin, arch-conspirators and chauvinists who were rightfully expelled from the Party in 1927. Indeed, it was with comradely restraint and generosity that comrade Lenin granted a state memorial to comrade Reed's memory....Regrettably, truly objective scholarship has all but disappeared since the unfortunate events of the past decade. Perhaps the best critical analysis of the contradictions in Reed's works is found in comrade S.I. Klepov's monumental and enthralling six volume work, \\"Annals of the Sixth Comintern's Sub-Committee On Far Eastern Labor Relations in the Baikal-Irkutsk Regions (Progress Press, Moscow, 1937 (sadly, now out of print)), in which at page 708, he writes, \\"The American J. Reed fails to dialectically confront the errors of so-called moderates but in reality bourgeois roaders such as Zinoviev. He can be excused many of these faults due to his education in the infantile American labor movement and its inability to grasp such fundamental necessities as party discipline... As we know, \\"facts\\" are not the same as \\"truth.\\" Shorn of the necessary empiro-criticism guided by the steady hand of the Party, Reed's \\"account\\" of the November revolution are but an empty shadow of the genuine proletariat victory.\\" Truly such words were written on pages of gold!Surely we cannot improve on comrade Klepov's correct analysis. Comrade Reed's work, while flawed, can be forgiven as a good and indulgent father excuses an errant but well-meaning child."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"The world was certainly changed by these days that shook the world; Reed is accurate about that. He also does a solid job of explaining the background to the Bolsheviks' power grab from the corrupt &quot;ancien regime.&quot; This is a good book for those of us interested in how a perverted, twisted, and destructive ideology was able to take control of a great nation and manipulate the levers of power to the tune of 37 million deaths over its lifespan. Now that communism (at least from the semi-peripheral states such as Russia) has been consigned to the dustbin of history, it is well worth a re-read."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"Although this book may be so brilliantly written by John Reed, I found it to be too laden with historical details, and even somewhat confusing for someone who is using this book to merely familiarize her (him)self with the makings of the Russian Revolution for the first time. The book provides with a glossary of Russian terms, events and political parties necessary to understand it but even so I found myself hopelessly stumbling through the chapters trying to pick up information here and there. However, due to my lack of knowledge of Russian history I was unable to piece together any of the information. So, in frustration I gave up and relinquished the book to somebody who knows somebody who is a &quot;history buff&quot;. From this experience I learned that if you want to familiarize yourself with a historical event about which you know truly nothing, it is always better to read a book which describes that event perhaps in a very broad outline form on the first page of the book. The rest of the book should be written according to that outline. A glossary of main events would also be helpful. On the other hand I do realize that most historical events are way too complicated to be approached in this manner. Anyway, if you would like to expand your knowledge about the Russian Revolution, I highly recommend this book. However, if like me you are looking to merely acquire a basic knowledge about this historical event you will get lost in its too many facts."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"I took Sheila Fitzpatrick's &quot;History of the Soviet Union&quot; at the University of Texas the same semester &quot;Reds&quot; came out, so it was only logical that I would read John Reed's book on the side. One had a hard time believing that he could be so calm and cool about the thuggish agenda proclaimed by Lenin, Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Stalin, _et al._ Then, when the Berlin Wall came down and Gorbachev called an end to the Soviet Union, we obtained access to Soviet state archives. What do you know! John Reed received payments of over $1,000,000.00 from the CPSU in the 1910s and 1920s! Who else ever got _more_ money, in current dollars, than this Communist agent? Maybe I.F. Stone.It's stunning that American publishers, etc., still give this fellow attention even after we know that, as Solzhenitsyn says, over 65,000,000 people were murdered by the Soviet Communists (and that's not counting the cost of their alliance with Hitler). Amazing moral obtuseness at the heart of American culture.It's a boring book, too."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"To appreciate this book, you have to understand what it is and what it isn't.This is top-notch journalism, by someone with a lot of insight into what he was seeing, and a knack for turning up in all the right places. It gives you a vivid, unparalleled *flavor* of the Russian revolution of 1917, the first victorious working class revolution.But it's still *journalism*. It's not an organized chronicle of what happened, beginning at the beginning and introducing events and ideas in a logical order. On top of that, Reed arrived in Russia at the climax of the revolution, after seven months of intense activity by an overwhelming cast of characters. If you read it too casually, it's like starting a textbook by reading the last chapter.To get the most out of the book, I suggest reading Reed's introductory material carefully, probably returning to it more than once as you read the book. If you need more help, there's a good summary in the last two chapters of \\"Revolutionary Continuity: the Early Years\\" by Farrell Dobbs.Your efforts will be well-rewarded. It really is great journalism.For a definitive history, I highly recommend the widely acclaimed masterpiece, \\"History of the Russian Revolution\\" by Leon Trotsky. If you like one book, you'll like the other. I promise. Please read my review. (Click on \\"See all my reviews\\" above.)Some reviewers complained that Reed doesn't explain the revolution's shortcomings -- the Russian revolution obviously turned out badly in the long run. But not everyone agrees that the revolution was fatally flawed from the very beginning. I don't. It's hard to read Reed's book and believe it was anything but an authentic popular revolution. For what went wrong, I recommend \\"The Revolution Betrayed\\" by Leon Trotsky and \\"Lenin's Final Fight\\", a collection of Lenin's last writings."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"This is a most powerfully written American radical journalist's eyewitness account of the Bolshevik seizure of power--recording the excitement of the October days and the beginnings of John Reed's own revolutionary disillusionment.Ten Days That Shook the World is the classic account of the Russian Revolution of November 1917 by a western journalist and has been admired worldwide since its first publication in 1919. Lenin endorsed it as &quot;a truthful and most vivid exposition of the events so significant to the comprehension of what really is the Proletarian Revolution.&quot;Already based in Europe and sympathetic to the cause of the Russian Revolution, Reed was able to observe dispassionately exactly what was going on and to find out not only what the Bolshevik leaders were doing, but to move among those on the streets and note experiences of the masses of ordinary people. Witnessing first-hand the day-to-day events of the Revolution, he captures in vivid and graphic detail the atmosphere of that time.An extraordinary document of history in the making, this newer edition is the first with contemporary photographs, while a new introduction by Harold Shukman, University Lecturer in Modern Russian History at Oxford University, sets the work in context. Published to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Russian Revolution, this illustrated edition will appeal to anyone interested in modern history. And quite possibly re-ignite a political polemic.Warren Beatty dared to make the film Reds, which gives us a poignantly epic visual view of John Reed, his life, his loves and his fierce beliefs as read in Ten Days That Shook The World."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"\\"Ten Days That Shook The World\\" is the account by John Reed of what he saw during the Russian Revolution. Reed was an American Communist and journalist who is the only American known to be buried in the Kremlin. Throughout this book we read a series of observations and dialogues reported by Reed, virtually without comment, although his bias is apparent. We read his reports of political meetings, encounters with minor officials and his observations of events occurring during those turbulent revolutionary days in Petrograd.This book is a classic case of missing the forest for the trees. The view is too up close to permit the reader to see the big picture. One does not look here for the history of the Revolution. We look here for its spirit. Here we see the swirling chaos, hear the repeated buzz words and get a feeling for the competing factions which fashioned the Communist tyranny which emerged from the Revolution.In writing this book, Reed gives the reader a view of himself and other American Communists who saw in the Revolution the future that worked. His view can best be summarized in his comment that, while watching a funeral, he realized that the Russian people no longer needed priests to pray them into heaven because they were building a world brighter than any which heaven promised. This hope is in stark contrast to the now known Communist record.Overall I enjoyed this book as it taught me some more about the Russian Revolution than I had learned from other books which I had read. (See my Amazon review of \\"The Russian Revolution\\" by Alan Moorehead.) For that it was worth reading."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"This book is one of the most biased books ever written, but this shouldnt be taken as a criticism. This is one of the those history books that was written by someone that was actually there at the time things were happening, and the author made it clear that he was not trying to present \\"both sides\\" of the story. He was going to present the \\"people's side\\" (at least at that specific time). You dont have to be a communist to enjoy this book. In fact, you can compare the dream the people had at that time with what they actually got later. Beautifully written, this book makes you live the revolution. As you read it, you find yourself walking down the same street with the people at that time and listening to them talk and argue and even fight. Thanks to Reed's amazing style you can visualize the whole thing."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"Mr. Reed's depiction of the events in Petrograd leading up to the October Revolution was gripping, well-balanced and thoughtful. The book was not marred in the least by the fact that he was a well-known Communist. Those who percived that are probably either ultra-anti-Communist or perhaps misinterpreted Mr. Reed's work. All in all, an excellent book."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"Reed's work definitely evokes the heady atmosphere of the Bolshevik Revolution, when it actually seemed as if the working class might rise up as one and seize the reins of power and therefore of its destiny. It is the classic account of Red October as told from the viewpoint of an &quot;outsider&quot; who identified with the Revolution as a member of the universal working class. However, it should not be forgotten that Louise Bryant was not only present as well but also wrote an account of her experiences. Six Red Months in Russia is the indispensable companion to Reed's work; the two should be read in tandem. As of the date of this posting (05.23.03) it is in print from Powell's Press. Get it while you can. It is a neglected gem of reporting from the Revolutionary frontlines which should command an equal amount of respect as does Reed's Ten Days that Shook the World."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"Reed's work is most exquisite; it acts as a very effective summary of the revolutionary events. As far as such goes, it is singularly unique in its singlety of focus. Further, it acts as a most helpful resource as regards obtaining an understanding of the underlying dynamics of the revolution; recorded by an American witness (and the only American to be entombed in the Kremlin), it is an original and wholly constructive study--a must-read for any student of revolutionary thought or conflict dynamics."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"John reed was there. He witnessed the Russian revolution firdt hand . A great book for a student of history esp. of Russian History. Reed brings to life the emotional and sweeping moment in History that was to shape the 20th century"},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"John Reed, Harvard Class of 1910, epitomized the best of the pre-World War I bourgeois radicals. Unlike the vast majority of his Class and class he cast his fate with the working people and oppressed of America at a time when the dominant left bourgeois movement- the Progressive movement- was busy applying band aids to the increasingly inequitable capitalist system. The radical movement is always in need, sometimes desperately in need, of intellectuals to tell its side of the story. Despite some exceptions, like Reed, the intellectuals then, as now, either stand on the sidelines or at most acted as \`fellow travelers' to the movement. Reed on the contrary put all his energies into the movement. As a journalist he sought out all the radical hotspots of his time starting with his coverage of the Mexican Revolution, through the various workers' strikes of the 1910's in America culminating in his coverage of the heroic period of the Russian Revolution. His journalistic account of the Bolshevik seizure of power, Ten Days That Shook the World, stands even today as one of the best eyewitness accounts of that turbulent time in Russia. Reed had access to many elements of Russian society, from the revolutionatry workers quarters in Vyborg and Kronstadt to high society in the shadow of the Winter Palace, and mined those sources for his material. He brings the passion of the partisan in the best sense to his work.Revised and Updated Review- July 5, 2008I, on more than one occasion, have mentioned that for a detailed history of the ebb and flow of the Russian Revolution of 1917 from February to October of that year your man is the great Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky. Trotsky's History of the Russian Revolution is partisan history at its best. One does not and should not, at least in this day in age, ask historians to be \`objective'. One simply asks that the historian present his or her narrative and analysis and get out of the way. Trotsky meets that criterion. I have also mentioned in that same context that there are other excellent sources on this subject, depending on your needs. If you are looking for a general history of the revolution or want an analysis of what the revolution meant for the fate of various nations after World War I or its affect on world geopolitics look elsewhere. E.H. Carr's History of the Russian Revolution offers an excellent multi-volume set that tells that story through the 1920's. Or if you want to know what the various parliamentary leaders, both bourgeois and Soviet, were thinking and doing from a moderately leftist viewpoint read Sukhanov's Notes on the Russian Revolution. If you need a more journalistic account for the period of the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks and the immediate aftermath, the book under review, John Reed's classic Ten Days That Shook the World is invaluable.If we do not, as mentioned above, expect our historians to be \`objective' then we have a lesser expectation of those journalists who write the \`first draft of history'. Reed makes no bones that he is a partisan of the Bolshevik led social revolution that he was witnessing. He, nevertheless, tells his story reasonably well for those who are not partisans. Moreover, Reed seems to have been everywhere in Petersburg during those days. He is as likely to have been reporting from Petersburg's Winter Palace, the seat of the Kerensky's Provisional Government, as Smolny, the seat of the insurgent Soviets. We can find him among the bourgeois politicians of the City Duma or at the Russian Army General Staff headquarters. Hell, he was in Moscow when things were hot there as the Soviet forces tried to seize the Kremlin. He is at meetings large-Peasant Soviet size- or in some back room at Smolny with Trotsky's Military Revolutionary Committee that directed the uprising. To that extent, as a free lancer on the move, he covers physically during this period much more territory than Trotsky could as central director of the action and thus has more first hand observations.Reed's style tends toward straight forward reportage with little obvious sense of irony in the various situations that he is witnessing. Of course, against Trotsky's masterly ironic sense he is bound to suffer by comparison. Nevertheless Reed gets us into places like the City Duma and into the heads of various characters like the Mayor of Petersburg that Trotsky, frankly, displayed no interest in dealing with. Probably the greatest compliment that one could pay Reed is that he is widely quoted as a reliable source in many historical accounts from Trotsky on the winning side to someone like Kerensky on the losing side. For those who want a quick but serious overview of the dynamic of the October Revolution then here is your man. Add in his companion Louise Bryant's separate account, Six Month in Red Russia (if you can find it), and some very good primary source poster, pamphlet and newspaper material in the appendices of Reed's book and you are on your way."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"This is not the easiest book to read and desparately needed editing before being published. John Reed, being an American socialist journalist, was obviously biased although he occasionally tried to hide it. John Reed's account is also confusing in many places trying to distinguish the various factions in play during the Bolshevik Revolution. Under normal circumstances this could rate as maybe two or three stars.So why am I being \\"generous\\" with five stars?There were factors that contributed to the \\"sloppiness\\" of this book. The US Government confiscated Reed's notes when he returned to the US and he fought for seven months to get his notes back. Once he got the notes he went into seclusion. If the book reads like something that was slapped together in around ten days it is because the book was slapped together in around ten days. Given the circumstances the book was a good eye witness account of the turbulent days of the events in Petrograd, Moscow, and other parts of Russia in November 1917.Regardless of what one may think of Lenin, Trotsky, Kerensky, Korilov, and other important players in the revolution these individuals and others played a critical role in a critical event that \\"shook the world\\". The book is especially interesting as it relays the hopes of the individuals in the early days of the revolution that was admittedly tense, confusing, and at times brutal. When the book was written Russia was in the second year of a civil war between Russian \\"Whites\\" and Russian \\"Reds\\". If the Whites had won then this book would have been just a footnote in the annals of political journalism. But the Reds won and what Reed witnessed turned out to be the start of something big that was to be a major impact on the world for decades to come.The book was also written by an American socialist journalist whose opinion was framed in the hopes and dreams of the Russian proletariat. It is not tainted by the harsh and brutal reality that was to occur in the post-Lenin Russia as Reed -- who died in 1920 -- had no idea of what the future would be. He thought many wonderful things will happen as a result the revolution. Instead, a power struggle ensued after Lenin's demise and the Soviet Union was plunged into a dark hole from which many of the key characters of this book did not emerge.It is also interesting that one of the book's harshest critics was Josef Stalin. Stalin was treated as a peripheral character who is mention maybe twice in the entire book. To make matters worse one of Stalin's bitterest rival, Leon Trotsky, emerges as one of the stars of the revolution without whom it probably would have failed. Stalin was to ensured Soviet historical accounts did not repeat that transgression.Regardless of what one may think of Communism and Socialism this is a critical book that accounts for the very earliest days of the Soviet Union. It is not the easiest book to read but it is worth the effort."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"It should be pointed out that since the 1980s new information about Reed has come to light through access to Soviet archives.

John Reed?s &quot;Ten Days That Shook the World&quot; reached a large audience in the United States and internationally. Many wanted to know why an entire planet could be thrust into war. In an attempt to address that issue, some decided that nationalism, governmental agendas, realpolitik, racism, class warfare, capitalism, Democracy, and corporations in bed with politicians and militarists were to blame.Nationalism was part of it. German unification and Balkan nationalism played a role. Governmental agendas and realpolitik always have played a role in conflict. Since Communism addressed the concept of &quot;one world government&quot; and a &quot;world without borders,&quot; some concluded that Communism offered the answer to these problems.Racism was never an original part of the war, but would emerge as an ugly by-product. The Turks unleashed an open can of worms resulting in &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; and genocide pitting Christians against Muslims, Turks against Arabs, secular vs. religious. In Germany, an easy scapegoat began to emerge: The Jews. Lies began to spread that Jewish banking interests profited from the war. In the American South Jewish influence was an affront to their sensibilities. The Ku Klux Klan rose again after a period of dormancy. The KKK?s &quot;mandate&quot; pitted them against a &quot;worldwide Jewish conspiracy&quot; somehow in league with Papal domination. They said Catholics pledge allegiance not to the U.S., but to the Vatican. But few Catholics and fewer Jews lived in the South. Many blacks did. They were becoming a more prominent segment of society. Blacks were emerging as professional athletes in the Negro baseball leagues, and as musicians in the jazz world. As they asserted themselves, this infuriated the white underclass.But the most pernicious thing that emerged out of World War I were Westerners who believed that the war had occurred because of the failure of capitalism, Democracy, and corporations who were in bed with politicians and militarists. When Reed?s book came out, a segment of society allowed themselves to believe that the new political system in Russia should be given a chance. Communism became &quot;the answer&quot; to society?s many problems, including racism and poverty. The failure of Communism, already evident by 1920, was not exposed to the world. Reed either chose not to write about the thousands and thousands of famine victims, the secret police, the crackdowns and forced marches, the banishments, assassinations and disappearances, or he was controlled by the hierarchy, and not allowed to see it. He probably did not want to see it. He had found his story and he was going to stick to it. The great failure of the free press, of governments and political figures, of humanists and truth-seekers, was the failure to pin Russia - Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky, and the rest of them - down before they became too powerful. To expose them for what they were.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;..."},{"Title":"Contemporary American poetry","review":"This little book contains some 39 American poets, some better known than others. If you're into poetry, and looking for an interesting and brief collection of what was being written in America during the middle-half of the 20th century (and thus, highly influential upon our own) than this Penguin anthology is a great book to own. In his introduction, written in 1961, Donald Hall distinguishes \\"new\\" American poetry as being \\"subjective\\" rather than \\"autobiographical\\". \\"It reveals through images not particular pain, but general subjective life.\\" The poems of this era (roughly the 1950's & early 1960's) are best described as \\"expressionistic\\" - they have their own language and feeling best understood and felt if the reader is open to them. Like a painter \\"...the poet uses fantasy and distortion to express feeling.\\"I like this anthology because it contains a number of American poets I was unfamiliar with and wanted to know. Each poet is represented fairly well, mostly with four or more poems. Stafford, Lowell, Wilbur, Bly, Creeley, Ginsberg, Ashbery, Sexton, Wright, Rich, Snyder, and Plath are some of the more well-known names in American poetry you'll find here. But the rest are just as interesting for being less known and \\"new\\". Reading these poets all together, one gains a basic idea of what kinds of movements, directions, and experiments were happening in poetry at this time, leading into and influencing ours. A number of lines strike me in a meaningful or thought-provoking way, and I enjoy the way many of these poets make one see and feel in a new and different light. Well worth the time and effort of any knowledgable poet or poetry lover."},{"Title":"Contemporary American poetry","review":"When Donald Hall put this together in 1962 it was filled with works by poets born mostly in the 1920's. It's a collection of short works to get you acquainted with poets, many now so famous, and old, that you hardly need this book any more other than for historical reference. Poems by William Stafford, Robert Lowell, Robert Duncan, Reed Whittemore, Howard Nemerov, Richard Wilbur, Anthony Hecht, James Dickey, Denise Levertov, John Logan, Louis Simpson, Edgar Bowers, Donald Justice, Robert Bly, Robert Creeley, James Merrill, W.D. Snodgrass, John Ashbery, Galway Kinnell, W.S. Merwin, James Wright, S.J. Kennedy, Adrienne Rich, Gary Snyder, Robert Mezey. The blurb on John Ashbery tells us that he won the Yale Series of Younger Poets in 1956 and wrote The Tennis Court Oath in 1962. Were we every that young?"},{"Title":"Me and the Arch Kook Petulia","review":"I found a yellowing copy of this book in my basement. It was a movie tie in for a Julie Christie, George C. Scott and Richard Lester film. I had heard the film was great but a book? Well, I was curious. The book is wonderful. The movie and the book are pretty much the same but the book maps out the relationship a little bit better. A young woman from a poverty stricken background finagles her way into marrying a rich young man from a very wealthy family. He turns out to be a monster who beats her regularly and terrorizes her. The family dynamic risen around the young man is to hide his violence and force her to do the same. A young boy from Mexico ends up in the mix and Petulia begins to look for another man who will help them both. She chooses an aging doctor with a gentle disposition. Without completely communicating what is going on in their own personal lives, they fall in love. Constrained by their pasts, it is difficult to understand what is true and what are secrets. An unforgettable book."},{"Title":"Even a Stone Can Be a Teacher: Learning and Growing from the Experiences of Everyday Life","review":"I think that this is a great book. The only problem with it might be, that its not written very well. It seems to drag at times and one might feel that its not worth the time. But, it is. This is one book which confronts you directly about who you really are and who you think you are. It reveals the actual meaning of your thoughts and the actual intentions of your actions. Its quite an eye opener into human psychology, in general, and you will see patterns of your own behaviour in his descriptions of situations. It brings you out from the illusion where you are a saint, an extremely nice person; where whatever you do is good, and where you are always thinking about others first and then about yourself. Its worth it in the end."},{"Title":"The Poser 3 Handbook","review":"I purchased this book about two months ago. I was not impressed with the volume and span of information covered, but nonetheless, this is a fine resources for all artists who are considering using Poser as a mainstay in their program skill sets. Particularly noteable: keyframe animation and lip-synching to WAV files. Also, (and in my opinion, this was worth the price of the book alone) there is a section on handshaking protocols with other 3D programs (RayDream Studio, 3DS Max, LightWave, Infini-D, etc.). Poser's interaction with MetaCreation's other very powerful mid-price-range vehicle, Ray Dream Studio 5, makes for unbeliveable effects for practically pocket change.If you're going to use Poser for serious reasons, you need this book."},{"Title":"The Poser 3 Handbook","review":"This is an odd book at best. In reading this you can garner the information you most wanted to know and that's the strength of this book. However be prepared for 2 things. No. 1 the writer has an odd style of writing and the examples border on the grotesque side. In fact that is my biggest complaint he spends much time in the book creating many examples of mutant figures (male heads with horns). This may not bother you, I just didn't see a need for it. My personal use for Poser has always been for realistic modeling. Now the good news. this is the Second part. No.2 To his credit he does tackle the tougher issues invovled in creating additional figures and props. I waited along time for a resource to describe whats involved. One thing to note Poser 3 is an incredible program. In the 3d arena few programs match the style and ease of using Poser3. Perhaps the best thing I found out was the incredible resources from other poser users.Bottom line is be prepared. If you find the book look through it and see if it answers your questions. In my opinion it does answer the toughest questions there bye making it worth while. Also of note is the information on human studies in motion as well as Animals in motion. These are included on the cd and should be interesting reading in itself for anyone interested in more realistic animating. I'm not a profressional animator bye any means so I love being able to learn from others. You can spend Hr's learning what takes minutes to read. This the best reason to buy any book and there is alot to learn."},{"Title":"The Poser 3 Handbook","review":"I have not yet bought the Poser 4 handbook, and it is THIS book that assured I never will! When I was still working with Poser 3, I was looking for a good resource to teach me how to use it's advanced (at the time) features. Heh, the cover art should have showed me that this book was NOT it. After reading the book (a waste of time), I realized that if THIS was the best he could do, then I was already far more advanced in Poser 3 than he was. Since, thanks to online tuts, I am an advanced Poser 4 user, I think I'll be once burned twice shy and avoid it. My advice to you about the Poser 3 handbook? Well, if you are a rank beginner that wants to make weird figures, this is your book. If you want to learn to use Poser 3's features to make lovely, realistic characters and scenes, use the online resources as this book's price tag is not nearly justified by the mediocre and sometimes bizarre infomation in it."},{"Title":"The Poser 3 Handbook","review":"If you have even the slightest experience with computer graphics you will find this book (like all the R. Shamms Mortimer books) to be useless! Not only does he appear to have no real skill with the product his examples consist of page after page of mindless repetition. Ex: here's how to make a man with a fish head, and now here's how to make a man with a dog head, and now here's how to make a man with a horse head, etc, ad nauseam. Instead of giving master advice on how to make the most of this tool (as part of a greater software toolkit) Shamms simply plugs pieces together mindlessly and passes them off as lessons. There are maybe ten useful pages in the book and ALL of them are almost directly from the Poser manual. Avoid this book at all costs."},{"Title":"The Poser 3 Handbook","review":"In agreement with other customer previews, Shamms Mortier has written a book not for the general Poser user, but of his own likes and dislikes. As his own graphical skills don't appear to be very polished (I am being kind here!) he shows his limitations by crude examples. By far, the largest drawback to this book is the fact that if you do not have other software (ie: Ray Dream Studio - as the author MUST have!) then the book is next to useless to a Poser (only) user."},{"Title":"The Poser 3 Handbook","review":"This is the third and FINAL book I will ever read by R. Shamms Mortier. This is the only book dedicated to Poser3 and sadly it has to come from such a wretched author. There are so many great features about Poser3 that could be discussed that are only merely 'touched upon'. His &quot;I don't like this feature so you MUST NEVER USE IT&quot; attitude bothers me. His work is pittiful -My non-artist friends make better pictures than he does and they do it with Poser1 ! To R. Shamms Mortier- stay out of the graphics resource documentation business!"},{"Title":"The Poser 3 Handbook","review":"This is one of the best books of it's type. first of all, it is the only book on poser 3. it has given me insights into poser 3 that would have taken me possibly months to get. it gives you so much. and the cd-rom that's included, gives you everything that's in the book, including projects to make. it also gives you templates of almost all of the poser characters, and their clear too! anyone wanting to paint texture on their models know's how important that is. i have no regrets about buying this book. if i had to pay $20.00 more for it, knowing what i know now, i would do it in a heartbeat!"},{"Title":"The Poser 3 Handbook","review":"i expected this book to bee more profeshinal , you can see that the Writer (most of the time) just playing with the program and not teaching you important things, they could done better please e-mail me for replay"},{"Title":"The Poser 3 Handbook","review":"Why did &quot;Top 50 reviewer&quot; Angel Lee feel compelled to rate this book TWICE and give it five stars each time? Without those two gushing, unrealistic raves, the book ends up with the one-star rating it deserves.If you like creating silly, useless morphs, this is the book for you. If you're serious about learning Poser, visit Renderosity and the other great on-line resources for tutorials that will really teach you something useful."},{"Title":"The Poser 3 Handbook","review":"Why? Cause he poses as a professional, when clearly he is not. I mean shouldn't you know something about the subject before you start teaching others. I have the manual I can look through it. I have the program I can play with all the different buttons, this literature brings me no closer to learning the program."},{"Title":"Washakie;: An account of Indian resistance of the covered wagon and Union Pacific railroad invasions of their territory,","review":"I have in my hands a book titled \\"WASHAKIE, An account of Indian resistance of the Covered Wagon and Union Pacific Railroad Invasions of their territory\\". It is beautifully illustrated with photographs. Inside the cover it has what appears to be a flyer citing 7 reviews and noting \\"Price $6.00 net, express prepaid\\". In the flyer, we see Arthur H. Clark Company with address Glendale, California but within the book I see Cleveland, U.S.A., 1930. The flyer has a slightly differing title: \\"WASHAKIE, An account of Indian resistance to the Covered Wagon and Union Pacific Railroad Invasions of their territory\\". The author's preface is 'signed' and dated August 1929. The book shows \\"Copyright 1930\\".This appears to be a first edition, yet Amazon is showing a 1911 version with a very similar title. (The 1911 title has 'invasion' instead of 'invasions'.)Something here does not compute!!I have this copy via my family: my father's father, Charles Warren Chase, had a sister, Kate, who married the son of Judge William A Carter. We still have in the family a desk from the Carter home on which Owen Wister is said to have drafted parts of 'The Virginian'."},{"Title":"The Joy of Six!","review":"A delightful, modest recounting of a woman's well lived &amp; thoughtful life.

Sometimes it is hard to remember to laugh at the things that happen in our lives, learn from them and move on and she does a great job reminding us of these things."},{"Title":"The Joy of Six!","review":"Charlene writes with down-to-earth common sense. Through the glimpses into her personal life we find a richness of wisdom and experience and so much humour...and maybe, if we allow her, she helps us to have another look at our own lives and see that what we think is missing has been there all along but we just needed to look from a different angle. Charlene is like that dear old friend you haven't seen for five years and yet you can sit and chat with for hours like it was just yesterday, and any time spent in her company will lift your spirit and have you feeling better."},{"Title":"The Joy of Six!","review":"I STRONGLY recommend this book. This is the book that had me laughing out LOUD while doing chemo (ok, the people around thought I was crazy, but I tell you the positive vibration I'm sure helped in the healing).I enjoyed it so much that I rationed it so that I would only read it when I went to the cancer centre for treatment.And Charlene doesn't just make you laugh, her wisdom and insights will have you thinking long afterwards.Thank you so much for this Charlene!"},{"Title":"The Joy of Six!","review":"I feel like I know this woman, really. We had (still have) 8 lively kids and lived in the midwest for many years. Many of her recollections resemble our very busy household.In this strange world where expressing your everyday faith and Christianity is akin to political incorrectness, it is refreshing to read some downright honesty in daily living.A fun book that is a bit like James Harriot and his animal short stories, nice for easy, humorous reading, always with some roots in a lesson to learn."},{"Title":"The Joy of Six!","review":"She has a very down to earth way of expressing herself and sharing her wonderful stories. It is refreshing to see someone declaring her love of God and the world around her with such honesty. She has the ability of laughing at herself which I find very refreshing. I am in the process of reading all of her books and am finding them all very enjoyable and enlightening."},{"Title":"The Language of Passion: Selected Commentary","review":"Most columnists, at least most American columnists, tend to specialize. They write on politics or art or culture or economics. But Vargas Llosa, Peruvian novelist (\\"Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter\\") and essayist (\\"Making Waves\\"), refuses to be pinned down. In the \\"Touchstone\\" column he writes for Spain's major newspaper, Vargas Llosa laments the demise of the British Reading Room with the same conviction and assurance with which he lambastes the leadership of the Chiapas rebels in Mexico or celebrates the erotic abandon of Rio's four-day Carnaval.Vargas Llosa has been writing his column since 1977 and this second collection includes columns from 1992 to 2000. The title, which comes from a tribute to fellow writer and \\"intellectual agitator\\" Octavio Paz, is a fitting one. Not that Vargas Llosa could ever be accused of hot headedness. Though he does tend to describe destructive elements on the extreme right or left as \\"idiots\\" or \\"absolute idiots,\\" his impassioned opinions are informed by 60 years of global travel, observation, reading and thought.His politics can be described fairly simply - he believes in secular democracy and the free market. Socially he is moderately liberal. But those simple terms embrace a host of cogent arguments and ironic observations from around the world.Vargas Llosa relishes irony and contrast. There is amusement in his vivid description of the bejeweled rich who paid big money to sit enraptured at a lavish production of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's masterpiece of anti-capitalism, \\"The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny. A bitter irony is found in the appropriation of the liberal argument for multiculturalism in defense of the abhorrent practice of female \\"circumcision\\" among immigrants to Western countries. More baffling is the contrast found in a thoughtful intellectual known for penetrating literary criticism and subtle reflections on the various world religions, whose 1939-45 \\"Journal,\\" is filled with an obsessive anti-Semitism that \\"lingers like a noxious miasma in the reader's memory, like the stink of cheap brothels, the smell of sharp tobacco, dirty feet, and rue-water that cannot be washed away or masked with dousings of cologne.\\"He pokes fun at those who proclaim the death of literature and the demise of culture, like the French functionaries who believe \\"that languages must be shut up in concentration camps and guarded by flics and mouchards disguised as lexicographers\\". He rails against those who would preserve their culture with hate mongering or use their religion to deny others their human rights (particularly women).But the most moving and inspiring pieces are his brief portraits of the people he admires, like methodical Vermeer's passionate perfection, Monet's obsessive search at the end of his career to paint the elusive qualities of reality, Frida Kahlo's \\"Painting to Survive.\\"One of the best is his evocation of Nelson Mandela from a visit to his prison at Robben Island. Another, completely different, is his discussion of V.S. Naipaul and Paul Theroux upon the publication of Theroux's compulsively readable savaging of his former friend, \\"Sir Vidia's Shadow,\\" which Vargas Llosa concludes with a perfect personal anecdote.Vargas Llosa writes about anything he pleases anywhere in the world - the Catholic Church, Islam, Palestine, Latin America, books, art, music, history. He writes about a romance writer who lived life entirely in her imagination and an Andean maiden mummy who \\"testifies - depending on how you look at it - to the ceremonial riches and the mysterious beliefs of a lost civilization, or to the infinitely cruel ways in which human stupidity once exorcised its fears, and often still does.\\"Though necessarily brief, each piece is well shaped and elegantly argued. Whether celebrating or fulminating, Vargas Llosa is intellectually rigorous and passionately engaged, a man of the world in the best sense. This is a collection that will be of interest to anyone with reasoned opinions, whatever their political slant."},{"Title":"The Language of Passion: Selected Commentary","review":"Mario Vargas Llosa's new book of essays is a selection of his newspapar columns from the early 1980s to 2000. The range of subject matter is quite broad, from Carnaval in Rio (\\"The Permanent Erection\\") to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (\\"A Walk Through Hebron\\") to economic aid for the Third World (\\"Aid for the First World\\"). Vargas Llosa uses several of these essays to stand up for the values and beliefs that he holds, which seem to boil down to three clear ideas: democracy, academic clarity and the free market. In \\"Seven Years, Seven Days,\\" Vargas Llosa criticizes the anti-democratic policies of the Fujimori presidency in Per&uacute;, while praising Fujimori for adopting certain neoliberal policies. He makes his opposition to Hugo Chavez apparent in \\"The Suicide of a Nation.\\" In \\"The Life and Trials of Eli&aacute;n,\\" the author laments the fate of Eli&aacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez, as well as the victory that Castro (\\"one of the most repugnant dictators ever produced by the authoritarian fauna of Latin America\\" p. 264) scored in the whole debacle.Vargas Llosa believes equally strongly in the free market, and takes George Soros to task for doubting it in \\"The Devil's Advocate.\\" And he makes his plea for academic clarity and sets himself in opposition to obscurantist postmodern philosophy in \\"Postmodernism and Frivolity.\\"Some of Vargas Llosa's opinions, nevertheless, seem limited to the times in which they were written. As the most recent of the essays were published in 2000, what does the author think about the Argentine meltdown? Does the unequal playing field of the free market deserve any blame, or can corruption and mis-management explain it all? What about the recent riots in Bolivia, where water privatization has aggravated resource-distribution conflicts? (Vargas Llosa is very complimentary of Bolivia's political class and policies, at least in comparison to Italy's, in \\"Italy is not Bolivia.\\")Whether you agree with Vargas Llosa's opinions or not, these essays are well-written and truly provide food for thought. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Jewish Tradition of Two Messiahs (Discovery Series)","review":"For better understanding of the christian religion, this examination of our Jewish roots is first rate!"},{"Title":"Berenstain Bears In The Dark","review":"This book is about brother bear and sister bear going to the library to get some books. When they arrived home it was reading time and brother bear scared sister bear reading her his scary book he checked out. That night sister bear couldn't fall asleep because she was scared so papa bear gave her a nightlight. That helped her fall asleep and she wasn't scared of the dark anymore. The lesson this book teaches is to not be afraid of the dark.

A best-seller since its release (now almost 20 years ago) there is a simple reason for its success: the book tells a wonderfully beautiful and fun story but one that is also very true to life. In the book, a night light is placed in the cubs' bedroom because of Sister's fear of the dark. By the end of the book, though, the reader sees that Brother (who argued against the &quot;babyish&quot; light) actually is in need of the night light as much or more than his sister. It is a fun story for kids and one that can be very useful for parents. The story is great and the illustrations are classic Berenstain Bears. This is a personal favorite that I remember from my own childhood and one I will continue to read for years to come! If you have not read it or do not own a copy, get one today, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!"},{"Title":"Berenstain Bears In The Dark","review":"We got this book as part of a set and it's just great. I have to read this one over and over again but I don't mind because it definitely has a good lesson. When brother bear takes out a mystery book to read from the library, sister gets a little scared when he reads part of it to her. He then wails like the cave in the story once they get in bed just to torment her but receives his just reward when sister can't go to sleep without the light on. So, the whole family is up with sister and quite \\"sleepy-eyed\\" in the morning. Papa bear sets up his old nightlight for sister who then gets her chance for revenge when she tells brother she wished the story ended with a spooky monstoer and hangs over the edge of the top bunkbed and makes a scary face at him! Brother has a little trouble sleeping after that and decides that mysteries are exactly his \\"thing\\" just then. It's fun to read for adults, all of us who remember hanging over the edge of the top bunk to scare a sibling below. I really laughed when I read that. Pretty funny stuff, especially since I did that too! My little one loves this book and it really does help explain how to not let shadows scare you. Great book, great find."},{"Title":"Berenstain Bears In The Dark","review":"I think this book is a pretty good book for people that like to read to young children, or just for anytime reading. This book features all of our favorite Berenstain Bears characters. Mama bear, Papa bear, Brother and Sister bear all play important parts in this book.

Every page features a different picture with a different dog and a one or two word description. Uses range from the fun (pillow and secret sharer) to the more useful (paper boy) with a few serious thrown in for good measure (search and rescue). The pictures are so cute that any person who loves a dog will smile the entire way through."},{"Title":"101 Uses for a Dog","review":"A TRUE DOG LOVER'S DELIGHT! Charming, fun, cute, adorable are all words which can be used to describe this wonderful little book. It is a collection of 101 well-chosen pictures of dogs with a descriptive word or phrase as the title of each picture. The book is divided into four loosely grouped themes. First is titled &quot;in and around the house&quot; and is composed of 24 pictures. Second is &quot;as playmates&quot;, 22 pictures. Next is &quot;as tireless helper&quot;, 28 pictures, Last is &quot;and specialty uses&quot;, 27 pictures.There are a myriad of breeds, but not surprisingly given their popularity and photogenic qualities, golden retreivers and black labs are most heavily represented. (This was fine with me, since we own one of each.) All different sizes and ages appear, and in fact one of the really nice pairings is the juxtaposition of &quot;someone to grow up with&quot; followed by &quot;someone to grow old with&quot;. Some of the other entries familiar to any dog owner or fan are &quot;gardener&quot; (and the related &quot;landscaper&quot;), &quot;exercise partner&quot; and not surprisingly the classic &quot;rescuer&quot;. (Guess which breed?) There are also such clever poses as the &quot;weathervane&quot; and the &quot;water quality specialist&quot;. It is hard to choose a favorite, but I would probably chose &quot;surrogate sister&quot; although the &quot;lookout&quot; , the &quot;bellhops&quot;, the &quot;partners-in-crime &quot; and &quot;playing hide and seek' are close runnersup.This is a wonderful book to keep on a coffee table or in a reading basket. Your guests will enjoy perusing it and you will want to just pick it up from time to time when you want to look at something that will quickly elict a smile. Note that is very small, but the size is appropriate for the format. As noted above, my only complaint is that it is overpriced if you pay full price. It is clearly meant to appeal to people as an impulse purchase or small gift item; I picked it up next to a cash register at a gift shop while on vacation, and I was entranced enough that I decided to buy it but felt as if I was being overcharged (similar to many other items in the store). However, I am glad that I purchased it - the pictures have been a source of frequent joy since then. It would certainly make a wonderful gift for any dog lover who you know, it is appropriate for all ages.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"101 Uses for a Dog","review":"I bought this book as a gift, but being a dog lover, read it first.

We have had dogs for many years and enjoy the glimpse into the lives and interactions of dogs.While it is small, it is a book filled with full colored pages of dogs in action ... from being a pillow for a kid, to acting as a dalmatian on a fire truck. Perhaps I am sensitive to my five year old's new puppy, but the most amazing comments to me at the moment are numbers 91 and 92Someone to grow up with ... and to grow old with.Those of us who love dogs have done both. I suggest that this book is especially appropriate for a dog lover in a nursing home where he or she can no longer have their pets. It will bring a smile to their face. If you manage to make it all the way through without having at least one smile on your face, well, you must have a really rough life, and maybe YOU need a dog to hang out with."},{"Title":"101 Uses for a Dog","review":"I can report to you that this is one of the most disappointing purchases I've made at Amazon over the past 20 years. WhY?The reason is that you've tagged this book under the rubric \\"Table Books\\". Perhaps you were thinking of Table Books for doll houses since the book is approximately 8 inches square. Hardly a table book in the conventional meaning of the term. In addition, it's not humorous the photos are amateurish, and it is grossly over-priced.Dominic Annacone"},{"Title":"Growing in Grace (Sermon Series)","review":"This little booklet contains in-depth spiritual insight.

Highly recommended for Christians of all denominations."},{"Title":"Morgan Morning (Serendipity)","review":"This was the first Serendipity book I was introduced to, and I love it! It is a deeply emotional story of a young colt who disobeys his mother and must live with the consequences. This is the beginning of the Morgan saga (Morgan is a unicorn who also appears in Morgan and Me, Morgan and Yew, Morgan Mine, and The Gigglesnitcher), and anyone who enjoys horses and unicorns will love this charming tale."},{"Title":"Morgan Morning (Serendipity)","review":"I had this book when I was young, and as is with all things it vanished, when I was finally able to get my hands on it again, I cried when I read it.The moral \\"Sometimes we must lose in order to gain.\\" I remember when I was younger and read it, I cried, I felt so much sympathy for the poor baby horse and his mother. He misbehaved, and learned, and suffered, and in that suffering and learning was rewarded, but not with the thing he most he wanted, his mother back.The artwork makes the story, and it is beautiful, this is my favorite childrens book, for anyone who has a daughter or son who needs to be reminded that not only is it bad to disobey mom, it is good to dream, this is the book.I recomend it twice a day and three times on sunday, get it, read it, love it."},{"Title":"Morgan Morning (Serendipity)","review":"This is the sad but beautiful tale of a young colt whose curiousity gets the best of him.

I loved the pictures and eventually owned the entire collection. I read and re-read them...except for this one. The message of loss may be necessary but at what age? Proceed with caution with this one and Glitterby Baby, which has a similar message of loss. Now that I am reading these to my 3 year old, and making up endings to avoid tears, I have to wonder if the author had some dark periods. Maybe I started my child on these too early? Anyway, be warned that this book was too sad for me as a child (at age 7) and I was not a sensitive child."},{"Title":"Morgan Morning (Serendipity)","review":"This is a beautiful little book with a message of hope for those who have experienced loss. I have to say, though, of all the Serendipity books, I'm not sure this one is for children in healthy, happy homes. The main character, Morgan (a horse), is severely injured and has to give up his mother and everything he knows to become a unicorn. For me, having lost my entire family due to serious child abuse, it carried an inspiring message of hope, healing, and an end to grief for me. However, I don't think I would read this to a child under different circumstances. It's very sad, and even a little disturbing.I highly recommend it for those with active \\"Inner Children\\", especially those recovering from childhood trauma and abuse. In that respect, I found it to be very therapeutic."},{"Title":"Morgan Morning (Serendipity)","review":"Like another reviewer commented, parents should preview this book before reading it to young children.

Growing up I would always read it. The problem was it has such a sad story that my mom and sister would not read it to me because they would always cry. My son is now 3, next week is book week at school. I was so excited I signed up to read in his class and found my old copy of the book. As I read it I remembered how sad the story is and won't be able to read it for his class because I too can not get thru the book with out crying.

We have the other books in the Morgan series and she loves them, I highly recommend this book, along with the others in this series and \\"The Gigglesnitcher\\" as Morgan is in that story as well.

The writing in the book is heart-wrenchingly vivid. The pictures are done beautifully. I have read others that say the book is too depressing for children. I do not believe this is true. It is a deep story, one that will still be in the process of being understood as the child grows, but it is a story worth knowing and hearing.

If you don't mind your child breaking down and sobbing at the end. This was even after my hasty attempt to modify and skip over the bad parts. I read the first few pages before buying it and sure didn't foresee the tragic ending. A little background. Morgan doesn't listen to his mother and keeps wandering away from her until he falls down a waterfall from which he could not be rescued:'His mother, along with all the other mothers and their babies, came and stood silently above the pool. There was no way for any of them to get down to help him... Morgan's mother choked back a sob when she realized that nothing could be done. With tears streaming down her face, she walked silently away... Morgan neighed softly and said, \\"I love you mother and I understand.\\" 'And later to the 'Morning Star' who is going to turn him into a Unicorn: 'My name is Morgan... I am here because I didn't listen to my mother... now I am waiting to die, for no one can help me... he began to cry and cry...'The 'Morning Star' has an offer he can't refuse: 'If we save you (by turning him into a unicorn)... you will be banished from all others of your kind forever more. Never more will you be able to nuzzle your mother... Morgan thought of a gentler time when he had played in the meadow and nuzzled his mother...'After being turned into unicorn he gets to see his mother one last time - to say Good-Bye: 'He slowly began to follow the river down to the meadowlands... but he turned once more... and there stood his mother. \\"Good-bye, mother. I'll always love you,\\"...And the happy ending: Into this life Morgan was born to live, maybe die, as a unicorn.This book taps into a child's worst fears of being abandoned. By his mother.

Useful thing to have."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I am currently studying Tess for my Hsc exams at the end of this year,and as a related student i have come to be rather familiar with Tess's character and how Hardy presents her to us.Tess is a victim of a changing society to which she really does not belong.Tess endures so much during her young life that it would be unfair for us to state that she was a depressing ,sad character.She trully is a heroine as she has the courage to tell Angel the truth about her past on their wedding night and faces her destiny of being executed in the 7th phase,she even has the courage to hand over her younger sister for Angel to marry and look after,thus how can anybody be so cruel and insensitive to say that tess is a sad and depressing character.Yes she may be weak and let people step on her but with what she endures she still continues on with her life,she demonstrates,resourcefulness and endurance.Atrue heroine in my eyes.And to those who think highschool students know nothing and should not be listend to,rethink your statement."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"I always enjoy reading literature of the late nineteenth century period, and I would have to say that Tess of the d'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy was one of the best -second only to my favorite Jane Eyre. Recently I finished the novel for an AP English class at Mercy High School. Not only was the story romantic and interesting, but it was also surprising and captivating. As the heroine of the story, Tess was an extremely courageous and strong character, constantly facing hardships and internal and external struggles. I was also torn, however, between Angel and Alec -which character is more honorable and who do I like more? Angel and Tess were passioately in love, but he could not see past the offense she had committed when she needed him. Alec wrongfully took advantage of Tess, but sincerely attempted to win her back in the end. Alec was there for her when Angel was not, yet, I still lean more towards Angel as my favorite of the two. I also want to point out that the message Tess gave throughout the novel is very true -complete happiness is not permanent, it goes away and it comes back, but only comes back if you have a strong soul and sheer determination to destroy anything in your way."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles","review":"this book wasn't the first choice on my list to read. it was very boring, and very wordy. the only thing really good about this book was some of the twists and turns."},{"Title":"Savage Summit: The Life and Death of the First Women of K2","review":"I liked the book because it was a true account backed us with research.

I found it fascinating and recommend this book."},{"Title":"Savage Summit: The Life and Death of the First Women of K2","review":"Why are the deaths of women disproportionately higher on K2 when compared to men? Is it that the women lack skill? Are less physically adapted to the challenge? And why are women criticized for leaving their families to attempt such a risky climb when men aren't? Jennifer Jordan explores these issues while telling the intensely personal stories of the first five women to summit K2.Jordan's writing style pulls you into the stories of these five incredible climbers. As flawed as these women are, we identify with them, cheer for them, grieve for them. We learn about their careers in the mountains, their personal lives, their love lives, their quirks, and for the two survivors, what they did after K2. The story of Wanda Rutkiewicz' death on Kangchenjunga in 1992, six years after her summit of K2, was particularly moving.I could not put this book down. The only thing that would make this book better would be an update that includes the story of Edurne Pasaban, a Spanish climber who summitted K2 in 2004 and Oh Eun-Sun who summitted in 2007. I would be particularly interested in Jordan's take on the competition between these two women to become the first female to conquer all 14 of the 8,000+ meter summits. The controversy that resulted could even become a book that stands on its own, and Jennifer Jordan would be the ideal writer for that book."},{"Title":"Savage Summit: The Life and Death of the First Women of K2","review":"I lived and breathed this book in my waking hours. I am a fairly slow reader but I could not put this book down!I loved and admired all these women for different reasons. Some of their lives paralleled in being in unhappy relationships and I believe the mountains and their challenges provided refuge. Others were groundbreakers and pioneers, breaking into the world of a \\"man only\\" sport. They had something to prove and were so determined to do it, they sacrified their very lives. I could write a ton on this book but I encourage all to read it, both men and women. It gives a bittersweet piece of history that I for one am proud of.Jennifer Jordan is an incredible storyteller and gives a great background on each of the climbers. I didn't agree with some of their ways but I cannot sit in judgement, all I know is that they were not of this world and they all broke ground in their unique and heartbreaking way.Cynthia M.

There are very few books written about woman mountaineers so this was a sheer pleasure to find. I am a women mountaineer myself. I have yet to get to those peaks and through this book I better understanding their struggles in a man's world, love, desire and views. It truly touched my heart and mountain soul. Thank you Jennifer for all your work in such a wonderful work of love and curiousity! A must read that I have already recommended to several of my fellow mountaineer friends, male & female."},{"Title":"Savage Summit: The Life and Death of the First Women of K2","review":"Entirely beside the fact that the author lacks some basic grammar and punctuation skills, the way this book is written is speculative at best and pure fantasy at worst. Some of the events depicted are just plain nonsense, and the 'inside the mind' view taken of the central characters is a schmaltzy 'lets all worship at the altar of feminism' weep-fest. The author also takes a swipe at other writers who dared to criticise the behaviour of the women depicted. Painful to get through and a bitter dissapointment after the thoroughly enjoyable Last Man on the Mountain."},{"Title":"Savage Summit: The Life and Death of the First Women of K2","review":"The book arrived quickly and in decent condition. It's taking me forever to get through the book though. It is interesting to a point, but there are so many climbers mentioned that it is difficult to keep them all straight. I'm a fairly good comprehensive reader and this book is the first mountain book that has me struggling. It might be because I am not as familiar with women climbers as with the men, but I think it is more in the way the book is written. That being said, so far I would still recommend it because it focuses on female climbers which makes it different than most."},{"Title":"Savage Summit: The Life and Death of the First Women of K2","review":"Savage Summit by Jennifer Jordan is a must read for those who appreciate true-life adventure stories. As a non-climber who lives vicariously through the adventures of others as told in their books, I can't attest to what really goes on during an expedition or the ins and outs of the social-politics of the climbing community, especially high altitude climbers. I can say that Jordan's book seems to be well researched and recounts the adventures of the five subjects in the manner that made me feel a part of their lives and their climbs.As a collection of adventure stories the book did not disappoint me in the least. I will admit that I was expecting a book about the first five women who climbed K2 that was written by a woman would be heavily slanted with a sexiest bias against the mostly male community of mountain climbers. Instead I found the book to be about 5 people who have that special inner drive to climb who also happened to be women. In telling the stories of these special people, Jordan also describes the bias and prejudice that some were faced with as they joined expeditions led by experienced men. This is especially true in the telling of Polish climber Wanda Rutkiewicz's adventures when women were a rare sight in climbing and as Jordan tells Wanda's stories and the stories of the other women she acknowledges that each was a person in her own right with their own strengths and weaknesses. Putting gender aside, Wanda Rutkiewicz had a personality that alienated many outside of a handful of people who understood her and even those closest to Wanda admit she could be difficult on an inter-personal level.In telling the story of Chantal Mauduit Jordan clearly acknowledges that Mauduit, a happy-go-lucky sort who enjoy much luck climbing 8,000 meters peaks, used her feminine and sexual attributes to her advantage and thus enjoyed an advantage as she manipulated the males on her teams to carry the heavy loads and break routes that she could easily follow on her summit attempts.The stories of Liliane Barrard, Julie Tullis and Alison Hargreaves were all exciting recounts of their climbing careers and their ultimate climbs to the summit of K2. Each of these women were beloved by friends and family, each recognized the dangers in high altitude climbing and each of them struggled with the pull of their loved one against the pull of the mountains. Ultimately, the mountains won and each died as accomplished climbers, not women, doing what they were drawn to do.Bottom Line: Savage Summit is a great adventure read about 5 people who loved climbing and were eventually drawn to the attraction of solving a problem that is much greater than the well worn routes of Mt. Everest on the world's second highest peak, K2."},{"Title":"Savage Summit: The Life and Death of the First Women of K2","review":"Savage Summit is essentially a biography of women mountaineers who have climbed K2. A number of world famous female mountaineers are celebrated extensively including Wanda Rutkiewicz, Chantal Mauduit, Alison Hargreaves, Julie Tullis and Liliane Barrard. The book was extremely well-written and extensively researched. It see-saws from uplifting to grievously sad. All the women met their deaths in the mountains between ages 33 and 49 leaving a trail of grieving parents, siblings, friends, lovers, husbands and children. Jordan captures their emotions, as well as her own, in a page turning exhibition of outstanding writing.Bravo!"},{"Title":"Savage Summit: The Life and Death of the First Women of K2","review":"I read all the books offered here related to Everest and K2 and, to be honest, this one was pretty low on my wish list. As it turns out, \\"Savage Summit\\" is one of my favorite mountain books. What sets it apart is the quality of the writing. If you open it you will more than likely read it straight through. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Savage Summit: The Life and Death of the First Women of K2","review":"This is a beautifully written book which tells the true stories of the five women who had successfully sumitted K-2 at the time of its publication. Although it covers five separate and distinct accounts, they are all interconnected by chronological events, and the result is that the book reads more like a continuing tale of one singular adventure. The author did a masterful job of weaving the challenges of each woman's personal life in with the major events of their climbing lives. Often times, one set of circumstances directly affected the other in a very positive or very negative way. Again, the author did an extraordinary job of weaving one into the other. Each woman came across to me as two different personalities - the woman she was with her family, friends and lovers, and the person she became when she stepped onto the mountain. A thoroughly enjoyable read from start to finish, more like a fictional novel than true life.I took the time to write a review because I was astounded that there are only seven reviews posted here. One does not have to be interested in mountain climbing to enjoy this remarkable book."},{"Title":"Savage Summit: The Life and Death of the First Women of K2","review":"This is an excellent account of the 5 women that reached the summit of K2 as well as their extensive backgrounds. Each of the women was from a different walk of life, from women who were nationally sponsored to a house wife who had to live out of her car and bring her children to base camp with her. But one thing was present in all the women, the desire to climb mountains and the draw that the mountains had when they went back to their \\"normal\\" lives. The author's research is apparent in the numerous sources for her accounts of the lives of these women, from climbing partners to children, journals to radio transmissions, her writing is filled with accuracy. But this is also an adventure story that you won't want to put down. While you already know the outcome, you want to learn how these 5 women lost their lives to the mountains. An excellent adventure story."},{"Title":"Savage Summit: The Life and Death of the First Women of K2","review":"Great book.

I couldn't wait to get back to it, and I hated for it to end. Great history, great biography, beautifully written. I shed more than one tear for these brave, unique women, all of whom, it seemed, deserved much more of life than they got. This is a wonderful book, even if you have no interest in high-altitude climbing or about K2.In the end, you could feel Jennifer Jordan's genuine sorrow for her subjects, and you want to share her pain and give her a hug for her labors. The best written mountaineering story of all I've read."},{"Title":"Savage Summit: The Life and Death of the First Women of K2","review":"As she pieces together the lives of women known for their extraordinary achievements in the world of mountaineering, Jennifer Jordan brings the reader to consider the role played by gender discrimination in their careers and in the events that have led to their tragic deaths. But Jordan is too sensitive and respectful to draw a straight line between gender-based issues and individual fate, she lets you get there on your own with her skillful account. Well-researched this book addresses a topic that few mountaineering books dare to address, so focussed that they are on the men's achievements."},{"Title":"Savage Summit: The Life and Death of the First Women of K2","review":"Jennifer Jordan does a phenomenol job detailing the lives of some of the 'leading ladies' of the climbing world. In addition to giving us a rare window on the specific challenges women face on the mountain, she does a thorough job of the challenges they face off the mountain as well. Although I love to climb and enjoy the outdoors, it's sad to see how this consuming, and often very selfish passion, and the drive to be the continue, whatever the cost, has ruined so many lives, chief among them the friends and families who don't share that passion for the mountains. At least some world class climbers, like Ed Viesturs, rationally assess the inherent dangers in climbing, and have developed rigid climbing principles that they always follow, leading him to state &#34;The mountain decides whether you climb or not. The art of mountaineering is knowing when to go, when to stay, and when to retreat&#34;. Most of those climbers who understand and develop those type of conservative principles early on in their climbing careers, are the ones who are still around, spending their twilight years with loved ones."},{"Title":"Savage Summit: The Life and Death of the First Women of K2","review":"I have read so many mountaineering books and this one is one of the best. It is unique in that it focuses on women.

Writing is more dexterous than camera work and words are more nimble than pictures, so we expect literary works to be more efficient and inventive than movies. Even so, as I left this book I shook my head in amazement and wonder and thought to myself, &quot;How did Lou Peddicord do that?&quot; I can answer only by saying that he is a great writer. He has created a world of fascination, joy and heartache with galloping plot and languid rumination, sweeping scope and intricate connections, playful befuddlement and razor-sharp insight that we can only hope some movie-maker will attempt boldly to put on screen. The masses need to meet Jay Gould and Christine Nostrinco, the love of his bittersweet life, as they strive to live nobly and make sense of it all."},{"Title":"The Late Jay Gould May Be Alive and Well","review":"Again, Peddicord finds a magical way to weave wit, humor, love, surrealism, and darn good writing into a novel with picturesque words that leave you questioning your own obsessively organized views of life. If you can take anything away from this novel, take from it an outlook on life that will inspire you to live more spontaneously, freely, and on the verge on a state of non-reality.In all honesty, I found a brief portion of the book (towards the middle) that seemed to drag on a bit too long. However, the beginning and ending of the book make up for this somewhat jet-lagged feeling for 50 pages or so.The personalities and ideals of the characters are so charming, so &quot;out there,&quot; but rather brilliant. Towards the end, Jay was a good friend and confidant, and I was just about ready to invite the dog to curl up into bed alongside me.Again, like other Peddicord novels there always seems to be an underlying message, if one can only take the time to find it. I believe his message in &quot;...Jay Gould...&quot; would be to screw the &quot;American Dream,' the rules and regulations, the clausterphobic lifestyles we're quickly heading into, and courageously swan dive into the experiences life has to offer, regardless of the consequences. This book inspires you to LIVE actively, rather than passively watch as the years pass you by. And if you don't feel inspired in some minute way to do just that, I suggest you read the novel a second time.If nothing else, you'll fall in love with this incredible piece of work, and perhaps someday be inspired to find your own piece of Paradise."},{"Title":"The Late Jay Gould May Be Alive and Well","review":"i have been reading since prior to grade school. i will read just about anthing once, but there is a special bookcase in my bedroom for the books that i know i will read over and over. my husband asked me just how i could keep reading the same books, time and time again. i tried to explain that some books are like great memories that you want to recall throughout your life. these special books touch you in some way that adds to the meaning of your existence. they are like an epiphany, whether they teach a more in-depth view of the world or of yourself. &quot;the late jay gould may be alive and well&quot; has now joined a permanent home in this bookcase with the likes of &quot;to kill a mockingbird&quot;, &quot;alas babylon&quot;, &quot;illusions&quot; and &quot;the alienist&quot;.its characters are plentiful and varied, their personalities painstakingly real and vital. even the dog has a fully developed personality and role; one that is intricately necessary to the process of learning that this book takes us through. it would be difficult to believe that anyone would be able to read this without periodically laying it down to ponder a self realization that has jumped from the book into your head. the questions it provokes, such as what we expect out of our own lives and those around us, gives a new meaning to the word &quot;accountability&quot;. most importantly, it asks why we deny ourselves the joys in life that are right at our fingertips by establishing our own personal walls to keep us apart from them. whichever character you identify with in this book, you will find a revelation.at its start, a seemingly light and airy story about a magical man and the characters he touches, &quot;the late jay gould may be alive and well&quot; is actually much, much deeper. it attacked my stoically safe attitudes toward life and the boxed-in, nonsensical rules by which most of us follow. by its ending, i was wishing that i could live my earlier years over again, and made me promise myself that i will finish the remainder as tenaciously as humanly possible."},{"Title":"The Late Jay Gould May Be Alive and Well","review":"Got this free on Amazon- it is a really well written book - the author has evoked the era so well- I now feel badly that I got it for nothing as I would happily have paid for it"},{"Title":"The Late Jay Gould May Be Alive and Well","review":"The Late Jay Gould May Be Alive and Well provides for a perplexing course of affairs to ponder.

It is always a thrill to find a gem like this.I am in total agreement with other reviewers who use words such as enchanting, magical and surreal. It is a well-written humorous commentary on modern life with emphasis on love, romance and lust.There were a couple of sections which I found mildly unpleasant most of which involved the character of Calvin White---a black man with a huge racist chip on his shoulder. His use of profanity and black \\"street talk\\" got old fast.Otherwise I thoroughly enjoyed the engaging, far-fetched premise that swept the reader along in an examination of values, relationships and extremes.The language flowed well with a few notable spelling exceptions. The author got particularly tripped up on proper names: it is Euell not Eull Gibbons; Salvador not Salvatore Dali; Karmann not Kharman Ghia; Uri not Yuri Geller; Jackson Pollock not Pollack; Rorschach not Rorshach; Ehrlichman not Erlichman; Solana Beach not Solono; Coronado not Coranado and the proper French phrase is \\"ce n'est pas ma faute\\" instead of \\"C'nest pas ma faut.\\"I am uncertain if Mr. Peddicord ever re-edits his work but for those of us who automatically go into \\"proofreading mode,\\" the errors are distracting. The only real grammatical error that recurred was the misuse of \\"laying\\" for \\"lying\\" (it is not proper to say \\"she preferred to lay face down\\"; \\"dog was laying in the...\\"; \\"laying abed,\\" etc.) but there were some oddly endearing typos \\"swam dive\\" for swan; \\"squeezed in a vice\\"; \\"crowing achievements\\" and my all- time favorite, \\"lumscious.\\" When I find such a wonderfully creative story it pains me to see so many easily correctable errors.[NOTE: The author indicated the errors have been corrected, and a revised edition has been uploaded to Amazon.]The book grabbed me from the get-go. This was an era which resonated with my own history, and I adored Mr. Peddicord's descriptions of \\"we're in California now...[N]ormal is a wider word here\\" and \\"under the thrall of the majestic\\" or \\"Jay lived on the edge of the future.\\" Of course, the inclusion of J. Edgar Hoover---who we learn faked his own death---was a masterpiece.Don't try to make sense of it all...just go along for a truly remarkable ride.

Almost all Silat styles have some aspects of Harimau in it because it has been so famous and influential an art. Here it is shown for the first time in this video from Paladin Press.First the basic postures and positions are shown, and then how they can be linked together in a sequence, much like the linking forms of bau gua, hsing-i, or tai chi. Many applications are demonstrated, including empty hand, weapons, and takedowns/groundwork. Harimau is shown to very much ground oriented in almost always taking the opponent to the ground, where he is finished off. Dozens of combinations are shown from start to finish, from initial entries to final takedowns so there is a lot of good information here.The techniques are usually demonstrated by Guru de Bordes's students, but Guru de Bordes also shows some langkhas and also a very nice weapons defense against multiple attackers in which he uses the machete or short sword against four opponents. Also, the music sound track is quite attractive and adds an exotic air to the presentation. Overall an excellent video on this legendary but still obscure art."},{"Title":"1967-1972 Chevy/gmc Truck Factory Assembly Instruction Manual","review":"The publisher of this book has removed all the page title blocks and the part numbers.

The Book of Revalation suddenly becomes important to our lives again.Swedenborg claims that the entire Book is a spiritual vision that John had while on the Isle of Patmos. This vision was of the fall and end of the First Christian Church which occured at the time of the Last Judgement and the institution of the New Christian Church by God. (Swedenborg asserts that the Last Judgement was a spiritual judgement or reordering and has already taken place.)The Book of Revalation teaches through correspondences of the dangers of the Doctrine of Faith Alone, how that Doctrine ultimately destroyed the First Christian Church, and how critical the union of Faith and Charity is in our spiritual development.Apocalypse Revealed (two volumes) was followed by Apocalypse Explained (six volumes) which is the full work on this subject. Although both works are useful, skip Apocalypse Revealed and head straight to Apocalypse Explained.(See author's long work entitled Arcana Coelestia for a similar treatment of the Books of Genesis and Exodus.)"},{"Title":"Behind the Masks: Personality Disorders in the Church","review":"I enjoyed the authors approach to the work.Without venturing into deep physological analysis, they based the work on personality traits and their accompanying disorders. The premise is that personality disorder stems from an overzealous personality type.For each personality type and disorder the Pate's list the endearing qualities as well as the faults. They then give a case study of an individual with the personality disorder from their ministry as well as the diagnostic material from DSM-IV.Finally, the authors provides some Christian based advise for dealing with the disorder. (Generally, behavior modification and personal counseling.)I would recommend this to any clergy who does counseling. (Also beneficial to students learning about personality disorders.) Although obviously not meant to be the &quot;Bible of Disorder&quot; it provide wisdom from experience in dealing with individuals as well as plenty of footnotes for further, more detailed research."},{"Title":"Behind the Masks: Personality Disorders in the Church","review":"An endless stream of books applies the Family Systems Theory to local churches. The most recent systems theorists now understand the individual as an intrapersonal or intrapsychic system. This lends support to the idea that developing a healthy congregational system rotates upon the axis of our personal wholeness as clergy and laity.Marvin and Sheryl Pate's book addresses one aspect of personal wholeness, namely personality disorders. Although not professional counselors, the Pate's twenty plus years in the pastorate alerted them to the need for a book like this. Thus, what they wrote uses plain language with real life stories about both clergy, pastor's wives, and laity. While Wayne Oates' book on personality disorders in the church is more analytical and descriptive, Pate's book is more practical and prescriptive.They introduce their subject using the analogy of a solar eclipse. People with a personality disorder are only a \`shadow' of who God created them to be. The moon, like a personality disorder, gradually eclipses the sunlight of their God given personality. The author's hold up Jesus Christ as the perfect model of a healthy personality. They hold forth the gospel of Jesus Christ and encountering his love as able to help healthy personality strengths reemerge. As they state in their book,The reemergence of personality strengths generally occurs over time in the life of an individual with a personality disorder as the fruit of the Spirit provides the missing ingredient in the person's life. It is not an easy process or a \\"quick fix,\\" but as persons come to grapple with their need and the power of the Holy Spirit to restore them to wholeness, in the environment of a nurturing and discerning Christian community, they can truly become the persons they were meant to be. (11)Each chapter describes the dominant characteristic of a personality, a personality disorder, and the strength it eclipses. Following the description flows a challenge for the church to tailor its response to help the person find wholeness through a particular fruit of the Spirit.Marvin and Sheryl's book uses scripture in a sound and creative manner to guide the church in its ministry to those eclipsed by a personality disorder. Their psychological research is sound as well. I recommend this book to bishops, denominational officials, pastors, church officers and seminarians as a good introduction. Those desiring to plunge deeper into the church's mental/emotional health ministry will find the following books helpful: Larry Crabb's Connecting: healing for ourselves and our relationships a radical new vision; Dwight L. Carlson's Why Do Christians Shoot Their Wounded? Helping (Not Hurting) Those with Emotional Difficulties; Doug Murren's Churches That Heal: Becoming a Church That Mends Broken Hearts and Restores Shattered Lives; Wayne E. Oates' Behind The Masks: Personality Disorders in Religious Behavior; and Conrad W. Weiser's Healers--Harmed &amp; Harmful."},{"Title":"The big footprints","review":"My best way to describe Hammond Innes books is it's like watching a great black and white movie on tv ... this one was colorized. Elephants, Africa, a Safari, it sure grabbed by attention. I actually purhcased this book in 1977 when it was first published and never got around to reading it for some reason. Now, in 2004 I'm finally getting around to reading some of the older books in my library and was amazed that I had missed reading this one along the way. Its a great read with all the typical Hammond Innes plots: Man against the elements, Man against Nature, Man falls in love with the primary female lead. Great protagonist / antagonist confrontations. Oh, it's Innes at his best to be sure. Ok, why then am I not giving it 5-stars? Well, the ending was not all I hoped it would be.

Sagan tells an interesting story of an astronomer and how a message from space effects her life and Earth's. He has arch-typical doomsday sayers in the book, but I guess in actuality, there would be some. He has an interesting take on theology and science. Being a scientist, and a agnostic, Sagan's ideas make me want to look for God in my own work. Of course, the book is better than the movie because you can get into the heads of the characters. As usual, there are significant changes in the movie. Finally, the ended in the book, is extremely thought provoking."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Contact is simply the best book I've ever read. The book's a bit different from the movie, the plot of the movie may be better, but the message Carl Sagan brings to us through the book is definitely more compelling. We realise how tiny we really are compared to the whole universe, and that all of us are actually equal. Though the book lacks a little of the excitement that the movie has, the book certainly is more stunning. Some people say that this is the BOOK, not the MOVIE. But tell you what, I've seen the movie for at least 5 times now (I still love it!), and I can assure you that the book's even better.

The search for aliens by using radio telescopes is so much fun. The story takes place that spans about 15 years. The plot is filled with adjectives that are terrific. If you watch the movie you can almost hear them talking when you read Contact. This is a must read book."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"The best novel I've read, so far. Eleanor Arroway is smart and devoted to her interests, which include mathematics and astronomy.The book fills in a (for lack of a better phrase) whole bunch of plotholes the movie has to where it has an entirely different background (one downside to the movie).The first part--like in all books--is rather boring, and you're stuck waiting for the plot to get a move-on, but when it does, you find it hard to take your eyes off the book.In the end of the book there is five people in the machine, so the end is more complicated than the end of the movie, and is more interesting.Carl Sagan is poetic and shows great devotion and love toward family values, theology, ethnics, mathematics and astronomy.

It is true that sometimes Sagan bothered more to expose his ideas and beliefs than get the plot moving - but this is not necessarily bad. The way the book's Arroway interacts with the rest of the characters (and, indeed, the mildly utopic society of Sagan's 1999) is intricate but interesting.Finally, some passages are worth reading again and again either because they are fit for a crash course in the philosophy of science or for the sheer pleasure of it!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I first saw the movie , when I hear about it and that it was based in the novel of Sagan I really wanted to see it , but it was a H.School project the one that made me go to the movies and see it.

Although originally different, it nonetheless feels a little tacked-on, and fades as quickly as it emerges.All in all, its a heck of a good read for those interested in space exploration and discovery."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Somebody pinch me, I must be dreaming: The book is good, especially if you HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET!!! Imagine to my surprise that I saw the movie in the theatre first and then was given a copy of this book: I read it, liked it when I had my trusty Webster's Dictionary on hand and so on and so forth... But, considering as any 16 year old would, between book and movie, the latter seemed to win out-- I had only one major query out of the entire experience... The blind physicist, Dr. Kent Clark (played magnificentlly by the talented actor William Fichtner) was a much-needed key in tying the emotional matter to the scientific-- His character and Ellie (Jodie Foster) had much more on screen character and even flow that with McConaughey's Joss-- It was believable, a good pairing, and would have done a book in this subject a world of good HAD HIS CHARACTER BEEN FEATURED IN THE BOOK!! then again, that's just my opinion."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"An incredible tale held by a plausible context of a possible and near future of communications with another life species in the cosmos. Dr. Sagan created a lovely and dazzling storyline, part fantasy, part fact, part autobiography and completely amazing, where the whole world and the main character (Dra. Eleanor Arroway) face the most wanted and last possible big discovery of now a days: knowledge of existence and contact with other life species. The book have many citations of new discoveries of science and existing institutions and research companies, what makes the story more realistic. This book is a must for who wants to read a science fiction story that can become a science fact someday, just as the tales of Verne, Wells and many other classic writers who dreamed of today common science discoveries and revolutions, such as travel to the moon and artificial organs. READ IT!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I have read both the book and the movie, and was impressed by both. Each form of the story did its job well. Since both the book and the screenplay were written by Carl Sagan (who died during filming) the movie does not suffer from the total evisceration of the plot so common in many book-based movies.One thing movie-watching book-lovers must realize is that it is literally impossilbe to cram all of a 400 page book into a 2 hour movie. Especially if you want to have your movie viewed by someone with the intelligence of your average American. (i.e. The the ones who pen (in another review): &quot;Carl Sagan can't right [sic] worth anything!&quot; and others expound on the glories of the movie, apparently not even realizing that it is a book too.)I think it is obvious that the movie did not even try to duplicate to plot lines of the book, as that would be too tedious and would not be the best choice for a movie. For instance, Ellie's long affair with the National Science Adviser, while it could have been duplicated in the movie, would have consumed a large chunk of the screen time (much longer than a one-night stand with Joss.) and Ellie's love life was certainly not the point of either form of the story, although in the book, it served to add character depth. The debates with the religous characters in the book would have consumed a good 20-30 minutes of valuable movie time, which needed to be spent in other places.Now for some biased opinions. I believe that Carl Sagan developed a greater animosity toward religion as he grew older. In the book, he certainly does not view religion as a friend, but he seees to have ambivilence about it. His view seems to be, &quot;If not carried to extremes, what's the harm?&quot; I recently read &quot;Demon Haunted World&quot; (written by him in 1996) I get the impression that he views religion as the enemy of reason and a scourge to be struck from the earth. (Perhaps I exaggerate a little.) In the book, religious groups are connected only fuzzily to the killing of Dummond, et al. In the movie, the bomb is exploded by a wild-eyed, hellfire and brimstone madman. (Although McConaughey's Joss is thrown in in the spirit of moderation.) I read &quot;Contact&quot; after reading &quot;The Demon Haunted World&quot; and seeing the movie. I remember thinking during the movie, (my only Sagan experience beforehand being &quot;The Demon Haunted World&quot;) &quot;This is a very 'Sagan' plot.&quot; I was not shocked in the least when he had a religious fanatic blow up the machine.A little sidebar:One of Ellie's questions on page 367 of the paperback is rather amusing. Look at this passage, near the bottom of the page:&quot;And the zero's and ones finally stop? You get back to a random sequence of digits?&quot; Seeing a faint sign of encourgement, she raced on. &quot;And the number of zeros and ones? Is it a product of prime numbers?&quot;Uh, sorry to reduce your sense of wonder sports fans, but if you remember 6th grade math correctly, all non-zero integers are a product of prime numbers.In conclusion, while the book isn't as epic as the &quot;Odessey&quot;, and the movie isn't &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, both are worth experiencing."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This novel was written for everyone to enjoy but for a select few to love. Carl Sagan is well known as a scientist and a non-fiction authur. If you have ever read any of his previous work you will truly understand where Carl is coming from with this book. If you are used to reading paperback,&quot;could never happen&quot;, type of contact or space books then please do not waste your time. You will think as many who replied here that the book has too much true science and is very slow. Contact has less to do with the actually contact with others as our own humility. Such topics as the debate between religion and science are probed very deeply at the noneducated readers expense. I think this is a wonderful book written by A true scientist is a time when they are very hard to find."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I decided to read the book before renting the movie. The story line is pretty good but the ending is weak; the outcome of the &quot;contact&quot; is unsatisfying and a surprising, but irrelevant, revelation about the heroine is used to provide a philosophical last paragraph. The book was written in the 80's but set at the end of the millenium, giving us the opportunity to review Carl's predictions. Not many have come to fruition. The National Enquirer, ABC, NBC and CBS are all still here. The Soviet Union and apartheid -era South Africa aren't. We don't have a two-term female president...er, okay, a split decision on that one...and there are no millionaire retirement homes orbiting the earth. The strike-out rate for Carl's predictions tended to make me think his predictions for first contact with aliens was probably way off, too. This is the kind of book you can read on a long flight or during a vacation, but it's a stretch to tag it a &quot;classic&quot; of any genre."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Most of the self-help books are full of excerpts and extracts written or remarked by other medical doctors or specialists, with or w/o Ph.D titles, collected and edited by the so-called authors, I've found CONTACT an interesting mix-up of a non-fiction with all the dialogues spoken by many professors with Ph.D titles and edited by Sagan, a failed novelist, often interesting but also bored you to death sometimes. A book published in '85 and resurrected in '97 covering an on-site space-&amp;-time travel mission in the year of 2,000 (or on the eve of 1999) being actually so close to the present that making the reading still dealing with the Cold War; the heroine and mucho other secientists trying to dig out the to&amp;fro E-mail MESSAGES between Earth and Vega(?) buried so deep in layers; trying so hard by Sagan to depict the E-mail era of the 90s in the early 80s when telex was still the only real deal, making Sagan a prophet who knew a revolutionary com tech would occure shortly. All in all, Sagan was so good at wri"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I first read this book in the '80s, when I was pre-teen. I adored it. I still rank it in the top 5 &quot;first contact&quot; novels, along with 2001, Childhood's End, Gateway, and Rendezvous with Rama. Other reviewers here have covered what's so good about this book in the months before the movie opened in Japan, so let me tell you why I took off 2 points.First, Sagan rubs his belief in the moral equivalence between the United States and the Soviet Union into the book. Sagan is entitled to his beliefs; after all, that's what the Cold War was about. If the movie was more true to the book, however, I think this point would have put off thousands of people from going to the theater and thus prevented them from receiving Sagan's worthy messages.Second, the way scientists deal with facts is not as simple as the book and the movie put it. I am not a postmodernist, but everyone uses a theory to register what he or she sees as a fact. All theories have core assumptions that cannot be refuted by facts alone. The difference between science and everything else is in how those assumptions are formed, modified, and discarded (if ever). Maybe Sagan felt that he could not give this away, given the strength of fundamentalism and postmodernism in the United States.Apart from this, I recommend this book heartily."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"For me, this book was mostly like a fairytale. Not everything was realistic as far as I have knowledge to todays science, but it might be somewhere in the future, and that facinates me about Carl Sagan. His ability to make you feel that you are there when it all happens, and in the moment you read it, everything seems possible and nothing seems unrealistic. You just can\`t stop reading, and when you\`re finished, you wish you didn\`t read it that fast because you want to have those fantastic reading experiences over and over again. Carl Sagan was a great author, and I can assure you that you won\`t regret if you read this interesting and extraordinairy book. Run to the store and buy it, it\`s an investment for a lifetime!!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I found Sagan's fictional work interesting fromthe standpoint of it's scientific base.I enjoyed learning about MESA and the search foraudio contact from others in the universe. The characterswere believable, and the weaving of the social,political. and economic implications were thoughtprovoking.I can't say it was a page turner, but I managed to turn them all."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"If you had one Carl Sagan book to read, thiswould probably be it.

While it may containtechnobabble, it's believable technobabblebecause so much of it is based upon Sagan'sreal-life work.All of his favorites are here: the dodecahedron,the SETI project, commentary on superpower mistrust,who speaks for the Earth, and the conflict betweenreligious and scientific belief systems.It does get a bit heavyhanded with the recurringthread about the persecution of astronomerswho are so much smarter than everyone else(another Sagan favorite).I enjoyed the fact that Ellie Arroway was figuringout the problems of the universe, but could notresolve her own family problems."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I really like it. If you have not read Sagan's science non-fiction books this is a good chance to learn and have fun at the same time. Through out the novel you get to know Sagan's skeptikal point of view and his strong positions about religion. To the science he added some good speculations about traveling faster than light. And to the meaning of God too! Good hard Science Fiction, if you like this genre. Also a good summary of the author's points of view expressed earlier and later in &quot;Broca's Brain&quot; and &quot;The Demon-Haunted World&quot;. So, if you haven't read Sagan or if you like his non-fiction books, this novel is for you."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I read &quot;Contact&quot; several years ago when it was first published. I remembered that it was a good book, but not much more. When the movie came out, I was really excited. I rushed out to see it. It was such a good movie that I decided to re-read my book. I was amazed. The book was so much better. Although the basic premise was the same, subtle changes were made to the movie version that in effect changed the story. During the re-read, I found myself comparing the movie to the book and thinking, &quot;they should have done that in the movie&quot;. It was great fun."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I have 16 years old and i feel like my life is the main caracter of the novel.

Then goes on to talk about such things like singularities, but brings us back to the rabbitts.I expected a message from E.T. to come from this book, but I admit from God I didn't.

I enjoyed the humanness of his characters, the realities of their work world, and the science in which they were involved. I read the book before watching the video and felt, as I usually do, that the book was better. One can always create more side plots and develop to a greater extent the individual characters in a volume of so many pages, which the reader can set aside at will and return to as needed. The director must stick to a central theme and be constantly mindful of budgetary constraints. I also thought the relationship of the heroine with her father was more intense and surprising in the book than in the movie."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"The only science fiction novel by a prominent astronomer who was the late twentieth century's foremost popularizer of science was bound to be something special, and Carl Sagan's &quot;Contact&quot; certainly is. No other science fiction novel is quite like it in its thrilling realism; one can easily believe that a sequence of events similar to that in the book could begin taking place tomorrow. The book is filled with a plethora of wonderful plot twists, fascinating details of scientific fact and speculation, and unexpected bits of characterization that only Sagan could have thought to include. Sagan, who apparently considered himself a &quot;spiritual agnostic,&quot; explored religious as well as scientific issues in this work, and the result is arguably heretical if seen from a traditional religious standpoint -- but not heretical in the specific way a reader might initially expect. Indeed, the story's climactic twist makes &quot;Contact&quot; into a twentieth-century equivalent of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; -- a work which, while subtly heretical, is one of the most awe-inspiringly religious books ever written.Jodie Foster's reading of &quot;Contact&quot; on this recording is absolutely superb. She differentiates between the voices of all the characters and her own voice as narrator -- even her voice for Ellie Arroway, the character she played in the movie of &quot;Contact,&quot; is a subtly more energetic and characterful version of her normal voice. Foster also employs about seven different accents (counting her usual American accent) in the course of the recording, moving effortlessly from one to another when characters from several different countries have conversations. At one point, when Sagan's text describes a character as having an almost (but not quite) non-existent Russian accent, Foster even manages to produce exactly that! She also evokes all the varying moods of the story, conveying Sagan's sense of awe and wonder at the beauty and majesty of the universe. Foster's performance on this recording is probably the best reading of a book which I have ever heard.I listened to this recording over several nights, and was in suspense from one night to the next, wondering what would happen next. This superb example of the intelligence and artistry of Carl Sagan and Jodie Foster is highly recommended. Six out of five stars."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Contact is grand, it is epic, and it is vast in it's hypotheses and plotline. However, it is also one of the most touching and personable books you will ever read.I agree with others who have said that the twists and turns in the plot are fantastic. No doubt. But my favorite thing about this book is Ellie's character - her tenacity, her passion, and her undaunted *faith* while yet an athiest and a scientist. Sagan develops an array of interesting characters, with different backgrounds and belief systems, who respond to the first-contact experience in unique ways. As much as Contact is a story about first-contact with aliens, it is as much or even moreso a pondering about humanity, our strengths and weaknesses, and the delicate differences through which we strive to find common ground.You should know that there are a few significant differences between the book and the movie (I did like the movie very much by the way, and felt Jodie Foster did a superb job as Ellie). The following are \\"minor spoilers\\". In other words, they are subtle hints at what you may have missed if you only saw the movie, but, I have not outright told you what is in the book either:1) Palmer Joss's character looks quite different in the book, and has a different background, than the hot-bodied heart-throb portrayed in the movie by McConaughey (McConaughey did well with the part written for him, in my opinion).2) Ellie and her dad's relationship is much more personal than the short snibets depicted in the movie.3) Ellie is not the only person who meets the Caretakers (aliens) in the book version.4) During the first contact with the alien (\\"her dad\\"), the conversation is much longer and more detailed. The alien shares paragraphs of information about the outside universe, what they have discovered, an intriguing discussion on pi and the secrets this number holds, and what they feel the future holds for other worlds in the galaxy. This was a significant difference from the movie, though I can see why Zemeckis needed to shorten some of it due to its extensiveness.5) The book has a fantastic twist at the end which the movie did not include. It revolves around something Ellie learned about pi during her conversation with the alien. I was surprised the movie did not include it, as it was such a creative and masterful conclusion.There are other differences but these were the most significant ones for me.If you are on the lookout for books with a similar theme/feel, try Jack McDevitt's \\"The Engines of God\\" and \\"The Hercules Text\\", especially the latter.And on a side note - Hey Nick, How about a SEQUEL?"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"For those who loved the movie, you should have read the book first- and then you'd have hated the movie.

And not just any picture! I found this to be a genuinely moving book- a distinct rarity in the science fiction world. And for the lost soul who rated the book a \\"1\\" because Carl is an \\"atheist\\"- you totally missed the point of the book! Like Einstein, Carl was an agnostic- but he was profoundly and deeply \\"religious,\\" in his way, as the ending of the book makes so clear. Carl's reverence and concern for this planet and for its future generations should qualify him for sainthood, in any religion.

Using the book's main characters as a mouthpiece for many of his personal views, Carl Sagan is successful in revealing that science and religion are NOT necessarily mutually exclusive. And Jodie Foster's performance as Ellie Arroway in the movie as well as the reader in the audio version is unsurpassed. The ending in the book made me weep big ole soppy tears, not because it is sad, but rather because it is so incredibly uplifting. If only there were such definitive proof of .... (well, I won't spoil it for you). Perhaps someday we will be ready to handle such evidence. In the meantime, wouldn't it be nice to actually make Contact? Perhaps then we could set aside our petty global differences and unite with a single purpose to join the cosmic family - if indeed &quot;they&quot; would let us in. Carl Sagan presents us with a glimpse of such a reality, although it is still perhaps just beyond our ability to convince ourselves that it could actually come true. Thank you Carl ... wherever you are."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Contact is a *very* believable story of humans detecting and decoding the first signal recieved from aliens. I don't want to reveal much more than that for if you are to read this book, there are so many exciting moments of mystery and discovery that unfold throughout the story. This book is captivating from the first page to the very last sentence. I highly recommend it to all.For those that have seen Contact the movie already, in my opinion, the book is much better, and that is saying a lot since I thought the movie was excellent. If you enjoyed the movie, the book will dive deeper and reveal so much more that the movie did not.One note... Sagan spends a good deal of time setting up and knocking down anything to do with religion. This is nothing new for Sagan (see almost any of his other books). For some, this might feel like old hat and a bit slow compared to the rest of the book. But it just made me crave more and more to get to the parts about the message and the amazing events that unfold after it is decoded."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"ContactCarl SaganCongratulations,You are about to embark on a journey through time and space, and get the opportunity to observe and evaluate the very thoughts of the author and ppreciate the author's scientific intuition.

Our distinguished author has many credits to his name. He was the Director of the Laboratory for Planetary Studies and David Duncan Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences at Cornell University. He was part of the team responsible for the Viking, Mariner, and Voyager Expeditions. He received NASA medals for Exceptional Scientific Achievement and for Distinguished Public Service. He was past chairman of the Division for Planetary Sciences and the Astronomy Section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Four hundred of his scientific and popular articles have been published. Additionally, he was the author and co-author of several other books including : \\"Intelligent Life in the Universe,\\" \\"The Cosmic Connection,\\" \\"The Dragons of Eden,\\" \\"Murmurs of Earth,\\" \\"Broca's Brain,\\" \\"Comet,\\" his most famous - \\"Cosmos,\\" \\"A Path Where No Man Thought,\\" an expose' of the nuclear winter scenario, and his last - \\"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors.\\" He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in literature in 1978; he was also a champion of both human and Earth rights. But for all his brilliance, intuitiveness, and achievement, Carl Sagan recognized his own mortality and insignificance in the Universe.Contact. Only Carl Sagan could devise this simple, one word name for his first fiction novel; the title so eloquently and completely describes the central plot of his story - contact with an advanced galactic civilization and, perhaps, more - the identity of which is: to be announced!Given his credentials, it is not surprising to me that Carl Sagan chose the subject of extraterrestrial contact for his first fiction novel; it so perfectly reflects his own interests: Cosmology, SETI, and CETI activities; SETI and CETI, incidently, refer to 'Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence' and 'Contact with Extraterrestrial Intelligence' respectively. His novel names real places, among them: the Arecibo facility in Puerto Rico and the Argus Array in Socorro, New Mexico. He conducted SETI activities at both these facilities. Indeed, his first fiction novel is a reflection of his own fantasies and ambitions of locating alien intelligence. With his collaborator and colleague, Ann Druyan, he achieved excellent results with \\"Contact.\\"STORY SYNOPSISIn the late 1980's, an intelligent radio source (a message)is received from the vicinity of the Vega star system in the constellation of Lyra. The signal contained many levels of information encoded by various modulation methods and astronomers found: a re-broadcast of the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, a set of prime numbers, and finally, elaborate instructions to build a machine. It's the \\"Machine.\\" Extraterrestrials are telling us they know we're here. Several years were needed to decode the instructions and build the Machine. During this time, great political, philosophical, religious, and scientific debates took place to determine the purpose, implications, and ramifications of the now controversial Machine. The Machine is eventually determined to be a vehicle by which five Earth travelers would be able to journey to Vega and be greeted by the Message senders. The Machine, do decahedron in shape, is completed and, on New Year's Eve - 1999, it is activated with 5 selected travelers on board. Within a matter of minutes, the travelers visit several spectacularly beautiful star systems before finally reaching their destination and meeting the Message senders, the \\"Caretakers.\\"The travelers find that the Caretakers are a conglomeration of cultures that have been around for half a billion years. After determining that the expanding Universe will eventually spread itself too thin to allow for the formation of new stars and galaxies, the Caretakers decided they would harness and corral extraneous matter using the gravity effects of black holes and other devices, and cause a sufficient concentration of the matter to insure the continued rebirth of new stars and galaxies. At times, they \\"closed off\\" sections of the Universe until needed.Does Dr. Sagan have an imagination, or doesn't he?! The Caretakers are certainly the ultimate ecologists. Like a galactic version of Johnny Appleseed, they have taken the task of re-planting the Universe! The Caretakers' true appearance is never revealed because they appear to each of the Earth travelers as the travelers' loved ones. Dr. Ellie Arroway, our heroine and main character, talks with her dead \\"father\\" and learns that the Caretakers have an \\"emerging civilization division\\" that makes contact with cultures such as Earth, and invites them for a visit and tour. The Caretakers have watched many civilizations come and go but believe the Earth has hope for survival.Dr. Arroway's assigned host, her \\"father,\\" talks with her about the possibility of a hidden message buried deep with the value of \\"Pi,\\" perhaps 10 to the 20th power digits beyond the decimal point. Dr. Arroway ponders the idea. But visit time is almost up! The Caretakers escort the travelers back to their craft and, without proof of their visit, send them home. Ellie later investigates the properties of Pi and makes a gargantuan discovery!A WORD ABOUT STORY ACCURACYAbove all, Carl Sagan is a scientist. Based on what I know about him from his previous works, he apparently assumes nothing and questions everything. He is a stickler for detail. He retains that child-like wonder and imagination of the world around him - and of the Universe in which we reside. Accordingly, he left little to chance while weaving his story.A transmission emanates from the Vega star system. Vega is about the right age, the right size, and the right spectral range to spawn a planetary system conducive to supporting an advanced civilization. It is also 26 light years away. The transmission, received about 1988, contained an encoded re-broadcast of the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. The period between 1936 and 1988 is 52 years; a round-trip radio transmission from Earth to Vega and back would take 52 years. Dr. Sagan later weaves the speed of light limit into his story when the Earth travelers are accused of perpetrating a hoax by government officials. The travelers are informed that the Message stopped at the moment the Machine was activated. With their limited minds, the government officials \\"know\\" that it should take 26 years for news of Machine activation to reach Vega. They refuse to believe that the Vegans could have broken the speed of light barrier. Dr. Sagan shrewdly used his \\"writer's license\\" with respect to the speed of light issue. As Isaac Asimov put it in his book The Roving Mind: \\"What do science fiction writers do?......better writers know of the speed of light limit and get around it by assuming that in the future, new technologies will be available. They talk about moving through 'hyperspace,' or through 'subspace'; they make use of a 'subetheric drive' or a 'space warp'.But let's get back on track. Our distinguished author's work is more accurately described as a science and philosophy text book with a story woven in to connect these things. I estimate that 65 percent of the book would remain if the story were removed. Among the multitude of scientific notions \\"Contact\\" explores are the descriptions of various radio transmission modulation methods and the properties of exponential growth. Through his Ellie Arroway character, Dr. Sagan points out that one cubic centimeter of water (about one thimble full) contains 3 x 10 to the 19th power molecules whereas the entire Universe contains 1 x 10 to the 80th power elementary particles. A numerical difference of only 61 (in terms of powers of ten) is the difference between a few drops of water and all the matter in the entire Universe! In addition, the reader learns about worm holes, black holes, the birth and death of stars, bright infrared and x-ray emission sources, precession of the Earth's axis, Keppler's three laws, and much more. Speaking of Johannes Keppler, Dr. Sagan - the little devil - cleverly and surreptitiously slipped Keppler's proposed model of the solar system into his story. Dr. Sagan's Machine took the form of a do decahedron enclosed by three concentric rotating, mutually perpendicular hemispheres he calls benzels. In his paper entitled Mysterium Cosmographicum, published in 1596, Keppler borrows the Greek Mathematicians' discovery of the five - and only five - regular solids. A regular solid is one in which all sides are the same. In Keppler's model, the five solids are nestled one-in-the-other, separated by concentric spheres. One of these regular solids is a do decahedron, formed of twelve pentagons. Is the similarity between Keppler's model and Dr. Sagan's Machine a coincidence? I don't think so. Dr. Sagan is not only brilliant, he's sneaky. \\"Contact\\" may someday be used as a textbook.Speaking of textbooks, consider the following riddle. What does one get when one combines the fundamental parts of the book \\"Cosmos\\" with a fictional story? Answer: \\"Contact.\\" As I previously mentioned, \\"Contact\\" IS Dr. Sagan's way of telling us his dreams. Consider the following examples:Contact: p.77 - Ellie imagines the Message as the \\"Encyclopedia Galactica\\" when it is first received.Cosmos: pp.291-315 - An entire chapter is entitled \\"Encyclopedia Galactica.\\" This chapter is a speculative accounting of how another civilization might communicate with us.Contact: p.100 - Ellie explains to the President that the transmission from Vega has messages over messages in different levels of modulation - what she calls a \\"palimpsest.\\" Cosmos: p.314 - \\"But the most likely case is that interstellar communication will be a kind of palimpsest, like the palimpsests of the ancient writers short of papyrus or stone who superimposed their messages on top of preexisting messages.\\"These are but a few of the many parallels that exist between \\"Contact\\" and \\"Cosmos.\\" Is there any doubt that Dr. Sagan is telling us his greatest ambition - his greatest dream?SCIENTIFIC INSIGHTS EXPLOREDScientific insight is an understatement in \\"Contact.\\" Dr. Sagan wasted no time with the development of his Ellie Arroway main character and our heroine. As a champion of civil and human rights, he naturally gave us a female astronomer and a female President. He meticulously describes Ellie's hard struggle to overcome harsh prejudices and resistance to her achieving her goal of becoming a radio astronomer and scientist in this male dominated profession. He also took great care to give her a perpetually inquisitive mind that questioned everything. She is a master of \\"Why?\\" From child through adulthood, she wondered about everything from the way vacuum tubes worked to - the Bible's compatibility with science to - the physical makeup of the Universe. Her curiosity parallels Albert Einstein's comment that a passion for comprehension is a necessary component of the scientific mind.Dr. Sagan's Ellie character also follows in the best traditionsof women devoted to space exploration: Henrietta Leavitt, the Harvard astronomer who devised a stellar distance measuring method in 1912; Jocelyn Bell, the Cambridge astronomer who discovered what we now call \\"pulsars\\" in 1967; Linda Morabito, the JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) engineer who discovered active volcanos on Jupiter's moon, Io in 1988; and, most poignantly, astronauts Judy Resnik and Christa McAullife who gave their lives in the pursuit of space exploration.Through his various characters and situations, Dr. Sagan also poses the questions of technical civilizations being self limiting through self destruction; the probable numbers of other cultures in the Universe based on favorable conditions; are we too dumb for other civilizations to bother with; are we really fundamentally happier with the benefits of science - each of these concerns shared by Isaac Asimov, among others. A religious leader in the book offers these criticisms of scientists: scientists keep findings to themselves; only share information in bits and pieces; over-estimate what they know, under-estimate what people know; taught us how to annihilate ourselves. This same religious leader attempts to identify God as the source of the Message. He incredibly points out that Vega was the \\"North Star\\" about ten thousand B.C. when the Earth's axis was at the other side of its precession cycle (precession is a wobble in the Earth's rotation axis). This era marks the emergence of civilization and the concept of gods. It is Divine Providence that the guiding star then is the origin of this message now, he claims. Does Dr. Sagan dig into the depths of detail, or doesn't he?Dr. Sagan, again through his Ellie character, does not allow the Bible to escape scrutiny. Ellie, in conference with not one but two prominent religious leaders, chairs a great marathon debate that scrutinizes biblical accuracy. Pro Bible arguments from the religious leaders focus mainly on claims of fulfilled Bible prophesies: \\"The coming of the savior is foretold in Isaiah fifty-three, in Zechariah fourteen, in First Chronicles seventeen. That He would be born in Bethlehem was prophesied in Micah five. That He would come from the line of David was foretold in Matthew one.....the Ministry and Suffering of Jesus are foretold in Isaiah fifty-two and fifty-three, and the Twenty-second Psalm. That He would be betrayed for thirty pieces of silver is explicit in Zechariah eleven....and the Bible speaks of our own time. Israel and the Arabs, Gog and Magog, America and Russia, nuclear war - it's all there in the Bible.\\" Undaunted, Ellie waits for the right moment to return fire. Among her first salvo of rebuttals: The prophecies are often abstract and vague, ambiguous and imprecise - open to a wide range of interpretations.....even straightforward prophecies don't seem to jibe - like Jesus' promise that the Kingdom of God would come within the lifetime of some people in his audience.....passages that seem fulfilled are highlighted and the rest are ignored.She continues by asking why God's communication with us in contemporary times isn't made perfectly clear. Why doesn't the Bible contain information that no mortal person would have known at the time - such as the Sun is a star....or Mars is a rusty place with deserts and volcanos....or a body in motion tends to remain in motion....or nothing travels faster than the speed of light? Why is there no mention of such things like \\"Two strands entwined is the secret of life\\"....or why hasn't He put a giant crucifix in orbit around Earth....or place the Ten Commandments across the face of the moon? Why no more burning bushes or pillars of fire or a thundering voice from the sky saying \\"I am that I am?\\" Why does He remain so cryptic - why doesn't He rattle our cages each generation or so? The marathon philosophical debate ends with all participants adjourning, satisfied with their respective offerings but not swayed by the others' positions.ADDITIONAL COMMENTSStrikingly, \\"Contact\\" contains a table of contents not unlike that of an omnibus text book. \\"Contact\\" takes us on a tour that introduces us to the unique properties of Pi .. scientific investigation and hypothesis .. contributions of Greek science and mathematics .. our solar system .. the known properties of the Universe .. black holes .. do decahedrons .. exponential powers .. the Milky Way .. stars' life-cycles .. the Renaissance astronomers .. probability of extraterrestrial intelligence .. probability of our survival .. our insignificance .. our propensity toward greed and corruption .. our pollution problems .. our place in the Universe .. and much more. Science, religion, politics, psychology, philosophy, and their relationships to each other - it's all there - in \\"Contact.\\"Dr. Sagan's message to his readers is multi-faceted. He tells us who we are, where we've been, what were doing, and where we're going. He tells us we need to make the right decisions now if we are to have a desirable future; he tells to be scientists, to have an open mind; he counsels us to control our arrogance; he demonstrates the distinct possibility of life elsewhere in the Cosmos; but most significantly, he tells us WHO HE IS. Although Dr. Sagan is no longer with us, I feel his message is still very much alive.But for all his brilliance, scientific knowledge and intuitiveness, skepticism, and resourcefulness, Dr. Sagan still held the door open to the idea that there may be a . . . Hey - read the book!\\"Contact\\" isn't for everybody . . . but . . . it should be.SOME PERSONAL THOUGHTSI first enjoyed reading this book when it was first published. I recently read it again to enhance my appreciation of it because I was able to convert my increased knowledge of the sciences from my schooling into a greater understanding of Dr. Sagan's \\"Message.\\"Dr. Sagan issued a disclaimer at the end of his book, telling the reader that no character in the book is a close portrait of a real person. I don't think this is entirely true. I can't help believe that there isn't at least a smidgeon of similarity between the persona of the Ellie Arroway character and that of Dr. Sagan or, perhaps, his colleague and collaborator, Ann Druyan.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I saw the movie first. Having been a Sagan admirer since before adolescence, I knew there would be ideas of enormous complexity and scope presented in a language that was accessible to almost any reasonably intelligent person. It took less than a half hour of the movie for me to know without hesitation that it had been drastically dumbed down from a book I hadn't even read. I bought the book the next day and will never bother with another film adaptation of Sagan ever again (and will be hard pressed to justify seeing anything made by those who defiled Sagan in this movie).There are three profound strengths to this book, and the movie only got close to approximating one of them:1) The translation of elaborate concepts and hypotheses of physics and astronomy into lay terms. This is the only area where the film even made a notable attempt. But they still didn't even pretend at nailing it the way the book did.2) The discourse between science and religion. Sagan explored this enduring quandry with a fairness, maturity and intellectual honesty that few authors (and probably no filmmakers) have ever achieved. He also explored the debates with a sense of drama and nuance, while the filmmakers focused more on the fact that the debates were occuring between pretty people with sexual chemistry/tension. Shame.3) The Arroway character was one of the most complete and believable characters I have ever read and, to be frank, the first female lead character I have ever connected with in any way. She was strong and brilliant and confident and hungry while remaining distinctly female and even vulnerable at times. This could only have been achieved by an author with an innate shared passion and sympathy for his character's purpose - in this case science and the search for the answers to some of the ultimate questions about life. The movie made her a sanctimonious whiner. Most of the rest of the characters were tragically dumbed down too.I recommend you read this book. Two or three times. And don't bother with the movie."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"No, I don't know the movie. But the movie cannot be much better than the book. This is Science Fiction at its best: demonstrating the impact of technology and research on our societies. Astronomer Ellie is participating in the search for extraterrestial intelligence and discovers a message sent to earth from the stars. The decoding of the message reveals the plans for building a machine of unknown purpose. And after the construction is finished, Ellie finds herself as part of a crew going boldly to unknown worlds where nobody has gone before (sorry about the comparison).Of course, the entire project encounters several difficulties: Ellie's education as an astronomer (hey, she's a girl), some problems getting the research grants, diplomatic difficulties (the book was written in the early 1980s - before Glasnost and Perestroika), religious fundamentalism, political issues, the power of big industrial companies etc. One might argue that Sagan drags the story's flow a bit when he describes the problems decoding the message and building the machine, but he probably knows far too well that scientific progress is slow, tedious, and not always a straight path.I am amazed that none of my fellow reviewers complained about the scientific content. Here Sagan is the good old educator again, fighting for popularizing science: Several technical details are described and explained; and the funny thing is, of course, that most of the stuff is at least scientifically possible. (If you are more interested how it works, try Jim Al-Khalili's &quot;Black Holes, Wormholes, and Time Machines&quot;. I have also a review on that...)Sagan's book has a strong emphasis on the relation between religion and science which still seems to be of particular importance in the United States. The novel suggests (especially the ending) that science and religion are not opposites but complement each other and that there are signs of the divine (the numinous, as Ellie calls it) in science as well as scientific moments in religion.Read the book."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Sagan had the knack of getting his humanistic point of view out without being offensive to the general populace. He was also a great explainer of scientific ideas in a simple way, to make it easy to understand and interesting. I wish he would have lived longer so he could've written more novels. I think novel writing could have been his best skill. He died too young.Jeffrey McAndrewauthor of &quot;Our Brown Eyed Boy&quot;"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"The classic science fiction theme of humanities' first brush with alien intelligence occupies center stage in Sagan's adequate, but not artful, novel.First the bad: In terms of literary style, \\"Contact\\" isn't especially impressive. Indeed, the prose is often awkward and this tends to give the characters a dry, not-quite-believable quality. \\"Contact\\" borders on the verbose---I am confident at least 50 pages worth of dialogue and \\"character development\\" could easily (and beneficially) been omitted. I'm sorry to say that after about 150 pages I very nearly lost all interest in the book. I'm glad I persevered however, because the last half was worth it. And on that note......The good: The scientific foundation and superstructure Sagan builds in this book is solid, credible, believable and interesting to read. Sagan has described a perfectly plausible and substantial \\"real world\\" scenario for first contact. As already mentioned, the second half of the book is where the real strength lies. Sagan takes themes and characters that were rather boring and predictable in the first half and actually makes them interesting, and thankfully, even thought-provoking. For example, I enjoyed the irony of Dr. Arroway having to defend her experience in the Machine vis a vis her antagonism toward other people's religious experiences. Dr. Arroway became a more believable and interesting character in the second half, some situations in her personal life approaching poignancy were very effective in that regard. The completion of the Machine is interesting enough, as well as its subsequent use. All told, \\"Contact\\" finishes strong---read it for yourself and decide!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I saw the movie before reading the novel. In the novel, Ellie Arroway isn't as annoying as the movie's Ellie Arroway: she is not constantly criticizing religion. The movie spent too much time focusing on the question of religion versus science. It is a theme in the novel, but the theme is not as in-your-face as in the movie (for example, Hadden and his Preachnix device).Unfortunately, the novel is very awkward at introducing backstory: a character is introduced and then the next few paragraphs give a quick biographical sketch of the character. Personally, I'd rather have the backstory of a character introduced in pieces and in surprises. For example, Palmer Joss could have been a much more interesting character if his backstory were introduced much slowly. These sketches should have been editted out.The last chapter of the novel, was much better than the movie's end. It would've been nice to see what Ellie did with that information from her mother's letter."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"\\"Contact\\" came to my attention after watching the film, which I dearly love. As books are usually better than films I was elated to finally settle in and begin the journey. I will say that the book and movie are dramatically different in many respects and I love both for different reasons, but this novel surpasses the film in a great many of those respects.Just short of the new Millennium (1999), the Earth receives its first message from intelligent life in outer space. Ellie Arroway is the romantic, ambitious scientist at the center of Sagan's tale and her personal struggles and beliefs, as well as those of her colleagues, magnify the sentiments of the world around them. They are faced with meeting a new alien intelligence, new tests of faith, many of which they would've never expected within the realms of science, and they must come to terms with their new knowledge in order to make sense of an ever-changing world.How would a society react to such a realization of life beyond our planet, how would it affect the everyday lives of those involved, and how would it change the way science and religion function? All of these questions are addressed in Sagan's staggering, uplifting, poignant piece of fiction.Steeped in technical and scientific terms, the book is challenging, but incredibly fulfilling. I came away from the last page with a deep sense of satisfaction, awe, and a great regard for Sagan's method of bringing science to the masses. This book really makes you evaluate the harmony of science and faith and points out that the two, indeed, can work together."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Carl Sagan's Contact is a very well-written, enjoyable books that manages to get a point across and be educational at the same time. Many books have approached the problems of first contact, but few have examined it as thoroughly as Sagan does here. Also, he approaches it in a different way from most. Rather than have the aliens visit the earth, the human race instead picks up artificial radio signals, and... well, I won't spoil it for you. Suffice it to say that Sagan's deep involvement with Project SETA carries over into this book and gives it a highly realistic feel, that along with the well-drawn cast of characters and pseudo-documentary narrative style. Another thing that makes this book worthy is that Sagan weaves his views on such issues as religion (on which he raises some very valid flags), science, government, nationalism, sexism, and aliens. You might not agree with everything he says, but you have to at least allow that he raises some truly tangible points. This is a fine book: well-thought out, info-packed, believable, and readable. My highest reccommendation (and a lot better than the movie, by the way.)"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Yes, I admit, I saw the movie before I read the book. The movie took some serious liberties with the book, presumably to make it translate better to a film (i.e. stepped-up sex, violence, and controversy). The written word, however, can go to depths that the film can not.The character of Ellie Arroway is fleshier and juicier when we are allowed into her most intimate thoughts. A friend of mine, upon seeing me reading the book remarked that the movie was &quot;boring&quot; and that it &quot;dragged&quot;. I found the movie and the book intriguing because Sagan delves deeper into questions I've pondered about in the wee hours of the morning with roommates and close friends and asks the questions that never even entered our minds. Sagan probes the relationship between religion and science and the mutual animosity its respective champions have for each other and their doctrines.The building of the Machine sent (by extraterrestrials from Vega) as a plan over radio waves is almost a secondary plot thread, taking a back seat to more pressing political, theological, and scientific concerns. Imagine receiving this plan in today's world. How many people would assume it was a doomsday machine, or from the devil, or that it was a summons that could not be ignored from a higher technology? How many people would insist we build the Machine, and how many would insist that we should not? How does the world-wide community reconcile its differences, and &quot;get along&quot; so the Machine, which can not be done by one country alone, be built? Fascinating and thought-provoking for me, apparently 'boring' for others, I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I saw the film Contact based on this novel and was totally blown away, so I went out and bought the book, and I'm very glad I did.Unlike other novel to film conversions, the film remains largely faithful to the novel. But, if you've already seen the film, not to worry as reading the novel is not merely repeating what was in the film - there's enough unique (and slightly more technicaly involved) material in the novel, along with a slightly different plot, to make reading the novel quite worth it.Unfortunately, I think the film was slightly dumbed down to be better suited to the movie-going audience - this book is smart, intelligent and thought provoking. And of course the film leaves out a lot of details. For instance, Sagan devotes quite a bit of the beginning of the novel to Elle's childhood - while the film spends some time here, Sagan goes into far more detail in the book, talks at length about Elle's mother etc. In fact, Elle's character in the novel is even better developed than in the film, which is impressive because the film really does an excellent job focusing on Elle and her beliefs.Lastly, without giving anything away, I think reading the novel is worth it just for the ending, which is a bit different than the book and explores a really cool idea relating to the fundamental nature of the universe (or at least our perception of the universe) which I found to be really intruiging."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Historically, intellectuals have philosophized their ideas about god. Hitherto, those philosophies have gained popularity in many's minds. The soul of one's spirituality, faith, and belief is similarly touched in this single work of fiction by one of those former intellectuals. Carl Sagan shows us the universality of faith and spirit in all of our lives, and whole-heartedly encourages us to frame our own ideas of faithful reasoning. Ellie Arroway, the main character, shows the puzzlement of our minds and Palmer Joss, her friend, lover at times, is it's firm-minded, though not closed minded, mediator. Her journey from agnostic to enlightened agnostic occurs with this truth seeker throughout lighting the way and proving connections, comparing the scientific mind with the religious, showing that fine line which separates them. The end of the book shows no conclusion, merely the importance of being open-minded and having an astute mind, an accepting spirit and a rational sould as their parent."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Contact is a great book that is completely satisfying in the end. I would not say that the plot is completely original but the themes are thought provoking.Does intelligent life exist outside the earth? That is not a controversy in this book because the book is one, fiction and second, SETI is really just a setting for the greater theme of faith, expansion of the mind, etc. It would be like arguing the historical accuracy of \\"War and Peace\\" when the real theme is the growth and changing of the human character.Sagan challenges the reader to think out of our own limited minds when dealing with expansive/infinite concepts like the universe or even God."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I don't know what these one star raters are thinking. If nothing else this book and movie give you some very important things to think about. We are not alone be it an alien civilization or an omnipresent, omniscient God. I like to think that both exist together. There is also the hope that we may be reunited with our lost loved ones, be it in a tropical Pensacola paradise or the Paradise that Christ describes for us in the Bible. Either way it would be wonderful. I can't think of a better way to spend an evening or two reading this book or watching the movie.

Still do. Very intelligently written, but thenwhat else would you expect from Carl Sagan. It's good to knowthat his 'creative' (fictional) writing equalls his non-fictionalwork. He's talented in either venue. What a wonderful imagination...so detailed, makes one wonder if it really is 'fiction'."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This is a book about first contact with aliens, writtenby a prominent member of SETI, the Search forExtraTerrestrial Intelligence. Sagan makes excellent use ofSETI's current search methods as well as his ownknowledge of astronomy and physics to bring a sense ofreality to the book. But above its literacy, philosophy,and speculation, it is an entertaining story that is notovershadowed by gadgetry."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This book has good ideas and characters as well as a nuanced story, but for some reason I just didn't think it was all that good. I liked Ellie, the chief protagonist, who was psychologically complex and a striver for discovery - she had a funny relationship with her father and step father, which influenced her ability to get close to men, perhaps focusing her on the search for intelligent life. Of course, she makes a great discovery and then fights the bureaucracy to get a chance to travel to the new beings with the technology that they transmit. Then of course there is the journey and the disappointing reactions of mankind, etc. THis is a solid and believable plot.That is fine so far as it goes. Somehow, it just felt static to me, rather than pulsing with the life that a novel by Octavia Butler or even Frank Herbert does. Perhaps it is because I regard the best hard scifi as genuinely great novels that I found this so mediocre. The characters are more vehicles for ideas than living beings, perhaps, or they just weren't all that interesting outside of their amazing adventure.Tepidly recommended. Go elsewhere for great hard scifi."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This is a passionate book that seems to be the sum of everything that Sagan cared about. I've always loved it.Has anyone else figured out the origin of Ellie's name? It's an anglicization of \\"Arouet\\" which was Voltaire's original surname. There are several references in \\"Contact\\" to Voltaire's writings, especially his \\"conte philosophique\\" Microm&eacute;gas."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"We chose this novel because it is the original &quot;Contact&quot; (first published in 1985 by Simon and Schuster in hardback ISBN 0-671-43400-4) Reading this novel was a credible journey into galactic realms, by 5 humans and thus humanity itself. It becomes a journey of soul, science, religious belief and politics simultaneously. Mr Sagan's career in science lends him the perfect tools to describe the intricate work of the central figure, scientist Ellie Arroway and her fantastic discovery. His cultural knowledge is deep and enriches the other characters who journey with her. There is enough of the book given over to science, romance and fantasy to make this a perfect book for any generation, it leads it's reader into an opening of the mind beyond our own galaxy, beyond where many of us ever go in our lifetimes. It gives value to contemplative star gazing and faint traces of credibility to intelligent life beyond our small earth-bound domain. Wow what a trip to take by anyone needing some sense of order to ones fantasies...he makes it scientifically believable.I enjoyed the religious debate and felt it appropriately elevated beyond our own earth based beliefs to seem credible, pushing one towards something larger. A larger concept of God or the Creator as we know them. It moved one towards a concept of preserving the world for the future generations, a more unified world, a single humanity, a true global village!I enjoyed the book because of it's balance of all realms: theological debate, science, humanity and it's struggle for survival and search for love and truth. All vital statistics for a fantastic voyage. The film is less intricate but recommended. We also read Ben Bova's &quot;Mars&quot; and found it equally fascinating.This book is a mind and heart and eye opener, it will send your spirits souring to the heavens amid a cascade of science, of human emotion and human politics."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Being a fan of Carl, I was expecting something a little more.

DoughertyApril 14, 2009Amazon.com Book ReviewContact, by Carl Sagan, is about Ellie Arroway, a scientist with an interest in extraterrestrials. While working at Argus, the first astronomical station just for the search for extraterrestrials, Ellie discovers a code of prime numbers in a radio frequency from the planet Vega. This brings the world together to complete an objective of deciphering the code. Ellie finds the primer deeper in the message and it contains the blueprints to build a machine. Without the world unity, however, the message would have probably been lost.The U.S. is well on its way to building the machine when a bomb destroys it. Mr. Hadden, a wealthy eccentric, finances and builds the machine in Japan. Ellie and four other people go to Vega on the machine through black holes which are used as portals to a huge landing platform. Once they arrive in Vega, the aliens read their minds to get questions answered on the human species. Then the aliens say they will leave Earth alone.When the space travelers get back, people think the trip to Vega was a hoax because the journey only took twenty-five minutes. The U.S. government tells Ellie if she ever gets proof about the aliens, she can come out with what she saw. In the meantime, the government is going to say the machine failed.I think Contact accurately portrayed human nature as people have always been initially uneasy with new ideas and ways of life. I thought the book was insightful in how an extraterrestrial encounter could really happen. However, I thought there should have been some action in Contact because there was virtually none. In addition, the transitions between the main points to the story, such as finding the message and building the machine, took too long and were a bit boring. All in all I thought it was a good book and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a book that makes you think."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I stopped reading this book right smack in the middle.

Sagan proves he is just another flying saucer nut who hopes some alien people from way, way out there (&quot;billions and billions&quot; miles away?) will eventually come and save mankind. He substitutes one wild unscientific premise for another. Reads like the work of a man who would be defending the medieval church if he had lived during that time because it is clear that he has a strong mystical bend of mind; hardly the temperament that lends itself to clear thinking. Fun movie, but then, so was &quot;Star Wars.&quot;"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"\\"Contact\\" is the story of one Dr. Eleanor Arroway, a radio astronomer whose work is responsible for Earth's first contact with an extraterrestrial species. From the start, Dr. Arroway is presented as a curious, confident, rational, independent lady--the ideal scientist. His description of her childhood and adolescence especially is poignant and serves to establish the Dr. Arroway we see throughout the novel.Though Dr. Arroway is the quintessential inquisitor, she is still a human being, subject to human yearnings and human desires--and, primarily, human failings. This plays significantly throughout the book, as the political obstacles she must deal with are often complicated by her romantic and professional involvement with scientists in key influential positions, both in and out of government.Faced with opposition from the Department of Defense, which is worried about what the Soviets; religious evangelists, who are concerned that they might not like the theological implications of contact with an alien species; and envious colleagues, who are worried that they might be publicly embarrassed, Dr. Arroway is forced to make compromises and concessions to reacher her one goal--the construction of the \\"Machine\\" described in blueprints transmitted to Earth by the alien civilization.It must be said, though, that the primary purpose of this novel is to build support for government funding of scientific work, especially projects such as the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). At this, the novel fails miserably. Dr. Sagan's argument takes for granted that government has any place funding any sort of scientific work in the first place, a tenet that many (myself included) do not accept.Dr. Sagan wrote \\"Contact\\" to present a fantastic case for continued funding of SETI.

The plot itself is original, a big &quot;what if?&quot;. Few works of fiction are on such an epic scale, few are as intelligent, and few inspire such a sense of awe and wonder. It goes very deep into the issues of religious philosophy, faith versus skepticism, and the possiblity of extraterrestrial life. These are the many good qualities of Contact.There are some bad qualities, too. The basic theme of the book, that you can have faith in something even when there is only evidence to the contrary and when everyone else ridicules the idea, seems to be pretty stupid. A Christian fundamentalist-scientist-preacher who rejects evolution and the age of the universe, and rants about messages from God and Satan and the immorality of scientists is made into a hero.

My 5 stars are to indicate my overwhelming satisfaction with Sagan's book. It ties in the following areas neatly into one sci-fi genre book: physics theories and findings, social science, political science, human behavior, and religion. Now, anyone who can put these categories together in one book is pretty good, anyone who does it seamless is great, anyone who does it seamlessly and keeps you entertained and has a clear point is great - Carl Sagan was great.First of all, this is a sci-fi book. What differs this from thousands of others is that everything physics related in Contact is either a proven or a proposed theory. Sagan is a phycist by practice.Secondly, Sagan humanizes the plot line. You are confronted not just a bunch of science jargon or some romantic story but rather a combination of the two which allows both an everyday reader and an astronomy enthusiast enjoy the book equally.Thirdly, it incorporates our current world beatifully. It is rather mind boggling to think about the kind of research that Sagan had to do in order to write this book. He wrote about many different cultures and fairly protrayed each. Sagan also did a great job portraying power play within and among the governemntsFinally, Sagan remembered his audience and never forgot to be entertaining and ever so gripping.Just as a personal note, for a physicist Sagan writes elegantly and descriptively - a rare gem really.Have fun with the book."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I read CONTACT long before seeing the movie and that gives one a different perspective than seeing the movie first. It is that rarest of works, science fiction popular with both scientists and readers. One detects the brilliant mind behind the prose giving us a work that is intelligent, probing and scientifically literate. Missing are space fights, dangerous aliens, gutter language, random acts of insanity, ESP, invisibility - all so common in today's current crop. Instead, it is the story of a scientist drawn to the search for alien life despite opposition from both both scientific and lay communities.Many scientists conclude that SETI is a waste; biologists in particular consider intelligence such a rare development (requiring incredibly special circumstances and literally billions of years to develop) that they despair of ever finding another species with which we can communicate.On the other side, religions object that a search is against the &quot;will of God&quot; and fear that Earthly belief systems will be adversely affected if it is known that creation is not unique. The real message is philosophical: Humanity (to quote the movie heroine) is so small and so insignificant and so precious as seen against the background of the universal panorama. This conflict between science and religion is explored without being didactic.He explains that science, unlike religion, never demands belief without proof, that its findings are always subject to change and challenge, and that it is an instrument that expresses our humanity in ways religion never can. Ellie's greatest epiphany is evoked by communion with the Universe, not with God.The plot has been bandied about before but it is the masterful blending of character, story, theme and conflict that makes this particular saga so enthralling. The movie necessarily differs from the book and while I miss the voyage of the five (and the rather incontrovertible proof that provides) the ending is not only pleasing but satisfactory. Every character seems almost perfect from the point of view of the book.I have read this book more than once and discover new nuances h each time. Dennis Overbye shares Sagan's spirit of discovery and humanity and any books by him are worth companions to this."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Contact is an entangling story about Ellie, an astronomer, who stumbles upon what she had been searching for her entire life, a message from other intelligent beings. The author does a fabulous job predicting the political, scientific, and personal struggles faced with a discovery of this magnitude.Carl Sagan is one of those authors that appeal to a select target group of readers. Born a scientific mind, writing fiction with scientific undertones was purely nature. After graduating from the University of Chicago with his Ph. D Sagan went on to participate in councils and organizations that revolved mainly around astronomy.Although this in-depth story is a type of mental quicksand for all kinds of readers, the scientific undertones are usually only grasped by those who embrace mathematics and think like a physicist. The answers skeptics, like us, constantly search for have been laid out in front of us in a fictional book providing possibilities we can only dream of. Giving everyone the ability to expand our horizons and think like a theorist, people create their own answers rather than listen to others."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"There is more imagination and intriguing conflict in the book than in anything Hollywood could produce. Sagan was a gift to readers who value thought above hyperbole and substance over style (though the book lacks for nothing in the style department). The best aspect of the book was the author's ability to take broad and complex ideas and theories from the realms of science and religion and make them completely understandable to the layperson. It was extraordinarily easy to read yet at the same time so packed with great characters and dialogue and thought-provoking material that I felt compelled to pause to digest and appreciate and reread quite a bit.The movie was utterly mediocre. It glossed over virtually every conflict and resolution and made the Arroway character (one of the strongest and most dynamic female characters I've ever read) into a sniveling sympathy magnet. If not for a few amusing political subplots and some entertaining effects, the movie would qualify as the worst adaptation of a novel that I have ever seen. It was a waste of some serious acting talent and an insult to a modern fiction masterpiece.If you've already seen the movie, do whatever you have to do to forget it, then read the book."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Carl Sagan should have written more fiction, as this is one of the best written and most intelligent books in the genre. The characters are fascinating, the human element of the story truly inspiring, the conclusion radical and eye-opening and it's written on a level anyone can understand.Sagan's writing conceptualizes science without sacrificing an enjoyable story. Open minded readers will appreciate the symbolism and irony absent in the film version as skeptics becomes believers and the tables turn on the debate between science and religion.You won't be disappointed. The ending in &quot;Contact&quot; is the most surprising and satisfying that I've ever read. It really gets you thinking about the universe, it's origin and our place in it."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"What a beautiful book! Until recently, I had never read any of Sagan's work but this book was spectacular. There is so much heart and emotion and feeling here that I felt like immediately reading it over again once I'd finished. I'm also ashamed to say I hadn't seen the movie until after reading the book, but I guess that was the best way to go at it. The character of Ellie is completely real and made me miss the relationship I had with my own father as a child (and also question by believe in God). Anyway, a great read! Also, for anyone who really enjoyed this book, I recently read a book called The Space Between by Ronald Damien Malfi and I felt the book had a similar feel, if you're looking for a good next read. I also recently read Islands in the Stream by Ernest Hemingway, but I guess that's a bit different than these other two."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"One of the best (and most realistic) first CONTACT(no pun) yarns ever written,,with wonderfully fleshed out characters(unlike the sterile Asimov and the ridiculously cartoonish Niven) without the sometimes overly mystical quliities of Clarke and Bradbury. A moving and touching capstone to the work of a true giant in the SETI field CONTACT is a paen to &quot;hard&quot; SF that speculates on the possible in the here and almost-now rather than the sometimes ridiculous space opera with mythical laser gun battles and aliens that speak perfect English. Reminiscent of Asimovs(un-Asimovian) The Gods Themselves and the recently published &quot; A Quiet Invasion&quot;"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Well, I am positive it has all been said before but I loved this book. Sci-Fi isn't really my thing, I usually prefer autobiographies and real life stories but the movie version of this book with Jodie Foster blew me away. I saw it years ago, and I just picked up this book 2 weeks ago. I just finished reading it earlier today... Jesus, where should I start? The character of Ellie Arroway was amazing... So many things about this book are just so great. Gilgamesh, chapter 22 is in my opinion the best chapter of the book... I won't give it away, but I will say that I would love to do what Hadden did lol BUY THIS BOOK!!! you will not be disappointed, I promise...I will say this though, it isn't perfect. It had some dull parts like when Carl decided it was a good idea to go pages describing in great detail the history of a minor character or two, but don't let that turn you off, it is a great book.... I didn't understand alot of the math though, but I loved it anyway... lol"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Any author can write a story about science in the not-so-distant future, but Carl Sagan is the genius who portrays today's science and scientist in a realistic light. These are people worried about obtaining grants, and dealing with aging parents, trying to advance up the glacial-paced science hierarchy. The portrayal of science reminded me of Kim Stanley Robinson's Antarctica while the interpersonal relationships reminded me more of real life.Reading the book could be either an interesting perspective or a bit of daily drudgery continued. Of course what keeps it moving is the story, which lays out like a mystery: find a clue and it only opens more questions. Sagan builds this right to the end and then cleverly continues it out. It is a fitting model of science -answers only leading to more questions, curiousity opening up whole new worlds- that is refreshing in contrast to some of the other aspects portrayed in the book.An excellent read."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I picked up this book and was fascinated just from reading the first few paragraphs. I disagree that Ellie was not a strong character, nor did I find any other characters to be lacking. I really liked Ellie as a character, and really disliked some others!I admire any book from a female viewpoint written by a man, because the generic character is usually male and I think males think from a female viewpoint much less than women think from a male viewpoint. In the early chapters he describes her frustrations about sexism very well and has some pretty specific observations about it that make me think he went to a lot of effort to understand women. And if someone as brilliant as him could see how silly and unfounded sexism is, it's about time some other people do too.This book goes all over the place. Lots of different types of characters, lots of beliefs, lots of debates and conversations. Carl Sagan is a great writer and there are certain descriptive paragraphs that I still remember and just think \\"wow\\". One main theme of this book is the ongoing science vs religion battle. I think he is kind of saying that science doesn't exclude spirituality- in a way it makes spirituality much larger than what we can imagine.My main criticism of this book was that the scientific and mathematical babble was difficult to comprehend. I basically had to just use my imagination for large sections of it. I wish I could understand more (although if there is anyone who has helped this clueless person understand science, it is Carl) but possibly some people (with degrees in science!) didn't have this problem and maybe liked these sections.Even though I didn't understand all of what he was talking about, I still wanted to read on! This book wasn't what I would call high-suspense in every chapter, but there were so many possibilities to what could occur and I really wanted to find out what would happen next. Some science fiction books just use characters as props, without getting too involved in their motivations and personal lives, but I think this book had a lot of emotional appeal, and this was a nice balance to all the techno talk. There are also some surprises, especially one in the ending. I think when he wrote this book, he put his heart right into it."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"No, that's not an afterlife recommendation. It is what the paperback I read in 1987 and the hardback that I just finished reading say on the spines when they are laying horizontally on the bookshelf. I still have a perfect picture of the gold on letters black, same size, same font, lying on a bookshelf in Foster City, CA. I just laid the newer one on a shelf that I can see from my desk chair.I enjoyed it as much this time, I think, as I did the first time. I was reminded pleasurably of how Carl dealt with the subject of religion, which was a very big part of the book. He depicted the preachers-for-money as the buffoons they still are. The subject of religion itself is treated with respect, as are many of the religious people involved. It is about as evenhanded a treatment as can be expected from an atheist.Even more, I remembered the clarity of his words and his vision, shining through the words of his characters and his description. Carl Sagan knew many things, factual things, that made him a very impressive figure. But his ability to put the facts together and discuss the combinations, to weave a story out of them, to educate the reader, was magnificent. There are too few people who are able to present complex facts and issues with the clarity he could.I miss him."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Like a lot of Sagan's work, Contact is really about the place of humanity, and life, in the greater reality of the universe. Are we a random accident of nature or is there a more fundamental meaning behind our existence?As a novel Contact is an entertaining, but sometimes cumbersome, read. The payoff is a brilliant little twist at the end, completely absent in the movie. It is original, delightful and a complete surprise, and by itself it raises a pretty good book onto my short list of personal favorites.Some readers won't get it, or won't get the significance of it, but those who are fascinated by the big questions and reasonably literate in scientific/mathematical thinking, will stumble upon a hidden little gem here."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Dr. Sagan was an intelligent and creative man. I would have been more satisfied if he had left out the twist between daughter and father in the story but the symbolic of the situation bode well with the whole fiction. Having a woman as the President was a marvelous idea especially as it may come true in near future. His futuristic interpretation of scientific developments happening at the start of the millennium was clever. Maybe I am being biased because of Dr. Sagan's real life's achievements as a scientist. My favorite character is none other than the inventor with an attitude. All in all, although the story line is simple and predictable, Contact is still a skillful art at science fiction by a man with many commendable qualities. The day he passed away was truly a sad day for the science community."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Jodie Foster does a very nice job reading Carl Sagan's wonderful book, and for those of us who have seen the film, it's easy to imagine her as Dr. Arroway as she leads us through the story. This audio book version, however, is only four cassettes long, and leaves out large chunks of the book, sadly. Still, it's an enjoyable and exciting journey as scientists receive the signal from outer space and rush to decode it. They find multiple layers to the signal, and over time, layers within layers. As the scientists learn that the signal is actually a series of instructions, they must fight many battles, overcoming paranoia and international politics to build The Machine. Finally, the quest for knowledge overcomes even military leaders, and Earth sends five scientists to find out what lies beyond our own small solar system. Their journey, and the answers they find, leads mostly to more questions, and they realize that this is only the first step of a very, very long journey, but that we are not alone in our quest, and that there are many things in the universe humankind never imagined.Fans of the movie will find some elements much different than that adaptation of Sagan's story, though both the film and the book have much to recommend them, and I feel that most people who enjoyed one version will likely enjoy the other - as long as they allow for the inevitable differences that occur between books and movies. I saw the movie first, and read the book second, but still enjoyed both very much."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Carl Sagan was a genius on this book. His truly visionary ideas mixed with the reality of politics and social fads(how people would reject the project at one moment and love it the next) was truly stunning. His idealism about us being silly to think of ourselves as the only living beings in the universe is visionary and seemingly accurate. The excitement of evolving sciences and the wonder this book fills you with are all well worth the time to read this book."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"In Contact, Dr Sagan is writing about a possible scenario in the event of mankind receiving signals from another civilization. The main plot with its subplots and very interesting characters is great. There are some subtle and clever analogies here too.I have read this book several times before the movie came out. I loved it from the first chapter and then it just got better and better. Also, reading it several years after the movie came out I feel that I understand more of this book for each time I read it. It's just excellent, this is how scifi should be written!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. I couldn't stop thinking about it after I read it, and I still think about it. I've always believed in life on other planets, it's stupid to think we're alone, in my opinion anyway. In this story Carl Sagan describes an intriguing and exciting scenario of how first contact with an alien species would be made. He uses scientific facts and scientific theories as the basis of all the events that happen. So it's more than a fantasy story, it's actually believable. The movie contact, while it was good, made me very angry. Sagan's story was about contact with aliens and just that, while the movie was about politics and conspiracy to gov't to hide information from the public. I wish they'd stuck to the real story, which was more scientific than political. Anyway, this book blew me away and I'd recommend it anyone."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I am not exactly scientifically inclined but I enjoyed this novel very much.

The plot in the book is sort of cool but it just seem overly simplistic.Also, the characters were AWFUL. Just devices to carry the plot. I found myself not caring about a single one of them. Some of them were downright ridiculous. I'm glad that generally, Sagan stuck to non-ficton.There's better stuff out there."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Carl Sagan may be a brilliant public relations man for science. And for that I thank him. But he should have stuck to TV shows. I struggled to enjoy this book and eventually stopped halfway through. The general story line is okay, although rather prosaic, and done before, but his writing and development of characters is pathetic. I got no feeling for the passion that drives anyone to seek understanding. People seem to think that scientists are stoic &amp; unimaginative; nothing is further from the truth. Carl failed to develop real characters within an interesting story. My suggestion to readers - pick a real science fiction writer (who was also a scientist with passion) and read Azimov's robot series - much more entertaining."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This is one of those odd cases where the movie is better than the book.

The book is drawn out and slow moving, the characters are poorly developed and it is full of Sagan's political agenda that detracts from what should be a fun sci-fi novel."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This is not a book for any fan of thought provoking science fiction. The writing style is plodding turgid and unsubtle. The book deals with the philosophical issues concerning the discovery of Alien intelligence as ludicrously juvenile simplicity. &quot;occams Razor&quot;, &quot;Does god exist or not&quot; Yech! reminds me of arguments I had when I was in High school! While such issues are of concern to the ignorant masses, real intellectuals, the sort of people who would actually detect and decode such a message would have no time for them. A much better Science Fiction book on the issue, sadly out of print, that deals with the same issue in an adult educated fashion is &quot;The Masters Voice&quot; By Stanislav Lem. Go to a Big library take this out and read it instead of this pulp drivel, you will not be disappointed! By the way I must add the disclaimer that I have always been a big fan of the outlook of Carl and very much appreciate what his non fiction books have done, and I also feel sad that he had to pass away in such an untimely fashion, its just that when it comes to fiction he should have stuck to his day job as a non-fiction writer."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"When I saw the film I felt there was a lot left out.

Then there's the ultimate \\"trip\\" to Vega is just as disappointing in the book (though certainly more coherent than the cinematic version)."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"If you are a fan of the movie version starring Jodie Foster, you will HATE this book.Carl Sagan was a brilliant scientist, but a fictional writer, he was not. Instead of creating compelling characters, great dialogue, and a moving plotline, Sagan's Contact is filled with government and science community hearings that go on forever and ever.Almost every character and every plot and character point in the book is different from the movie--but the movie is infinitely better.For one, you cannot follow who is who nor are able to understand enough about any characters (sometimes even Ellie) to even connect name to information about them. Ellie, for example, never developes a relationship of any depth with Palmor Joss. In fact, Joss is a very minor character in Sagan's version, a lesser religious figure opposed to the machine. Instead, she's in love with Der Herr (whoever that really is?) and has a live-in relationship with him.The machine has five people who go, not just Ellie.Even Hadden is different and far less important than he is in the movie.This would be okay if Sagan's work was well written and sound as a piece of fiction. But it's not. it's confusing, hard to follow, and just not very well constructed. The characters are flat and uninteresting.I found reading this book a chore.I gave it away to a used book store as soon as I finished reading it!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I can't believe all the 5 star reviews of this title. I've read a lot of books, and this is only the 2nd one I've found that had almost no redeeming qualities. The biggest problem I had were the charecters. Not once did I care what happened to any of them, and the spice girls have more depth. The idea behind the book was okay, incredibly overdone, but okay. Now if only the author had concentrated on that instead of spending 10 pages telling me about a religious debate. After the first 200 pages I realized it wasn't going to get any better, and the only thing that kept me reading was the fact that I wanted to know what the message said (and even then I had to start skipping pages at a time to make it through). All in all, this book sux."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"With all due respect for the late Mr Sagan, he might be a brilliant astronomer but he was definitely not a good story teller for several reasons:1. Throughout the book, there're plenty passages which are redundant & irrelevant to the story development. For example, I found that you can actually skip the whole Ch 10 (and Ch 17 too) without affecting the story development at all - which is not a good thing for a fiction.2. Perhaps also due to the above, the story movt is very slow. At times it gives me the feeling that the author does not know how the story should progress, so every other 2 or 3 pages, he repeated & recapitulated the then situation of the story.Actually the idea of the story was great, but sadly it's a waste for the idea has not been developed into an attractive story. I like the movie but not the book.PS for a debate of science vs religion, I would recommend \\"Angels & Demons\\" by Dan Brown. The outline of ideas & controversy is far clearer than \\"Contact\\"."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I didn't see the film but I read the book and was disappointed. Sagan's agent walked into his office and said &quot; You have to do a work of fiction.&quot; to which he replied &quot;I can do that, I'll just put a couple of characters into COSMOS!&quot; I am awed by the amount of 5 star reviews that are here. Sagan seemed to have overwhelming optimism that humans might one day explore the stars, after reading the reviews of this book, I can only conclude that if these are the same people who show interest in said exploration than perhaps the galaxy is better off having these slack-jawed troglodites gravity bound to their homeworld."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I was excited to learn that a reputable scientist, Carl Sagan, wrote a book about our first contact with extra-terrestrials. What would a respected scientist have to say on the subject? What would he think the aliens would be like? Unfortunately Carl Sagan didn't write the book I thought he wrote. We don't meet any aliens in this book. In order to make contact, it's not enough to just make contact with ourselves. Without spoiling the ending, I'll just say that the characters don't end up shaking hands with Bob Schultz from the planet Nebulus. What this book is about is the stubborn, corrupt stupidity of the scientific establishment and the cowardice of our space travelers who knuckle under pressure. It's a stupid book. It's about as satisfying as banging the top of your head against the inside of your car after you return the ice scraper to the glove compartment.

IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THE MOVIE!! :):)"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I read this book after I saw the movie. There were a lot of holes in the plot of the movie, I figured that it's a good idea to find out what's this all about.I finished the book in two days. It's a difficult book, with a lot of technical terms and jargons. But generally, it's a very good sci-fi book which stirs up your imagination. It encourages you to look at the sky at night and ponder about life.I am shocked by Sagan's knowledge about the history and culture of many other countries, like China, India, Nigeria, and former USSR. If you have read his Dragons of Eden, you will find that he knew a lot about evolution, animal behaviors and psychology too.Two problems exist though. He was not very good at dramatizing the important events, like the death of Drumlin, making the flow of story not very exciting. Another one was his use of love at the very end of the book, was that necessary?"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"OK... I read this book few weeks ago, and I didn't really like it. After reading all the reviews, i read it once more, and I still didn't get the idea.First of all, this book has nothing special. Have you ever read 2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke? The idea of Grand Central Station and extraterrestrial intelligence 'cultivating' civilization was already mentioned in 2001. The 'Machine' is just like the black monolith which transfers Dave Bowman to... somewhere. And the part when the alien (who disguised as Ellie's dad) talks about Beethoven and peace stuff, I couldn't help smiling. I think it is ridiculous and funny, or rather cute. And after all, why would the alien stay away from human being when the Five already visited them? To be honest, I think the whole story is a big HOAX. I didn't give one or two stars though, because I liked the last part. It was unlike other Science Fiction novels."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Carl writes a possible scenario for contact with beings in other galaxies, and the reactions of groups pro and con to such a contact. Being of fair mind as regards religion, race and sex, his characters are socially advanced for the mid 80's.The protagonist is a female astrologer who is the first to decipher messages from what seems to be outer space giving mankind the secrets to space travel. Aspects of the inevitable space trip are imaginative and interesting, as are the motives and suspicions of the earthlings.Carl shares his own investigation into the rhelms of religion, science, human relations and politics as he attempts to help us understand and examine ourselves.Although full of worthy philosophical questions and well written, the book takes the reader to the brink of something significant and then drops the subject. It's not difficult to read (quite admirable for an academic), and although it's examination of motives is stimulating, it tends to meander regarding a goal.His target might be for the reader to search and allow her/his imagination the freedom to find and evaluate truths... to consider the possibilities without prejudice.Maybe he did achieve a goal afterall."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I read Contact after seeing the film, and without a doubt, the book is leaps and bounds better. For one thing, the emphasis of the story is quite different. Rather than concentrating quite so much on the main character's beliefs and love interests, as the film tended to do, the book instead delves fairly well into how contact with an alien civilization might play out on a sociological level.For that matter, Contact also shows a balanced an forthright view of the battle between science and religion, and how the two are not mutually exclusive. On this point, it should also be noted that to interpret Sagan's writing in Contact as atheistic, as one reviewer here claims, is to have missed the point of a great deal of the book. Sagan's views as demonstrated by Contact and the characters he conjures in it are decidedly theistic in tone. Sagan makes it clear in several ways that the main character's strongest motive is a search for spirituality through scientific enlightenment. Also balanced against the main character's atheistic opinions are the opinions of several well-rounded characters for whom the spiritual and the scientific are complimentary and mutually reinforcing ideals. All in all, Sagan's treatment of the subject shows a high degree of sensitivity to the subtleties of spirituality, while also making it clear that extremists in any camp are dangerous and frequently irrational. Sagan's strongest criticisms in the book are reserved for the thoughtless, insensitive, and fanatical regardless of what their basic belief systems are.Also note that there are several major plot lines and characters found in the book that are wholly absent from the movie. Readers of the book are lucky though, as this difference is to their benefit. Sagan's characters are quite interesting and diverse, and the plot is much better, if a bit politically dated.I enjoyed reading Contact immensely. Those of a philosophical and analytical bent should get a kick out of the arguments between the characters and groups scattered throughout Contact.However, I'm not particularly enthused about the ending. I won't spoil it, but I will say that it's too obvious and strives too hard to reconcile science and spirituality.Contact was certainly worth reading however, and I wish Sagan had lived long enough to write more fiction."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"If you thought the movie was great, do yourself a giant favor and put this at the top of your reading list. Sagan's novel is light years better than its film counterpart.The writing, concepts, and characters are so wonderful I forgot this was Science Fiction I was reading. Even though I thought I knew the story from the movie (there are some big differences), I got wholly caught up in the excitement and possibilities. I really didn't want this one to end.An excellent touch presented by Sagan is the inclusion of quotations from a multitude of diverse sources at the beginning of each chapter. The persons and characters quoted are a well rounded group and really give a terrific perspective to the ideas presented in the novel.Perspective is what this novel is about. Though written more than 15 years ago, Contact is still very contemporary--especially during a time when it's difficult and even painful to see hope in our world. In this novel you can take delight again in being human. You come away feeling like a kid again.Highest accolades to this work--one of the best novels I've ever read."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"contact is one of my favorite movies. it has content, something lacking from most hollywood drivel. i figured, the universal rule is that the book is always better than the movie, so i should read the book. i was vastly dissapointed.the movie seemed to be more well thought out, have a more consistant theme, and have more parallelisms and symbolisms with respect to religion and science. there were differences on the order of detail, up to major plot changes, and in each and every case, i thought that the movie version was far superior.this is, without a doubt, a rare case where the movie is better."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Yeah, I saw the movie, that's why I read the book.This book runs at 431 pages, about 100 pages too long.

Who knows, maybe it was the most extremely anticlimactic ending ever. Anyone who hasn't seen the movie would be thinking: &quot;allright, we get to see the aliens now! What will it be? Magnificient cities? Strange cultures? Exotic creatures?&quot; No, no, and no. Let me give you a hint: it's a family reunion, yawn. The same reader might be thinking: &quot;Man, no one's gonna believe this one, but the aliens are smart enough to give some evidence, even if they are total jerks.&quot; No again. The closest we get to evidence is some sand. Aliens who have gained great technology developed throught the FREAKING SCIENTIFIC METHOD expect us to take this stuff on faith!And you gotta agree with the skeptics here. They even provided me with a few out-loud laughs when they read my mind on several occasions.Despite all its faults, though, there was some good stuff. The philosphy stuff was well done, if not emphasized enough. But hey, at least it wasn't movie (that's a whole different rant)."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I actually saw the movie before I read the book, so was partially biased through that experience, but in spite of it, I was enthralled by the sheer brilliance on display in Contact. A brilliant story, challenging, stimulating and tightly-written, it's speculative science fiction at it's very best."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This book is about the human race's first contact with extra terrestrials, in the form of a radio waves from space. If you have seen the movie, let it be known: it simply does not do the book justice. The book is above and beyond the movie in almost every way, although the movie itself wasn't too shabby. The story provokes a lot of thinking in the reader by making them wonder what would happen if something like this occurred, and by also having conflict between the characters and between their religious views. If you are at all interested in science fiction or SETI, then I suggest you read this book!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"While updating 'Anomaly at Fortune Lake,' I searched for classic first contact stories. Of course, Contact is known as one of the best, and I wasn't disappointed. The book's real world astronomy, with technology not overly exaggerated, will appeal to readers of all ages. If you're an avid amateur astronomer, like me, you must read this classic. Endings are always the toughest part to write (I struggle in my own books), and Sagan has stepped up to the challenge, with a firmer ending than in the movie-version of this book."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I am normally not a science fiction reader. I enjoy non fiction and rarely dabble in fiction but i had to make an exception for carl sagan. I read essentialy all his other works and decided i had to read this book and lets just say i was not disapointed. This is a must read for everyone, especially fans of sagan or astronomy. It is well written and has a gripping story. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Great book. After 20 years I keep on going back to my favorite passages. I've always had a \\"thing\\" about initial contacts,the value of \\"pi\\" and its place in the universe. Contact ties math, science, and science fiction all together. Like all critics, I could chop out at least 50 pages to quicken the pace."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Good book to pick up.What Carl has done here is an attempt to imagine what first contact with an alien civilization would be for Earth, but utilizing a background of science rather than science fiction. It's a look at how two civilizations, grown up in different systems with little if anything in common would communicate (spoilers: a long transmission utilizing prime numbers as they don't occur naturally in nature). He proceeds with all the relations to human civilization that such a transmission would bring about, in terms of religion, culture, social interaction, interaction between nations and politics, the economics of (spoiler: building a machine with blueprints that the aliens have transmitted), and the search for what it means to know that we are definitely not alone.It's deeper than I'm making it sound, of course.The style is definitely different than most novels, which may be a little odd, but it's worth it. Give it a read or watch the movie.

A very goodand imaginative work by a real Astrophysicist, man makes contact withaliens through SETI and build the device the aliens give them plans to sothat first contact can be achieved. The ending is not what you wouldthink, but is still very good. I would recommend this book to fans ofArthur C Clarke, as it is in the mold of 2001 and other books which portrayan alien culture as so advanced as to be beyond our understanding."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This novel for me was exactly what I was looking for in a Sci-Fi story. As other reviewers have mentioned, Carl Sagan does such an amazing job of extending from our current (well, his current...) time that the story becomes very believable. At times I had to remind myself that it was, after all, still a story I was reading, and not the present reality.The characters in the story were deep, and there were few characters introduced that the story did not build on extensively in some way. Relationships were well-developed, and earlier presumptions that I had about characters changed as the events of the story unfolded and roles were reversed. It was surprising to me how well this book was written, considering that the author was an physicist. It's almost sad for me that this was his only novel..I almost didn't buy this book, because I had seen the movie years ago, but I'm certainly glad that I did. Next in line for me is Cosmos, also by Sagan, which I'm hoping will be as rewarding of read as Contact was."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"The book arrived timely and was in decent condition for pre-owned.

Thanks :-)"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Another great book by Carl Sagan. I expected a great book by the Pulitzer Prize winner author of Cosmos... Carl Sagan ( see my review 5 stars) and I was not disappointed.As an amateur astronomer of 40 years I knew of the famous distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan. All of the basic astronomy used in this great Sci Fi I knew about but I know very little of Radio Astronomy. By reading this book I learned a few tidbits about Radio Astronomy. To me this book was fascinating.We see the central character Ellie Arroway growing up and eventually getting a PHD and becoming a world class astronomer in charge of a huge radio telescope... project Argus. Dr. Arroway leads a team and finds an ET signal originating from near the star Vega beaming to Earth. Project Argus receives a signal of prime numbers and then the The ETs beam back a radio signal received from us of Hitler and the Olympic games in the late 30s. Embedded in the signal is a message of instructions for us to build a 2 trillion dollar machine but there is problems getting the \\"primer\\" message to understand it. Eventually we get the \\"primer\\" and build the machine in the US, Russia and Japan. 5 people are selected to go into the machine ( Dr. Arroway is one of them) and using wormhole technology on double black holes are.....that's enough I wont ruin the book for you. Just to say the famous 5 are threatened to not say what they discovered and let the world think the machine did not work. But it did....! At the end of the book we learn the final message.Carl Sagan was a world class astronomer and scientist that also worked as part of the Viking Mars spacecraft team. One of the things I liked about Carl was his seemingly effortless way of making complex problems in astronomy and science understandable to the general public. That is a rare gift. Many times brilliant men/women can not write to the average laymen complex thoughts in a way for the less educated to understand. Carl was a master at this.This is excellent Sci Fi. Also some real Astronomy and some Radio Astronomy is used. The book reads very well. A fast read. The characters are well established and there is good interaction. As a novice to Radio Astronomy it was great learning a few very, very basic tidbits of Radio Astronomy.Also Contact was a major motion picture from Warner Brothers. I remember seeing the movie and liked it too. The book was just as good.5 stars for a very enjoyable book.Sadly Carl Sagan passed away in 1996. The world misses a great astronomer, scientist and a great man. Even though he never knew of me I considered Carl Sagan a friend who I respected very much."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I enjoyed the movie and thought I'd love the book but had so much trouble getting through it. Don't think I even read it all before trading it for another book."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I thought this book was excellent. Sagan does a wonderful job of predicting the reactions of various people --given their occupations, ideologies, worldviews, etc.---were contact with extraterrestrial civilizations ever to be made. Sagan's insight into Ellie's character is understandably, considering his own work as a scientist, apt and in depth --in my opinion.The debates between the scientists and ecclesiastics were something all too real for me, and I thought the interactions between different governments, and their marked suspicion of each other, was both appalling and accurate. One of the hallmarks of GOOD science fiction, in my opinion, is the ability to use real science within the story (of course the occasional divergence into the purely theoretical is sometimes necessary for things such as interstellar travel) and in this respect Sagan hits the mark head on. Definitely one of my favorite science fiction books, apart from the works of Adams and Asimov. I will be giving this book as a gift to a few choice friends."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This is an excellent book, both because it is so imaginative and so concrete. Carl Sagan's excellent science knowledge make the ideas plausible in a sci-fi kind of way. Where the book leaps up and excels is that it is so eerily close to what I could imagine happening in the real world, the government official are real, the talks, the deliberations, the project, and the reactions of people. If aliens contacted us tomorrow, this book would be the blueprint, there would be groups for it, groups against it, and groups willing to go to any length to thwart the meeting. If you have seen the movie, compare the end of the book to that of the movie, see who gets in the last &quot;blow&quot; science or religion. It is interesting to see how they differ. This is one of the most excellent books I have read."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I saw the movie Contact, and I wanted to read the book. Boy, this is a great book! Much more detail and plot than the move (no kidding right!). Once you start reading this book, you will not want to stop until you are done. It is not an overly technical book, but one everyone can read and enjoy... you may even learn something about science and space!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Contact is slow going at times, and the story wanders occasionally, but in the end you end up with an inspiring and alltogether magnificent novel."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This book was a terriffic read. I really enjoyed it. Although I am not generally a fan of Science-Fiction, I found this book amazingly realistic. However, the movie of this book was a big dissapointment. I found that the story was incredibly different in the movie, although the basics stayed the same. If you have seen the movie, then I suggest you read this, and be prepared for a pleasant surprise. In the copy I read, there were quotes relavent to the coming chapter on the page preceeding. This gave an extra depth to the story. I wasn't able to put the book down. This book is an amazing read for anyone who has looked up at the stars and has wondered if we are alone."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I read this book shortly after I saw the movie, just after completing my sophomore year in high school. The book went much more in depth than the movie; something that usually makes books better than the movies that are based on them; which is true in this case.If you can understand the complex math and science that is interwoven into the chapters (I didn't, but I read it anyway :) you'll probably enjoy it that much more. Otherwise I would have rated it five stars. A must for for the obsessive sci-fi reader (such as myself :)."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Normally, I don't read fiction, but when the author is Carl Sagan, I stand up and take notice. And Contact is well worth it to. What makes it even better is Sagan's accurate scientific detail that applies to the situation he is creating, although few people can appreciate this. Much like watching Star Trek, the scientific inaccuracies don't get in the way of a great series, but it sure would've enchanced it more!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Not only is this book appealing to science-fiction readers, it also stays true to the Sagan tradition of relaying True Scientific information to most anyone, be it the next Stephen Hawkins, or the average human."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I firmly belive there is intellegent life out there, and this book gave me the opportunity to experience the discovery long before it will likely actually happen. Being a scientist myself, I could appreciate Sagan's fine walk along science fact and fantasy and he leaves it believeable throughout. The ending is a final treat. What was espcially pleasing was that I read this book after visiting Aercibo and the VLSA referred to in the movie or book, and so had the atmosphere fresh in my mind."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This is one of those rare occasions where I actually liked the movie better than the book, though not by much. Most other times movies have been based on books, the movies have come across as complete trash - the plot not what it had been in the novel.

And for me at least, it did. Fortunately, the book rarely used complex technical terms and so was very easy to understand. I couldn't recommend a better science fiction book!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This book was written well (it wasn't breathtaking prose, but it was sturdy and understated.)about mortality and life.The plot is not merely about making contact with extraterrestrial beings, but emphasizes the relationship of humans between each other and the infinte quest to understand the mammoth question every person asks himself: &quot;why?&quot;. Alongside the factoids (which he manages to explain in a clear manner), he has woven a story of characters that we sympathize with and relate to. He intertwines religion and science, facts and faith to come upon an understanding that it is somehow connected to all of us and everything we know. The only drawback is that towards the end, there is a lot of scientific jargon, which can become a little tedious. But overall, this is not simply science fiction, it is a book on the human condition."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"People have always considered religion and science to be separate entities. However, &quot;Contact&quot; provides a tangible explanation to this subject which is usually thought to be highly esoteric.Ellie Arroway is a scientist, but also a person who needs faith. Throughout her life, she seemed to believe that fulfillment and significance lies in the beyond, that she will not be able to find it on Earth. However, though Arroway is firmly atheist, her experiences open her up to a totally new school of thought. She was reaching for something that had always been with her; she traveled only to realize that she could find fulfillment where she began, and in other people.It seems ironic that Ellie was a woman of science, but yet her search, her mission, was for enlighenment. For some, enlighenment comes from a book of religion. For Ellie, it came from science. Perhaps this is Sagan's theme: we are all searching for enlightenment, but we use different vehicles to find it.The novel is filled with beautiful symbolism, as well as realistic social, political, and economic predictions of what a journey such as that decribed in &quot;Contact&quot; would have in this world. It is purely Sagan; his philosophy is evident throughout the novel. I was taken by it; &quot;Contact&quot; is not a good read - it is an experience.- Sheila Bapat :-)"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"'Contact' is one of those rare gems which educate,entertain, postulate, and theorize, taking you along for the ride. It belongs to a genre that I have begun calling &quot;Science Faction&quot; - science fiction stories that are too real and almost possible; stories that could be plucked from the newspaper headlines of tomorrow or next week; authors like Michael Chrichton.'Contact' is about discovering a radio message from space and its effect on humanity. The science is thick but generally explained. Science and religion are played against each other, not as enemies attempting to destroy each other, but as opposite sides of the same coin and possibly not as different as people might think. It is a story of journey and discovery, of answering one of our most sought-after questions - 'Are we alone?' - and what happens when we are faced with the possibility of an answer - do we believe enough in ourselves to accept the answer, to respond to it, and to not fear the unknown?"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"For those who have ever pondered the question of life on other planets, or, who are pondering it now,read this book.It addresses many of the religious,scientific and philosophical concerns that one would have on the subject.Excellent"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Carl Sagan, one of the most renowned Authors of non-fiction, and probably the most famous astronomer ever, captivates and interests the reader immediately in his book Contact, his first and only fiction onus.

I've never been much of a Carl Sagan fan, but I am a fan of hard SF and I figured that an astronomer who was so dedicated to SETI would have an interesting take on first contact. I was right.

While much of Sagan's book now seems quite dated technologically, and bound up in the context of the late Cold War, it's still an entertaining read, and one that might lend encouragement to aspiring future scientists"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This book is among the best I have ever read! The story line starts immediately from birth of the lead character, Ellie Arroway, and ends with her realization of her true life. Throughout the novel, Sagan subtly satirizes government, humans, science, and, of course, religion.The way Sagan leads from one subject to another is amazing. He has a way with words that is unique in itself.Contact with Aliens that Earth receives &quot;the message&quot; from is questioned, and at the end, science is on the same questionable footing with religion. A richly developed book with not too exquisite details lets the reader flex his/her imagination to the fullest extent. The book is not about mere superficialities involved with aliens; it deals with personal struggles of an individual and the planet Earth"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"After reading this book, you will likely agree with Dr. Sagan that humanity has reached a turning point in its maturation. We, unlike other creatures, have the intelligence to choose our course. We have the technology to destroy ourselves -- or the technology to make &quot;contact.&quot;This book is very exciting and serves as a reasonably good introduction to the efforts of the SETI program. The book brings up questions about the nature of intellence, our place in the universe, and the nature of our possible brothers of intelligence in the universe. Since these questions are not yet answered conclusively, the book cannot hope to tell us the exact setting of the contact. So keep in mind that the &quot;findings&quot; of this book are not inevitable, and that they are not based upon any single and fully successful scientific study. But it does illustrate conclusively the depth and scope of those questions, and the fact that if and when contact occurs it will be wonderful in ways that most of us cannot currently imagine.On a slightly different note, with all of the problems facing mankind in the near future this book's message stands out as a beacon of hope. I highly recommend it to the open-minded reader."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"No one ever accused Sagan of being a poet, but his first novel did bag film rights, even if this was not his intention. It would have been a better read if written by Rev. Palmer Joss, more poetic, less dodecahedral. I read all Sagan's books back in the 80's, including this one, and almost attended Cornell just so I could take a few of his classes. So I saw the movie. Then I listened to the audiobook, then re-read the book. Of course the movie had to have romance between Ellie and Palmer, how else could you get a producer/studio interested? But Jodie Foster gave a standout performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. So too some of the special effects, which gave me shivers on several occasions: the opening, and especially Ellie's arrival at the window on &quot;the world.&quot; The Apollo astronauts gave similar accounts on seeing the Earth from afar. The big disappointment was Zemekis replacing Sagan's &quot;Ms. President&quot; with Bill Clinton. Maybe Zemekis will finally get his invite to a White House dinner. The book is scattered with science faqs which sometimes distract, but the story is original and prophetic. The audiobook is yet another feather in Foster's cap...and I wasn't even a Foster fan. The day of first contact will come eventually, and the then-inhabitants of Earth will react in all the ways Sagan imagined. Humanity will, for the first time, have to consider what it means to be only one of many. Does every galactic civilization have a savior who died for their sins? Would the Creator not leave us a message or clue, or is creation itself the proverbial 'watch on the beach,' the beauty of which cannot be accident? How does a government of a civilization a million years ahead of us function? Would such civilization have free-enterprise, or communism ? Would they even need business, government, or political parties ? If they squashed us like ants, would they feel any more remorse than we do stepping on a cockroach? On first read I found the ending odd if not disappointing, but the more I listened to the audiobook ending, and re-read his ending, the more I thought Carl's on to something. Humans want to know how (or why) the world began, but his aliens are more concerned about its future. This is infinitely more believable given a second look. When development eventually blots out the last green spot on earth, and politicians &amp; taxes destroy our last hope, we'll reflect fondly on our pale blue dot, and the naive if creative &amp; loving inhabitants who used to live there. Sagan's alien saw this good within us, and it was Carl's hope for mankind. This book is about more than its contents. It's about making us re-think everything that matters. And for that alone, it merits a 10, as did Carl Sagan's life. Earth is our cradle, but one doesn't remain in the cradle forever. Thanks, Carl, for all the years. We'll break out your book on first contact, drink champagne, and call you 'visionary' - if we too have the vision to make it that far."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Carl Sagan made a name for himself by making science, and astronomy in particular, more accessible to the general public through a series of books and, of course, his TV show, \\"Cosmos\\". In the mid eighties he decided to try his hand at science fiction, the end result being this book. His goal was to speculate on what a possible contact (hence the title) would be like from intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, and to the extent he sticks with this theme, his book makes for a highly engaging read. Unfortunately, he just couldn't resist going off on a number of different tangents, which is really too bad, since what he mostly does is reveal his own ignorance and prejudices as opposed to offering up enlightenment.What's best about this book? Well, as to be expected, the actual core story, which is, of course, about what happens when a project designed to detect signals from alien civilizations actually makes contact with one. Sagan, who in real life was a passionate supporter of the SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) Project, brings his expertise to bear, and the result is a thoughtful and imaginative take of how just such an encounter might occur. As the story begins, we are introduced to Dr. Eleanor Arroway, an expert on radio astronomy, as she and her team intercept and start to decode what is clearly a message from outer space. In due time the signal, which has multiple layers woven together, is translated, the result is a set of plans for a complex machine, the purpose of which is impossible to determine. After much international debate, the machine is built, and Arroway and four companions, noted scientists from around the globe, enter the completed machine, start it up, and are whisked of to some unknown portion of the galaxy to commune with the beings who sent the message. Giving credit where due, Sagan serves up a nice mixture of science, speculation, and mysticism as his tale unfolds.The problem, however, is Sagan simply can't leave well enough alone. As a science writer, Sagan excels, but as a novelist, he's got much to learn. With the exception of Arroway, most of the character development is poor and there are some rather odd plot developments, most notably a bizarre twist at the very end concerning Arroway's stepfather. But bad writing isn't the primary fault, hubris is. For some reason, people like Dr. Sagan, who are brilliant in one realm of human endeavour, begin to think themselves as experts in others in which they are actually quite clueless. This shows up in a number of spots in this book, but none more notable than his efforts to put religion in its place. Sagan himself is apparently an atheist, which is fine, but he devotes a rather large portion of the book to, for lack of a better term, shoving his views down our throat. He does this by having Arroway engage in a number of \\"debates\\" with a pair of preachers, which by itself wouldn't be bad, except that he resorts to the classic \\"straw man\\" tactic, which is to say, rigging the contest by having the opposition represented by easily refuted buffoons. In this case, the preachers are, for the most part, ignorant bible thumpers who spout clich&eacute;s about Creationism and other sundry topics, the end result being, of course, that Arroway (and, by extension, Sagan) comes across as sensible, rational, and enlightened while religion is shown mainly as a tool for exploiting people's fear and stupidity. It's one thing for Sagan to use a work of fiction to expound his opinions on religion, but at the very least he should have had the intellectual honesty to give the opposition a fair hearing. There are any number of learned theologians and religious scholars, rabbis, and so forth who could have been used as the basis for an intelligent argument in favor of religion, but Sagan probably didn't want to risk having to examine his own views too deeply for fear of finding that perhaps they weren't as infallible as he thinks.And that, in a nutshell, is my principal complaint. Sagan has always been an articulate advocate for science, and a passionate supporter of anything that adds to our knowledge and understanding of the universe. His experience as an astronomer and his work with SETI put him in a near perfect position to write a fictional account of a possible contact with extraterrestrial life, and that part of the book is thoroughly enjoyable. It's only when he ventures off onto other subjects, most notably, his obvious dislike of religion, that he starts to make a fool of himself. It was notable that, when a movie based on this book was made; they cut out most of the extraneous stuff and focused the central issue, the \\"Contact\\" with another civilization in the universe. This book is by no means bad, and contains quite a bit of thought provoking material, but to be perfectly blunt, if someone were to ask my recommendation, I'd suggest they see the movie instead."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"You think you have read the best of science fiction? Have you read 'Contact'? Then, you might want to think again. Sure, you'd have faithfully watched every episode of the X-files; perhaps even maintain a fan site for Mulder and Scully; watched every alien encounter movie from Strange Encounters and ET to Independence Day and War of the Worlds; you might even have SETI@home running on your system, and a record of Alien Invasion Week on your VHS. But, it takes a true scientific spirit to look at both the objective and the humanistic sides of a scientific endeavour, and Sagan shines there bright in the sky. Two thumbs up!His erudition is displayed unabashedly in the quotations at the beginning of every chapter; he ceaselessly opines on worldly problems throughout the book. Unlike the balderdash that people like Dan Brown et al. write, Sagan knows what he is writing about; his scientific pursuit does not defy logic; there is every reason to believe in the possiblity that the exact sequence of events might happen; and concludes with a brilliance, that might disappoint the arch skeptics and delight the agnostics. Unlike its contemporaries, Contact maintains the same pace of movement throughout the novel, and pays attention to little details to breathe an air of scented nuance.There are a few downsides to the novel - sometimes, the narrative, and the dialogue, becomes clich&eacute;d. Banal details about all the scientists could have been avoided, given that we know the protagonist well. And Sagan could have handled imagery much better. But, these are trivial compared to the scale and the ambition of the novel, and its unique attempt in provoking boundary-crossing and unifying thoughts. For that, Sagan deserves full credit.A word about the movie. In my opinion, it is better to watch the movie first )given the brilliant direction by Robert Zemeckis) and then turn to the novel, as the versions are drastically different. One who watches the movie after reading the novel will certainly feel disappointed. Given a choice, I would always recommend the novel."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"As most everyone agrees, the movie is never as good as the book. The better the book, the more disapointing the movie seems to be. Perhaps this is why it's my opinion that Contact movie is one of the worst adaptations of the book given all the changes made from the book to the movie. Spoilers to come. One of the key changes in the movie is Ellie's relationships - one of the key relationships in the book was her relationship with the preacher and the whole message of the book became acceptance between faith and science and even a bit of merging of the two. The movie radicallized both sides and made it about the battle between the faith and science - the book's point was entirely different. In the book, the clash led to acceptance, while in the movie the clash led to Ellie not being selected as the sole person to go (antoher change from the book, given that a team got to go in the book) and the first device being destroyed by religious extremists. While the destruction of one of the devices was in the book, there was an entirely different reason for it. So, all in all, given the content of the book, which I recommend, the movie was totally disappointing and diparts from the book to the extent rarely seen in recent years."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This book is one of the best novels of our time! Carl Sagan was such an extraordinary human being! I highly recommend this book to anyone! Especially if u have seen the movie, regardless whether u liked it or not. The book is, of course, very different, and, of course, much better than the movie (although the movie is pretty good too). It seems there are very few books like this one who manage to talk about all the big and important issues of our human race."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"My regrets that I watched the movie and then bought the book. I read the the first few chapters and was a little thrown off by the difference in Dr. Arroway's character. A few months later (book half read) I received the audio version as a late birthday present, and I was absolutley captivated by Jodie Foster's voice as she took me through the book. Without a doubt the book offers the reader something the movie just could not deliver. I would suggest reading the book first and then renting the DVD. It's fun to pull together the theatrical elements and the very philosphical points that Carl Sagan throws in there for the atheist and agnostic reader. Thought provoking and a very good read."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I chose to read this book for my book report in school. It has a captivating plot about science and religion intertwined in one story. Why can't religion and science be in the same book. I think religion proves science and science proves religion. Why can't God have created and follow the rules of science.The story had a great plot and had good meaning, but was bland and dull through one third of the book. Carl Sagan would go off for pages talking about things that are irrelevant to the story and disrupts the flow of the events.All in all, the \\"Contact\\" was good, but could be revised and be made into a more captivating and intriguing story."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"There are not a lot of books that I read from cover to cover without setting down for a break now and then. But this is one of them. I was enthralled with this book from word one and loved every word of it.If you have seen the movie, yes, there are some differences. Different good? Different bad? I don't know, I think some will like the book better and others the movie. I thought they were equally fantastic and told best by their medium of communication.The basic plot remains unchanged. Earth realizes that man is not alone when messages from Vega start appearing. Using the \\"language\\" of mathematics it is easy to tell that this is not random noise from the universe (an echo of the big bang maybe?) but a message from an intelligent life form from outer-space. And within the basic message is another message, instructions on how to build a machine. What does the machine do? How do Earthlings respond to the message? How does religion become effected by the messages and the realization that we are not alone?There are two wonderful things I really like about this story, both well portrayed in the movie and the book. The first is the message. If aliens were to communicate with us, how would they best do it. I love how easily Carl Sagan figures it out. We all have a common language no matter which corner of the universe you are from: mathematics. Everything is mathematics that people after the Renaissance could figure out... all that is required is a bit of technology to pick up the message. In the book, mathematics plays a bigger role especially at the end of the story when the aliens find a message within pi (you know, 3.1415....). Carl Sagan shares with us the message, which actually made me laugh. One because it was rather creative. But two because it probably isn't too far off of what Douglas Adams would have come up with. But I think it made the story interesting none-the-less.The second is how this story is shown from the points of view of many peoples. How would religion react? Government? The skeptics? The believers? Many reactions are shown by various groups and I appreciated the depth of characters that are in this book and even shown in the movie.If you are looking for a good read, pick this up. It isn't just a good story, it is also told very well by the author. If you liked the movie then you've most definitely got to give this book a go. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"It fascinates me to learn that this book was written by *the* Carl Sagan. I had seen the movie when it first came out, at a very early age, and one of the things my parents and other adults told me was how unrealistic it was. Despite their comments, I adored the movie.Imagine my surprise when years later, I learned that the book was written by him. Carl Sagan, for those of you who don't know, was extremely involved with the scientific community's search for extraterrestrial intelligence, including being one of 11 attendees at what is probably the first conference ever held on the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Another reviewer mentioned Drake's Equation, the equation that projects the possible number of advanced civilizations in the galaxy. What they didn't mention was that Sagan was actually present at that first conference when Drake's Equation was first unveiled and discussed, which is a fascinating story in itself.Please don't misunderstand me. Contact, at its core, is still a science-fiction novel. But its roots are a lot deeper in science than many believe."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I read this book after I saw the movie. OK, so it wasn't as good as the movie, but it was still pretty good. I liked it better when Ellie Arroway was alone instead of with a group. And Palmer Joss's character was more developed in the movie. But it has a space on my shelf, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in astronomy or physics."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"CONTACT is an incredible book. It isn't just your average sci-fi movie with little green men. It's a more realistic story line. Carl Sagan was a genius. He didn't just plain out attack religion, but was subtle and more reasonable. One thing that I especially enjoyed about the book was the way he divulges into true human nature, not the first time he has done so. the most interesting part is the part about pi, and how the discovery of something like that really could change the world. I just plain loved it."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Words are impoverished to adequately explain how I felt upon completion of this book by the late Carl Sagan. I was just stunned. While opinions will evidently vary when it comes to interpretting the meaning behind the work, for me it was obvious: the vaildation of experiential spirituality. Dr. Arroway, a hardcore and relentlessly critical scientific woman, has no room for unprovable experientialism, as seen when the tone was set between herself and theologian/philosopher Palmer Joss. Then upon returning from this epic journey to... somewhere... she finds herself on the very side she has scrutinized and criticized her entire life. She finds herself having experienced something that she cannot prove, and understands the frustration. But the book was about so many other things as well. It was also about necessary cooperation of religion and science for all mankind, and how we cannot have one while not the other. Both are equally important. Science serves to satisfy our questions of &quot;what&quot; while religion satisfies our questions of &quot;why,&quot; and the one can never hope to take the place of the other. Science can never answer &quot;why&quot; just as religion is inadequate for answering &quot;what.&quot; Although it is not in the novel, the line from Palmer Joss's book (as seen from the movie), &quot;Losing Faith,&quot; sums up what I am trying to say like I never could: &quot;The one thing that mankind truly desires---'meaning'---is the one thing that science can never offer.&quot;An exceptional work of science fiction, and Carl Sagan's greatest masterpiece."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"the bottom line is whether a book is an enjoyable read. Some think this book is 'hard' sci-fi but if you look closely it has as much fiction as any other book in the field. I enjoyed it and others that were the same and different: DUNE by Frank Herbert, 2001, HYPERION by Dan Simmons, AREA 51 by Doherty. Read them all for a spectrum of science fiction books."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"It's a rather romantic representation of science at it's current stage, but I think that's one of the things about Sagan's work that tends to draw in so many people. He's not afraid to dream, whilst still remaining rooted in science fact. It's an excellent delving into human nature on so many levels, as are his other works. The one scene in the book where Ellie is clutching the ground, and can &quot;feel&quot; the earth churning and spinning beneath her ... I can really identify with those sorts of things. It was amazingly touching, but perhaps not for a steadfast science-only type of person.All in all, I loved the book. I *thought* the movie was excellent, but it simply does not compare once you read the novel. This book is well worth the six or seven dollars it costs. It's a colourful book filled with fascinating descriptions and characters."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I first read this book a few weeks ago and I didn't really enjoy it... After reading all the reviews, I read the book once more and I didn't really get the point. I don't think this book is really scientific: too much about alien science was unexplained. This book also had some boring parts and some ridiculous characters... The worst thing about this book is the concept of the extraterrestrial intelligence... Have you ever read 2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke? The 'Machine' is just like the monolith which tranfers Dave Bowman to... And the idea of 'Grand Central Station' , and cultivating civilization is also mentioned in 2001. 2001 was written in 60s and this book was written much later... Now it is clear that who copied who... Finally, the alien being is so human like... It is ridiculous for an alien to talk about Beethoven (I might have mispelled it... They know too much about human being, and this fact makes them more unconvincing than powerful. ) The reason I gave this book 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 is because the last part of the story... It is quite touching..."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"In Contact, Carl Sagan deftly encompasses many facets of humanity. The reader picks up a mass of astrophysics effortlessly with Sagan's easy prose. The somewhat abstract concept of pi is explained and its significance as the universal constant is reveled at as the probable key to otherworldy contact. Other more earthly concepts are explored: secularity, adultery, love. When this book is finished, the reader has hopefully experienced a minor epiphany, as the wholly remote idea of the universe and its properties are boiled down into an engaging story. This book is a different body from the movie, but both stand alone as excellent works of science fiction."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I first read this book between the time when the movie was in theaters and when it came out on video. I never saw it in theaters, so I thought I'd read the book until it came out on video. Contact has to be the most intriguing story I have ever read. Those who criticize the ending are simply after too much action. The ending is probably one of the most thought out of any book I have read, and it leaves many questions for us to answer ourselves. Then I saw the movie. The movie is probably one of the worst pieces of garbage to come out this century. They brutalized the story line in so many ways. For instance, they cut the space travellers from 5 down to 1. This destroys a large portion of the interaction. They also left out the government conspiracy and the most interesting portion of the entire book, the secrets of pi. All in all, it is a great book, but a horrible movie."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"After seeing the movie Contact, which immediately became my favorite film ever, I was anxious to read the book, and it did not disappoint! Obviously the book &amp; the movie had to be different, but their differences were well-done, and each told a slightly different, though equally beautiful, story. Ellie Arroway was a well-written protagonist, finally a real woman, and written by a man! Impressive! As a spiritual person *and* a scientist, I knew there had to be a way to bring religion &amp; science togethe, and this book does it wonderfully. I loved that scientific Ellie was also an &quot;incurable romantic.&quot; Sagan does a good job in bringing Ellie's childhood thoughts back when she is an adult, and skillfully weaves poetry in with scientific prose."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Cheers for Sagan! Not only does this book emphasize the wonders of space exploration and the expansive universe, but he incorporates important and profound ideas pertaining to religion, love, faith, and skepticism, both religious and scientific. The blend he uses makes many enigmatic problems blossom. He analyzes religion for what it is: faith, and shows that not all things can be explained, as Ellie has found out. Ellie is a classic example of the scientific skeptic who yearns to understand and process everything. It is at the point that when her story is deemed incredulous that she realizes that faith in herself and the acceptence of a God who created the universe, is something only her eyes and those with her saw. This is what she has and it is this link that makes her believe with a passion similar to Palmer Joss. This book is perfect for people who are searching, not for answers, but for examples of faith and understanding and the consilience of them."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"As usual, Carl Sagan has proved that he is the master of science fiction. The book raises interesting questions about how we would react if we were to meet alien life. The theological and scientific debates are certainly thought provoking and I found myself thinking about a lot of these issues while reading the book. The heroine of the book, Elie Arroway witnesses a signal from outer space, which raises many controversies about this message undermining the importance of god and about aliens destroying our world. A must read for everyone interested in debating on theological and scientific topics relating to alien life."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I saw the movie and immediately got the book. Overall, the book is better. But I thought that the character of Ellie was weaker in the book. I thought Jodie Foster was great in the movie, but in the book, the character isn't very interesting. But the book is great anyways. Really recommend it."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Absolutely the best fiction book I have ever read. Carl Sagan was a master of science, and extending that knowledge to science fiction made it one of the best books ever written."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"HE CHALLENGES EVERY THOUGHT AND ANGLE POSSIBLE.

The way Sagan combines the hard science approach of radio-astronomy with social and religious relations is brilliant. This book is a must read for any one who enjoys challenging their beliefs"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Carl Sagan's Contact is truly the most masterful work of literary art published in the twentieth century. The novel, originally published in 1985, and the posthumously released film that followed in 1997 are among the most fascinating and moving stories of all time. Human words can hardly describe the emotions, sensations, and fascinations triggered by reading this gripping book. Even the most skeptic and cynical reader will be forever touched by this enchanting novel. It mesmerizes a reader like no other novel can.Contact is the only novel written by the late astronomer Carl Sagan. He should have written more. He was the only man in all the years of his study of science to boost anyone's interest in this fascinating field to the extent that he did. I also strongly recommend his many other books, including Cosmos, Comet, Broca's Brain, and Pale Blue Dot, just to name a few.Contact flawlessly debates and explains many prepossessing topics at once, all while telling a spellbinding story of the seemingly endless quest for truth. It is about the search for meaning and fidelity in our troubled lives. It gives us an answer to our questions about the constant battles between scientific proof and faith. Sagan predicts the future of the universe through this spectacular narrative. I'm happy with his answer."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I think this book is in several ways very similar to the Name of the Rose, by Umberto Eco, in that there is a very simple plotline inside which conflict of ideas takes place. It is truly a book about ideas. Additionally, Eco and Sagan use in my opinion the same brand of irony in that many of the characters show examples of vast ineptitude at their jobs. Unfortunately, I read the book only after seeing the movie (and I hold the movie as one of the finest ever made,) but I felt that the book did not live up to its vast potential as the basis of that movie. Both Forrest Gump and Contact focused on a central character, but were driven by auxillary characters; I don't feel that Sagan had fleshed out his characters nearly as well as they were delivered in the movie, which is unusual for a book/movie comparison. If you have seen the movie, I would reccommend the book *only if* you seek more depth on the science component of the story."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"A radio signal might be the common way many civilizations make &quot;contact&quot; in the universe. Just as we make a simple phone call to family and friends around the planet, opposed to getting in a plane or car, traveling hundreds of miles, just to say hello. Interstellar travel, although well theroized, at best reaches only a small percentage of light speed necessary for travel to be commonplace and practical. It would take thousands of years to travel between planets and systems outside our own. The reality is that Radio waves, already traveling at light speed, would be the first &quot;wave&quot; of intelligence signals detected in the COSMOS. This book opens up the possibility that we may not have the technology to build masssive starships right now, but we have been, for over 60 years, traveling to the stars at lightspeed through the simple medium of radio! Think about it! I don't know about the trasport/ship build in the story, but there are theories of wormholes in space. Maybe, through extreme dynamic physics and advanced radio technology, we could gain access to interstellar teleportation and transport ourselves into the universe as invisioned by Dr. Sagan...expand your mind..read this great book!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"In telling a story about first contact with extra-terrestrials, Sagan has managed to explore ideas about religion, politics, and science, without sacrificing character development, plot, or suspense. He engages the reader, not only in the life of the protagonist, but also in the exciting interplay of intellectual arguments. Contact is a book that asks the reader to examine his or her own assumptions and beliefs, and in doing so, the reader gains a better understanding of the book, and the world."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"CONTACT is a novel about the global reception of a message from space. Radio observatories around the world pick up the length-repeating signal and manage to piece the whole thing together. As the code is broken the signal is revealed to be visual. When put on a screen for the first time the scientists are treated to the image of Adolph Hitler. The images are from the German Olympics which were the subject of the first strong television signal broadcast.Underneath the picture data is more hidden data. This is eventually deciphered to be the blueprints of a device. As the world reacts to almost indisputable proof that we are not alone the device is built and a team is assembled to test it.Upon activation the scientists find themselves traveling at unimaginable speeds to a distant location. Each traveler is individually greeted in a form to make them comfortable. One is greeted by a deceased father. After glimpsing the almost miraculous peace of this civilization, the travelers return at the exact moment they departed and all of the records of the trip are blank. Everyone refuses to believe that there actually was a trip except the travelers themselves.While CONTACT starts out on a firm scientific basis that is gripping and well written, I found the novel as a whole to be disappointing. What starts as good hard-core science fiction quickly transforms into the account of what can only be called a religious experience. At least one bookstore actually shelved the book in the religion section. While I personally have no problem accepting both science and religion I felt that this book did a poor job of joining or reconciling the two. Despite my objections to the plotting I will recommend the book as it is quite well written."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"One of Carl Sagan's great interests was advanced alien civilizations and the possibility of contact with them. What I think he really wanted to do in this novel is convey some of the sense of wonder and even awe that we would experience if we did manage to contact someone. And he does this very well.But one aspect of the novel that I found a bit tedious was the romance between the lead characters Ellie and Palmer Joss. They just seemed to be such an unlikely match - she, a highly professional, intelligent intellectual, and he, a fundamentalist Christian. I understand that Sagan needed some dramatic tensions to help flesh-out the novel but it went on too long and strained my credulity. Likewise I was unimpressed with the ending where he has the aliens investigating the discovery of a hidden message in Pi - implying an intelligent designer/s of some sort. Whether this reflects his true beliefs or not I don't know but I hope it wasn't just an attempt to appeal to religious readers.Anyway, it was a great read, and I also like the movie with Jodie Foster playing the lead role. I'm very sad of course that there'll never be a sequel now."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Let me first say I'm not a &quot;reader&quot; by nature, so it's rare for me to say that I &quot;love&quot; a book. This book is deserving of the &quot;love&quot; label, because once it grabs your attention, it doesn't let go. I seem to have a short attention span usually, but Carl Sagan wrote a great novel that doesn't overtake the reader with too much scientific mumbo-jumbo. There is science stuff every once in awhile, but nothing that overpowers the reader -- it's VERY easy to understand.The story goes very in-depth with each character, but leaves just enough questions in the readers mind to keep up suspense. If you liked the movie, you'll like the book. If you hated the movie, you should read the book -- it explains SO much (they are very similar, excluding a couple things). Great book overall."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"It's important to not draw any conclusions about this book till you've finished it. So many questions are addressed, and so many different philosophical points of view presented, it's tempting to try to second-guess the author's own perspective on the question of extraterrestrial intelligence. Specifically, did Carl Sagan believe in God, or not? But he doesn't truly reveal himself till the last few pages. And it's worth the wait; the story's closing is very satisfying. One caveat: The book can get pretty bogged down in the development of too many characters. I myself only really cared about Ellie Arroway and Palmer Joss."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"A pioneering piece of literature written by one of the pre eminant physicysts of our time. I was very much impressed by the author's writing ability, considering his background of very much academic and scientific work.At last contact has been established with a foriegn life form, from a distant solar system. This book delves into how the earth as a whole might respond to a situation where everyone has to work together to achieve the desired goal. It also brings to light the classic, but somewhat sleepy struggle of scientific evolutionary principles versus literal interpretation of the Bible. Great dialogue and a wonderful array of perspectives make this book an adventurous and intriguing one to read. This book is well written, and gave me a real sense of the vastness and beauty found in our universe."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Definitely the most thought-provoking science-fiction novel I can remember. No, the movie was OK, but don't read this book because of the movie.Sure, if you like Matrix or Star Trek, just the sci-fi aspect of the story would blow you away. But here is more:If you want to know how to reconcile between Religion and Science, Carl Sagan offers such a good view on this ever-controversial topic, I can't help but feeling a subtle shift in my own fundamental philosophy after reading this book.Why are there so many Christians, Catholics, Islamics, Buddhists, or even athiests? You would find such distinction a bit ironic once you read &quot;Contact.&quot;Bravo, Carl Sagan!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"There's not really much I can say about this magnificant work other than I've read it close to fifteen times,and I read something new each time.Packed within the thrilling,brisk narrative are amazing passages in which characters argue-intelligently,insightfully-about all the philisophical,theological,and scientific ramafications of actually making contact with another life-from.Protaganist Ellie Arroway is obviously an alter-ego of Carl Sagan,as she shares the same passion for exploration and knowledge as he did.He was one of history's great thinkers,and his influence and boundless enthusiasm for the very fabric of our existance will be sorely missed.Anyway,like I said,there's not much I could say to elucidate this classic story any further,just suffice it to say that if you're a fan of a great read,and enjoy asking questions and actually THINKING about things,then this is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I have read numerous science fiction novels and this is by far the best I have ever found. I have read several of Carl Sagans other fact-based scientific books and am not surprised that he could make this story so believable. The story is based on radio astronomy and the SETI (search for extra-terrestrial intelligence) program.The main character, scientist Dr. Ellie Arroway, finally receives a radio message from space that turns out to be the instructions for building a machine. The story revolves around the machine and what happens when it is built and used. A truly gripping tale that will keep you spellbound till the end.This is the best science fiction tale ever written, Thanks Carl."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I am currently reading this book for the fifth time. It is one of the greatest books I have ever read. The characters are vivid, the ideas explored are profound. It is a positive book; it gives one hope for the future of this little planet. I would recommend it to absolutely everyone."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This book was shaping up to be a five star novel. I disliked the movie (which I saw first), but having read and enjoyed much of Sagan's non-fiction, I figured that it was the usual case of a good book being badly translated into movie form. There are definitely a lot of differences, and the book is far superior to the movie, but the same thing that I really hated in the movie is present in the book also.I can't be really specific with what I disliked about the story without giving everything away, especially since it is at the end of the novel. The problem is basically the reams of implausibility, with regards to both logic and science, that take place in the last 50 pages or so. Things just simply couldn't have worked out the way they did. There was too much evidence. I can't understand why Sagan would ruin an otherwise excellent novel with such a badly thought out ending, especially given the quality of all his other work.This is a mostly excellent novel, well written, and with some very thought-prevoking discussions in it, but the ending is simply unforgiveable."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"First let me say that unlike most who apparently have posted here I'm not going to talk about or rate the movie version of this novel. I'm also not going to base my rating on a comparison of the two.I found this book in the late 80's on a local bookstore shelf and decided it sounded interesting. I had actually read an excerpt, I reallized, several years before. The book laid out the &quot;BASIC&quot; themes of contention between fact and faith. Within this discourse the autor found a way to introduce the reader to some amazingly interesting characters. How easy it would have been to go heavy on the science and forget that you're writting about people. Sagan takes us into the &quot;soul&quot; of Dr. Arroway. Yes, her soul was the very thing that eventually drove her to each new accomplishment. The author lets us see that her mind was only the vehicle. This story is her story of discovery and because of that the ending is especially important. The story shows the frailty of the human species when mind and soul are at odds or simply not allowing the other to exist.Sagan goes to a great expense of the English language though to tell his story. Although I didn't count there seemed to be &quot;millions and millions&quot; of extra words thrown in needlessly. Alot of the science though was explained well enough for even me to grasp. I appreciate that. The storyline is well crafted and engaging. The characters are interesting and the book is still the second best novel I've ever read. I'm about to order it again.A MUST READ"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"read the book after seeing the movie 7 times. surprised how much better the movie's plot was. Sagan's vision of the aliens as bored galactic engineers was a real let down compared to the movies vision of the aliens as enlightened and spiritual. The whole treatment of the spiritual angle, though, is confused in both the movie and the book"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I would never have guessed that Sagan, a hardheaded, agnostic, scientific type would have in him a book with such a fine sense of character development and emotional pitch. Having read many of his nonfiction books, I was not surprised by the social and religious commentary, which I found to be both perceptive and very even-handed.The science was interesting -- particularly the mode of travel described -- and I found the use of messages buried in irrational numbers to be an imaginative concept that I've never seen before. As a sci-fi story, I would compare this favorably with some of Arthur C. Clarke's best work, including 2001 and Rendezvous With Rama, in terms of the scope and majesty of the universe he creates. My only problem with the story, in fact, is that it is a little bit too derivative of Clarke; the space/dimensional traveling sequence seems to be imitative of 2001, and there are other similarities to Clarke novels, such as Childhood's End, that were a little distracting (this is why Contact gets a 9, rather than the full 10 rating).Nonetheless, I found this a very moving story that has more genuine feeling in it than almost any S-F story I've read. This is a novel that is visionary and almost religious in its awe of the universe, and I only hope that the movie version coming out next month does it justice."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"He became so famous as an astronomer that it's easy to forget he was one heck of a fine wordsmith as well. Yes he was. You've watched six shows, at most, on PBS. Sesame Street, Are You Being Served, Monty Python's Flying Circus, The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy, Red Dwarf, and Cosmos with Carl Sagan. If you're brighter than me, throw in The McNeil-Lehrer Report or its sequel. But that's it.Why COSMOS? Well, if I type \\"billions and billions\\" in quotes, you hear his voice in your head. Yes you do. The man made astronomy interesting because he was a wordsmith.CONTACT is a novel by Carl Sagan. Copyright 1985, which works for me. I read it when it was new. Back in my security guard days, down in Tampa Florida. (Yo Bob!) I later saw the film, very well done, with Jodie Foster, but I can't remember it. One of the advantages of getting old.How does the book stand the test of time? So well that I'm gonna recommend you get it right now. Of course the science is spot on, since this is Carl Sagan. If we ever do hear from somebody not of this earth, this is how it'll happen. But that's a given. What's easy to forget is that Sagan gave us some very well-drawn characters from his world in an eminently readable style. And, as always, accessible science that makes you marvel at the possibilities. Keep in mind that I've probably never used the word \\"marvel\\" in a book or movie review before. I'm too old and jaded to marvel. But heck, I marveled.As if that weren't enough, he had so much fun predicting the future. This far down the road, we can see where he misfired, which was almost never. We can enjoy how accurate he often was. This is where he let his subtle humor roam free, and we can love him for his wit. These are the traits I didn't catch 20 years ago, because I was looking for aliens. Which he also delivers, somewhat, but I don't even care at this point. I just know I love this book."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"In the year 1999, one astronomer makes a discovery that would shake the very foundations of the world. Eleanor Arroway, a graduate of Harvard and California Technological University and a native of Wisconsin, would make such a discovery. Working in a radio telescope compound known as Argus, she searches the sky constantly, in hopes of receiving a message from a distant civilization. Dedicated to her work, she finally makes progress when one of her telescopes receives an overwhelmingly strong signal from a star named Vega. Looking at the screen of 1's and 0's, she discovers that it is a video clip of Adolf Hitler welcoming the world to the 1936 Olympics! After further studying this awkward transmission, she discovers that there is a message underneath the video clip. Quickly, the rest of the world joins in the effort to collect this message and hopefully decipher it. As the message continues, members of the Soviet Union make the discovery that the message may be a blueprint for the construction of a machine. This novel follows the life of Ellie Arroway during this fictional period of discovery. Playing a vital role in the construction of the Machine, she also becomes the representative of the United States to the alien race that sent them the Message. She always believed that there were other intelligent beings in the universe, and for the first time, she has her proof.I enjoyed this book. It was full of exciting \\"what-ifs.\\" Also, Carl Sagan did an excellent job with the character of Ellie, who was both extremely smart and very much human, unlike other genius characters in other stories that seem to be above everyone else. He gave all the characters deep emotions and backgrounds that kept me interested in the book. I would not recommend this book to those who cannot stand reading anything that isn't full of action. Though there are some exciting points in the book, I would not say it was full of action. Also, the language used in the book was highly scientific, and with my \\"junior in chemistry class\\" understanding of science, I could barley understand it. I did, however, have some idea of what was going on at all times. In short, I recommend this book for the open minded and the scientific, otherwise, I suggest staying away from it until you figure out what isomers, harmonic oscillators, and erbium dowels are."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"If you haven't yet read this novel by Carl Sagan, then immediately PUT DOWN what you are doing and start reading one of the greatest books I've ever read. In any case, you have probably seen the movie, which I thought was ok, but the book provides a much deeper and important experience. Let me just go through a few of the reasons I enjoyed this book so much.First, any book worth reading should be both entertaining and thought provoking, and hopefully at the end it will have changed or added to how you think about the universe and your life. Well, this book is undoubtably entertaining and is hard to put down, but more importantly there is much to learn and ruminate over within. Whether there is intelligent life out there in the universe is one of the most important unanswered questions left for humanity. Here Sagan explores the implications of finding an intelligent message: how it unites humanity for a common cause and how it changes our view of our place in the universe. On another level, Sagan's book is about one person's quest for meaning. Ellie Arroway travels across the galaxy to find answers, but in the end she finds even more surprising revelations from her step-father back on earth. On yet another level, there is the issue of religion in our society. The characters are very rich in Contact, and each voices their unique opinion on these issues. Here is a book that can be read many times over with new insights each time.Some highlights of this book are the great writing and dialogue as well as the depth of the characters - a rarity in a SF novel. Also, the science is very well presented. In particular, the chapter on Hadden's final departure is near perfect. Sagan also included many future predictions for 1999 and many of them hit quite close to home.There are a few downsides as well, but they don't really detract from the overall experience. One is Sagan's prediction of the continuing Cold War gets a little tiresome. Another is why would Hadden (who helped decipher the primer) choose to leave for space rather than waiting to see what happened to the crew? If he was really looking for immortality, wouldn't he be curious to see what the aliens had said?Finally it is interesting to realize that 1999 has come and gone and there has been no messages received by SETI. What would the implications be of Earth being the only planet in the universe with intelligent life? I recommend this great article if you are interested in reading more about this topic: http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/88aug/easterbr.htm.Go read Contact!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Carl Sagan was a wonder and this abridged audio version of Contact is the only version I've ever gone through. I saw the film, but never read any of his other books. I've since ordered them all. Amazing.Wow. I literally didn't want to get out of my car. As good as Jodie Foster was in the film, her audio read was remarkable. She really is as good as they get on screen and in my car stereo. Her talent was to convey the wonder of the book and make me care about the issues and she really delivers.If you are thinking about buying this, you won't regret it. The only regret you may feel is that Carl is now gone and there won't be any more of his wonderfully educating stories."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"CONTACT is a great book. The main character, Ellie, is a radio astronomer looking for extraterrestrial intelligence, and the result makes all heck break loose. She makes enemies, is betrayed, is double-crossed, yet manages to make some friends along the way. CONTACT is not only about aliens and space and technology, but a book which makes us realize just how tiny we are. Wonderfully crafted by Carl Sagan, creator of COSMOS; CONTACT feeds the dreamer in all of us. Or, depending on who you are and what you believe, the person just waiting for some proof."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I read the book Contact by Carl Sagan. It would probably be considered a science fiction book because it has a lot to do with space and \\"other forms of life\\". I gave it four stars because it was very interesting and it made me want to keep reading further and further. The main plot of Contact is about a doctor that works at a satellite monitoring station. She is always listening for sounds form outer space and comes up empty handed every time. Finally she gets her big break; she hears a loud heart-beat type sound coming from a distant star. Soon they start to receive sound and video waves. I will not go into anymore detail because it would make the book a lot less exciting to read and give away the ending if you knew anything more about the book. Overall, thought it was a great book and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who finds space and science interesting or who has a little bit of an imagination and curiosity about space."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I loved Sagan on TV and I loved Cosmos, but I didn't love Contact. Sagan is a great scientist but he's a pedestrian novelist. I'd call him a poor man's Michener. The characters in Contact are stereotyped and dull. Some sections lag such as the exposition of Ellie's childhood which, apart from being banal, was unreasonably long notwithstanding that it ties in with the ending. I also found the &quot;real science&quot; aspect -which other readers have said is the books strength -to be a little elementary and a little skimpy. Seems to me that Sagan spent a lot more time in musing on religion vs science than on the technology or the science of SETI (and he does this via too many unauthentic long speeches). All in all a great disappointment"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"The performances are excellent and the scenes memorable. Though the filmed version lacks the key points in Sagan's novel, Contact is one of the most realistic science fiction films ever produced with many real newscasters (almost too many, at times)lending their hands. Aside from its special effects and mysteries revealed, Contact presents a very believable story ofworldwide reactions to the discovery of life beyond.I strongly recommend the novel to anyone interested in this topic. Reading the book is well worth the time."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Think about it. What would the pope have to say? How would world leaders weigh in? This incredible book suggests what might happen. I've read the book twice and enjoyed every page.While the movie was also quite good, the storyline was changed to accommodate Matthew McConaughey. I imagined Palmer Joss to look and sound like Jerry Falwell. I have no doubt that Sagen wrote the novel with Falwell in mind -- though I doubt Falwell has tattoos.This book is so good that I enjoyed my second read as much as the first."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This is one of my all time favortie Sci-Fi books. The characters are three deminsional and believable, and their problems are. I'd almost call this book a cultural collage of society. There is everything from history, to religion, to politics, to science, to humanity crammed into this book. I also liked it because it seemed like the story could be going on now. (Besides that Russia was called the Soviet Union). it wasn't campy or futuristic like most Sci-Fi.The story is that Ellie Arroway finds messages from the planet Vega and the earth builds a machine to get to these aliens. But there is so much more. I couldn't possibly explain it all. I love the imagery of human feeling Sagan gives you, and also the science in it is very strong, since its written by Carl Sagan. Just read it!Also, if you've seen the movie, don't think you've seen it all. The movie only skimms the surface of this complex and enjoyable book. I mean, you couldn't possibly cram that much meaning into a hour and a half movie!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Before I read this book, I did not have just one, single favorite book. I had multitudes of favorites, and my favorite for the time was only determined by which book I had read the most recently.

I highly reccomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"The lead in was great. Good details, very interesting suspenseful story. I just thought the end was way too fast, almost if he said, enough of this - lets end it. I am looking for the second half of the story. The book was better then the movie."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Arguably, this is the greatest science-fiction book ever written. Nearly impossible to put down once you've picked it up, its blend of extremely plausible fiction and sociological prediction is, in my experience, unmatched. You will find when you read it, that you are swept away in how real it all seems.The movie is similar to the novel, but the ending is far better explained and more believable.Contact also provides a profound, soul-searching question to all of us, spiritually and scientifically, from the first chapter to the last awe-inspiring page."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Well, it's like this...I really enjoyed the book (so much better than the movie), I just think it ended abruptly. Otherwise, I would have given the full 5-star rating."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Definately the most awe inspiring novel I have ever read. The imagery given as I was dragged into the story by your words is just beautiful. I was caught up for weeks on your theories on how likely life is out there and I will forever be caught up in the mystery. Three cheers for the high master Carl Sagan! Thank you sir and you are correct. We Are Not Alone!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"There are few books that leave you with the disire to discuss life, the universe and everything and this is one of them. Thought provoking and engaging at the same time. The book has some flaws that the the film was able to repair (one of the few times I think a movie improved on an already great book) - the book has a tendency to be a little too technical and plods occasionally and the ending is slightly weak. But it's a facinating, well thought out tale by one of the greats of science and science fiction."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This book is pure magic. I very rarely read science fiction (I tend to think it's a genre best left to adolescent boys), but \\"Contact\\" is no mere adventure story. Rather, it's a soaring achievement of intellect and imagination -- and a love letter to the human race. So much better than the movie, which was already quite good. It's like the movie, squared."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Carl Sagan was Absolutely one of the greatest minds of out time. He was the only person so far that has expressed a complete understanding of both science and religion truly unambiguously, and with the most comprehensive, nevertheless beautiful poetic voice, a work finer than Cosmos. Sangan's insight in physics is no less that that of Feynman, Weinberg or Hawking; in addition, he may have explained the importance of Christianity to the world better than John Paul II."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Very good book but the movie is better"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Great book for all ages with a little scientific background. Carl Sagan explains that humans are not alone in this vast universe we occupy. In a few words, a must have book from a great man. The movie was great too."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"What a great way to explore the realms of science fiction! This novel evoked exciting and mystical thoughts in me about the burning question of are we alone in the universe? I enjoyed the part in which Ellie imagined another form of life existed on a certain star looking back at her. I also thought it was a nice twist that the return message from space was a film of Hitler delivering a speech. This book will stimulate the curiousity of those interested in space and the possibility of life on other planets. Keep reaching for those stars and you just may find the answers you've been looking for. Three,two,one,and contact!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"When I saw the movie Contact, I loved it. After reading the book, I say &quot;its good, but could been better.&quot; The development in both were very good, showing how scientists really are, but the movie do not tells us anything more than 'they are out there'. The book tells more than that. I was terribly dissapointed that a 3 hour movie could not present the impact that the contact had in Ellie. Leaving the movie behind, this book is great! You love and hate the characters and the story is told from a scientist perspective. It can't get more realistic. Beign a scientist I also see this book as an opportunity for non-scientists to feel how we work, and why things are done the way they are done. The conflicts between scientist and non-scientists in the book are seen everyday in real life."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I'm only a fourteen year old but belive me, you will not want to miss out in reading this book. I recived this book on a saturday and by monday night i had finished. I couldnt put this book down because of its great detail, immersive storyline and its overal realism. This book ignited an intrest i didnt know was there."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Like one other reviewer, I don't know what the two one-star raters saw or experienced. Maybe it was no monsters (except the traditional governmental bad guys.) I got the movie on a whim after ignoring it for years. What a shock--it was fantastic. I now own the movie and a hard-to-find hardbound copy of the book. What an experience. Read, watch and listen to the book, movie, and book on tape!!!!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I have just finished reading Contact and I have to say that it is spell-bounding. I'm only 13, and reading this book caused a few strange stare's from my classmates, but they were worth it it. This book is worth taking the time it takes to read, and comprehend, it."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"After having read everything Stephen King has ever put on paper, I got tired of horror and when I saw Contact, the movie, I immediatly wanted to read the book. But as the weeks went by, I totally forgot about it until I saw the movie again. Then I went straight to my library and got this brilliant piece of work and finished it within a week. It is absolutely brilliant!! My only wish is if Carl Sagan would still be alive so he could write another book that measures up to this one. This would definately be very high on the top of my &quot;destert-island book&quot; list. Read it!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"After reading the book and seeing the movie, I loved them both. The book was great and I only wish that more of it could have been included in the film. I had seen Cosmos, Carl Sagan's TV show, and it's great to see his ideas and views expressed in great piece of contemporary fiction. One of the few books that I can't help but read over and over."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"The movie was excellent. So that got me wanting to read the book. Bought it and started it right away. I was disappointed. I just read half the book cause Carl Sagan can't right worth anything! His idea was something I could never imagine it's just the way he wrote bore me and I quit reading it. I wanted to finish it to compare the ending to the movie but the guy just dragged me page after page and I couldn't stand it anymore. Go see the movie."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Scientific writer is like a chef who wants to put all the ingredients in one dish, and making it quite weird both in outlook and taste. Endless elaborations and repeats making the heroine look like Vega, shinning, bright yet distant exactly like a male Sagan himself. A novel should not read like a textbook. If the writer cannot achieve such basic requirement, he should write no-fiction to elaborate his billions, billions ideas with lot of clauses which never end. Showing off all the books you have read and all the concepts you have acquired in your lifetime were fine, but you should not put them in a novel, instead, you should jam them in non-fiction writings. This is the reason why the movie has to be completely changed and deformed in order to make it more seeable (readable), otherwise, the cinema would only hear lot of zzzzzzz snorings. At the end of the movie, on the lower right of the screen, a short note was shown: FOR CARL. It meant so well and so appropriately, since they finally made Carl Sagan's"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I think this is a three or four-star book. I have mixed sentiments. The first time I read it, I remember being impressed by the witty dialogue on the issue of religion and science, the reasons to doubt as opposed to the reason to believe. Religion and believe makes up an important theme of the book, and Sagan's insights (as expressed through the characters) are important and still useful. But in another sense, Sagan is merely substituting a more impersonal, science friendly religion for what he perceives to be an older-time worn formula for religion. His caricature of religion seems to omit that anyone could have a liberal sense of religion, and focuses mostly on the fundamentalist view. I just wish the book weren't so \\"chatty.\\" Honestly I think it could have been edited to be much shorter, more succinct. In a nutshell, I think there are important themes of religion and science here, and that it is a still a worthy read - if also a mildly flawed one."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Contact, by Carl Sagan, is overall a mediocre book. There are three parts in the novel. The first part, The Message, is mostly about Ellie, the main character's childhood and background. This is a very boring part in the book. It is basically a biography of Ellie. There is not really any reason for me to care. There is no action or suspense. There are no interesting concepts that would intrigue a reader. In fact, there is little science fiction in this part of the book. The only aspect of science fiction prevalent in part one of the novel is the fears, hopes and dreams of Ellie Arroway. That sounds interesting, doesn't it?The second part, The Machine, is mostly about the interpretation of the Message. Also this part includes the building of the machine. In this section of the book, it is still very boring. There is a pattern for the chapters in part two. The beginning of the chapter starts with an uninteresting concept or theme in math or science. The middle of the chapter expands on the concept or theme. The beginning and middle of the chapters are dull because of this. The only exciting parts in the chapters occur at the end. They introduce new interesting concepts. One example is the introduction of the idea of the Trojan horse theory. Someone suggests that the machine they are building is a way for the aliens to voyage to earth easily. The problem is that they do not expand on the concepts that I, the reader am interested in. Instead they waste most of each chapter on uninteresting dull concepts that my chemistry teacher would find boring.The third part, The Galaxy, is a very interesting part in the book. I could hardly put the book down. The main reason I liked the third part of the book was the abundance of science fiction. In this part of the book, Ellie and some other scientists are using the machine to travel to Vega. This part of the book deals with technology and perceptions of reality. In the third part of the book, they throw out many new concepts. One example is the \\"space subway\\". The machine that they build allows the people to travel to the center of the galaxy by using a galactic subway. The third part in the book introduces a lot of cool concepts like that. The main reason the third part was the best is because of all the action. There is not much action in the first two parts. In the third, the scientists travel to the center of the Galaxy and also have to prove to everyone that they are not lying. Perceptions of reality play a big role in the third part. People on earth do not believe the Scientists, because the voyage seems to only take the scientists 20 minutes. To the scientists, their adventure takes a day and 20 minutes. The third part of the book was fun to read.Overall, I think it is an okay book. It could have been better if the author had further developed the concepts that I found interesting."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"rating 3.5I have to admit that I enjoyed the movie. I think it is a quite provactive work, from anything more than a simplistic analysis anyway. That probably explains why it didn't make billions of dollars: it wasn't obvious enough nor had enough kill-em-all action.Anyway, the book. The main character Arroway is the same. However she is compelled by far different motivations in the book. She is also not hounded by Drumlin for pursuing a percieved marginal science such as SETI (reflects the time in which the book was written: 1985, when science, especially astronomy was still blessed with the charm to do pure research on the taxpayer dollar and follow such things as SETI- challenger hadn't crashed yet!). The movie obvious takes a different tack, reflecting the harsher realities of now: justifiable science, where dollars must produce results (whether this is right or wrong is never explored in the book, because it isn't an issue). This has skewed the movie in different direction, along with greater knowledge of physics.The book does develop the apprent conflict of science and religion as managified by the message (yes the psychology, philopsophy and the symbolism is reasonably obvious -&gt; more so in the book than movie). In fact this is something the book does delve deeply into. Possibly a little too deeply because it becomes a little preachy in an issue that all of us must decide for ourselves. I can respect however the need to develop this aspect of the story because christianity and science basically underpin (to an ever diminishing extent) western civilization. And provides fertile soil for the battle between them. Yet tangible and active zealotry on both sides is not explored to any great extent, particularly from the religious camp (unlike the movie).The actual physics of the machine and the journey aren't as strong as they could be (the machine, because we're not supposed to understand it anyway...however???). And the interpersonal relationships between the key characters are fairly restrained (reflecting reality). Also the decryption of the message could have been more interesting (compensated by the pi idea however).The main protagonist from the movie, Drumlin doesn't get much of a run here and whatever contact there is between him and Arroway is nothing like the movie. Nor is the backstabbing!I guess you could say that there is a grinding inevitability about the book. There isn't too much in the way of suspence because the plot, though arching and fluctuating like a dampened sine curve, never deviates that much from it's linear path and becomes more supressed toward the linear as the story progresses. It felt obvious at time. Inevitable. You just know what is going to happen (having seen the movie didn't help).I really wanted to like this book. And at times it was wonderful. But it also left me dissastisfied as well. I don't think it reached the heights or depths it could have. But this perhaps reflects the time it was written? However, if you're looking for a deeper version of the movie's plot...you won't get it. They are very dissimilar.Ultimately, I think you have to make a choice: either like the movie and the book or the book or the movie. Accept their differences and avoid comparing the two if you can, thereby enjoying both...if you can't, pick one of the other and completely avoid the one you didn't pick. And enjoy the one you did pick.Prose-wise the book is very well written."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I saw the movie first, which made the book a lot easier to visualize. Although, I would say the movie was better altogether than the book. The book seems a little too drawn out, especially in the end. At times, Sagan seems to drift off and get lost in some minute detail, and he'll spend an entire chapter on it. This may just seem like this to me since I saw the movie first, and it's relatively fast paced.Another thing I think the book lacked that the movie had, was the relationship developed between Ellie and Palmer. In the movie, they develope this love-hate relationship with each other, and in the end I thought they both learned a lot about each other through that. In the book this is almost completely nonexistant.Other than those little things, this book is awesome. It held my attention every time I picked it up. One good thing about reading the book after watching the movie is that you have a picture in your mind of Ellie going through wormholes and the magnificence of the machine itself. Then when you come across these scenes in the book, it's easier for me at least to understand and picture what's going on. Great book. The best depiction of First Contact ever!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This book arrived in a timely manner and was in excellent condition.

I read this book few weeks ago, and I didn't really like this book. After reading all the reviews, I read the book once more, and I still didn't get it. Basically, this book has nothing special. Have you ever read 2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke? The 'Machine' is just like the black monolith which transfers Dave Bowman to... somewhere. Also, the idea of Grand Central Station and extraterrestrial intelligence 'cultivating' the civilization was already mentioned in 2001. This book is not very scientific either: most of the science were written as if they make sense, but in fact only few ideas were explained. The part when the alien(who disguised as Ellie's dad) talks about Beethoven and peace stuff, I couldn't help smiling rather them being overwhelmed by the power of those aliens. It was ridiculous and childish. And why would the aliens want to stay away from us after the Five visited them? The reason I didn't give this book one or two stars is because I liked the finishing part. It was unlike many other science fiction books."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I have read this astounding scientific book by Carl Sagan Contact. It has left me a lot of good impressions about this book. This book is well written and well detailed for many people to read. This book goes over a lot of detail, compared with the movie that came out in the theaters. There are couples of passages in the book that I would like to discuss with everyone. They are as follows: \\"the search for extraterrestrial intelligence-everywhere abbreviated SETI, and except by those who talked somewhat more optimistically about communication with extraterrestrials intelligence (CETI)-was essentially an observing routine, the dull staple for which most of the facility had been built.\\" Page 49, last paragraph. This paragraph talks about the many types of organizations that are designed for searching for extraterrestrials. In the book Dr. Arroway seems to be very involved in keeping up to date from the sponsors of the program and to see that everything is going as scheduled. She's always trying reach for the things that would seem impossible from other people's perspective. One example would be that she always explores every opinion that he could find before she says that something would not work. My second passage: \\"No Ellie, this is endless. After dozen years you will find no sign of anything. You will argue that another Argue facility has to be built at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars in Australia or in Argentina to observe the southern sky. And when that fails, you'll talk about building some parabolic with a free flying feed in Earth orbit so you can get millimeter waves. You'll always be able to think of some kind of observation that hasn't been done. You'll always intent some explanation about why extraterrestrials like to broadcast where we haven't looked.\\" Page 47, 2nd paragraph. In this passage it got really interesting for me, because it went to the heart of the story and the goal that the character is trying to achieve by using more sophisticated and more up to date technology than before. In this passage she always looking for someway of improving her observation and never give up in the process no matter how slim the chances are. When Ellie was little girl she was every much interested in electronics, the functionality of different type radio, and also mathematics. As she grew up she got more and more interested in the career in radio astronomy. As she grew up and got her degree she started looking for a way to communicate with the Alien in the universe. The one thing that I like about this book was the strength of the character in the story, and her ability to push herself to the edge, and try every option that she could think of before going on to the next phase. For my final passage from the book, it talks about one of the most frequent conversation the Dr. Arroway has with the collogues at the work place: \\"there's a chance that dozen of additional dishes might be added to the Very Large Array, and make it into a dedicated SETI observatory. They'd do some of the usual kind of radio Astronomy also; of course, it would be a superb interferometer.\\" Page 50. 2nd paragraph. In this passage it talks about the project named SETI, and how it's developing among the scientific community. In this book it talks about the way SETI would help the community and be able to profit the research for scanning the skies for radio signal that some life form would be broadcasting to the other planets. In this story the word SETI comes up a lot and it represents the beginning research project in radio astronomy. I had a lot of fun reading this book and I was able to obtain a great amount of knowledge. I would recommend people reading this book, and especially to those people that have the academic level of high school and up, and are interested in astronomy. This book would be a book that you would never want to put down and want to continue reading page after page, chapter after chapter."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Despite being hailed as one of the greatest scientists (astrophysicist) who had dedicated his entire life to popularize science and humanitarian values Dr.Carl Sagan proved himself to be one of the most insightful story tellers as well in his one and only fiction work &quot;CONTACT&quot;! It was during my early teens I started reading Dr.Sagan;I started off with &quot;COSMOS&quot; followed by most of his available works. He has that uncanny knack of putting forth some of the most difficult concepts in the simplest language possible, such was his erudition and simplicity! Reading &quot;COSMOS&quot; after more than a decade was a totally different experience altogether because it is only then I happened to read the &quot;Dedication&quot; part. It read: &quot;In the immensity of time and the vastness of space it is my joy to dedicate a planet and an epoch with you&quot;. These words had a magical effect on me for, these simple words revealed the innermost recesses of a passionate man with a cosmic vision and Compassion unbound. Ever since that day I had always wondered what would it be like if he wrote fiction. He answered this question with &quot;CONTACT&quot;! Though it appears much like a science fiction novel, I consider it to be one of the most philosophical novels ever written exploring some of the vital facts of our existence with lot of autobiographical elements intertwined. While depicting the life of the Astrophysicist protagonist Dr.Elle who sacrificed a lot to pursue that which she thought to be of utmost scientific import and public concern, Dr.Sagan also speaks out with effortless ease the fierce inner conflicts at the emotional level of even the most undettered. Being the main scientist who initiated SETI, Dr.Sagan gives a clear account of the latest research in the field of Radio Astronomy and Planetary Studies around the world. Every chapter has a few header quotations, which helps the reader resonate with what follows. While looking for a message from outer space Dr.Sagan ferrets out that message from our inner space which all of us bypass in our mad race to survive..This echoes these words of T.S.Eliot:&quot; Where is the Life we have lost in living..?&quot;.Yes, all through her life Dr.Ellie was looking for a message from outer space, all through her life she was busy debunking the creation myths of others while remaining oblivious to the simplest message that &quot;FOR LITTLE BEINGS SUCH AS WE HUMANS ,THIS VASTNESS IS BERABLE ONLY THROUGH LOVE&quot; .It is here we find the perfect blend, a rare combination, of intellectual vibrancy and emotional sensitivity which brings forth the enlightening awareness of being Intellectually Sensitive!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This book is beautiful, stirring, and breathes life into science, religion and life in general.

I just finished re-reading this book and my thoughts aren't really settled yet. That happens every time I read it - the ending is so powerful and yet so simple, it inspires strong emotions.I guess the thing that gets me with \\"Contact\\" is that it works on so many levels. It's an adventure story (receiving a signal from space and the events that follow). It's a biographical account of an incredible woman (the main character). It's an interesting look at our recent past (the late 90s) from a 1985 perspective. It's an interesting comparison of religion vs science, written by a scientist who obviously was not ready to completely give up on religion.There are also a couple of messages that always hit me when I read this book.First, a common argument between science and religion is the age of the universe and the role of \\"God\\" in creating the universe. Various religions have their stories of how God created the Earth and the Heavens and human beings, etc. But what if \\"God\\" is actually responsible for creating billions of galaxies and planets and beings? What if the universe isn't a random collection of atoms and molecules...what if it really is all part of a plan so big that it really can't even be comprehended? Isn't that even more incredible than what's in the Bible or the Koran or the Tao Te Ching?And second, in a universe so vast, how can we - who are so small - make it through? How can we not be overcome by the galactic forces that are so powerful? By believing in the strongest galactic force of all - love.Probably not the messages you would expect in a science fiction book, but then, \\"Contact\\" is not your typical science fiction book. It's really a simple story of hope. And that's something we could all use more of."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Science fiction/fantasy written by someone who knows science is refreshing. Reminds me of Asimov. Or a more accessible Feynman. I mean that it the best way possible.The book touches on many subjects, including academic egos, technology, religion vs science, science vs government, government vs government. The book revolves around the means that some totally unthinkable culture might communicate a complex message. The latter was of course Sagan's passion and was the whole reason for the book.It also touches on issues such as Your Sneaky Government, sexuality, and sexual bias with a 70's academic slant (not in an in-your-face way however.)Basically, everything Sagan had to deal with is represented. He says the characters aren't real. I think he's lying :-DWhat happens in the book? Sometime in the mid-to-late 80s, a dedicated, brilliant, and somewhat boring radio-astromomer is Director of a radio astronomy facility. One of her dishes gets an interesting signal. Of course, things snowball. The novel finishes sometime in the beginning of the new millinium... That's all the spoilers you get!How did it read? Pretty good. The characters tend to be a very believable mix of pettiness, heroism, strength, brilliance, and quirkiness. Even the heroine has her share of issues.Recommended. While I rated it a 4, it was more of a 3 in a literary sense, but it is a _worthwhile_, thought-provoking book. It made me want more science and didn't give it. Sagan's such a tease."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"If you like science fiction that leans heavily on the fiction, then this novel is not for you. There are no Dragons of Pern or Swords of Shanarra. This is the real deal, and provides the most reasonably realistic way for the human race to receive communications, and ultimately, make physical contact with an extraterrestrial civilization. As for the review that put the pu pu on the last chapter...suggesting Sagan was throwing a bone to the religious...I say he was throwing a bone to the ultimate question any thinking being can ask...WHY IS THERE SOMETHING INSTEAD OF NOTHING?"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"The owner of my local sci-fi bookstore recently complained that science fiction has a bad name. If you write sci-fi in America, you're probably going to be stuck writing sci-fi for the rest of your life. It's why we see so few mainstream authors cross over into science fiction, and it's a shame. The problem, of course, is that too much sci-fi is written strictly to be fun reading. There's nothing wrong with this, but critics want more flesh in their reading. Some science fiction has that flesh, and it is upon such works that we science fiction fans must pin our hopes for any future acceptance of the genre as 'respectable' literature.Carl Sagan's Contact is without a doubt one of the best examples of this sort of work. The story is set in the near future, a 1999 envisioned from the mid-eighties. Its protagonist, Eleanor Arroway, is a brilliant young astronomer who has dedicated her career to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. When she finds it, the discovery changes her world in ways both radical and global, and personal and profound.The story's scope is grand. It discusses seriously the effect of the aliens' Message on the nations of the world, and also on the minds of mankind itself, which must now face the fact that it is not alone. Despite a few awkward digressions, Contact is masterfully written, engaging, and stocked with interesting and believable characters. The perhaps over-hashed subjects of &quot;man voyages to the stars&quot; and &quot;man meets slimy aliens&quot; are downplayed in favor of introspective considerations of &quot;man realizes the size of universe&quot; and &quot;man acknowledges the Other.&quot;Science fiction, like any genre, can and should produce fun reading. It is a joy, however, to find that it can also produce stimulating, thought-provoking reading. Fans and foes of sci-fi alike should read Contact and see the potential of the oft pooh-pooh-ed medium."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I saw the movie about a year ago, and I must say that this novel FAR surpassed my expectations. I expected it to be dry and a challenging read, and although there were some places that were dry and difficult to get through, the book as a whole was engaging and intriguing. Some of the science was over my head (physics? red shift?), but for the most part, Sagan breaks down the science into simple language that most people should be able to understand. Mostly, however, this book is an examination of the relationships between science, religion, and politics. Throughout the entire book, for example, Ellie runs into obstacles just being a female scientist. Then, when she stumbles upon the radio signal from Vega, she is chastised for not keeping it secret from other nations and asking other scientists, who are also unencumbered by political pettiness, for assistance. Thus, we have to wonder -- if we DID discover communication from another planet, would we ever manage to work together to answer the call, or would we still try to one-up other nations? Even more prominent -- and controversial -- is the discourse between faith and science. As someone who has long ago reconciled science and religion, this book is extraordinarily refreshing. Science and faith are not mutually exclusive, and everyone -- even people who fancy themselves \\"atheists\\" -- has faith in something. This book calls for theists not to cover their ears and shout \\"LA LA LA\\" in the face of scientific discovery, and for atheists not to shut themselves off from anything they may not be able to prove firsthand. Loved this book from start to finish, and will definitely read it again in the future."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"As a youngster, the vastness of the universe and the possibility of life beyond our planet fascinated me. That probably explains why, when as a teenager I first saw the movie adaptation of this book, I was moved greatly.A lonely young woman, who misses her father who passed when she was a child, devotes herself to the pursuit of making contact with life beyond our planet. That contact is made at the facility she manages, and the entire diplomatic and economic strength of the world is thrust behind the project to decode the Message and build the Machine. All of our conceited, egotistical superstitions, as well as our secular nationalist quarrels, are put aside as we are confronted with the reality that we are not alone.When our protagonist does makes contact, what does she learn? That there are others in the cosmos who have been here much longer than we have and are much more advanced, but do not have the answers to the fundamental questions that plague our shared existence. She learns that they have been looking for the same answers too, but in all their searching have found that what is really important is our connections with one another.Beautiful.While the film was able to be faithful to that central theme of the book, I think that the occasions of digression cheapen the message. Carl Sagan's written version is much, much more dynamic and ultimately intellectually and emotionally fulfilling.*Spoiler Warning*In the book there is no distracting romance between Dr. Arroway and Palmer Joss, the dialogue between the proponents of dogma and the proponents of science are much more interesting, there is no asinine suicide bomber sabotaging the Machine, the presence of the Five rather than simply Dr. Arroway adds to the concept of a shared human experience void of nationalistic identity, and in the end the \\"meaning of life\\" is something that Dr. Arroway ultimately learns rather than something she is simply told.*/Spoiler Warning*This is a fantastic book that I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of science fiction and has an overactive imagination regarding the cosmos and the possibility of life beyond our little planet. I had anticipated Sagan's literary style to be dry and unappealing and therefore delayed reading this novel, but I could not have been more pleasantly surprised. This book was for me a literal page turner."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"If you're expecting an alien shoot-em up, you will be disappointed. This is a novel that is extremely relevant to the times we live in. Though written in the 70's (with allusions to pre-internet and now seemingly archaic technology) it still has an impact on humanity as a whole with the dawn of a new millenium.The novel is about contact with life beyond our tiny little planet. However, rather than exploring the &quot;aliens&quot;, it explores us as human beings and as a unified global entity. Will we act as a whole unit working together harmoniously to achieve a common goal? or will our petty squabbles be our ruin? Will our prejudices and stereotypes prevail over our need to work together or can we survive and learn to put aside problems? Can we as a race survive the technological revolution occuring now as we speak? These are questions that Mr. Sagan explores through exploration of racism, religious fanaticism, sexism, and many -isms present in our our world.With a lot of detailed descriptions and hot debates that show both sides of every conflict, his novels presents what is quite relevant in our world today, namely how will we react if (or when) we find out we are really not alone, in a manner that makes one really think about our global society. Using his mastery over being able to explain to the every day Joe complex scientific ideas and making them interesting, Mr. Sagan opens the mind and spirit to the possibilities of what can quite literally happen in the near future. He ties together science, literature, religion, and philosophy into an exceptionally beautiful novel that delves into the very heart of human nature. More than highly recommended....10 stars and two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It really is first-rate science fiction, especially coming from a guy for whom writing science fiction wasn't his \\"day job\\", but I thought in some ways that it was an odd book for Carl Sagan to have written.Sagan never made any bones about his atheism, at least in a functional sense, but this is a very \\"religious\\" book. Consider the climax of the story (Spoiler Alert!) - five intrepid voyagers traverse the universe and meet the Caretakers, while to all outward appearances their capsule never left the ground and the mission failed. They can produce no tangible evidence of their journey except their own testimony regarding an experience shared only by the five of them. Moreover, their account of their journey, and of wise and powerful beings across the universe, is taken as evidence of psychological distress. Not terribly unlike a \\"conversion experience\\".Or, consider the Caretakers themselves - ultra-wise, deeply moral, all-knowing, and powerful enough to manipulate galaxies. They are not only super-intelligent, but also personal. You don't get to see them as they really are (you couldn't handle that), but only as they deem it best to show themselves. The impression slowly dawns that these alien beings are just . . . like . . . God.But we know that Carl Sagan had little use for ideas of God. Why, then, if God is a concept so unpalatable to Sagan's mind, does he find the idea of alien beings congenial - alien beings who are a pretty good first-order approximation of God? If he can't accept the idea of God, why CAN he contemplate aliens who have so many of the same attributes as God?Just curious.All that being said, this is very good science fiction - it speculates in some very interesting directions, and the \\"moral\\" at the end ('love is what makes our lives bearable') brings the book to a warm conclusion. I heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"After reading the book, seeing the movie and reading these reviews I can see there is an element of science vs religion. The book was great because Ellie wasn't as meak and intimidated as Jody Foster portrayed in the movie. Matt McCaunhey was just too quick in the movie with illogical retorts of how all the information she was receiving could have been God. I would guess Sagan needed to feel the need to appeal to the theist to educate them in their faulty logic. I did like the ending of the movie in that Jody Foster helped the next generation by telling the small group of children to keep looking for answers. The movie had an element of absolute farce, Ellie saw her Dad who was dead. The fact that time was an element did entertain me. We have created time and to see Elle travel through all those visions in a few seconds, leaves me wandering what if we could ultimately understand in outerspace. Though we hardly fathom time travel as factual, the intellectuals are working on making this a reality. I mean it's only been thirty years since we landed on the moon. Could you imagine telling your great-grandfather we will land on the moon? He would have said impossible. Luckily our tax dollars are being used to explore science projects despite all the opposition of people who think we are the center of the Universe. Sagan should be admired for his ability to make us think of what we can attain through space exploration. If I had to recommend one over the other, read the book."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"...Or to the heart of the human mind....?? This is indeed an excellent book which is worth reading a coupple of times to get all the details straight. There are so many neuances to it, and so many questions to think through. It differs from the movie, and that is probably why I didn't like it the first time I read it. I was also two years younger then, and I feel like I've gotten a much better perspective on things since then. I believe you have to be mature enough to read the entire book and not just skip the parts you find boring, to fully enjoy Contact.Carl Sagan has been critizised because he connected religion and science in the book. I think these people were very reigious, and couldn't handle that the two things may be compared to each other. Both come down to a search for something greater than ourselves, wether it is an omnipotent and omniscient god, the natural laws,or maybe something else out there..Even though Man considers himself the center of the Universe, we are indeed not more than an ant in the unimaginable vastness of space.....I would like to recommend this book to everybody, but particulary to those who feel lost, cut off, alone. Because you're not. The only thing that makes the emptiness bearable is each other....."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"First, since most readers who pick up the novel &quot;Contact&quot; will be comparing it with the movie &quot;Contact&quot;based upon this, Carl Sagan's stiff legged sci-fi romp, let us release the good news. Carl Sagan really DOES know how to treat a woman! Far from conveniently dead in the &quot;shades of Disney syndrome&quot; (see film version) our heroine Eleanor Arroways's mother is alive and communicative throughout most of &quot;Contact&quot;, providing her brilliant daughter with lots of pricks of conscience and many a petty annoyance. (Plus a next to the last page revelation that is both juicy and confusing.) Not only that, but Sagan 's U.S. President for the 'nineties is a political dynamo who happens to be female. The book therefore achieves a balance between the sexes missing up on the big screen. Sadly, Sagan is not gifted with the writing abillity to truly lead us into astronomer Arroway's world, so much of the book reads like a giant footnote--information we receive to help us catch up. I don't mean to quibble. I'm grateful Carl Sagan wrote &quot;Contact&quot;. It is, after all, 430 pages of a really fun idea - the whole world works together and five people get to see God tip his hand. Now, where do I go to post my movie review"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I get goosebumps every time when I think at the idea of this book!Carl Sagan (unlike it has been suggested here in other reviews) was trying to believe in God but he wanted some scientific proof of that, which of course would have made that science and not religion.Well, the end of the book comes up with an idea to reconcile the 2 seemingly opposite ideas!Only a person like Carl Sagan could have come up with something like that! Oh, and the movie! It does not even touch any of this area, so consider reading almost like a 'different' book."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Contact is not just an ordinary literary book, I've read Carl Sagan's books and Contact is the most touching of them all. I have seen the motion picture version of the novel, even though the two do not blend very well , the motion picture conveys the same message as the book does, science and religion's main objective is the search for truth, whether that truth was in a heavenly god, or the big bang and evolution, the two are not necessarily exclusive. I have cried after reading the book, Carl invites you to live in the life of the young scientist Ellen Arroway for which Jody Foster has perfected her role in Contact the movie. From a stubborn child to a pioneer scientist, every single plot is beautifully drafted. After reading the movie I felt that everything in the world is beautiful, but not everyone sees it. Read the novel, it is nostalgia to something this world misses."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"How would society and the individual react to the idea of another intelligent, advanced life form 'out there'? This is the question asked and answered by the late Dr. Sagan in his book 'Contact'.Through his protaganist's eyes Dr. Arroway, Sagan pushes the idea that science is the way to find answers for everything. Too bad though, that science is couched in jargon which fortunately Sagan explains well. Fortunately too, Arroway's character is interesting: intelligent, strong, with the prerequisite emotional baggage. Even though it shouldn't be brought up in a book review, the movie version with Jodie Foster as Arroway was a casting triumph. With Arroway's character supporting Sagan's thesis, the book just rises above the ordinary.Read the book to understand a man of science's philosophies and wishes, and note Sagan's debates between religion and science in the book, and you will find yourself subconsciously taking part in it. But this book cannot be a classic of contemporary fiction, because of the improper development of the drama within the plot."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Carl Sagan's only attempt at fiction has a fantastic premise, but the story is often overwhelmed, not just by the scientific terminology, but also by ham-handed characterization. The basics of the story are preserved for the movie, which eliminates much of Sagan's clutter (some will argue that the meat of the novel was lost, as well). Sagan struggles to find his narrative 'voice' here-perhaps understandable for a first time prose author, who almost certainly relied heavily on his co-author, both for the novel and screenplay.I saw the movie some years ago, and by comparison, I felt the story works much better onscreen, without the 'near future' setting(which had become contemporary by the time the movie was released), and less emphasis Bradburyesque 'advanced technolgy' that sounded outdated long ago. The de-emphasis of mathematics in the film made the story much easier to follow, if not as intellectually 'weighty'.The gist of the story is Ellie's voyage of discovery, and I feel this aspect works better in the movie, without the extraneous supporting characters seen here. Sagan tends to go off on tangents on both scientific and socio-political matters, which renders some sections very 'skippable', without really affecting the story. This is a bad sign for what should be a thought-provoking exploration of faith and the 'limits' of humanity and the universe. Instead, we're forced to endure needless verbiage as Sagan tells us the life story of each crew member in excruciatingly dull detail, simply so we'll understand who their loved ones were later on.Some of Sagan's attempts to have certain characters 'sound' like credible 'spokespeople' for the religious community are rather hollow, given Sagan's personal viewpoint on spiritual matters. He only partially succeeds in preventing his personal feelings from spoiling the story. Scholars of mathematics will no doubt find this more interesting than the average reader, or even the average science (or science fiction) buff. Too many segments read like digressions in scientific lectures, rather than plot or character development of a novel. Sagan gets carried away building and explaining the technology of the world beyond the story, and sometimes only grudgingly advances the plot.For those who disliked the movie-sorry, but I recommend that more highly than this book. I was a bit generous with the stars-but Jodie Foster and Robert Zemeckis' vision of 'Contact' has more to do with that than the original text does!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Although Sagan's novel wasn't bad, the movie was in fact better. Sagan tends to go off on a tangent for three chapters and goes into extraordinary amounts of detail about some things, and not nearly enough about others. The book seems to be even closer to how such an event would happen in real life than the movie, but to the point where it becomes tedious and boring at times. Character development in the movie was actually better. Read the book if you have the chance, definately go see the movie!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Most readers of science fiction are not interested in character development, or even plot. They are interested in Big Ideas. Contact has reasonably good character development and plot, especially coming from a scientist, not a professional sci-fi writer. But then, that's not what this book is about. If that's what you seek, read Hemingway, Steinbeck, or Proust.This book is about a Big Idea, and what a doozy it is--it will truly blow your mind. I first read Contact in high school in the '80s and spent several hours in a daze upon completing it. I recently re-read it, and had a similar reaction. The final pages contain the single most impressive Big Idea I've ever encountered in science fiction.After building a so-so story around &quot;meaning&quot; as it is perceived by the religious and the rational, Sagan proceeds to close the book with nothing short of a mathematical proof of the existence of God. The protagonist, after earlier demanding of religious leaders, &quot;Why would God make himself an article of faith? Why not reveal himself unequivocably in nature?&quot;, is finally given her proof. God wasn't hiding, it turns out. Mankind just wasn't smart enough yet to find Him deep within mathematics. With Intelligent Design proven, faith and reason are united, and mankind sets off on the next level of development.This is what good sci-fi is all about.Too bad it's fiction. A fitting final work for Sagan, a scientist who wished desperately to reconcile faith and reason.btw, the movie leaves the whole Big Idea out. Apparently the producers felt the mathematics would be over the audience's heads. Pity."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed hearing the late Carl Sagan's innermost aspirations lived out in the life of Ellie the radio astronomer. His descriptions of what might happen if a non random signal were received from elsewhere in the galaxy through a radio telescope inferring intelligent life as the source of the signal are creative and fascinating. The flight to a distant paradise-like world to meet god-like beings who are all knowing, all wise and good leads one to hope that such things exist. Carl Sagan's description of the multinational, years long, and no costs barred effort to decode and understand the message that turns out to be a blueprint for a complex machine is in fact occurring today! Truth is stranger than fiction. There is currently a collaborative effort over many years, by universities around the world costing millions of dollars to understand the message encoded within DNA which is the blueprint for the human body. The effort is justified because of the spin off benefits both medical and economic that will result.I sense that Contact reflects a aspiration to find God, to find purpose in life and fellowship in the universe. Just as the skeptics doubt the story the 5 travelers bring back of visiting the center of the galaxy and meeting other beings, so too many today find a purposeful message in the stars above or the cells within too incredible to believe. Just as the \\"machine\\" was built to transport people to its designers in space, so too our Designer desires to bring our souls to Himself through our earth bound bodies. \\"Yet in my flesh I shall see God\\"."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"WOW!!

In fact, I've read this book four times since then and it's sincerely the best science fiction I've ever read. I realize that religious and narrow-minded people may not wellcome Mr. Sagan's thoughts. This is quite understandable, since these fellows will hardly be capable of following the book till the end. There's lots of science and little fiction in &quot;Contact&quot; and even the most talented layman will eventualy be led astray. Well, that's life. Sometimes things get complicated. I've been expecting the movie version since I read this book but it was a bit disapointing. On the one hand, Jodie Foster, altough an excelent actress, is not Eleanor Arroway. On the other hand, the story is too complex to fit the big screen and what we saw was a mutilation. Other point is that even Mr. Sagan couldn't predict the fall of the comunism and Contact's soviets are here no more. Except for this and some other minor points the future depicted in &quot;Contact&quot; remains a viable one. The only thing that bother me is the Fermi Paradox: &quot;If life in galaxy is so widespread, where are they ?

Things that couldn't be used on the movie are available on the book.The ending, for example, is fantastic.

Try this, get out under the summer night sky with a flashlight and read this book. Vega is overhead most of the night and it feels like it is watching you.This book is not about aliens -- it is about how we see ourselves. Carl was underhanded in his writing because your ordinary moke would think it is supposed to be about his view of the future or some factual account. Only it wasn't. Carl wanted to make the reader think about their own life and humanity from a human perspective. I am a true believer that life exists in the Cosmos, but that is completely irrelevant to this book. It is an excellent account of humanity - our flaws (many as there are) AND our triumphs. It is unfair to Carl to subject it to literary or factual critique. What is fair to say is that it most assuredly will make you think. Carl will definitely be missed."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Carl Sagan captures your interest the moment the book begins, not with the science of it mind you, but with the main character, whom one automatically recognizes is a exceedingly gifted, and yet compassionate person. The book details her trials in life, including discrimination, death, and domestic family problems, as well as romance. Sagan of course has a healthy mix of technicality within the book, virtually all of of which is based in fact. Between the characters, which seem all to real, and the actual story line and discovery of extra-terrestrial life, this turned out to be my all time favorite book which has something for everyone to enjoy!

Then goes on to talk about such things like singularities, but brings us back to the rabbitts.I expected a message from E.T. to come from this book, but I admit from God I didn't.

My head tells me one thing, while my heart tells me another. I believe Ellie faced the same dilemna. Without giving away any of the plot, Ellie searches for answers about the eventual whereabouts of loved ones after they have passed from our Earth. Although the book has a lot of technical language (consider it a learning experience) it is well worth the read"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"..and this is from a guy who dropped out of first semester physics. I don't agree with the reviews that have made it sound like Sagan was trying to show off the breadth of his knowledge, or achieve some literary standing that remained out of his range. It was a rare pleasure to read a novel written by someone who expressed (and revived in me) the far-reaching curiosity I knew as a child and teenager.The novel did have a &quot;flat&quot;, restrained feel to it, similar to Sagan's nonfiction, but I felt that this was not inappropriate, given the context (it certainly did not read like a textbook--the reader who said that needs to see some textbooks!). There were some minor unnecessary features, but fewer than I have seen in other authors who turned the experiences of a prior career into a novel (recently I've read a lot of Grisham, for instance), and I wasn't bothered by them.I read the novel after seeing the movie, and recommend this sequence, since I enjoyed the book far more, and particularly because the third act of the book is significantly longer, more scientifically interesting, and more detailed than the one in the movie (although not having read the book beforehand, I enjoyed the movie's version). Although I enjoyed the entire book, the part involving Pi really won me over. I don't know if it was Sagan's idea, but it is the most original sci-fi concept I have read about in years (I haven't gotten a tingle like that for a long time, probably because I keep seeing the same ideas rehashed).He does have some of the same appeal as Crichton. While he is less skilled as a storyteller, he more than makes up for it by having such a well-performed climactic section of the book; he does not suffer from Crichton's typical pattern of amazing and thought provoking openings, an even stretch in the middle, and a formulaic, disappointing wrap-up."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I could tell you why I liked this book, but I think you really need to read it yourself to appreciate it. If you haven't seen the movie yet ---read the book first---!!! The book is a million million times better. A 'must-read' even for those who don't like Sci-Fi"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I'm no literary critic, so I cannot give a good criticism on the structure of the book. However, the book, at the very least, would be a gem for an aspiring wordsmith. It is lovely to see the English language used so eloquently. I sat for hours, with Contact in one hand and a good dictionary in the other.For me, the Message is what's important: Making contact within by making contact without, theology relating to science and science resonating with theology, politics as the ever-present reminder of the egocentrics on all sides. I hope this book moves my fellow readers as it moves me.Contact is a great gift from a great man"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I read the book and loved it, and I almost didn't see the movie because Contact seemed to me like the sort of book which would translate badly onto the screen. I didn't trust hollywood not to ruin one of my favourite books.Well, it wasn't ruined. I was annoyed by some things - for example, the sexual relationship between Ellie and Palmer Joss. Why can't they understand you don't need romance in every movie? In the book the ambiguous relationship between them was one of the best parts.But this is a review of the book, not the movie. I found it extremely readable, with believable characters and politics. But the best of it was the UNDERSTANDABLE science. So much hard sci-fi provides details you feel obliged to try to understand. I'm 17 and I quit science last year. But Sagan makes it easy for the ignorant to appreciate the science in the book.I think Sagan combined science, politics and religion better than any other scifi I've ever read. He doesn't push his point of view, but leaves the argument open.A very good book with a strong plot, interesting characters, emotion, visionary concepts and intelligent religious comment. Now we can believe in God the creator AND the Big Bang."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This book is wonderful. I would recommend it to anyone who has seen the movie, but beware the book does turn out different. This book keeps the reader involved and always wondering what is on the next page."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Reading this book in 1998, I found that many of Sagan's fictional premises have now entered into the realm of science fact. The idea that a supermassive black hole exists at the center of the galaxy has been confirmed by the Hubble Telescope. It's a shame that Sagan did not live to witness the findings, but CONTACT is a testament to his vision. I found that book was too long-winded, and could have been trimmed to half its length. The movie used only one pilot--Ellie--in the dodecahedron capsule rather than a whole team, and this seems to work better dramatically. Of course, the real treat of this novel is Sagan's treasure chest of technical knowledge, which he showers on the lay reader without condescension."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Carl Sagan's idea here is much more important than his technical expertise or writing style. Contact gives us the means to reflect on our loss of faith in a scientific world. It is not preachy, nor does it to try to make us Christians. The point is to recognize the greatness of the universe and the things we do NOT understand about it. Science will destroy humanity if it is applied arrogantly and ruthlessly enough. I also liked the perspective gained by reading Contact. Seeing the earth from afar makes us realize how ridiculous our wars and political boundaries are. I think people should read this book if they can. It is quite inspirational."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I enjoyed this book. It posed many interesting conflicts between science and religion. However I feel he did have a farily one sided view of the religion aspect of the storyline. It also presents the issue of goverment funding. Eventhough he does not come outright and say it in the text, it does make it clear through the character dioaloug and action that goverment funding is an issue. The movie does not give the book justice. However the movie was quite good."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I loved the book, but was a little bit disspointed with the ending."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"In Contact, Carl Sagan introduces all types of popluar genre and precludes scientific jargon while still maintaining a very technically backboned storyline.

The movie not even comment it."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This work is commendable, considering it was Sagan's first fictional effort (although pundits would argue Sagan science writings contained an abundance of fiction). The plot is believable, the characters are alive, and the science-oriented references give the story some added depth - especially for those who have some previous science knowledge. Religious issues are confronted by Sagan with great fervor, who isn't apprehensive about expressing his opinions. All in all, a solid science-fiction novel. This is one case, however, where the movie tops the book."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This is a wonderful book.

You are left to decide for yourself which has the most impact.A Wonderful book, I'm ready to read it again....."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"With so many science fiction books and movies screaming of vicious, drooling aliens and invasions it is a relief to know that some writers, such as the late Carl Sagan, are making intelligent comments about our relationship with the universe. The movie is excellent, but the book is even better. With a very different and more elaborative plot it is able to explore not only outer space but real human virtues"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Real Carl Sagan fans will already own the book. So what am I doing at Amazon? Well I think the book is at my parents house; and I want to reread it. I was raised on Carl Sagan and to see the 'Contact' movie was to bring me back to what I used to be. The movie will disappoint those seeking the latest special effect-ed aliens; but it will move those who as children dreamt of answering the big questions and/or traveling to the stars. Was I the only one who asked himself, &quot;If I could travel to a distant civilization at the speed of light never to return or to return to a charred, aged earth, would I go?&quot; and naively but seriously answer, &quot;yes&quot;? While one's ambition may still secretly long to represent one's planet, maturity (call it spiritual or moral maturity) includes an understanding that we aren't alone in the universe (even lacking aliens and lacking God) if we can share and communicate with other sentients, and these are the ones we love"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"While this book is in need of editing and is at times a much too explicit an advertisment for Mr. Sagan's scientific philosophy (read _The Demon Haunted World_), it is still a good book with a very well done ending. This is not science fiction in the traditional sence as much as it is a sort of a science novel, in the safe vein as Gregory Benford's _Timescape_ (which I enjoyed more than _Contact_). The other major problem with this work is that Sagan's forte is as a nonfiction writer and not as a novelist. So at times _Contact_ shrugs under the weight of too much wordless narration without dialogue. Many of his ideas are interesting but feel out of place in the novel, thrown in to boost the page count. Nevertheless, it's worth reading if you're a Carl Sagan fan or a fan of science fiction, but don't expect incredibly wonderful Arthur C. Clarke-esque things. There are better &quot;first contact&quot; novels out there, like Clarke's _Rendevous with Rama_ or _2001_ to name two of the best.I don't intend to see the movie, since a _lot_ of things from the book appear to have been changed"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This is not a simple science-fiction book, although to some it may seem so.

It teases all your emotions. So,what would happen in society in all parts of the world IF contact was made?, this is as real as your going to get in my opinion. I saw the film years ago and was upset by the ending but this book covers and goes over what really happened on that trip through the galaxy, and of course the novel is always better. What I got most from this read was an actual education, I learned more science in this book than in school(do they still teach science in school?),I finally understand Pi. Most worthy of what I got out of this book since I'm an Atheist myself was the discussions between characters about the interwoven arguments between science and religion. As well as what an entire world would go through mentally if a alien being was known to us. Fear,happiness,questioning faith,and a feeling that us humans are very very small, and how a world can come together in such a crisis or should I say 'such a moment in our history'.Sagan has a incredible style that is very well thought out and scientific, yet explains it to the reader in such an easy to understand way that like I said, is understood by the casual and hardcore reader. His character development is on point, with so many main characters its hard to fully understand their situations but Sagan had woven their origin perfectly and no character is felt as lackluster or incomplete. I had feelings for these people,loving and hating characters is a sign of great writing.I urge everyone to give this a try for you will learn something of the human race, religion, science, philosophy,and world government, economics and the lessons we need to learn if such a scenario did happen for REAL, the coming together as a species for the benefit of the world. A must read and I'm still thinking about this story days after I finished."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"While I have read hundreds of books, I can count one hand the books I have re-read. After recently watching the movie Contact again (one of my favorites!), I went to my library and grabbed the book (first edition) which I hadn't read since I originally bought it. I won't go into detail on the book because many other reviews have performed that function, but I did want to point out a couple of prescient things that Mr. Sagan wrote in the book which was published in 1985.At the start of chapter 8, Ellie is channel surfing and two shows are mentioned, Lifestyles of the Mass Murderers and You Bet Your Ass. Now, while Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous had been on TV a year or so prior to the publication of the book, I thought Mr. Sagan did a great job of predicting the popularity of reality shows and the fact that Ass is no longer a forbidden word on TV. In fact, Wikipedia tells me that there was a show on The Comedy Network in 2005 called You Bet Your Ass.In chapter 12 there is mention of \\"robot roving vehicles on Mars\\". While there had been two failed attempts to land rovers on Mars in 1971, it wasn't until 1997 that there was a successful landing. Given the success of the Spirit and Opportunity rovers, this comment struck me as much more apropos for 2009 than 1985. Good job Mr. Sagan!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I read this book several years ago. I still think it is the best sci-fi novel I have come across. Contact is the only novel Carl Sagan ever wrote. One of the most amusing and powerful plot points in this book was never included in the film version: it involved iterations of pi.I think that one of the other reviewers here is missing the point when he carps about Carl's atheism. It's not about God. We earthlings are way too hidebound by our petty, superstitious and in many ways self-destructive concepts and belief systems of God. This novel is about intelligence and the triumph of human intelligence as a key to communing with intelligence in the universe.Drake's equation indicates that there is a high probability of other intelligent life in the universe. The human species has only been around for a relatively brief time in the chronology of the universe. Scarcely a blip, actually. The presumption that we - who have only used our brains for barely 200,000 years, where most of our discovery has taken place in the last 50,000 years, with a concentration of technological achievement in the last 6000 years, where most strides have taken place in the secular societies of the last 200 years - would be superior to other intelligent life is absurd. LOL! We'll be lucky if we don't annihilate ourselves before we ever make contact.I understand that Carl had some big-time rows with the film studio; I guess it wasn't produced to his satisfaction. It would be interesting to get the details on that. Though the film was a powerful drama, the book still blows it away.Those who like science in their science fiction will be satisfied and entertained by Contact."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I recently re-read this book and was again impressed with Dr. Sagan's attention to detail and work. I am an astrophyscist and his work and research inspire many of us who deal in theoretical issues that this book deals with."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Few books will make your mind soar like this one can. Sagan's genius shows in this book again like it has in every other book he has written. What a wonderful book! It combines science, religion, philosophy, and literature. Each chapter begins with a wonderful quotation by some famous scholar or thinker.The most enjoyable part of the book is the debate between believers and atheists/agnostics. Definitely a very thought provoking book."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"The novel Contact by Carl Sagan was an excellent read. Carl Sagan tells the story of Eleanor Arroway's search for extraterrestrial life. The trials and tribulations that she goes through in order to reach her goal are amazing. After many long years of research, she is rewarded with a transmission that appears to be coming from near the star Vega. Ellie immediately begins decoding the message. Ellie's life is forever changed by her discovery of the transmission.Ellie has a rough time in becoming an astronomer and her life doesn't get any easier. Through college, she is the only girl in her glasses and is often made fun of by the other students. Following her graduation, she begins as an observer and works her way up to being the Head Supervisor of the Project Argus observatory in New Mexico. Fellow astronomers believe that the SETI project that Argus is focused is on is an extreme waste of time and money. Ellie must defend her position constantly. After Argus radio telescopes pick-up the transmission, Ellie is forced to deal with the constant nagging of government officials and religious leaders. Ellie never gives up on her search and continues it no matter what problems come up. The discovery of the Message spreads throughout the world and the decisions are no longer Ellie's to make. A great adventure begins that will leave the reader with a great desire to know what will happen next.This science-fiction novel is an excellent choice if one is interested in adventure and the struggles of a woman to have equal respect in the world. Although the novel is slightly jumpy at times, the adventure that the people must face is not too hard to understand. The novel also digs deep into the feelings and thoughts of Dr. Arroway. It allows the reader to understand Ellie's decisions while enjoying the novel. I strongly suggest that everyone read this novel and enjoy the adventure."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I would never have guessed that Sagan, a hardheaded, agnostic, scientific type would have in him a book with such a fine sense of character development and emotional pitch. Having read many of his nonfiction books, I was not surprised by the social and religious commentary, which I found to be both perceptive and very even-handed.The science was interesting -- particularly the mode of travel described -- and I found the use of messages buried in irrational numbers to be an imaginative concept that I've never seen before. As a sci-fi story, I would compare this favorably with some of Arthur C. Clarke's best work, including &quot;2001&quot; and &quot;Rendezvous With Rama,&quot; in terms of the scope and majesty of the universe he creates.My only problem with the story, in fact, is that it is a little bit too derivative of Clarke; the space/dimensional traveling sequence seems to be imitative of &quot;2001,&quot; and there are other similarities to Clarke novels, such as &quot;Childhood's End,&quot; that were a little distracting (that's why, on a scale of 1-10, Contact would get a 9, rather than the full 10 rating). Nonetheless, I found this a very moving story that has more genuine feeling in it than almost any S-F story I've read.This is a novel that is visionary and almost religious in its awe of the universe -- the movie was also enjoyable, but as is almost always the case, it can't capture the numinous feeling that the book has, despite a great performance from Jodie Foster.Don't let some of the religious nuts' reactions scare you away from this book -- it has more genuine spirituality in it than a whole room full of Baptists and 700 Club members."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"We meet Ellie Arroway as a child whose father dies. She marvels at the wonder of radio, notably the &quot;clear mathematical precision of radio waves.&quot; She becomes a radio astronomer, and in time joins, and even leads the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. The drama begins to heat up with the detection of a radio signal coming from the Vegan System. Questions abound. How can we capture this message 24/7? We need international cooperation.After deciphering many layers (good old mathematical precision), the message is clear; it is an instruction manual for building a device. Theories aboundoDoomsday Machine, Trojan Horse, Space Ship. Despite the outcry of the pessimists, two projects are funded and the unit is built in both the Americas and Asia. Both of them get destroyed.In the end, a Japanese parts supplier has been secretly building a third device on Hokkaido. Ellie is chosen for the crew.The international project to build the device becomes known as the &gt;Machindo Project&lt; and Machindo comes to be a byword for international cooperation. Besides various bureaucratic wheelings and dealings, religious zealots also take aim at the Machindo Project: They say &quot;If it is a message from the heavens then it's a message from God?&quot; This being so, many zealots reason, and many different responses arise.How Ellie rails against the imprecision of religion! For instance she determines there can be no God because so many people see God differently (Note-does that mean there is no George W Bush because many people see him differently?). She also considers that if there were a God, then man would know ALL even in the dawn-times of humanity.For those who've only seen the movie, the journey to meet the senders of the message is a bonus. Five passengers take the trip in the book vs. the one in the movie. And while each spacer believes they are gone for a week, in actual time only 20 minutes passes. The real fun begins when the machindo crew return to Earth. Each are individually cautioned by their countries to deny they ever took the trip! Their reports are dismissed in the crudest fashion. Once again, bureaucratic gamesmanship carries the day. Surreptitiously, Ellie continues to work on the information gained in her space flight. She redirects her Cray computer to work on transcendental numbers and finds THE TRUTH. No, Douglas Adams fans, the truth is not #42! If you like Contact in print, you can also see it rendered in movie and even an audio version narrated by Jodie Foster, who played Ellie in the Warner Brothers movie."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Contact is a story about how could be the first contact of humans with other intelligent beings in the universe. Although this is a very old theme, it is an entirely different book. As an astronomer, the author tried to be very realistic what yielded a story where everything is tied and where you will not find any contradictions. You will not only enjoy a very good and beautiful tale, but also will have a &quot;contact&quot; with real scientific worries and concepts related to the search of intelligent life in other planets. The book also touch in the conflicts between religion and science mixed inside all the story in a very balanced way: you would expect that Carl would only support the rational side in the book, but when you read, you will be awed and surprised (and will respect Carl still more).For those who saw the movie (that is an excellent movie, my favourite), the book has less untied knots, everything is clarified and has an end that the film has not. The end chapter of the book make you end your reading with a smile in your face.One final note, when Carl was researching to write the book, he contacted Kip Thorne to ask him about the possibility of interestellar travels through black holes. Inspired by Carl's question, Thorne developed the real physics concepts of travel through wornholes and, later, timetravel through them.If you like science fiction and science, read this book. Certainly this will be one of your favourites, if not the favourite itself."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Truly Carl Sagan's masterwork of fiction, &lt;u&gt;Contact&lt;/u&gt; somehow introduces several infinitely complex themes-- the conflict between science and religion, the awe-inspiring magnitude and complexity of the universe, and a plethora of political, social, and religious commentary-- and a great depth of information and analysis of each, yet remains entirely readable. A reader fortunate enough to read this book untainted by the terrible film version will find it both deeply provocative and thoughtfully entertaining; one less lucky must forget all that occurs on the screen before he can properly enjoy the book. Overall, &lt;u&gt;Contact&lt;/u&gt; is an amazing piece of work and one which I will happily read many times over."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"CONTACT begins with the greatest idea of them all--that somehow, someway and somewhere, life exists beyond the small blue world called Earth. It is in these moments of the beginning of this novel that a grand adventure begins to be spelled out. In that adventure rests none other than Doctor Eleanor Arroway, a woman whose intelligence and drive magnifies her far beyond those of her peers.It is one day, after an extremely-difficult line of work and a declaration that her SETI project will be shut down, that an unknown message begins to come from the Vega star in distant space--a message bearing, what appears to be, schematics for something far greater than anyone could ever possibly imagine.As a reader of speculative fiction, and a fan of the science-fiction genre as a whole, I jumped into this book with excitement shortly after viewing the movie adaptation that features Jodi Foster and Matthew McConaughey. Thinking that it would be vastly different than the original movie, I ventured forward believing that the book would be something different--something that, regardless of its genre's tenants, would absolutely blow me away. To say that I was underwhelmed would be an understatement, and for that I sadly have to say that I did not enjoy this book as much as I could have.With science-fiction, there is always a bridging line between the actual science and the fiction itself that can either make or break a book for a particular sub-sect of readers, mainly those who enjoy the idea of far-off worlds and alien civilizations but are not, in the least, intelligent enough to know specifics details about astronomy, radio waves and other technological jargon. Being a reader following into that sub-sect, I have to say that much of the time, I found the book doing just what it was I feel many science-fiction novels do in order to make up for the fact that there seems not to be enough \`science' and too much \`fiction'--mainly, of course, making the science much too heavy a role in the story. While I don't necessarily feel that this book lacked the essentials needed to make this a realistic story, I do feel as though the book (and its now deceased author) went to strong lengths in order to make this as set in stone as possible. For that alone I found myself cringing over three-page-long descriptions of certain scientific actions, theories and equations, and while that may have been beneficial to the story, I feel as though CONTACT could have done without so much of the science and more of the fiction itself.To say that the book is bad would be wrong. The writing is, at times, beautiful; eloquently strung together and written in a way that marks Sagan as someone who also, along with his astounding intelligence, had the ability to write. While reading certain passages, I found myself blown away at how they were strung together, worded, and ultimately assembled to create the overall mood of the science in the story. To say this is a smart book would be like comparing an apple to a seed, and while the scientific endeavors that line this book is great, I have to say that I felt little emotion connection to the characters--particularly Arroway, who, as our main character, should have had a stronger focus within the overall story--that dealt a huge blow to the fictional connection between reader and main character.While I would not recommend the novelization of CONTACT to most everyone, given its scientific-slant, I can honestly say that the writing itself is beautiful and, if only for a few chapters alone, should be given a chance. While I may have felt a bit disappointed with the novel, that doesn't mean others will follow my path."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Ever since the film came out it has remained my favorite of all movies and I watch it more times per year than any other in my collection. There is something uplifting and I end up being deeply moved by Dr. Arroway's testimony to a Congressional investigative panel. Her depiction of how we humans are both so small and insignificant when seen against the backdrop of the Universe, coupled as it is with how precious each and every life is....this gives me great comfort and I return to that sensibility like a warm blanket. Curiosity finally motivated me to get the book and it was quite easy to find a very inexpensive paperback. The book is a very quick read. As I read it I had the movie playing in my mind, chapter by chapter and the comparisons jolted me early in the book. In fact, as is known, there are two versions: the book version and the movie version and they are in many places so different that one can almost say that they are two stories instead of one. It reminds me of the various Leonora Overtures that Beethoven wrote for his one opera. As I read the book I kept asking myself, why did he not stick with this or that detail in the movie version? I considered the book version translated as is to the screen as a viable story and frankly I am perplexed as to what motivated Sagan to re-write the book version so thoroughly? Perhaps the director or the producers of the film pressured Sagan to re-work the material? In any case, the two versions are remarkably different in so many ways and if you have not seen the movie, some of my remarks here will be spoilers. For example, Palmer Joss is depicted in the book as being covered all over his body with tatooes and does not have a romantic affair with Dr. Arroway. Drumlin and Elie have a much closer and respectful relationship, Kitz wields much higher and very dramatic levels of power in the book and the President of the USA is a woman. Most strange of all are the depictions of the machine which had seats for 5 people and that 3 machines were built. These differences are only some of the many that one notices when comparing the book to the movie versions.About the book, I have read several Sagan books and I found his writing up to the usually high standards of creativity, style, drama and erudition. As a story I quite enjoyed it and I could not flip the pages fast enough....However, the premise of his astronomical theism as well as all SETI theology I have decided is completely insane. I do not understand how such a smart man as Sagan and all other SETI-ites can be so foolish as to believe, deeply believe, that sentient life elsewhere in our galaxy or in another galaxy would rely on the speed of light to transmit a beacon of information, greeting, data, etc. The distances between stars is known and is the most obvious limiting factor for two sentient civilizations to communicate with each other in a meaningful way. Despite this fact, known and understood clearly as it was by Sagan and the SETI gang, they still clung to the notion that it would be worthwhile listening in on the universe with the random chance that they might tune into an intelligent, unnatural wavelength. It beggars my imagination how sentient beings, stretched across the galaxies and universe, would communicate with one another if the only recourse is the speed of light. It makes zero sense on any level. Never mind how preposterous it would be for an advanced civilization to transmit the designs of a machine that could bore through time/space, even though it might take hundreds or millions of years for that information to go one way out into the ether. The way Sagan explains the motives of the Vegan's is for me ludicrous and when he starts talking about beings who can seed galaxies, then he really has entered the science fiction hall of mirrors and well, he can write just about anything, regardless of the sense of it.Sagan was a big believer in black holes and talked about them all the time. To this day though, they are not completely proven and even if there is circumstantial evidence of super powerful events happening around a star, there is no 'slam dunk' or 100% evidence that what is being observed is ONLY a black hole. He, like his colleagues even today, hold fast to this and many other beliefs in what is called the standard model of astro-physics. I have come to admire other versions of what is going on in stars and galaxies as explained by the Plasma Physics people. That Sagan toyed with the idea that the transport somehow or another involved itself with types of black holes is a predictable but silly idea that he was bound to come up with. The Einstein-Rosen bridge is a very interesting concept but alas, it still sits only as an idea that sounds more like science fiction than a reality that happens at any time in the universe on its own. Black holes or no, tunnelling through space and time might not be a natural event. Could it be so arranged for it to occur by artificial means, as described by Sagan as the machine? Who knows....that part of his story I liked the most.In summary, I really liked the book as a drama and story. I found the premise of listening to a remote signal a foolish idea. In my mind, if an advanced civilization wanted to reach out and CONTACT us they would certainly not send us a radio signal. They would get into their own device, (I imagine) punch a hole in space/time and come over for a visit. That Sagan spent his whole career downplaying and making fun of and lambasting all reports of UFO sightings as false is the biggest blemish on his legacy. His short sighted and tenacious clinging to the ludicrous notion that ET's would first send us a radio signal from millions of years ago never struck him as a futile notion. It is a foolish idea that is not based in logic. Though I quite liked the book, the film will still remain the favored version."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Politics, theology, and sci-fi possibilities abound in this book, blended together in a brilliant manner. Sagan develops his characters better than Arthur C. Clarke does, though that's not to say that Clarke's work is any less intriguing. But this book addresses the \\"what if\\"s quite adeptly, illustrating the classic attempt for some people to blend religion and scientific discovery (personally, I hate the idea of \\"guided evolution\\" myself, so I could relate to the protagonist's feelings of pure scientific discovery for its own sake; here, the discussion of whether life is out there and if it's truly more advanced and benevolent as we would expect is unanswered). Most of all, there's no happy, wonderful, flowery ending. Nor is there a bad one, but one that -like all of Sagan's works- leaves the reader thinking.At the end of a book, I want to ask the hard questions rather than have a forced discussion about what parts one enjoyed. This novel enables one to do exactly the former of the two: it sets up arguments, allows for critique and belief in the possibility that we really may be \\"it\\" out there, in spite of however much searching we may hope to accomplish. That's not an easy prospect, considering Sagan's \\"Cosmos\\" discusses the odds of discovering life and in which stages of development/advancement we'd find it; here, he lets us imagine that we may be the end of the road, and that the non-thinkers who tend to run our societies could end up ultimately lead to our ruination rather than let those who think out-of-the-box take the world by the hand and lead us forth. Hard stuff indeed. Great book, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I truly enjoyed the book--and would have enjoyed it more, I'm sure if I had not seen the movie first. So with that caveat, let me proceed....Sagan has truly done a good job of showing how it COULD happen. It makes sense...though at places it can drag just a bit. The large passage of time (the main part of the story takes place over 12 years) is not readily apparent to the reader. Is it weeks, months, a year, or years that have gone by?However, I give great credit to Sagan (of whom I was under the impression was an atheist, certainly an agnostic) for ultimately \\"playing fair\\" with religion. In multiple passages he uses his characters to skewer or belittle fundamental Christianity, yet he also displays respect (again, through his characters) for some very intelligent people who are thoughtful and practicing Christians.Ultimately, we find that the whole alien interaction serves as an analogy to religion. That is, things that are certain on the personal level cannot be \\"proven\\" to others' satisfaction. Deep truths and heartfelt emotions are looked upon with great skepticism by others. Just as Ellie, the main character, has done with religion.It leaves us wondering if perhaps our current religions came about the same way. Or perhaps that there are truths that are not accessible to all...except by believing the report of those who have experienced such things.And the fact that the \\"real\\" builders of the universe are unknown, even to the highly advanced civilizations of other worlds...well, that smacks of \\"God\\" in some shape or form.All in all, a wonderful read (though sometimes it gets a bit bogged down in technical arcana--but that may be because I saw the movie). I recommend it to skeptics and believers alike."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Contact is one of the most realistically written books of its kind. A young scientist finds a signal from outer space that appears to be the first \\"contact\\" with an extraterrestrial species. I won't give any \\"spoilers\\" but the story becomes very political, and dramatic as we see the way the Earth's governments and general population react to this unprecedented discovery. Everything that happens after the mysterious signal is discovered is very likely what \\"would actually\\" happen in modern day society. Sagan's writing style is special because he finds ways to give you a history and science lesson as he tells the story. But he does go into tangents quite a bit, for example he will go off topic to discuss Russian politics for and extended period, but it's still relevent to the overall story. The Movie is very similar, but the book of course has the wisdom of Sagan's tangents woven into it."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This was a great story. I am a science and astronomy buff so this was right up my ally. Sagan did a wonderful job and I love how he put an agnostic scientist in the place of not being able to prove the experience she had with aliens. I read this book years ago and when the movie came out I couldn't wait to see it. Sagan was a wonderful human being and tread lightly when it came to the beliefs of others."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Sagan was a very intelligent man and it shows in what he wrote about. Rarely do i see a movie i really like with the book being as good or vice versa. The different ending to the book is maybe more interesting than the movie but is more of a cerebral subject. Discussing pi in a movie and implications of it would not work as well but in a book, very interesting.I wonder how much this book has contributed to the explosion of books analyzing pi and its history?"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"\\"Contact\\" is, in my opinion, one of the best science fiction books written to date. Carl Sagan addresses one of the fundamental questions facing the world today...does life exist elsewhere in the Universe?Beyond the scope and inherent engaging elements of this question, \\"Contact\\" is so good for a number of other reasons as well: it is credible, the characters are interesting and engaging and the tone of the novel is one of suspense coupled with science education coupled with an undercurrent of what this all means for humankind.\\"Contact\\" is a great book for all readers, but especially good for readers with an interest in science and technology."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Although this science-fiction novel is different than the movie, it was an interesting and fascinating read. Contact, by Carl Sagan, is the story of a woman in search of extraterrestrial life. The main character, Ellie, encounters a transmission sent from the stars above and begins to decode the message. In the process of decrypting the message, Ellie is challenged by government officials, religious leaders, and personal feelings. While Ellie is allowed to finish deciphering the message, what it contains becomes a world issue causing world governments to take control of the project, and remove her from her position of supervisor. Although she is irate about the situation she has been put in, Ellie finds what she is looking for in the end.This intriguing novel is a great story whether one is interested in astronomy or not. It is filled with the search of extraterrestrial life, but more so with the life of a woman who is obsessed with the search of other existence in the universe. If given the opportunity to read this novel, one should not pass the chance, but take advantage of it."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Let me start with a few key points about the book, the movie, and the original screen treatment which precedes both.&quot;Contact&quot; (the film) is NOT an adaptation. Carl Sagan died in the midst of production, but up until that point, he was on the set working with actors, directors, and prior to that with writer James V. Hart every single day. Sagan and Druyan initially planned Contact as a film, but the idea was EXPANDED in the book. The book spans many, many years and has multiple perspectives. Although it would be possible to do the same with the medium of film (and in a select few instances, Zemeckis chooses this approach), it's a much riskier approach and, if you know your Contact history, not what Sagan and Druyan originally intended.The main theme (as evidenced by its placement in the book's resolution) in the book is Ellie's isolation. As for science and religion, it's less about conflict and more about faith: Sagan notes (as others have, though less eloquently) that faith is no less necessary for science than for religion.As for Ellie...brilliant! What's unique about Sagan's characterization of a woman in science is the exploration of her faults: her stubbornness, her self-absorption, her inability to truly connect, her own xenophobia...the list goes on. So few authors can present a character in a balanced manner without suggesting that she will somehow be punished for her humanity. In the end, the only judgment that comes to Ellie is her own--despite her self-absorption, Ellie has little sense of her SELF. All her confidence--all her strength--has roots that Ellie herself has been unwilling to recognize. The film does not, in my estimation, present Ellie as a &quot;sanctimonious whiner,&quot; but there are certain limitations of the medium, especially considering that the book is written with Ellie's THOUGHTS in mind while maintaining the distance of a 3rd person narrative. How do you bring what is on the inside out?To the reader who said he or she &quot;bought the book the next day and will never bother with another film adaptation of Sagan ever again (and will be hard pressed to justify seeing anything made by those who defiled Sagan in this movie),&quot; I remind you that Sagan was among those filmmakers. See the film. Read the book. Make up your own mind as to how you will treat them. That, after all, is the point."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I don't what those two 1 stars guys' beef was w/ contact, but REALLY! Either they were some sort of scientists, and were looking at it from a biased perspective, or avid fans of sci-fi, who don't accept a more realistic novel. I did see the movie before i read the book, and already loved the movie. SERIOUS sci-fi, with a heart, a relatively realistic situation, engaging topics, not to mention Ms.Foster's tremendous acting ability. (Or Matthew .M's good looks) I dove right into the book very eagerly. Expecting something wonderful, I was more impressed than I expected to be. This story, simply put, sweeps you away. And you'll most likely walk away from it extremely optimistic about the future of, well, us. WARNING! Please, please, please see the movie before you read the book, or else, i expect you'll probably hate the movie."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I read 'Cosmos' when I was a boy and I became a scientist(but, biologist). When I read the the Contact', I was so impressed with the book again. Real humanism and devotion for the science! What can I say more? I cannot express fully because I am a asian(Korean) but I recommend the book as well as movie(it's really rare case! Both are extremely excellent equally). I lost the book but couldn't buy another in Korea, so I will purchase one soon! A must!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Carl Sagan really belived that the universe was full of wonder and this book explores all that and much more. The people who search for alien civilizations in this novel also search for the meaning of life at the same time. Sagan has taken his rightful place alongside Arthur C. Clarke and Ray Bradbury as among the best contributors in both science and science fiction."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Although maybe a little too optimistic, &quot;Contact&quot; is one of the best books I have ever read. I saw the movie first (yes, I did like her going alone better) yet the book had a stronger message than it. Make sure you have patience when reading this- it's worth it. This book forces you to think, like it or not."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Killer Read... Sagan was just a bit too optimistic about how far technology would come in a short time, but I find this to be true of all near-future writers."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Dr. Sagan's book is an amazing experience that the film with Ms. Foster recaptured with extreme intensity.I wondered what else could be achieved on the audio version, and I found that a difficult symbiosis had been performed: Ms. Foster performance built an atmosphere with such force that all the scientific passion and humanity on the book surface harmoniously, and goes beyond the mere verbatim.Close your eyes and participate on the true galactic search..."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I did think it started out a little slow but once the message was recieved the book really took off. This is a beautiful story and Carl Sagan once again inspires me with his hopeful writing. His vision of the universe, shared with us, is a beautiful and optimistic one. The writing may be a little dry at times but the message is worth the wait. This book remains on my &quot;favorites&quot; shelf and on my list of books to recommend."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed many parts of this story. There was always some new unrevealed scientific finding from the signal, there was something that the scientists had to deduce and come up with a solution for. There was government involvement, there was private interests, all the things needed for a good book. The problem that I saw was that the character development lacked quite a bit. There was excellent explanation of certain scientific practices, and certain &quot;theoretical&quot; arguments between groups that would be interested in the well being of such a project, but I found that we have the characters, they solve problems or we have characters and they have a certain belief and it's changed by what happens within the story. Sagan is an excellent thinker, he knows the difference between polar modulation of radio frequencies and he knows that bits of information can be sent by the side to side motion of certain electromagnetic waves, but does that make a good story? I really don't believe so. Ellie the main character was a strong willed woman with ambition, and desire but she was merely some ambitious girl who I didn't feel the slightest bit of care whether her mission was completed or not. I feel the book really must be read to get the full meaning of what a paradox is created when religion and science are mixed together, but I feel that if you would like a story about dynamic characters who you feel a deep respect and hope their desires come true, I'd suggest the movie."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"We don't know for sure if there is life out there.But we know for sure that we are intelligent beings and Carl Sagan used not only his amazing intelligence but also his vivid imagination to create a story about the greatest moment in human history: the encounter between humans and extraterrestrials.Unlike any other science fiction book this has a story that is not only very believable, but also very touching, making us feel a part of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.With this book, the reader really makes a voyage to the stars. Carl Sagan will never die."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I love this book. The movie was fantastic, but the book is better. I'm not going to explain to story to you because there are lots of people who have already done that here. I'm simply going to give it my highest rating and let you read it to discover why."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I agree that this novel was creative . . . for a non-fiction writer. It provided an excellent basis for one of the best movies I've seen of late. I am definitely not a conformist, however, and I don't regret to say that when Mr. Sagan presented his opinions of the different factions of life, he didn't consider a valid arguement: that science and religion are inherently inseperable. The novel is presented like a prolonged debate between the theological line of thinking and the equally unlimited world of the scientific reality. It is essentially an arguement, although it appears to be passive. The characters in the novel exemplify the limitations of both lines of thinking by not allowing them to intermingle. It places a stone wall where maybe none is needed. Yeah, the book makes you think, as you can tell by my comments, but by no means does it represent existance as it likely is, only a few ideas of what it could be."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Many are the people who, for some existential reason, seem to find peace, or an ideal environment for contemplation, while gazing upwards on a clear night. So vast, so unknown, yet, as far as we know, so, so empty. It just boggles the mind that there can be such a waste of space. Not surprising that such a vacuum has drawn a whole lot of fictitious accounts to fill it up. Carl Sagan's foray into fiction, CONTACT is, truth be told, a rather enjoyable contribution to that library, giving us a very readable story about mankind's first encounter with an alien species.One big reason that CONTACT works is that Sagan interweaves several elements at once. Unlike many genre books (and I think especially sci fi) Sagan does not focus so heavily on the fantastical storyline that character development gets short thrift. The story of man's first encounter with the little green men converges nicely with character development, with neither really overshadowing the other.The same is true for the scientific features of CONTACT. Not so dense as to be beyond the average lay reader, not so sophomoric as to flunk the giggle test, Sagan presents enough science here to live up to the 'science' part of the fiction, but avoids laying it on too thick. Most people with enough intellectual curiosity to pick this novel up should have what it takes to 'get it' and not wind up all befuddled (and I say this as a non-scientist).Sagan does, unfortunately, throw in some social criticism that does not hold up very well and which can come off as a tad condescending. Several mentions are made comparing the advanced civilization and knowledge of the aliens to our own. No surprise ours is paltry by comparison. Yet Sagan includes man's economic systems in with such comparisons. But economics, unlike mathematics, physics, etc. is a social science, based upon the psychology of humans. Comparisons on this point fall flat and remind one of those 'which one doesn't belong' types of assessment tests.Although not overtly hostile to religion, Sagan does portray it as buffoonish, and, like many scientists, attempts to portray the religious as antagonistic to science. Although this stereotype may have a kernel of truth, it is, to a large extent, false and an example of people (in this case scientists) believing their own propoganda about others. Again, though, it's not so heavy handed as to sideline the story.In terms of genre fiction, I usually prefer crime stories to sci fi. But a simple truth holds for both - there is an awful lot of poor writing, two-dimensional characters, and stories so ridiculous that it makes one's eyes roll of their own volition. Separating the wheat from the chaff is a task unto itself, but CONTACT makes the cut."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This book was a great treat for me. I have always viewed Carl Sagan with much respect. There is-I believe-no one better qualified who could bring to reality this idea of \\"contact.\\" Carl Sagan filled his book with such details that made the idea of extraterrestrial contact seem-for once-plausible. He brought his knowledge and wisdom, as seen in Cosmos, to this novel to make it extraordinarily realistic. But it wasn't only his great detail of scientific facts that made the story seem rational; it was also his painstaking detailed descriptions of the lives of all the characters. I don't believe his only message in this novel was that of \\"contact\\"; he had many other messages especially in the intercalary chapters and flashbacks. Contact is an extended parable in a sense; Carl Sagan had much to teach us in both philosophical aspects and in individual and societal thinking. Another facet that made this book an incredible read, were all the quotes at the beginning of each chapter and each part; it makes the reader think more into the story. Carl Sagan's writing style also was attractive. His style of writing is uncommon and makes the read easier. The underlying but prominent theme of Contact is knowledge is power. Carl Sagan knew this very well and he tells us to acknowledge everything in this world and if we do so, we will find the truth."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I absolutely loved Carl Sagan's novel. The movie did absolutely nothing for me. The novel speaks to you on so many levels. It is the true Sagan speaking. From his feelings on contemporary political agendas, to his thoughts on religion, Sagan gives his readers an insightful look into the issues of the modern world. I think what disappoints most readers of this book is that Contact is not only about &quot;contact&quot;. The movie may have been, but the novel is not. I think that this is what makes it outstanding novel. The movie was made so that fourth graders would have no problem understanding the complexities of contacting an alien race. The novel was NOT created for fourth graders. It was created for intelligent adults who are able to gain insights from something other than television. I was not disappointed by Contact. It lived up to my expectations completely. I loved the ending and can admit to crying (as well as laughing) during various parts of the novel. If you want to experience the real Contact, and not the dumbed-down movie version, read Sagan's novel. You won't regret it. In fact, you may be amazed....."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"The movie \\"Contact\\", based upon this book, is a good one...but the book (and I'm sure you've heard this before) is ... stellar! (little astrophysicist humor).It's engrossing and entertaining and definitely a PAGE TURNER!There are a TON of things left out of the movie (necessary for a 2 hour movie), and these details, for me, make the book great.Also the ending is MUCH more fulfilling than the movie. In the movie it's more of a nature of 'faith' dilemma....definitely not Sagan's message. In the book it's more of a 'fabric of space' ending...and I won't say more...no spoilers.Buy it, read it, if you like Sagan, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"What a great read! I have become quite the fan of Carl Sagan after reading this book. It was a required read for a Astronomy course I am taking - initially I was a little taken back that the professor would require a science fiction novel to be read for the class, but upon finishing &#34;Contact&#34; I understood why.Carl Sagan ingeniously incorporates real science and an honest opinion about the unexplored frontiers of space with a very beautiful, artistic view of our real world, and real emotions that we deal with every day.One of the best books I have read in a while. I immediately sent it to a friend to read and he loves it too."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I was a big fan of the movie and wanted Carl to expand the world even further. However, it makes for dull and difficult reading. It takes a while to get into it, but it warms up in the end. I guess I like it spoon-fed to me in visual form."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Few people have expressed just how insignificant the earth appears amid the backdrop of the entire universe more eloquently than Carl Sagan. He spent a lifetime impressing us with how well he conveyed the grand scale of the cosmos, and in Contact Sagan has brought that same style and vision to fiction.The story develops around the intriguing idea of a message received from another star system. Contact deals with questions of space, time, faith, religion, and the essence of the universe as a whole. Sagan's incredible mind and imagination give this story all the intrigue that is needed. Thus even without creating characters with significant depth that so often describes good fiction this story maintains its quality purely for its engrossing ideas.Sagan deals directly with some of our grandest questions, and instead of simply providing answers he has widened the horizon of potential answers. Many ideas are proposed that reach beyond what most would normally ponder. Sagan is a master of spatial awareness and imagery and in this story he has examined the realm of possibilities in a manner few are capable of accomplishing. The conclusion of this story is so well done that it will be pleasing to views of any persuasion. The book is far superior to the movie adaption and I'd recommend Contact to any fan of science fiction."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Carl Sagan's Contact is a very well-written, enjoyable books that manages to get a scientific point across and be fun to read at the same time. Many books have approached the problems of first contact, but few have examined it as thoroughly as Sagan does here. Also, he approaches it in a different way from most. Rather than have the aliens visit the earth, the human race instead picks up artificial radio signals, which allows us to go to them."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Contact is one of those rarities where the book and the film of the book are of equal excellence.The book works because the science is accurate, due to Carl Sagan being a physicist, astronomer and cosmologist and his underlying plot for the book... the interception of encoded transmissions from deep space being something that the scientific community was and is working on as embodied by SETI, the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence, which was located at the Paracebo Telescope on the island of Puerto Rico.The concept is a simple one. That a non Earth-based intelligence would probably try to communicate with other developed intelligences in the galaxy by the use of radio telecommunications. Sagan uses the intercepted broadcasts of radio pulses which occur in the same sequence as prime numbers and it is this property that identifies the signals as non-random radio transmissions which draws the attention of the astronomers and causes them to investigate further.Eventually, the investigating astronomers discover a television signal underlying the pulses and when they reconstruct it they find themselves looking at a the broadcast of the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. The hypothesis is that the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin were the first TV transmissions which were broadcast around the world and that these had been recorded by another intelligence and re-broadcast to Earth. These TV pictures themselves had embedded within them the technical schematics for the building of a machine which would enable a human being to make a journey through space-time in order to gain knowledge of a more advanced civilization. I won't spoil the denouement.Contact is a powerful book, because the detail is accurate and Sagan is stimulating our imaginations and yet staying within the realms of the actual and the 'doable'. The idea of traveling through a worm-hole, is, as yet, theoretical but according to Professor Stephen Hawkins, his theories do not break the Laws of Physics.Contact is a great work of science fiction and an uplifting one.[...]"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"In my opinion, Dr. Sagan is undoubtably one of the most talented science-fiction writers of our time. Contact is yet another example to renew that belief. After receiving and decoding a message sent from space, Dr. Ellie Arroway's marvellous journey with her four colleagues to an unknown corner of the universe is an immediate classic. The rich characters with their political and moral undertones make for a believable cast that anyone can identify with. See the movie first, otherwise compared to the book, it will be disappointing. The book elaborates and expands many of the plots that the movie simply could not explore. You will not regret reading this book!."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"This book is about more than just an invitation from Aliens: It shows what would happen, IF we got in contact with another species. It describes all the conflicts, religious problems and how the government would deal with such a unknown situation. The book is much more detailed than the movie, and that's probably why Carl Sagan (the author) didn't like the movie. I enjoyed reading the book because it makes you think. And you stop reading a lot of times just to think for yourself about the topic! Nevertheless, some scenes seem to be too unreal, like Dr. Arroway's trip to the Space Station during such a hectic situation while planning the &quot;Real Journey&quot;. No wonder the film team left those sequences out. The book also gets some times repetitive. To sum it up: I would say it is worth reading, but don't expect any unknown wisdom in it!"},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I recommend Contact by Carl Sagan as a summer reading book for anyone who is looking for an exciting and intellectually stimulating book. The main character, Ellie Arroway, discovers a signal from aliens. After decrypting the message, she and other scientists find that it gives instructions on how to make a spacecraft. The book gives a views of different groups in the world and how they react to the message and building the spacecraft. The way that Sagan writes the book gives the reader the impression that the book is actually about the human race. Carl Sagan's writing is well done and makes the book exciting. He challenges the reader to think and to look at the world from a totally different perspective. He incorporates various intellectual studies, especially philosophy, to give his book power and to make his themes apparent. Because it is well written and incorporated a lot of ideas, this book left me speechless and wanting more."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I have seen many one star ratings to this book, and all those reviewers compare this book to Issac Assimov's job, well i am going to tell something to those guys: THIS IS REALISTIC SCIENCE FICITION!, the book it's long but fun to read, although in the first chapters the descriptions are long and almost without any dialogue, they are interesting, also the book it better than the movie, the movie was boring, but this book it's exciting, also, this book it's better than that &quot;Red, Blue, Green Mars&quot; by Kim Stanley Robinson trash, altough sometimes this book it's unbeliveable, (at the end), but at least it's more realistic and not as dumb and boring as that Mars trash, this is a book that will make you think, it really potrays how religions are like, unlike the movie were it was offensive this book seems a lot more well not offensive, i give the book five stars, while to the film four and a half stars."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Definetly this book proves that Carl Sagan it's better at writing fiction than science, this book it's amazing!, way better than the movie itself, it shows more deepness, altought the descriptions are too long, they are entertaining, there is no much dialouge in the first three or four chapters,but the descriptions are very interesting on the way that Carl Sagan does, this is why this is his best book ever!, also what i loved about this book it hows it describes religion, sexism,well everything, but i don't recommended to a &quot;closed minded&quot; reader and for a very hard scinece one, because when they make contact to alien beings it's on 1999, this book was written in 1985, so please forget the real facts and enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I think most people that read this book don't get past it's surface of a search for extra-terrestrial life. Certainly, it's a flashy surface to the story. This book is really more one of faith, and how a faith in science and a faith in God are not necessarily contradictory, and in fact are very much alike.

It is the kind of science fiction that is only one step removed from science fact: Consider it a realistic story with some fantasy elements, rather than a fantasy story with some realistic elements (a la Star Wars).

Hitherto, those philosophies have gained popularity in many's minds. The soul of one's spirituality, faith, and belief is similarly touched in this single work of fiction by one of those former intellectuals. Carl Sagan shows us the universality of faith and spirit in all of our lives, and whole-heartedly encourages us to frame our own ideas of faithful reasoning. Ellie Arroway, the main character, shows the puzzlement of our minds and Palmer Joss, her friend, lover at times, is it's firm-minded, though not closed minded, mediator. Her journey from agnostic to enlightened agnostic occurs with this truth seeker throughout lighting the way and proving connections, comparing the scientific mind with the religious, showing that fine line which separates them.

For example, at one point he causes a character to remark that information can be found in the digits of pi. And the writer seemed to have no idea that ALL information can be found SOMEWHERE in those digits. Why? Because the digits of pi are infinite and random. So, somewhere is your phone number, and somewhere else is the product of your zip code multiplied by the square root of your zip code added to your age. Get it? ALL information can be found to exist in an infinitly long and random string. The only issue is how much computing time will be required to find such. Anyway, his character was supposed to have a good knowledge of math and did not understand this simple fact. In fact, she was quite driven by her ignorance of such things."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I very much tried reading this book with an open mind, and it wouldn't have mattered to me in the least if Ellie's character was an atheist. But Carl Sagan had to try and place biblical doubt in the mind of the reader by expressing his own apparent atheist views, by saying the Bible is contradictory. It's too bad that Carl Sagan couldn't have just written a fascinating Sci-Fi book without critiquing the word of God.Without a doubt Carl Sagan was a brilliant scientist. I viewed Cosmos open-mindedly and was fascinated. I understand most scientists are unbelievers of God, and they place their beliefs on the Big Bang theory, Evolution, etc. And that's fine; they have the right to believe what they choose. But please do not critique other people's beliefs.If you want to read a very good Sci-Fi book, check out 2001 a space odyssey.I know my review of this book will strike a nerve with other reviewers. Though, as a believer in God (as I am) and someone who values God's word (as I do) I refuse to give a book a good review when said book critiques the Holy Bible as \\"Contact\\" does. For the unbeliever in Christ, and those who hold no value for the Holy Bible, Carl Sagan's book, Contact, will probably be the next best thing to the creation of Star Wars. For those who value God's word, this book, Contact, has way too much Blasphemy in my opinion. Once again, it's too bad Carl Sagan, couldn't have just written this Sci-Fi book without having to \\"TRY\\" and place Biblical uncertainty. That's all that needs to be said. The \\"point of the book\\" is meaningless. I wish very much that I did not even have to bring up religion when giving this book review. Quite possibly many people will love this novel. But being as though this book really did speak negative about the Bible, shame on me if I didn't at least warn anyone who values God's word, and who might be thinking about reading this book."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"Contact is an excellent book! Carl Sagan keeps you wanting to read more, as the Message suddenly streams in. The Message contains plans for an intricate machine, which will take years to build, it took about a year to finish downloading for the plans. After they build it, the have 5 people enter the machine, and they turn it on. The travel through space and time (although they don't know that at the time). They travel through what they can only describe as a Black Hole, and they suddenly pop out at Vega, the system that they were receiving the Message from. As they orbit around the star, they see radio telescopes, and another black hole. They are sucked into the hole, and pop out at another. This goes on for a while, until they arrive at the center of the galaxy. Now this is where it gets a bit confusing. They dock at the massive port, and they are in an area that is exactly like a deserted beach. During the night, the races that are there somehow retrieve all of the information in their brains. Suddenly, it's time to leave, they get back in the machine, and power back to earth. On earth, it has only been 20 minutes, and all video evidence was erased. Nobody believes them. This was an excellent book, but because of the confusing end, I have to give this book four out of five stars."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"OK...

The idea of Grand Central Station and extraterrestrial cultivating civilization across the galaxy is already mentioned in 2001. And the part when the alien (who disguised as Ellie's dad(not really...))talks about Beethoven and peace stuff, it was ridiculous and funny rather then overwhelmed by the power of ETs. And this book is not very scientific: it sounds scientific, but only few of the scientific stuff was explained... Anf after all, why would the ET avoid the encounter with human being after 5 scientists visited them?

Then I would recommend &quot;Contact&quot; by Carl Sagan. If you didn't know Sagan was (he died about a year ago) professor of planetary research at Cornell University and has written many books on astronomy and popular-science. This is as far as I know his only novel but it is a good one, very serious and well thought-out. Ellie Arroway is a radio astronomer who has devoted her life to SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) but is strongly counteracted by her colleagues. One day however, her stubbornness bear fruit. A radio signal from the star Vega in the constellation of Lyra is detected. The signal isn't just a &quot;Hello ! we are here &quot; but it's a sketch of a machine that turns out to be some sort of transport of people, perhaps to the the star Vega. Many questions arise such as, should the macine be built? If so ,who shou! ld go? Are the Vegans friendly? Etc. The machine is enormously expensive but at last it is decided that it should be built and the crew makes ready to go. This book is basically devoted to describe how we would react the day we understand that we are not alone, both politically and religiously. With the exception of Arthur C Clarke's 2001, not many books have taken this interesting subject so seriously as Sagan's Contact. The book has also been filmed by Robert Zemeckis (Forest Gump) but as always the book is better than the film."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I'll state right now that I haven't seen the movie. I've read the book. It's a good read. It begins with Dr. Eleanor Arroway's father dying. The lonely little girl soon finds a way to relieve her grief by trying to send ham radio messages to Vega. It's now December 1999 and the new millennium is just around the corner. Dr. Arroway and a team of international scientists receive a message from Vega. This message contains the instructions on how to build a spaceship. The scientific community greets it with great enthusiasm. A fundamentalist minister sees great evil in this message and denounces the scientists as godless atheists. The scientists build the ship and go to Vega. They return twenty-six years later and Dr. Arroway's mother has died in a nursing home. She wrote her a letter saying that the man she thought of as her father wasn't her father and that her father was the man she'd had an affair with.

Carl Sagan, of course, knows a great deal about these things - and he isn't afraid to show it off. &quot;Contact&quot; reads like a long, scientific lecture; the good stuff is over before you know it. When we are first introduced to Ellie Arroway, the book's likeable and intelligent heroine, we are told in short sections about her intelligence which was a gift to her, literally, from birth. Over the next twenty years, Ellie suffers through the death of her father, the sexism of college classmates, and betrayal as her mother marries once more. We skip ahead a few years to see Ellie working happily at Project Argus, a facility dedicated to the search for Intelligent Extra-Terrestrial Life. And, lo and behold, Ellie finds it!

Worse still (to me, at least), the language is extremely dry. The characters are very bland and one-dimensional, not so much people as they are idealized Shakespearean characters that go on long soliloquies about how very beautiful caterpillars are.I'm about halfway through, and I'll finish it, but I can safely say that it's not for me."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"I didn't necessarily think that the ending was some sort of cop-out, my problem is this: We as a CIVILIZATION undertook the most massive feat of engineering in the history of the world just to teach a SINGLE person a lesson in faith? What about the rest of the world? But this book did have some redeeming qualities though. Sagan tries to show that there is a common ground between science and religion: the dogged pursuit of the truth. Why are we here? What is our purpose? It is just that these two schools of thought attempt to discover this truth in different ways, one through the scientific method, the other through faith in God. The argument between the two though is who is right and who wrong? One thinks the other is evil and the one thinks that the other is delusional. Sagan does and excellent job of summarizing this conflict. Good novel but has some faults."},{"Title":"Contact : a novel","review":"What's to like about Carl Sagan's one and only SF novel?

He prefers his victims to be young, female, and bicycle riders though when suitable provoked, will kill outside his target group. He likes to chop up the bicycles and their gear before disposing of it. He also likes to chop up his victims as well and always saves a cut or two for his own private selection. He is known as \\"the specialist.\\"For Kirsten Knelsen, jewelry designer in Vancouver, Canada, she has never heard of such things and she knows nothing about the ongoing search for the specialist half a word away in Tasmania. What she does know is that her somewhat eccentric sister Emma who is wealthy and likes to see the world on her bicycle was supposed to have arrived by now on a specific ferry and then taken a specific road to Kristen's home. But, she never arrived and after explaining to Kristen that without any evidence of anything the police can't help, she is more frustrated than ever.Kristen checks out the area where she should have arrived and finds nothing. It is only later, much later in fact, having made no progress above ground, that she finds a clue underground. While exploring a here to fore unknown cave with a group of spelunking friends, she discovers a ring that she made Emma years ago. The fact that the ruing is here, deep in a passageway in the cave is proof that something bad has happened to Emma. Kristen's subsequent search, above and below ground, leads her right to the specialist.As in most books of this type, the point of view shifts from the serial killer to the detective/intended victim, which is Kristen in this case, and back again. While at times, the view does shift to other characters in the periphery of the investigation in typical thriller fashion, the point of view always returns quickly to the specialist and Kristen. In so doing, the clash between the sophisticated killer and the plucky amateur is pushed hard and almost inevitable in the choosing of setting and delivery.Beyond the fact that this novel is typical hungry serial killer fare, the work turns on a heavily contrived act of coincidence. The discovery of the ring creates an almost laugh out loud moment and shatters the necessary willing suspension of disbelief for the reader. Such a stumble makes it very hard to overlook the fact that for most of this work, it is well written for its genre and not something easily forgotten once the book is closed.Kevin R. Tipple 2005"},{"Title":"The Specialist","review":"On Vancouver Island, jewelry designer widow Kirsten Zelichovsky awaits the arrival of her flirty sister Emma Knelson. However, when Emma fails to appear, Kirsten turns to the police, who offer no satisfaction.To get away from her worries, Kirsten joins some friends caving. When she finds a passage into one cave, her cronies dub it \\"Kirsten's Cave. However, she is stunned when inside the cave she finds a ring that is the first major piece of jewelry she made; one that she gave to Emma. As she begins to dig into what happened to her sibling, she meets two interesting individuals just arriving in British Columbia from Tasmania. Dr. Stafford is a Canadian doctor while Teague Kendall is a writer interested in police procedures involving missing tourists as actually occurred back home. However, as Kirsten gets closer to the truth, she wonders who to trust for one of these new friends is the Specialist, a serial killer with an exotic taste for food.Though coincidence is used to throw off the reader, fans will appreciate this dark amateur sleuth tale. Kirsten is a terrific center holding together the tense story line as she struggles to learn what happened to Emma. The support cast adds depth even inside the caves as they bring out the strength of the heroine as well as disguise the identity of the killer until the final serpentine twist in the caverns.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Apothecary's Demise","review":"As a Houston resident, I chose this book because I am interested in fiction set in my home city. However, this one is like no other. The Apothecary's Demise foregoes guts and gore for an off-beat historical setting.Set in pre-suffrage Houston, Sloan does a fine job of bringing old Southern Houston alive, warts and all. Her heroine is a white suffragette who's earnest struggle for the truth can get a little grating (but only a little) as she helps out the young relative of her black housekeeper.Sloan's glimpses into historic Houston -- particularly the Heights neighborhood -- as well as the cast of turn-of-the-century American characters keep the reader interested.Really pleasant gentle read without the sap."},{"Title":"Metal Sky (Jack Stein)","review":"I do agree with the previous reviewer, however, i didn't find it quite as annoying, more amusing. i mean if they can make the magnificent seven, aka seven samuri, then this is no worse. the alien culture is a bit different from maltese falcon, but down to the dead captain on the couch? at least he never called the \\"lost item\\" a \\"dingus\\". can't complain, it was a fun read, i didn't buy the book because i wanted to be intellectually challenged, i just wanted a nice scifi/detective story, in this it did serve the purpose."},{"Title":"Metal Sky (Jack Stein)","review":"I really enjoyed reading the book, but******PLOT SPOILER***** Jay took the whole story from the Maltese Falcon, right down to having him rough up the henchman!!!

It's a town on the move, literally (it really is a moving town), and it's a programmable town. For instance, one change the furniture in a room just by telling your computer. Jack's appointment book is empty, until Bridget Farrell walks into Jack's office. She is a very beautiful woman who knows how to use her beauty. She asks Jack's help in finding a metallic tablet inscribed with ornate symbols.Farrell had a colleague/competitor in the field of obtaining rare objects, a man named Talbot. Unfortunately, he got too close to the business end of an energy weapon, and is now very dead. The Yorkstone police are now very interested. A rich industrialist named Landeman is also interested in the tablet.Jack is a psychic investigator; he works from hunches or \\"feelings\\" gained from objects, other people or dreams. He meets Talbot in his dreams and is told to go to a planet called Mandala. A major archaeological dig is underway, uncovering what was a major city. In his dreams, Jack sees the city as it was a millennia ago. But he is no closer to discovering the answers to his growing list of questions.Back in Yorkstone, Billie, Jack's teenage \\"ward\\" and an expert information finder, learns that the object is made of a metal unknown to science, and probably came from Mandala. It could be an object of great power, or the key to some advanced civilization. Jack begins to piece it all together; a potentially \\"huge\\" object like this would be worth a lot of money to some people.This works really well as a mystery story and a science fiction story. It's just weird enough, and it also has echoes of famous tales like The Maltese Falcon. Either way, it's worth reading."},{"Title":"Drawing for Girls","review":"When I was a little girl, (in the 1960s) this book was in the house. I had a knack for drawing so I spent many hours looking at it, tracing it, and copying it. It is a thin paperback book, really a booklet, with clean pencil drawings for illustrations. It doesn't have many words, but the illustrations are self explainatory. It is perfect for an elementary-age girl, but an adult who wanted to start drawing would benifit greatly from it too.It basically shows you how to \\"see\\", to discover the underlying structure of what you are trying to draw. It starts out very simply, showing how a clock is a circle, and a suitcase is a rectangle. It shows how to measure proportion using you pencil held at arm's lenght as a guide. Flowers can be broken down to ovals, and leaves have a structure. Birds, fish, cats and dogs can be broken down to basic shapes, just like the clock and the suitcase. There are some nice horse drawings too, (my sister spent hours tracing and copying those). Then it goes into the horizon, distance, and seeing a box and a plate on a table from diffent angles. This shows how to make your drawings get three-dimentional. Then they illustrate the vanishing point, with 1-point and 2-point perspective. The picutres are so clear, that I grasped the concepts easily as a child. As I grew, I understood everything in the book better and better. Houses are cubes, just like the suitcase was a square. Then it goes into the human figure. There is a diagram of children in their underwear (everything is a pencil sketch) from a 1-year-old to a 16-year old, so that you can see how the proportion changes as children grow. Then they show how to break down the human skeleton into simple stick drawings to get your people right. I used that method for years when I was a child. Now it is internalized. When I started teaching my daughter to draw, I used this same method. I would say this is where the \\"for girls\\" part of the book comes in: the skectches of people are of girls ice skating, reading, running, and a ballerina. I would suppose that the \\"drawing for boys\\" by the same author would have \\"boy\\" activites at this place. Then there is a page on foreshortening, another page on faces and heads. After that comes hands and feet, which are tricky. The last pages are compostion and shawdows in a landscapes. I think this is the very best book that I have seen on drawing for a beginner. It takes you from a square for a suitcase, to a landscape with composition, shadow, perspective, and figures.I am artistic, and I have acquired many, many art books over the years. None of my drawing books, even the expensive ones, cover such a wide range of things you need to know, and so easily. Any artsy child can grasp the concepts easily by looking at the pictures. Even though there are words, I would guess that even some who could not speak English could understand becuase the pictures are so clear in what they are trying to convey.My grandma, who is 93, is learning to paint. She told me that she was having a difficult time with flowers and asked me to sketch her some. I made some elipses, and roughed in some petals. I made some flowing lines and put leaves on them. It was a cinch. She was amazed and said, \\"How did you learn to do that?\\" I realized that she had not grown up with \\"Drawing for girls\\" like I had, so I ordered her one. I know it will be a big help."},{"Title":"Drawing for Girls","review":"I am a full time artist and this is the book I bought when I was a child to learn.

In this book, Dr. Gray says we all too often just look at the tip of the iceberg - when the bulk of the problems lie underneath the surface. That is why many of the medications and treatments, which sound so promising, fail to work over the long-haul. The author explains to parents how to get to the root causes. The book is detailed with chapters on ADHD, Bipolar, Borderline, RAD, etc., but it is structured in such a way that it is easy to find the information you are looking for. Dr. Gray uses humor and a friendly style to make the book understandable and fun to read.I would highly recommend this book to parents and school counselors who have children needing help. You no longer have to have a Ph.D. to understand the world of neuropsychology; The Maltreated Child explains it all clearly. In addition there is a great glossary and abbreviation dictionary at the back of the book so you can decipher the mumbo-gumbo you hear in most clinician's offices. This book contains a gold mine of information."},{"Title":"The Maltreated Child: Finding What Lurks Beneath","review":"The author heavily promotes bogus diagnostic tests, treatment and parenting. He is a proponent of what is currently called \\"Attachment Therapy\\" (aka Rage Reduction, Holding Therapy, Compression Therapy, etc.). This therapy has been denounced as abusive by the APSAC and the APA's Division on Child Maltreatment (2006). Numerous criminal child abuse and death cases have involved this therapy and its brutal parenting methods (aka Nancy/Beth Thomas parenting).The author promotes several bogus tests. For instance, he calls the Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire (RADQ) the best test for diagnosing \\"Reactive Attachment Disorder.\\" He should say \\"Attachment Disorder\\" which is a totally different and unrecognized diagnosis. The RADQ is blatantly idiotic on the surface of it, though it has also been evaluated in peer-reviewed journals as totally worthless for diagnosing anything. Elizabeth Randolph herself had her psychology license revoked in California.Additionally, the language the author uses to describe children and their problems (e.g. \\"muck\\") is disturbingly disrespectful.The author has long been associated with the Attachment Center at Evergreen (now known as the Institute for Attachment and Child Development). I happened to hear the author speak some years ago, at which time he used the ancient \\"four humors\\" theory (a theory finally abandoned in the 19th century) to describe the personalities of children: this theory contends that black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood determined the workings of the human body.In short, this book is worse than worthless. It is potentially harmful to parents and especially their children."},{"Title":"The Forever Club","review":"The more I read of &quot;The Forever Club&quot;, the more I wanted to read.

Some of the characters are one dimensional, but, hey, it's a suspense thriller, not an Anna Quindlen novel. The characters do have some unusual habits and some great lines. And I loved the way it wasn't just the same old thriller fare.

Most books rehash the same old information about this or that happened on this or that day but never tell you WHY the happened. This book does and it does so in an easy to read and straight forward way.The 11 chapters are divided into various periods of the war, such as the Russian Front 1941-1943, the Battle of the Atlantic, and Strategic Bombing vs. Air Defense. As an example of the approach this book takes, the strategic bombing chapter discusses why the Germans didn't really form dedicated air defense systems until late in the war. The production problems which plagued the British armaments factories, which in turn prevented the RAF from effectively bombing Germany until the US entered the war and added their production planes to the offensive. By not having enough planes to replace heavy losses, the RAF was more or less forced into night bombing. Because night bombing was far less accurate than day bombing, little damage was being done to German cities. Because such little damage was actually occurring, the German high command decided it was more important to keep the fighters supporting the front line troops rather than defending the Reich.Other books prattle incessantly about the missions and how many bombers flew to what city and lost X bombers, but this book gives the reader insight into why the war unfolded the way it did. Why did the British expend so much effort in the Mediterranean? Why did Hitler send troops to fight the British troops there instead of concentrating on Russia? In 1942 the Germans had over 400 U-boats. So why were only 180 operating in the Atlantic?If you're looking for a book depicting day by day blows of the major battles of World War II, keep looking. However, if you are looking to find a comprehensive coverage of why the war developed the way it did, look no further."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This novel is a very readable and highly accurate portrayal of Aztec civilization.

When I finished the book I didn't quite know what to do with myself - for the first time I found myself missing the characters and their exploits in a book. (This slight separation anziety was only temporarily quenched by Aztec Autumn, the sequel - not nearly as good as Aztec.) This is a fantastic story which uses the story of one man to explore the saga of the collapse of one of the greatest civilizations in our history. But it is also the story of the life of a (fictional) man, and an exploration of human nature.

Aztec quite literally makes every other epic/historical, or even 1000pp+, novel I've read pale in comparison (i.e. Gone With the Wind, Heaven and Hell, Les Miserables, etc.). It's also the only one that I hope never makes it to the Big Screen, because it would be a mockery of Jennings' talent for vividly describing what that era was like so that the reader may see it in their mind. &quot;It would be a sullying&quot; of how I feel about this book.

This being the case, with Aztec at ten,would require each and every non-Gary Jennings novel toreside somewhere between one and three.

In Aztec liesthe entire spectrum of human emotion, the complete realm ofsenation, and the ultimate adventure of one individual.The experiences of his life, from young to old, are told withan almost hypnotizing style. Beyond this, there is theabsolutley magnetic content, created with an imagination thattruly seems beyond human capablity. As if this weren't enough, theunderlying philosophy of what it means to be human is sopowerful that, once felt, it will not only stay with you foryour entire life, but it will quite simply change you. And Iam now out of adjectives, so just read it!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Can't help but notice that every single one of the \\"helpful\\" reviews calls Aztec the Best Book Ever Written in Any Language. I have to disagree. It's true, very few works of historical fiction are so well-researched and succeed so completely in capturing a destroyed world but... that doesn't mean I have to like it. To me, as a young and not at all conservative female, the sex and violence in this book is ABSOLUTELY SICKENING. I'm about three-quarters through the book and not sure I can force myself to finish. The fate of Mixtli's sister/ first love is so horrifying that it makes me want to throw up all over my copy. Does some kind of \\"tapir woman\\" actually exist in the historical record, or did Jennings just include this fun twist because he felt like it?The Aztec is pretty informative, but so are \\"Schindler's List\\" and \\"The Grey Zone.\\" I don't really understand how one enjoys reading this novel.UPDATE: I finished the book and have to admit that I like the second half better. I'm not sorry for having persevered with it (I have also added another star to my review). The story calms down and you come away with a fascinating look at Aztec culture and its tragic end. So I would recommend the book to individuals with a) a strong interest in ancient cultures and b) very strong stomachs! That said, I will NEVER read this book again."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I read this book after reading about it in the times and it sounded so exotic. It's not always easy, especially with the Aztec names and the amount of characters involved. But once I got into it, I could not stop and it still remains in my head. The sadness of the story of the Mexican Indians and their treatment by the Conquistadors is another heartbreaking one of the battles between the native inhabitants of the Americas and the white settlers.There were horrific rituals performed by the Aztecs that I thought incredible until some time after I read this book, there was an Aztec exhibit at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. And sure enough, there was proof of the validity of Jennings' careful research and the practice of flaying was true.Highly recommended. You will not forget it."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This is a wonderful novel set in \\"The One World\\"--the land of pre-Columbian Mexico/Central America as it was called by the inhabitants. It is about the life of one Aztec adventurer immediately prior to, and then during, the coming of Captain Cortez and the Spanish Conquistadores.Jennings' novel presents a fascinating society utterly unlike our own, but every bit as rational and civilized, albeit that it had certain attributes we now consider barbaric, e.g. human sacrifice as a component of religious rituals. Jennings makes the point that many or most of the Indians disliked this ritual as well, and did their best to simply avoid and ignore it. This novel offers a sympathetic and insightful portrayal of The One World. Whether it is accurate I cannot say. But it is a vivid and engrossing setting and story.The storyline is rather simple: it is about the life of one member of the Mexica nation (Aztecs) from his early youth to the arrival of Cortez and the conquest. It is a wonderful, captivating, and sometimes moving story. The novel does not dawdle--the storyline is brisk, the prose crisp.My only criticism of the novel is that it is punctuated with soft and medium pornography throughout. In this particular novel, this adds nothing. Unfortunately, this is characteristic of most or all of Jennings' novels. It ruined some of them. Here it is only an annoyance--primarily because it causes me not to recommend the book to my children, which is a shame because otherwise this book would be a great way to introduce kids to another culture and civilization.This is a novel well worth reading and keeping."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"If you want a book that will not let you put it down read &quot;Aztec&quot;. As I read through this book I became more and more involved. I could not put this book down. I felt as if I was feeling the pain, love, and excitement of the ancient mexica. You will experience everything the character went through as if you were involved in the conflict. This book brought out every emotion the main character was feeling and I have never read a book that has done that. I praise this book and I have already started reading it again."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"It's been many years since I read this novel, yet still, it is clear and vivid in my mind. I am grateful to have read this book early in my life, but at the same time I am disappointed that every book I have read since has been a let-down and has fallen short of my expectations. Nothing has yet matched this novel in its depth of story-telling, in its ability to stir emotions of all forms, in its ability to teach something worthy and inspiring, and in its ability to give life and memory and reverence for a people and history of which many are ignorant.The feeling you get while reading this book, especially at the conclusion, is simply *wow*. This feeling comes very rarely: It is a profound awe that one usually feels when in the presence of greatness. It comes from the knowledge that you have read something that has a value beyond expression.This book gave me a story that I will never forget, characters that I will remember as though a lost friend, a history whose remembrance is entitled to the victims, and a landscape of a world that comes back to me as clearly and as often as though I had read the book yesterday.Entrancing and enthralling."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I actually picked this book up at the dusty old used book store in town. Out of sheer desperation I picked it up off the shelf and bought it- finding absolutly nothing else worth reading. I am glad I did.This book is impossible to put down. Incredibly detailed historical fiction and a plot full of suspence and surprises. It, however is not for the faint of heart- exceedingly violent and filled with copious amounts of sex (not the comfy vanilla type either). For those of us who are always searching for the next shocking and new expierience it definantly suffices.There are some flaws- namely all the female characters are either scheming (*sp?) backstabbing whores or virginal and utterly perfect... nothing in between. Also doing my best not to spoil anything the way he \\"concludes\\" all of the relationships seems to be a bit lazy- as if he couldnt figure out what to do so he just kept repeating the same \\"fate\\".To be perfectly honest I didnt even read the letters at the beginning of most chapters- I know that plot wise they made sense but the story can stand completely without them and in my opinion much better.Worth reading- and loaning to friends to read... but I doubt I would pick up the sequels- I would rather leave on a good and satisfied note."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Why has no one made a movie of this book? I thought this at least 50 times while reading &quot;Aztec&quot;, then stopped myself, realizing no director could bring to life the minute detail and beautiful imagery that Gary Jennings put into simple words. This novel transports the reader into &quot;The One World&quot; so completely that it is easy to lose track of time (and place). After a month with Mixtli, when I finished this remarkable book, I suffered withdrawal for at least a few days. Like any person's life, Mixtli's was enriched with joy, pain, struggle, fear, passion and reflection. &quot;I pick my teeth&quot; at anyone who does not think this is an outstanding novel."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I first read this book over a year and half ago. I have also read the psuedo-sequel, Aztec Autumn. There is no doubt that Jennings has captured the depth and intricacies of Aztec culture and society. His character Mixtli is memorable, as he takes us with him on his life journeys. Few characters in modern literature have the ability to capture the world around the them, and give us a unique perspective of their own soul. Nevertheless, Jennings has used a great deal of literary license in order to prove certain points. Mixtli's relationship with his sister, though poignant and touching, is tainted by incense, an Aztec cultural taboo which Jennings points out yet still uses in order to pull the characters into several crisis. Nevertheless, Jennings is very honest in his depiction of the Aztecs, other MesoAmerican cultures that Mixtli meets in his journeys, and the Spanish Conquistadores. Jennings nor Mixtli pass judgement, though there is a definite sadness, yet sarcasm in Mixtli's narration. I highly recommend this novel, though I will say it can be a difficult read. It can be gory, violent, but as I said earlier brutally honest."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I made the big mistake of picking up this book a week before my finals. Very bad news, I could not put it down and nearly flunked the exam! Captivating is an understatement."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Some would say it's sick and twisted, but I loved it. I first read it when I was 16 (many years ago) and it inspired a lifelong interest in history.I know that Jennings played fast and loose w/ some of his cultural characterizations and details, but he sells it as fiction, not fact. It really is exhaustively researched, however -- many of the characters in the novel are mentioned in Meso-American records and lore. Jennings liked to use fact as a jumping off point -- he would figure out everything that we know about a historical people/era, and w/in the loose boundries dictated by fact, flesh it out.Aztec really was his opus, the definitive Jennings. His other novels are worth reading, but after you've read one you'll recognize similar themes and characters popping up each time... (E.g. complex but sympathetic protagonist, sagacious practical mentor, pretty young boy, hypocritical and opportunist religious zealot etc...)Jennings will [tick]-off everybody. Advocates of political correctness will dislike the tolerant but definitely condescending attitude of his protagonists towards his gay characters, and fact that the gay characters are always at least a little flawed and almost always suffer a horrifying fate.In his more Eurocentric books, many of his non-white characters are presented as ignorant or conniving or both. His black characters in particular are generally flawed in some major way (for example, the one black character in in Aztec is coincidently the guy who unwittingly brought smallpox to the new world...)His females tend to be semi-dull saints... or if clever, incredibly evil. The reader is definitely getting a \\"male\\" perspective through Jennings first-person narrator.In a way that could offend the sensibilities of both the left and the right, his books are all ridiculously violent and often sexually violent. Certainly any sexual taboo is described in detail somewhere in his novels. I have a feeling that he has a small following amongst NAMBLA advocates, although I don't believe that Jennings was writing for this crowd. W/out exception though his books feature attractive young boys who are sexualized to some degree.Conservative readers may take offense at his dipiction of Christianity as a opiate-like tool for opportunistic men. Christianity is a favorite target of Jennings, yet his books all have a thread of mysticism to them, as if God exists in spite of Christianity.On a related note, Moslems in particular are also typified as uneducated, backwards and self-serving (not in Aztec though, which had no Moslem characters.)Of course any historian who reads his books will have to take issue w/ the characterization of the inhabitants of the past as essentially 20th Century people. The protagonist is often successful specifically because he thinks like a modern Western person instead of a person of his era and culture. And Jennings core style of filling in the blanks of history is going to offend the Occam's Razor scientist-minded.All of this is irrelevant in my mind. The books should be read by adults who understand that it is FICTION reality and are capable of drawing their own conclusions. If Jennings conventions offend, stop reading. If you find some of the more twisted (specifically non-consentual sex, non-adult sex or violent) concepts titilating, you are a sick [person]. Seek help. If Jennings was prejudiced against gays, non-whites, women or Christians, that was his opinion and he had a right to say it, even though I personally don't agree.Jennings could've argued that the predudice is simply an extension of his protagonists attitudes, since most of his novels are written in the first person, and even though his protagonists are sympathetic they are products of their era and culture. (This is a valid argument, except that Spangle is written in the third person and is probably the most offensive to the Politically Correct.)Anyway, you've been warned. Read the book if you can accept the above criticisms and you're in the mood for a big meaty tall tale. As a novel it is brilliant, only bogging down twice, at points where Jennings resolves lots of loose ends and doesn't quite leave enough hanging to keep you going. Muddle through those spots and you're in for a rewarding yarn."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"A one-time Mexicatl nobleman named Tlil&eacute;ctic-Mixtli, or Dark Cloud, relates the history of his people (aka Aztecs) after the capture of Techn&oacute;titlan by Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s. It is 1529 when the story opens and 1531 when it ends. It takes almost 2 years (and 1,000+ pages) to tell of the life and experiences of the Aztec Mixtli, who served at one time or another as mapmaker, traveling merchant, historian, spy, warrior and nobleman.Because Mixtli is narrator, we learn of the history and demise of the Aztec people from their point of view. It isn't until the last 100 pages that the invasion and diseases, which kill off the Aztecs, occur. Thus, the book is rich with the social, political and economic history of the people.Because Mixtli relates his story to the bishops that serve the king of Spain, and because these bishops reveal their ignorance and prejudices through their letters to the king, we receive the viewpoint of the victors as well. The communication gap is phenomenal, vivid and heart-wrenching.Aztec is one of the best books I have ever read, and I have been reading for more years than I care to reveal. I've read it twice. It's epic historical fiction with empathetic characters, romance, and the ups and downs of human life.An unqualified 5-star recommendation!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. Historical fiction as its best. Jenning transports you to the vanished world of the Aztec Empire at its zenith, as an old Indian tells the story of his life and many adventures. As in all his books, the past is illuminated with such detail and attention to bizarre aspects of culture that reading this rich, engrossing novel is an adventure in itself. I highly recommend this book to any reader who desires a truly unique reading experience. Even if you are not a fan of historical fiction, \\"Aztec\\" would convert you."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Read it because my sister made me. Lots of words to look up in the dictionary, some don't appear even there. Seems 1/3 of the book could be deleted without missing anything. Not my type of fiction."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"No book can compare to this one. Its sequels are worthless, but Aztec itself is the greatest book ever written. I have read it over ten times and am amazed at Gary Jennings' writing. You will never forget this gripping story...I promise you that"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Aztec is an absolutely wonderful book! Jennings has done a great job. The story is very captivating. I actually found myself caring for Mixtli and sharing his griefs, joys, victories, etc. With the arrival of Cortes, I felt a tinge of sadness knowing what would happen. Though the story starts off slow, it eventually picks up to the point that you won't be able to put the book down.At 1000 pages, Aztec is certainly a hefty read, but don't let that scare you. The pages will literally fly by. And don't worry about staleness. Mixtli's tale is still as fresh and exciting on page 850 as it was on page 90.If you get the chance, definately pick up this book. It's great!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I don't consider myself a prude, but Jennings takes this guy's sexual exploits, and the Aztecs religious practices to places I don't want to go. Jennings dwells on the supposed deviant behaviour of the Aztecs; human sacrifices, every deviated sexual situation possible, live hearts being ripped out, limbs torn off, dismemberments, torture, etc. on and on, ad nauseum. If this is what the Aztecs were really like, we should be glad the Spaniards conquered them. I'm no Christian and the Spaniards likely were'nt saints when they imposed their religion on Mexico, but it had to be better than what went before, if this book has any basis in reality. Of course, it's fiction, and anything goes. That doesn't necessarily make for good writing or great authors, but I guess it sells books. I'd skip this one if I were you."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"First of all, undeniable praise goes to author's talent for recreation of the world long gone: besides Aztecs themselves, all those tribes and peoples, with names difficult to pronounce and their ways and traditions, mostly repulsive and hardly believable. I'd have liked to know how much of the story has been fruit of Mr. Jenning's brilliant imagination, and what has been based on research. To follow narrator's - Mixtil's - fascinating story is easy, but sad to acknowledged, I finished this book with no regret that this civilization has vanished. First of all, it reached its peak and was ripe for defeat and conquest, second, and more important, however much blood was shed in the name of Christianity and European civilization, rites of Aztec to 99% are abominable to understanding of a modern and medieval person alike. Author's merit is that he does not only graphically and grisly describes them, but also explains why they were performed, what religious belief led to them. Still such civilization did not stir no sympathy or understanding in me. However, author's sense of humor, acid scorn or subtle remarks, pronounced by Mixtil, whether it concerned Aztec's ways, human stupidity or Spanish concistadors, are amazingly to the point.The book also proves that human joys and misery are always the same. Enjoy this book, even if it makes you shudder every second page...what remains after you finishthe book, is its humour and bloody imprints in your memory."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I don't know...it certainly isn't a book that I couldn't put down,in fact it took me several tries to finsish it. Though it started out interesting enough, you know with the sex and violence, after awhile I found myself skipping ahead to try to outguess predictable and corny outcomes. Didn't really catch any sort of mystical, magical historical viewpoint for me. More like silly soap opera dressed in Aztec rags."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This is the original review by Douglas Jackson, quoted in full by Kev11sky:Having not actually read everything by Jennings, I may be wrong, but it's highly doubtful. What am I talking about? The fact that every novel by Jennings can be described in three words:Sex, blood, and travel!Not that there's anything wrong with that. In fact, in the hands of Gary Jennnings, these things are masterfully and wonderfully interwoven.Sex-wise, AZTEC continues Jennings' apparent self-appointed task of documenting every possible variation of sexual behavior -- in AZTEC may be found sodomy, two brutal rapes, sex on drugs, and arguably two cases of incest. Not counting, of course, the relatively \\"normal\\" sexual encounters swarming through the rest of the book.With regard to violence, you will find the expected Aztec religious sacrifices -- but I assure you, these are the LEAST horrifying instances of violence in the story.**SPOILER WARNING #1** You will probably see quite quickly, as I did halfway through reading my first Jennings book (Raptor), that Gary Jennings will never, EVER fail to kill, invariably in a horrific way, every single character that you come to care about. But knowing that will in no way ruin the emotional impact.And then, there is travel -- which reflects Jennings' arduous research. Mixtli (the protagonist) visits almost the entirety of The One World; exploring, trading, and doing his best to imitate a nymphomaniac rabbit. But all of this is simply the canvas upon which the life of the man named Mixtli is drawn. As with any good book, AZTEC will make you hurt. I say that this is \\"good\\" because happy people are dull people, and it is those books which make you FEEL which also make you remember.** SPOILER WARNING #2** As Night Wind and The Oldest of the Gods tell Mixtli, his purpose in life (and the purpose of a good book) is, for better or worse, TO MAKE YOU REMEMBER.There are moments of revenge -- rare moments -- when you will notice an evil smile on your face (I speak primarily of Mixtli's description of a particular beautiful work of art). There are other moments of revenge where you will NOT smile -- but you will remember nonetheless.And then, there's a reference on the back cover of the paperback, at the end of the last line: \\"...the great, enduring, tragic love of his life.\\" At the risk of seeing more than is there, I venture to say that that statement cannot be fully understood until one reads every single word of Mixtli's tale -- no matter what you may think at any moment before then.Ultimately, AZTEC is the tale of a lifetime -- a fictional lifetime, but of necessity -- since I doubt that any one human being could ever \\"live\\" as deeply and thoroughly as Mixtli does, and as such be worth a read on that basis alone. But Jennings is a good and capable storyteller. His characters are well thought-out, and their motivations and actions make sense, so that he avoids any sense of \\"deus ex machina\\". His characters are not entirely original, but that's impossible in most ways; the character \\"Blood Glutton\\" is reprised in a man named \\"Wyrd\\" in RAPTOR, and Nezahualpili and Zyanya are both emblems of literature -- one could call them Gandalf and Arwen, for example; or Mariko-san for Zyanya, if you're a Clavell fan.In AZTEC there are two examples of lyrical beauty, simple sentences that (to me at least) sit alongside the rest of the events in the novel in my memory. I leave it to the reader to find them.There was only one real flaw that detracted from my enjoyment of AZTEC -- the tendency of the female characters to behave rather more as Mixtli (or Jennings) would have them behave, instead of how real women are likely to behave. But even if you read this as the ultimate male-fantasy sex, blood, and glory novel (heh-heh), the important part is this:Read AZTEC! Love it, hate it, experience it. And then, you will REMEMBER it."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Quite an interesting book, though I was irritated for the first few hundred pages by several contradictions, such as the willingness of most people Mixtli encounters to offer their selves/daughters/cousins etc for Mixtli's pleasure despite his own tribe considering adultery and the loss of virginity before marriage a crime punishable by death.In addition I question the historical accuracy of several of the book's details. Did the ancient Aztec culture really provide sporting scholarships to their equivalent of university colleges for a game similar to basketball? Did they really describe their chief's favourite wife as the First Lady? Well researched and highly detailed fiction masquerading as fact can be a dangerous thing.But if you ignore the shortcomings and keep in mind it's pure fiction it's a very good read."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Aztec is a very interesting research on mexicas' customs and history... Unfortunately, Jennings is very untrue in his description of the Conquest... Seems that he has following only the Bartolome De Las Casas' version (who was no present in the Cortes expedition, and who had a certain amount of animosity to Hernan), and that he has ignored the rest of chronicles written by the own Conquistadores and by the other contemporary historians (Bernal Diaz del Castillo, Cervantes de Salazar, Tezozomoc, G&oacute;mara, Ixtlilxochitl, Sahag&uacute;n, Gayangos, etc)...Oh the other hand, the sexual descriptions are almost pornography in an unnecesary way, the main character commits incest and sex with children, facts that are richly detailed. As well as the historical violence of the human sacrifices, also narrated in great detail, the author adds almost gore scenes along the story of the protagonist, Mixtli. I think that this great detail was unnecesary.On the bright side, the 1000 pages are easily legibles, the differents peoples of the azteque nation are descripted with a wealth of details, and the story of Mixtli, some incredible, is however interesting."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed learning about Aztec culture and civilization in this lengthy and detailed novel, but the author's tendency towards writing as graphically as possible is pretty disturbing. Of course I expected to read about the human sacrifices well-documented by historians, but the author includes detailed accounts of fictional massacres and perverse tortures (especially of women) that are on the same literary level as a horror novel.While in one passage, he writes poetically and in a respectable literary style, in the next he sounds more like Stephen King, perhaps trying to be as gross as possible to add shock-value to the novel. The author also probes deeper into the main character's sex life than is necessary in an historical fiction novel, including such perversions as sex with a boy and with small children, which almost made me stop reading the novel. Surely such offensive acts were/are, unfortunately, a shameful part of even the most advanced civilizations' secret lives, but their inclusion added little of substance to the novel, and instead detracts greatly from the enjoyment of it.If the author had focused more on getting facts correct about the Aztecs, and less on disgusting his readers, this would have been a more engaging novel to read."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Very descriptive and although the names and many of the words are in a strange language, they become so familiar that I found myself using one of them without realizing it: tonali (destiny)"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This may well be the greatest historic fiction novel I have ever read. Before reading it, I scoffed at the reviewer who stated that he had dreamt of the Aztec world on several occasions, only to dream of The One World myself many times during and after reading it. I had to put off reading the last few pages, and was upset when it was all over. I wish I could read it again for the first time!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Being of Mexican decent, I was moved and felt this was a well written book.

Then you realize you are nearly 500 years too late. No one did then, and no one will now. What a shame! This one affected me--disstressed me is more like it. Takes the reader from the beginnings of the Reed People to the mighty Aztecs they were to become and then to their distruction by the sword and cannon of the Conquestidors. Amazing story.

To do so would be a pity for the reader who , to fully enjoy and benefit from this reading experience, must suspend much of what he/she brings to the table as &quot;correct&quot; and &quot;civilized&quot;. That accomplished , hold on to your seat and enjoy one of the most enjoyable and educational reads out there. Too bad Jennings other efforts turned out to be little more than &quot; Azetc meets China &quot; or &quot; Sun of Azetc&quot; meets Rom"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"It's hard to write a small paragraph about sucha humongous work (figuratively and literally)as &quot;Aztec&quot;. The prose is polished, the historicaldetails exact (as a full-blooded Mexican, Aztechistory really strikes a chord), and the narrativenothing short of spectacular.The plot has everything: adventure, politics, sex,war, religion, philosophy, humor and grief. In the voice of Mixtli, reminiscing in his old age aboutthe things he saw and lived, we hear and learn ofthings of a by-gone and almost-forgotten world, ofrituals bizarre and common things familar. Leavingthe book is hard; leaving behind Mixtli and theOne World is even harder.The beauty of Jennings' style is that, not content with spinning an awe-inspiring yarn, carving characters you dream about later in the few hours of sleep you manage to snatch between chapters, he teaches history by vicarously making us live it."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Jennings' style of writing (In Aztec, Spangle, Journeyer) is so graphic, so rich in detail, so strong in characterization, that other writers cannot begin to compare. The reader feels as if he is there in that time, in those wonderful places, and the characters are so real that the reader feels an emotional bond with them. Jennings pulls no punches. great stuff"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Who is this man Gary Jennings???A true literary giant!!!The Journeyor enthralled, Aztec surpasses.To quote the author&quot;Only a novel can reclothe the dead bones of anthropology with flesh that is capable of smiles and frowns, sneers and winks, hurts and pleasure, all the semblance of reality.&quot;Well I couldn't have put it myself! Thank you Gary Jennings for hours and hours of extreme pleasure."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I was transported, transfixed, obsessed, a child again. Not in many years and many books have I been so mesmerized. My mind still eagerly explores this intricate feathered tapestry though it sits on the bookshelf physically untouched. This book is endlessly fascinating. Jennings is a true artisan. For anyone who has forgotten the life of books; let this reawaken you"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"In 40 years of reading, I go back to this book as THE hallmark of historical fiction. I've reread it, and I've bought copies just so I could give them away! If the author, Gary Jennings, were still alive today, he would be the the one author I'd go to a book signing for just to tell him how much I LOVED his books. I cried when I'd learned that he'd died before being able to complete his book set in Babylon. AZTEC is a wonderful book; trust me. You'll have a hard time getting into the beginning, the letters, but at some point you don't notice you'll be in Mexico with Mixtli. I was 32 when I read it the first time, and 39 when I read it the last time. I'm even older now, ha ha. It will always be the first book that pops into my mind when someone asks, \\"What was your favorite book?\\"."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I love this book. I've geek-read it like some folks do \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" I do it about once a year. It never tires me.FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, Amazon, get with the program and make this magnificent work available for Kindle. Honestly! How many hard copies has this book sold? Don't you think you'd move a few e-copies? Lord knows, I was ready to buy it."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This book is second to none. Excellent historical fiction. The first half is slow, but after that moves at the speed of light. A little heavy on sex and violence, and very graphic, so not recommended for the lighthearted. The characterization and sense of place are the best I have ever seen in a book.I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I thought this book to be extremely good. But I have to admit - that through the first half of the book - I was disappointed after reading all the raving reviews. It wasn't until the last half that I started liking it and then by the end - I was completely absorbed.Definitely a worthwhile read.I was transported to another time, another way of life and as a result of reading this book, I have been enriched.It is gory, graphic and for \\"mature audiences\\" - but I believe that is inline with life back in the 1500s; i.e., it WAS Smelly, bloody, \\"less civilized\\" (whatever that means) and more human.If you read it all, from beginning to end - it will be worth it."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This book has everything anyone could ask for. Adventure, love, war, culture, human sacrifice, the list goes on and on. I am a slow reader, but I finished this 1000+ page book in less than a week. I could not put it down."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"It starts a little slow but watch out. Once this book gets going you will not be able to put it down.One of the best books I have EVER read."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I'd read Aztec years ago and really enjoyed it. Decided I'd like to re-read it and also the two subsequent Aztec books. They were available as used books so it was cheap enough and I'd just seen a television series on Aztecs and wanted to see how the books held up and compared. I found Aztec gripping from the first pages...held up extremely well."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This is something all North American readers should read. It was very meaningful to me on a variety of levels. The Mesoamerican civilizations are, I think, fascinating for two main reasons; one, they developed utterly independently of the rest of the world's civilizations, which were connected to each other through the so called &#34;silk road&#34;; two, the Mesoamerican civilizations are a part of who we, as North Americans, are: we eat their foods as much or more than imported European ones (what is life without tomatoes, potatoes, corn, chocolate, vanilla etc?,) dress in their textiles - ever heard of cotton(?) and we probably follow other rhythms of life from them that are not so easily identifiable, but musical and artistic influences are certainly among them. Latin American culture of course is best explained as a continuation of Mesoamerican/Andean civilization with an important Iberian (Spanish and Portuguese) admixture, mainly in language, religion, and institutions - this fact goes for DNA as well. These ancient cultures are fascinating simply on an aesthetic level besides. This book is several things. It is an ethnology of the Aztecs and their neighbours; a history of the late Aztec era and of the Spanish conquest of Mexico; and, a well-spun and highly entertaining tale, as all this ethnographic and historical information is rendered into story form. The fact that it is so well researched, the author having spent 12 years of his life traveling around Mexico and reading everything he could about the period in the original languages, is what makes the book such a worthwhile read in particular. He tells the story for us English speaking North Americans, and thus lets us know the things we as English speakers will find most interesting, but does it on the foil of an old Aztec scribe recounting his life's adventures to Spanish scholars - I guess symbolically showing the passing of the torch of North American civilization from one civilization to the next, whether conceived of this way intentionally or not. I am terrifically amazed at in fact how civilized the Aztecs were! This book certainly drains away the myth of European superiority in all realms of civilized life at the time, and like I wrote above, our own modern world is something like half-Aztec if you think about how many foods, products, and things we do that originate with them or that part of the world. Basketball was explicitly designed as a modern form of Tlachtli, the Aztec national ball game. Oh yes, rubber - kind of need it for lots of things - from the Mesoamericans. Tobacco - not my favourite thing, but it's influence is huge in the world. We could go on ad infinitum. The book was recommended to me by a Mexican teacher of Spanish as one of a very select few &#34;best&#34; books she could recommend me to read in Spanish (among Don Quixote and Cathedral of the Sea.) My understanding is that the Spanish (and is there a Nahuatl translation of this book???) rendering of this book has taken on a kind of national epic status among Mexicans. It tells of the defining moment of North American civilization, the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, in great, highly entertaining and shockingly vivid detail. To put it comically, it made me proud to be Mexican, and I am not Mexican, haha! It definitely changed my view of my identity as a North American though, and my understanding of modern world history. The conquered American peoples influenced the Europeans as much as the reverse; the modern West is quite a &#34;mestizo&#34; culture.Now for a few words about some things I didn't like so much about it. One of them is how comically ridiculous it would have been to expect some Spanish monks to actually record all of this fictional old Aztec's rantings and musings, particularly the explicit and often quite illegal (in both cultures) sexual adventures. Really, this aspect of the novel's structure is more comic than silly, but it still is silly. How they could write that quickly, and that they wouldn't censor anything is beyond belief - but again, no problem, it's pretty funny actually.Another problem I have with the book is how the author over-vilifies the Catholic officials and the Spanish generally. He seems to fall into the group of opinion that identifies the Catholic Church primarily with sexual prudishness, extreme narrow mindedness, mass murder, and not much else. This is not to say that the villainous character of the bishop supposedly recording and sending off these memoirs to the king of Spain does not reflect any of the historical bishops of New Spain of that age, but it seems to be too cartoonish and it overly black and whitens the situation. The fact that the Spanish adopted the Aztec language Nahuatl as the official language of New Spain and kept it so for almost 200 years (until 1696) and they even spread it to other native groups, and actually continued quite a lot of the Aztec political and social structures, let alone material life in its entirety, tells a quite different story. In fact, this story of continuity is why the Aztecs remain such an important part of the modern world to this day. The Spaniards inserted themselves as the top dogs over the Aztecs, and this is seen symbolically in their razing the centre of Tenonchtitlan and rebuilding it in Spanish style, but leaving the rest of the city more or less as it was, and then developing things slowly from there (such as replacing the terracotta and earthwork Aztec aquaduct with a Roman style arched masonry one later on.) The Mexicans I meet with all tell me they are Aztecs - that is what &#34;Mexico&#34; means (Mexico is a synonym for Aztec.) I just read a 17th Century book in Spanish written by the great-grandson of Montezuma telling the traditional history of his people for the future descendents of the Aztecs - these people were most obviously not having their ethnicity beaten out of them. The author of that book is very proud of his heritage, and it was a published book at the time. There are actually about a million and a half persons in Mexico who to this day still speak the Aztec language at home. I am seeing continuity, not a break. Spanish's status started to trump Nahuatl's only after 1696, and last I heard, Nahuatl proficiency is required to enter the civil service in Mexico City. Spanish's greater reach, its official status, and international connections, all worked in its favour, and with more and more mestizo marriages happening where the language of choice would therefore naturally be Spanish, this language became that of modern Mexico, and Mexico is now the world's most populous Spanish speaking country (the USA being second, believe it or not!) The point of my rant here is that I would have liked this continuity touched on a bit better - I don't like mis-education for the purpose of mere dramatic effect, or to over vilify the Spanish. The Spanish made their contribution to Mexican life, and not all of it bad. They introduced improvements in technology, literacy, human sacrifice was stopped, the &#34;flower wars&#34; ended, cattle and horses introduced, the wheel, steel, and so on and so forth. In such a definitive and epic novel for a whole culture, I would have liked a little more fair and balanced view of things. But, the Spanish did indeed wreak much evil in many cases, particularly early on, albeit more from germs than any other method, so this aspect of the book doesn't really do it too much harm.Anyways, in sum, this book changed my whole paradigm of understanding North American and modern world history generally. You can probably sense my enthusiasm in how I wrote this review. I'm pretty picky with my books, and this one satisfied me, no, engrossed me on so many levels - intellectual, epicurean, philosophical, artistic, ethnological, identity, historical, dramatic. Judging by the enormous number of reviews here, and its being a number one NYTimes best seller, I don't think I'm the only one in this acali! Ya ayya!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Purchased this book as a gift. Arrived on time, the recepient loved it, stated it was very well written. Great customer service!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Item shipped fast and arrived in perfect conditions, it has been suitable to my needs and I have nothing negative in response."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"The book by Gary Jennings is the best novel I read about the cultures of Mexico."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This is a rare book - a gripping page-turner with dozens of plot twists and enough action to exhaust Jerry Bruckenheimer fans, while at the same time providing a window into an ancient culture that no longer exists. Using a simple, straight-forward story-telling style, with the narrator fortunate enough to be present at all the historically significant occasions of his time, Aztec is too entertaining to allow one to be churlish. It is a great read, loaded with sex and violent images (that I still recall ten years later) and which leaves you a little sad at the end of it all. The 'uncivilized' are eradicated by the 'civilized' and by the end of this wonderful book you may be wondering at the meanings of those words."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Having read what I consider one of the best epic novel series in existence, Stephen King's The Dark Tower Series, I have no quandries in saying that this novel in itself brings in every literary aspect that King adopts throughout the Tower series into roughly 1000 pages and in one book. If there was one book you should bring to a desserted island, Gary Jenning's Aztec would be it. Imagineative, Gratuitous at times in terms of sex and violence but always entertaining and enthralling, this is to be held as one of the best books ever. Unless you are freakishly squeamish about taboo subject, this will end up on your all time list, GUARANTEED!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"You don't have to be a sicko to like this book.It's a romanticized version of the Aztecs, but the book still has a lot going for it. It's a human universal: sexuality and death cults go hand in hand -- be prepared. The book recreates the worldview of pre-conquistador Mexico City, and then brings in the Spanish. The plot is... good to great. A few loose ends were tied up in just the way you knew they would be, but there are still some surprises.If you liked Tom Clancy's Without Remorse or Steven Pressfield's Gates of Fire, you are probably going to like this, too."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Incredible journey through Central America before and up to the devastation that was the arrival of the Europeans. Gripping story with a lot of action wrapped in insightful historical perspective. Great characters and although the life of the main character may be a little too big to be one person's life the context and the environment through which he takes you is extremely believable and pretty accurate from what I could tell."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This is a great book! It is long, though. It is so well written and well researched. It is a novel that gives an unbelievable history lesson. It is my mom and brother's all time favorite book."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This book has become one of my favorites. Jennings has a great way of mixing history and fiction. I definitely recommend it. Be warned, however, that there are strong instances of sex and violence."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"By far one of the greatest stories I have ever read! When I finished the book my first word was WOW! If the rating system was from 1-10, this is a 9.9 or 10. I could go on for days about this, but the other reviewers have made it plain and clear. If this was made into a movie it would be XXXX.. Blood, Gore, Lust, Incest, Murder.. it has it all!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I first read this book when it was published in 1980 and was mesmerized by the story telling skills of the author Gary Jennings, who went on to write several other books in the series and also The Journeyer, a wonderful book about the travels of Marco Polo. Aztec was certainly the first fictional book I had read about the Aztecs and I absolutely loved it.It is the story of what must have been the greatest native civilisation that inhabited north America, in the area now known as Mexico. It is a story of epic proportions about Mixtil a young boy who rises above the lowly beginnings of his family and distinguishes himself, firstly as a scribe and later as a warrior.He earns himself a great deal of money as a merchant traveling to all corners of the Aztec lands. Lands that were extremely diverse, including mountains, jungles, deserts and the coastal lands. Mixtil, travelled them all.This large volume is full to the brim with excitement and adventure and gives an insight into what it must have been like to be part of the Aztec nation. The weapons they had, the games they played and the human sacrifices they made of their enemies. I read it avidly. The only down side to the book is the virtually unpronounceable words of the people and the places. But this is a small price to pay for such a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"An amazing story about life, love, and tragedy. It took me on a journey to another world."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This l-o-n-g novel is truly multi-purpose.If you want to learn about all aspects of the Aztec people--their history, their Flowery Wars with neighboring tribes, their religious beliefs and practices, their language and picture writing, their dress, their lifestyle, their buildings and temples and pyramids, their great city Tenochtitlan, and so forth--then this is certainly the book for you. The author spent twelve years in Mexico researching and learning the language of the Aztecs, and by all accounts has provided a very accurate picture of that world.If you enjoy a picaresque novel with a lively and intelligent hero whose many adventures include the observation of and participation in all of the most historic events, you will find this is the book for you. It is the story of Mixtli, who rises from a lowly station in life to become a scribe, a traveling merchant, a warrior, an explorer, an adviser to rulers, an interpreter for the Spanish conqueror Cortes, and a chronicler to King Carlos of Spain of the history of himself and his people.If you find it interesting to read specific details about the violent and blood drenched religious practices of the Aztecs or about the atrocities perpetrated by the Spanish in the name of king and religion, then choose this book. Readers not only learn that the foul deeds are done, but also hear in graphic language exactly how they are accomplished. The account of the method for ripping a beating heart from the breast of a sacrificial victim is particularly visual in its description.If you are amused/titillated/aroused by accounts of various sexual escapades, then by all means read this book. It includes sexual episodes of all kinds for a variety of tastes: incest, child/adult sex, object-assisted self gratification, male-male sex, female-female sex, and even regular old male-female sex. Sorry, no bestiality. One particularly noteworthy sub-plot involves an Aztec princess who, when she tires of sexual partners, has them killed and boiled to remove the flesh from the bones, and then uses the skeletons as the foundations for life-size statues.All of this is put together as a first-person oral account by Mixtli, given to the Bishop of New Spain, to be sent to the king of Spain. Throughout, the author gives his narrator a sly and ironic voice, as he pretends to be a loyal subject of the king and a Christian convert, all the while portraying the Spanish in a very unfavorable and mocking light and seemingly slipping in the sexual matters to shock and/or excite the prurient interest of his listeners. (And surely the author was being doubly ironic here, intending the same result for his readers.) As such, the story is often unexpectedly amusing. For example, ostensibly praising the high sexual standards of the Spanish, the narrator says, \\"I can truthfully say I never saw a single Spanish soldier rape one of our women except in the one orifice and one position permissible to Christians.\\"Written in 1980 and still in print, this novel is well executed and better than most of its kind. It beats James Michener's history-based novels by a mile. It's not a book for the ages, but any book of over 1,000 pages that can become a best seller and then stay in print for over 30 years has got to have something going for it."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"this book, is amazing. Thick book, great adventures. Jennings makes you think you're there. Makes me wish I were there to witness Mixtli's life. Ahh I could go on and on..."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. Aztec Autumn is a close second. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This book was excellent!! I thought at first that I might not be able to get into the book. I had it for several months before I opened it and read it all in like 3 days. I just couldn't put it down. Very vivid and the characters were lively. I read it because it was very entertaining and didn't know much about Aztec history and this gave me some insight. Some areas I felt uncomfortable...like the main character & his sister's relationship. But otherwise I enjoyed it very much. I would read it again in the future. I have read the rest of the series and they are all a good read, but I thought this was the best one in my opinion."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"one of the best books ever jennings has a great/filthy mind.... makes me with I could have been there. cool"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Gary Jennings' massive novel Aztec is packed with so much detail that it could double for nonfiction--and should find its way into many classrooms across the country. But background info isn't everything, and the historical fiction offers up an engrossing story to serve as a vehicle to its lectures. Bravo."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Was disappointed not to find an electronic version of this book, and very happy to find a copy at a great price and in good condition. Shipped quickly and was true to description of slightly used - great shape overall!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I can honestly say this book just is the best, i kept telling everyone about it...every part was just so raw and its soo much! i love the way i can read it and picture it all in my mind as if it was a movie,all the details, just everything!... Its honestly the best book ive ever read.!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"AZTEC is one of my favorite novels. Jennings' packs in so much detail and immerses the reader in another world so deeply that I had a hard time putting it down (despite its length). He is a true storyteller, using a unique framing device to have the protagonist tell his life story. Yes, there is gore and violence and sex, but as Jennings reimagines it, these are qualities of that society. Reading a history of the Aztecs and how they came to power is one thing - but very few historical novels can bring fact to life as brilliantly as Jennings does here. It's too bad the follow up novels in the AZTEC line don't deliver as this one does... but then again, this is a rare book."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Very fast delivery of a book I was looking forward to reading again after some recent traval. Had this book about 20 years ago or so but it fell apart. newly received book is in perfect condition to read and pass on to the family. Cheers!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I read this book several years ago, after a referral from a friend. I still remember the story quite well, and have since read other Jennings novels. This incredible saga traces the life of a fictitious character, \\"Mixtli\\", an Aztec, from pre-Spanish conquest, to his death at their hands. Aztec will educate you on Aztec culture and the Conquistadores, while at the same time providing an entertaining epic story of unforgettable remembrances - rituals, war, adventure, sex, gore and suspense."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This may be the biggest book I've ever read but once I started, I couldn't put it down. Gary Jennings is a terrific writer and I am fortunate to have stumbled on his best work. The sequel Aztec Autumn in OK but not quite as good as Aztec. I would recommend this book to anyone with no reservations."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This is the life story Mixtli, Dark Cloud, a commoner in the Azteca world, who rose to be a nobel in the last days His world. This book will give you a greater vision of the real Aztec world and it's death.Gary Jennings is a great author, who does his homework. His books show a great deal of research.In my opinion, this is the best book I have ever read. My basis for this is over 40 years of reading including Asimov and Uris and Mitchner."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Novels about the Aztec world aren't very common, but even if they were, I think this book would still top them all easily. It's true that Gary Jennings didn't get everything 100% accurate, but he did nearly so, and in any case as a work of fiction, this book is excellent. A must read for anyone interested in the Aztecs, or just a good book in general."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I saw, I heard, I smelled, I felt... I was there. Now that it's over, it's still with me, and Mr. Jennings did a great job of making sure it stays.Ahhh, what a gift!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"What can I say, without sounding too redundant this is THE best book I have ever read. The late Mr. Jennings is a literary genius, his style of writing is a landmark. His descriptions of the Aztec world are superlative. He brings Tenochtitlan to life agian, you can actually see in your mind what he writes. His charecters are well developed, you sympathize with their plights, you revel in their accomplishments.With all that said, I encourage everyone to read this book don't be put off by it's size. Your only problem will be finding time to read it! I simply cannot say enough wonderfull things about this book! Jeeez, now I think I'll go read it again..."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I have read a number of books on Aztec history, and although it is a passion, it can get a bit dry. When I stumbled upon Gary Jennings &quot;Aztec&quot; I was quite surprised.This novel really takes your mind into the soul of the Aztec culture and for once I really fely close to all those events that I had read so much about. The main character is wonderfully colourful and his adventures make for a stunning plot.I could not put this book down."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Very carefully researched and entertaining book that put me under the spell of ancient Aztec culture. Highly recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This jewel is NOT to be read by the weak-hearted. This is really a man's book because so much of what the characters think, say, and do make you ask yourself, &quot;Did this guy read my mind?!&quot; Jennings is the Michaelangelo of storytellers. His attention to details, even the most bloody and gory ones, make this book a must read for anyone interested in the history of Mexico and the indigenous indians that populated it. Parts of it are very humorous, parts are gruesome, parts are appalling, parts will make you cry, many parts will make you angry, parts are very sensual and sexually graphic and all of it is the utmost of entertaining. Like it or not, Jennigs tells it like it is. My favorite characters were Beu Rebe and Armed Scorpion. I just loved Zyana. The most despised were Hernan Cortez, Mocteczuma, and the dispicable Zumarraga. This book is loaded with &quot;good stuff&quot; so what ever you do, don't try to speed read it. Slowly savor each exciting part. Don't try to figure any character out. Laugh at &quot;Offal of the God's&quot;. Wretch at &quot;Jaded Princess&quot;. Marvel at &quot;Armed Scorpion&quot;. Sympathize with Beu Rebe. You will fall in love with this book. It will occupy your mind and make you pledge to ourself that a visit to Mexico is something you must do before you die. The magnificence of that civilization is impossible to comprehend. Then pick up a copy of the sequel &quot;Aztec Autumn&quot;. That jewel I will review another time! Until then . . . happy reading and I kiss the earth to you!!!!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Insightful,engaging,bold and bawdy.Jennings immerses the willing reader in the life and times of an acerbic ancient Aztec more surely than a time machine.Rich in both historical detail and compelling narration,Aztec informs as it entertains with equal ease. One is drawn to identify strongly with the novel's central character Mixtli, to the point where his vastly different cultural imperatives seem more reasonable than those of his Spanish overlords. As my wife put it, Mixtli seems like an&quot; old friend&quot; by the novels end and you just know you're going to miss him. Maybe that's why this is one of a handful of books worth reading a second time instead of the sequel.D'ya think?"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Though I give the man credit for exploring the culture and history of the Aztecs so deeply, I can't say that I enjoyed the book. I felt no connection or emotions for any of the characters. In fact, my strongest feeling was usually one of repulsion. If you really want to know ALL the gory deatils of Aztec history, then by all means read this book. If you are looking for a historical fiction to transport you to another time, try something else."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Everyone seems to love this book. I suppose if you're comparing it to Michener, it would be daring. As a historical novel, it is exhaustive. I'd rather read an ethnography, however. The writing is repetitive, unimaginative, and endless. The sex and violence is completely gratuitous; are we really to believe the Aztecs had small trained children performing ritual (and graphically described) sexual acts on people? I'm not a prude, but I felt as though Jennings was taking pleasure in describing some of the most violent and sickening acts by proxy. Clocking in at over 1000 pages, it has lost the battle for my attention."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"(...)I enjoy a good erotic novel, but this book thinks itself to be an historical book.If you love detail, pick up a book by Umberto Eco. Don't waste your money and more importantly your time in reading this junk. If you want to learn about history research it in the library. If people all over the world think our cultures were only about violence and sex, we are in serious trouble.There are many achievements and inventions not even touched in this book.

Hopefully as I get more into the book, it will grab me but right now...it's slow going. The book is interesting enough to make me want to keep reading but now a page turner!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I just didn't want to pick it up anymore. It just seemed like sex and violence. The first sex scene was good but after that it just seemed like the author was trying to be sensational - which I find boring. This sex stuff is interspersed with all sorts of violence and cruelty in the guise of religious ritual, accidents,etc - also boring to me. Furthermore, I felt this wasn't giving me a genuine picture of Mexico in the 16th century. When my daughter told me she was half-way through the book and was still waiting for a plot to emerge, I decided I was going to toss the book and assume that the rest of it was going to be 99% garbage like the first quarter. Why waste my time any more? I gave it 2 stars because it is well-written, that is, readably written."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Ok, so I exaggerated a little in the title. The main character isn't mentally challenged like Forrest Gump. But he does have an uncanny ability to be at the right place at the right time. Did you know that he even invented eyeglasses?I am a huge fan of historical drama, and was looking forward to learning more about the Aztec world. I just couldn't get past the poor writing, which was bordering on the melodramatic. Don't even get me started on the almost laugh-out-loud bad sex scenes. One woman's vagina was referred to an an opening bud. Could the author get any more cliched?It was a true test of will power for me to finish reading this book. I would give it 1/2 star if possible."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I'm honestly perplexed as to how people enjoyed this book (nothing against them, I read the reviews online before I started and was excited to read this book).As other reviewers said, it's very annoying how the narrative stops every few chapters so that the main character can talk to the Spanish. I also feel Jennigs uses these interupttions to show how much of a difference there was between Spanish and Aztec culture. Hey Jennings - NO KIDDING. He was pushing the blatently obvious every few chapters making you feel like an idiot.Another bad part was that it was hard to follow. The name of the main character changed every few paragraphs, it seemed.Secondly, the entire book had no direction whatsoever. He randomly started doing things for no reason. I wanted to read a story, no some schmuck's life story!If you haven't read historical fiction and want to kick it off with an epic, I would suggest Keith Follett's Pillars of the Earth."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I can't for the life of me understand why so many people like this book so much. It's the worst piece ... I ever finished (Stephen King's It being the worst one I didn't bother finishing). If you know ANYthing about the Aztecs, you know that most of what happens in this book is absurd and stupid. There are so many better books, don't waste your money & time on this one. Go read Stephen King's The Stand."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Very dissatisfied with the printer of this book since pages 52-85 are missing and pages 117-148 are printed twice."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I first read \\"Aztec\\" twenty years ago, and despite the passing of the years this novel for me has been a benchmark in all that is outstanding in writing. This is one of the few works I have read that made me think about it for weeks afterwards, and it has left a distinct imprint on my own developing career as a writer. My own original copy through numerous re-reads had degenerated into a dog-eared, much thumbed relic that holds a treasured place on my bookshelf. Mr Jennings has delivered a literary masterpiece that encompasses every possible aspect of the human condition,from unspeakable horror to poignant tragedy as told through the eyes of Mixtli, an ancient Aztec scribe to a less than enthusiastic panel of Spanish priests shortly after the Mexican Conquest.The minute attention to historical detail in Mr Jenning's descriptions, including a fascinating and rare insight into the Aztec tongue of Nahuatl, gives the novel an authenticity seldom encountered in many more romanticised works of historical fiction. Mixtli's voice is one that is totally credible because of the gritty realism that pervades throughout \\"Aztec\\". Mr Jennings has managed, despite the novel's daunting 1300 or so pages, to deliver a fresh and gripping narrative on each page that leaves the adventurous reader wanting more. Sex, war, murder, intrigue, betrayal,epic spectacle and blood-drenched ritual - this novel has it all and is certainly not for the squeamish. But for those wanting an insightful and authentic glimpse of a unique and vanished world, \\"Aztec\\" is a definitive must."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I love this book. I love the immense historical details, the gorgeous use of language, the intense battle scenes and the passionate love. The book, however, is intensely graphic and erotic, at least compared to anything else I've read. Anita Blake can't top some of this crap. I don't read romances and I don't read erotica, but I do like a good story and I love historical fiction. I had to remind myself that this is Mesoamerica through the first half of the book, as it felt like some other world, excluding the occasional scene between the main character and the Spaniards, which I for one also enjoyed. I was also motivated to do more research on the subject, to see for myself the truth (or falsehood) of Jennings' words, though that is something one can do for one's self, not for me to detail here. On that note, the main character seems to, in a roundabout way, play a role in major historical events. He's even sometimes the catalyst or a guiding hand. Obviously, this character is fictitious, which has further driven my curiosity to find out more.The only reason I give it four stars is due to the extent at which it horrified my brain, and for a few stale chapters. By that point in the book, it had become rather predictable to me. I could start to get a feel for when we were due for another scene of graphic violence or more sex. The plot was beautiful, but towards the second half it was regrettably just a little predictable. Still, there was a question of how such things would come about, and there are still a few severe shocks left in store. You don't read the book to find out who lives and who dies. You read it to find out how.This was one of the very, very few books that had me so hooked that I actually felt moved by it, to laughter and tears and anger and joy."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I love history with all its lessons and implications, but sadly history books can either be fascinating or terminally dull. \\"Aztec\\" by the late Gary Jennings is a great book, exhaustively researched by an author who loved the history and culture of the book's subject, as evidenced by his other similiar novels.We learn the tale of an Aztec Indian who, because of his literary skills, becomes a historian on his own, and describes his life among a civilization that is at the same time superstitious, bloodthirsty but also capable of great beauty and knowledge. He tells the tale to his conquering Spanish friars and Jennings does not hesitate to bring up the obvious irony of the Spanish Catholic settlers ridiculing the many gods of the Aztec world and its superstitions, meanwhile destroying the pyramids and temples and replacing them with churches full of their own saints and countless rituals of their own, not to mention their own penchant for bloodletting and cruelty.\\"Aztec\\" is sometimes vulgar, sometimes beautiful or funny, and at all times entrancing. History buffs and readers who just like an excellent story should add this book to their libraries at once."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"It is not my habit to review items that have been reviewed by many others. But it this case I just wanted to drop in a few lines about this magnificent book.This novel is full of historical, religious and anthropological data. You will probably gain more insight into the Aztec empire by reading this book than any other, fiction or non-fiction. The story is realistic in the extreme. The language and descriptions very detailed and moving. If you're a reader and haven't read this book yet: it's a must read!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"No spoilers.All you can really say about Aztec is in the title of this review. Because a detailed plot synopsis can be ascertained from among the 200+ other reviews here, I won't go into what the book it about. I'll just tell you why I liked it so much.The most conspicuous element of this entire book is how Jennings is able to blend accurate history of the 16th century with lessons of life that are sure to be timeless. What I mean is that while reading this, not only will you learn a ton about Aztec society and culture and its subsequent end at the hands of Cortes from a people-wide perspective, but you also get to see this same conquest from the eyes of the narrator Mixtli. I love historical fiction, and because I didn't know much about the Aztecs prior to picking this book up, it was a bullseye hit in that respect.Furthermore--and what makes this book more than a mere history lesson--is that you a treated to seeing Mixtli's life progress from being a common citizen, through his rise to warrior, to his becoming nobility. This story is the real soul of the book, and there are passages that are as relevant today as they were 500 years ago when Mixtli spoke them.The bottom line is that this is a great book both for its historical fiction, as well as its sad/funny/awkward/inspiring/heartfelt/tragic, etc. story line that tells of Mixtli's life. It's a long book that will occupy your time, but it's so worth it. Get it now."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Truly, Gary Jennings has a light prose, great descriptive and the book is well researched. It also treats a civilization of great importance in the history of America, and especially Mexico. I believe the best thing about this book is how through the eyes of Tilelic Mixtli, the author fully represents the full collision between two cultures with so different paradigms.The book isn't good just as history, but it is also filled with romance and adventure, without loosing it's sense of history. There is however one thing that could diminish it's greatness, and that is the tragic sense of Jennings. The whole book is filled with tragedies, and Jennings tends to do this a lot, however, in this particular case, the whole momentum of the book is tragedy.Strongly recommended, yet not for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"While underway on an US Submarine I picked this book up from the ship's libray and literally could not put it down until I was finished!!Whn I was called to my watch station I would get excited the closer being relieved so I could pick up where I had left off.After finishing the book, I passed it on to a co-worked(shipmate) who in-turn had the same experience I had. This followed suit ten time witth ten different people. By the end of our &quot;SPEC-OP&quot; there was almost a cult following on the boat made up fans of this book.Upon my return to port, I gave the well worn paperback to my wife who fell in loe with the book so much she even changed he screen name to reflect her enjoyment of this great read!I strongly recommend this book to anyone in the least bit interested in the Aztec civilization or who enjoys a great bookOne word of Warning...this book is not for the sqeemish or those with out an open literary mind and it is not for children!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"If you are faint-hearted, prudish and easily offended, this book is not for you.However, if you love adventure, steamy sex, don't mind vividly gruesome descriptions (I can still see the blood running down the Pyramid), and most of all excellent writing, this book is a MUST READ.The book follows the life of an Aztec named Mixtli, from almost the beginning of his life to the end, and is one of those books that sucks you in and won't let go. As one reviewer so eloquently states on the book's cover, I myself have been dreaming about the Aztecs since I started reading this book. You know that feeling you get when you are nearing the end of a great book, and you start savoring every word, reading more slowly because you don't want it to end? That's what this book is. I loved it. And I will still love it when I read it the for the fiftieth time."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I first read this book years ago when I was in college. The book takes you to mexico prior to the Spanish invasion. I fell in love with &quot;Aztec&quot; it does what you wish all books did. It sweeps you along with the story, you feel you know the people in the book as if they were your friends, or enemies. I have reread this book many times and also all of Mr. Jennings other books. I have judged all the historical novels that I have read since, by this book; all have fallen short . This is the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I really didnt mind the violence contained in this book. I was, however, disturbed to read about the main character: 1) having detailed sex with his sister 2)having sex with a little boy and 3)him and his wife having sex with two little bald kids.Maybe its just me but im not a big fan of that kind of stuff, and it wouldnt have even been that bad but those parts were WAY too detailed.Other than that, the rest of the book was incredibly enjoyable and educating. I would suggest it to anyone, but recommend skipping those nasty parts."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"...From The Monitor...Aztec, a firm epic story by Gary Jennings is so spectacular, that I would be willing to read it at one o'clock in the afternoon, middle of July, laying down shirtless on black asphalt. Impressed? Aztec is an epic historical fiction novel, often categorized with James Clavell's Shogun or the works of James A. Michener, which enraptures its audience with a firsthand vivid account of the 16th century life of the Mexicatl (Aztec) people in their city Tenochtitlan (present-day Mexico City). Jennings uses \`Mixtli' which is Nahuatl (language) for Dark Cloud, to tell the story of his life ab ovo. Mixtli tells his story to an audience consisting of friars, a bishop and scribes whom were charged by the King of Spain to write down verbatim the words that escaped Mixtli's mouth so that his august Majesty could know of the people (Aztecs) he had recently conquered.Jennings reveals a people, a place, and a time period that is often forgotten. He takes you through religious ceremonies, sacrifices, and festivities that are completely alien to any of today. The myths, suppositions and lore of the Mexica people come alive through Mixtli's narration. Mixtli's life is exciting and diverse, he wears many hats: a scribe or \`word knower', a peddler of booty, a passionate and sometimes clumsy lover, a cartographer and a very unlikely warrior. Mixtli travels throughout his nation and to far off lands and experiences much through intention, and more often, through error. He learns various tongues along his travels and eventually picks up Spanish, which makes him a great but reluctant tool of the Spaniards. So much of Jennings' novel is comprised of such a wealth of sensible, believable information that it is easy to forget Aztec is a fictional account. I would be hard pressed to prove or disprove the elements of truth in Aztec. I can only rely on the experts: Professor J. Pino of Kent State University found Aztec's representation of culture and religion a \\"total horselaugh\\"; the Denver Post had this to say: \\"The history, geography, art, literature, and religion of the Aztecs are all here, along with a wealth of information about the people themselves and the way they went about the business of living.\\" Now what? Even the \`experts' seem dubious. To any reader of historical fiction, it should be evident that certain liberties are taken regarding factual information; something may be added or subtracted, or even sugarcoated for effect, this is often called \`artistic licensing'.Whether or not you believe Aztec is a grandiose misrepresentation of the Mexica people during Spain's occupation in Mexico during the 1500's, or an accurate story down to the letter about the ways and means of a great people, you simply cannot deny Jennings' skill of seizing readers' curiosity, welding their hands to the book. Although, I must admit there were times when I felt dirty reading portions where Mixtli nonchalantly addressed incest or grisly religious rituals, purportedly indigenous of the Aztec people, it has been the best read of the summer. In reading Aztec, I spent most of time admiring Lake Texacoco, enjoying walks through the great city of Tenochtitlan, and despising the \\"smelly\\" Spaniards for their \`divine' right to pursue \\"Gold, Glory and God\\". I could empathize with Mixtli in the good times and the bad.However, when you pickup Aztec, don't expect a quick read, for it is 1000+ pages, but expect to live, or at least dream of life among the Mexica people for days to come. Jennings has finished this race first place."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Gary Jenning's 1980's series \\"Aztec\\" reads more like a thrilling and dramatic behind-the-scenes expose of Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. This is book one, and it is followed by Aztec Autum and Aztec Blood, the last which takes place in Spain. This novel has its ups and downs. Jennings spent years researching the language, culture and history of the Aztec Empire so that he was able to bring it to stunningly graphic life in highly descriptive scenes. The principal characters are well-developed and sympathetic, particularly the \\"good\\" Aztecs, namely our hero Mixtli \\"Dark Cloud\\" and his family. Through Mixtli's eyes we see the world of the Aztec, which was a dangerous and exciting world. Human sacrifices, war, honor, sex, violence and corrupt Spanish missionaries and conquistadores in pursuit of gold and fame. Mixtli, a humble villager, rises from his poverty to the position of scribe and later warrior. In this way, Jennings allows us to see the varying social classes within the Aztec social structure. Scribes were educated professional writers and translators, the equivalent of business men today. Mixtli travels to Guatemala, where he makes business deals with the Maya, who were the enemy of the Aztec and are thus characterized in a malign manner. The life of the warrior is also described but does not take a prominent place in the novel. The warriors wage war with other tribes for dominion of Mexico, for victory of their gods. The Spanish become foreign white devils who wish to destroy the entire Aztec race and clear out the land for Spanish colonies. This is an epic book, an Aztec equivalent of Shogun by James Clavell. Nevertheless, if this book were made into a film, it would be rated R and the sex scenes are wild enough to be featured in hardcore pornography. Unfortunately, the majority if not all the females in this novel are treated as sex toys and not empowered women in their own right. It's a man's book, if you really think about it. And therefore, men who normally don't read historical fiction would be attracted to this book for the violence and the sex and the glorified males in the novel. Overall, an interesting read. Look for other Jennings historical novels, but be warned, for they are graphic, bizarre and sprawling works of heroes overcoming obstacles for the sake of honor."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I've given away many copies of this book to people I know and like. Every one has called to thank me. It is without a doubt one of the most brilliant books I've ever read. Author Jennings has created a whole world that may well have existed just as he's described it. He pulls no punches, and describes this world in all its detail, good and bad. You will come to love and appreciate the old Aztec, Mixtli. His life adventures will astound you, and along the way you'll learn more than you realize. Jennings is a master at building up tension points. There are a few places in this book where I just gasped and had to put it down. He toys with your emotions, and grips you like few authors know how. Courage, treachery, brutality, creativity, destruction, determination, futility, tenderness, tragedy, blind hatred and eternal love - everything is there. The end of the chapter where Mixtli talks about his Zyana is so lyrically beautiful and touching that even now it brings tears to my eyes to just think about it. (And I'm a 50+ male, not some sappy teenager.) You will not escape this, either. No book of fiction I have ever read remains so much in my mind. I can visualize whole passages even though it has been years since I read it for the first time. You'll read it and enjoy it again and again.If you remember nothing else from this review: This is one story that will be with you - always."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"A superior read for those seeking an epic adventure ride, inside a historically accurate novel. This is the life and times of Mixtli, an Aztec citizen, ....one time warrior, merchant, teacher, royal attach&eacute; and many others. A picture of what it may have been like inside the magnificent Empire of the Aztec.You will begin the story with an elaborately written request from the rulers of Spain and Catholic Church; to write down for posterity, a history of the now conquered Aztec Empire and a depiction of its former state..... supposedly to ease the conscience of the powers in Spain (Cortez having been directed to completely obliterate the art, culture, architecture and language of the Aztec people) This is the start of a long and interesting tale.If you pick up this novel for historical depictions and accuracy, I promise you won't be disappointed. As an educated person of Spanish and Oneida Indian descent, as a North American (in the southwest), and just plain my humble opinion, Gary Jennings did his research for this novel. As you travel with the main character, you will taste, feel, see and hear all the architecture, colors, scents, artistic talents, courage, blood lust, tragedies, loves, engineering feats, people and scenery of a time that once was, through the eyes of someone who was there when it was the center of the universe.Before Mexico city was Mexico City, into the beginnings of the Aztec peoples then on through to it's glory then ultimate conquer and subjugation to Spain and the Catholic Church. This is a riveting story, woven with colorful threads, through the experiences, memories, and actions of one man.I cannot imagine anyone attempting to try and develop a film version of Aztec. The many nuances and difficult ideas would be difficult to depict, it is a long book.... But not too long. Don't worry. .... I admit a film version would be something I wouldn't mind seeing in my life time.The explicit sexual encounters, I thought were unnecessary, and could have done without. Artistic license or something, I suppose the author thought these had to be there, in detail...I don't know.There are many tragic characters in this book, the Tapir Woman is the most tragic of all. You will understand, when you read the book. and although for me, that was 27 years ago, I know you also will not forget...... \\"the sound of small bells ringing\\" ***** FIVE STARS"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Before a day just 2 months ago, I must confess I had never even heard of Gary Jennings. I now must admit I'm sorry he passed away. Aztec proved to be one of the most engrossing books I've ever read, if by no means an easy read.I happen to be one of these people who totally love historical novels--I'm certainly awaiting the conclusion of Morgan Llywelyn's Irish Century series, and Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series captured my heart (as well as bringing me closer to the woman I now call my wife). Perhaps not all of them--I tried Mary Renault as a young teenager and just couldn't get started; I may try her again now I'm a grown-up. Of late, my imagination has been captured by the First North Americans series that Kathleen and Michael Gear have written; reading Aztec, then, seemed a logical move. And while wandering through a local bookstore (which shall remain nameless) one afternoon in late March, I made this discovery and decided to go for it. I'm very glad I did.Others have commented that Aztec starts out slowly, and I'll not gainsay them; I admit being disturbed and put off by the racism displayed in Bishop Zumarraga's letters to the King of Spain, but they are a fair representation of the white man's mindset of the 16th Century (sad to say). As the story progressed, I came to quite enjoy the moments when Mixtli (our protagonist) would unconsciously tweak the friars writing down his story with some bit of gross indecency. But indeed, once you've gotten through the first 75 pages, the action picks up, and you're thoroughly engrossed in Mixtli's many adventures.He goes from being a middle-class nonentity to (at first) a pretender to nobility, to finally being honoured as a noble by the Aztec King Montezuma; and he does seem to have a Forrest Gump-like ability of being in the right place at the right time. However, it's not eyeglasses he invents--merely a monocle, strictly from his own need--and he does discover oil at one point. All his sexual adventures seem to end in tragedy--his sister (with whom he has an indecently incestuous relationship) is taken away from him because of their love (to suffer a horrible fate which I won't reveal here); he loses his wife and daughter to floods and sacrifices, and even his closest friends are victims of betrayals (some of them his own for reasons better left to the potential reader to explore). In no way could this book, should it ever be made into a film, work properly with the typical \\"Hollywood ending.\\" It is a tragedy, and must be viewed as such.But all of its characters are refreshingly human and not at all difficult to visualise; whoever said that even Hernan Cortes is treated with some dignity (and not painted as an evil daemon) was right on the money. You will unquestionably be sad when it's all over, although I admit I began to hurry a bit towards the end. 1036 pages can be daunting even for the hardiest reader--but it ultimately rewards your dedication."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Occasionally there comes along a book which, once finished, causes you to sit and contemplate in silence its final words.Aztec was at times exciting, overzealous, profound, gratuitous, cheerful, and captivating, but on the whole it was tragic, for it is not so much a tale of a dying empire (and the means by which it died) but the life of one man and the fact that no matter how much we do, there are always regrets and missed opportunties. I have to say that having finished the novel, I feel unsettled and profoundly melancholy, but I wish I could read it again for the first time.To those considering purchasing: I urge you not to read this book. For during every future reading endeavor you will likely be thinking: \\"I wish I was reading Aztec.\\""},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"You will like this book if: you like historical fiction, you like erotic fiction, you like catptivating, gripping, doesnt-let-go-of-you fiction, if you like fiction, period! Like many others have stated, this is a great book, a work of genius. It's such a long book that you would think it's be hard to get through, or might get boring. Not at all, at the end of nearly a thousand pages, you wish it wasn't over.This book is not for the light-hearted. The plot, action, and imagery is often dark, graphic, sometimes disturbing, and other times stimulating. If you're looking for a conventional book, you might not like this.Overall, after the many books I've read, this one stands out in mind more than most - I wish i could give it 6 stars. When you read this, the world around melts away and you forget you're in the 21st century, stiing at home in a chair. With all of the hero's journeys and adventures, you're right there with him - you ARE him. He's easy to identify with, and he's the opposite sex from me.Buy it, read it, keep it. You'll love it."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"A big thank you to the reviewers of this book whose high rating of it enticed me to order it. I got absolutely lost in this literary delight during the festive season and whilst perhaps of the thought that the author could have summarized more the saga towards its ending, it remains indeed a historical epic - in my view the Aztec equivalent of Ken Follett's medieval English saga of \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I read Aztec for the first time over 15 years ago. I am now reading it for the 86th time and it is still new to me. Every time I read it is like visiting an old friend. No other work (music, art or literature) has ever touched me the way this book has. You are instantaly transported back in time to an ancient civilization and you never want to leave. My only hope is that it is never translated into a movie or miniseries. Gary Jenning's descriptive narrative could not be done justice on the screen. HOLLYWOOD, LEAVE THIS ONE ALONE!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This is a wonderful novel set in \\"The One World\\"--the land of pre-Columbian Mexico/Central America as it was called by the inhabitants. It is about the life of one Aztec adventurer immediately prior to, and then during, the coming of Captain Cortez and the Spanish Conquistadores.Jennings' novel presents a fascinating society utterly unlike our own, but every bit as rational and civilized, albeit that it had certain attributes we now consider barbaric, e.g. human sacrifice as a component of religious rituals. Jennings makes the point that many or most of the Indians disliked this ritual as well, and did their best to simply avoid and ignore it. This novel offers a sympathetic and insightful portrayal of The One World. Whether it is accurate I cannot say. But it is a vivid and engrossing setting and story.The storyline is rather simple: it is about the life of one member of the Mexica nation (Aztecs) from his early youth to the arrival of Cortez and the conquest. It is a wonderful, captivating, and sometimes moving story. The novel does not dawdle--the storyline is brisk, the prose crisp.My only criticism of the novel is that it is punctuated with soft and medium pornography throughout. In this particular novel, this adds nothing. Unfortunately, this is characteristic of most or all of Jennings' novels. It ruined some of them. Here it is only an annoyance--primarily because it causes me not to recommend the book to my children, which is a shame because otherwise this book would be a great way to introduce kids to another culture and civilization.This is a novel well worth reading and keeping."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"As a native of Mexico, I have always been fascinated by our pre-columbian history, over the years I have read many accounts on the subject, and clearly Mr. Jennings must have read some of those same Books ! he did such a great job in research for his magnificant novel .

Almost impossible to put down!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"After reading some novels about the aztec culture, this is the one I still like the best."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"From start to finish, I couldn't put this book down! Mr. Jennings definately &quot;did his homework.&quot; This book gave me a new perspective on the plight of the Mexican Indians. I've often felt empathy towards the Indians of North America during the &quot;era of discovery&quot;, but never really gave much thought to what was going on south of the border.Mr. Jennings made everything so believable and real. I felt I was actually living the life of Mixtli - Dark Cloud. I felt myself growing up and growing old with Mixtli as he recounted his life. I didn't want this book to end...I can't wait to read the sequel!!!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"If you have any interest in the history of the Aztecs, this book is indispensible. To put my impressions into words, This is the best book ever written about them. You really feel that you live along with the main character, Mixtli. Gary Jennings deserves far greater praise than mine for his novels...I have read Aztec,Raptor,and The Journeyer (sp?), and been blown away by their wondrous attention to detail every time. I only wish I could encourage him firsthand instead of blathering on the internet. All personal considerations aside, I would encourage everyone with an interest in history to check out his novels... You will be unable to put them down...literally!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Aztec was an experience in reading, history and knowledge. It is a story which stands out even if you glorify the faults in the book. The courage of Jennings as an author to offend the sensibilities of rogue Christians is difficult to ignore. It is one book, and perhaps the only book that educated me beyond my endurance, and supported my long standing anger against religious colonization. I thank Jennings for his gift of Aztec to our world. Anyone, or only those who can shamelessly accept the truth, may read this book otherwise they would only end up in disgorging their intolerant reviews. Gary Jennings is great for all times to come."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Jennings has a wonderful style of taking you through, not only generations but very detailed generations. He gives you a very real sense of the people and culture that he is writing about. You come away with a very complete view of the topic at hand."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"One thing that is as accurate in this book is the accuracy of what has been told of the beliefs of the Aztec's. However there is still quite a bit of expansion in the decriptions here. Once you get past that it seems to be structured to support soft porn for men in the endless sexual encounters of the story teller. If you take that away, and you are left with a story telller that has contradicitons in what he says and believes and then does in actually opposite ways. So you continue to read only to discover that he never gets to the point of the begining of the story that caught your interest. While he plays hard on the Spanish explorers, I have found that in many ways he was too gentle and held back much of what the Spanish have done in the past that is historical writing and is provable.I rated it a good read, tho struggling at times."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"AZTEC - part history - part fiction - partly the result of archeology and anthropology - is, for those of us who are tired of the dry, bare bones of what is known about the Aztecs, an excellent compantion to Bernal Diaz's &quot;Discovery and Conquest of Mexico.&quot; Diaz, a member of Cortez's rapacious band, wrote this excellent memior in his retirement, having gotten out of Tenochtitlan with his skin intact. It is probably the most definitive work on the Spanish conquest of Mexico,but is ably abetted by many works from priests who, in the name of the Cross, burned the codices of the people massacred by war, European diseases, and, laterally, the Inquisition and slavery. In short, they burned the Aztec writings that would have told us much about them. We have excellent historical references by the destroyers, but, until fairly recently, we have had little intelligible information about the vastness of the empire that was destroyed along with its cultural richness. Archeology and anthropology, have been plodding along in the last two centuries belatedly trying to repair this atrocity. Now comes Mr. Jennings with his excellent ability to weave together the widespread strands of this information and put them together in a highly readable narrative that tells the other side of the story with, no doubt, &quot;poetic&quot; license. This is not a poor-boy-made-good-in-an-exotic-setting story. This is an attempt to emulate what everyday life must have been like at various social levels and geographical settings at the apex - and the death knell - of the empire of the eagle. In doing this, he has made an excellent contribution to the understanding of the reader of just what Mexico was before the crusade for gold and the Cross destroyed an entire civilization. Even its mythology was virtually destroyed. Even better, he has painted a graphic picture of the fate of the s! ubjugated...Thank you, Mr. Jennings. Your work would make a magnificent epic movie."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Far and away my best read so far this year. We have built up so many legends about the Aztecs in our minds, with no understanding. Although he goes a little bit overboard in the &quot;evil white man&quot; theme, we did do a terrible thing destroying this culture. The characters were fully explored and realistic, the plot and writing style admirable. It is a huge book that I just could not put down. I found myself planning my day around &quot;when will I have time to read more of this.&quot; The only negatives were the emphasis on sex and evil WASPs, which were far outweighed by the grandeur of the story. If you like this one, try 1812 by David Nevin too (almost, but not quite, as good)."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"The story is compelling and the presentation magnificent andunique. I am reading it for the 5th or 6th time and find itbetter every time. Jennings' writing is complex and challengingbut never overbearing. As I read the pages I believe the story,the history, the characters and the conclusions. My very wornhard copy has 754 pages and I reach 754 way too soon. I found&quot;Journeyor&quot; almost as good, &quot;Spangle&quot; less so, and &quot;Raptor&quot; onlyfair. &quot;Sew The Seeds of Hemp&quot; was entirely different, but agood read if you like Jennings. I only wish Jennings was more prolific."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Gary Jennings eloquent writing will transport the reader to the incredible world of the Aztecs.His well researched history,blended with captivating characters and narrative,provide a rare insight to a mysterious ancient culture"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I still have the last 30 pages to read, but I hesitate to finish it, because I'll miss it. I read the bulk of the book in Mexico & it gave me a great sense of the history of the country and its people. I will definitely read the other Aztec books by Jennings."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I've loved this novel for its insight in the great Aztec civilization,and the poignant depiction of its fall.Mixtli is wholly plausible,so are the narrow-minded priests (Aztec and Christians) Indeed the rogue of heretics is comparable,in barbarian cruelty,to human sacrifice.But old Gary really loves gore,sadism and cruelty.He depicts them with the utter gusto of the dedicated algolagnic.You can say he loves SPLATTER and enjoys it. Well,I don't. And even less when gore mixes with incest, paedophilia, and other perverse sex acts, depicted for the sake of it."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I read this when it was first published in 1980 and still can't get it out of my mind. Jennings lived in Mexico for twelve years researching the Aztec civilization. It is a violent and disturbing book, human sacrifices are never pleasant, but it is also a very human book. If you read it, you will never forget it."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Powerful and moving account of the Aztec life, culture and their dismal enslavement by the conquerors. While ficitional, it stays true to historical facts and paints a vivid picture of a culture thought dead, but kept very much alive in its many descendants. It pays homage to the survivor spirit of the Nahuan people. Gary did his research well. I highly recommend his book."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This book is incredible. It will change the way that you look at everything. Crisp details and descriptions of persons, places and events make for a great read. You will feel this book happen around you as you read it."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"The way that Gary Jennings wrote this book was super extraordinary!!! He makes it seem as if the main character Mixtli (one of his many, many names as most &quot;Aztec&quot; readers learn) was part of the aztec's history. He wrote it as if Mixtli experienced it all. It's truely an amazing book. As many others agree, my first thought of reading this book was, &quot;Oh no. Here goes another boring history book.&quot; But NO!! If I would've had time, I would've finished the book in at most a week, but at the pace of 50 pages a day, it took me only about a month to read it.If you would like to read another magnificent novel, I would defenitely recommend &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot; by Ken Follet.I promise that if you liked &quot;Aztec&quot;, you defenitely will not regret taking my recommendation."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"\\"Aztec\\" by Gary Jennings is easily one of the best novels I've ever read. Jennings uses the life of one man, Mixtli, to tell the saga of the fall of the Mexica, the people we know as the Aztecs. During his long life, Mixtli is a scribe, a trader, a soldier, a mapmaker, a lover, and an adventurer who bears witness to his people reaching their greatest heights and their all too rapid descent from power.Like his nation, Mixtli rises from poor beginnings, reaches a position of great wealth and power, and loses everything with the arrival of the Spanish. He tells his story to a panel of Spanish priests who have been ordered by the King of Spain to record the story of the Aztecs. Mixtli weaves his own tale with that of his people much to the consternation of the Bishop of Mexico. A letter from the Bishop to his King disagreeing with everything that follows precedes each chapter of Mixtli's tale.I have no idea how historically accurate Jennings' work is. I only know that it is a fascinating story about a people who developed a civilization that was, in many ways, more advanced than the one that replaced it. It also raises serious questions about who had the civilized culture and who were the actual barbarians.I do have one caveat for any potential readers. \\"Aztec\\" is not for everyone. It contains explicit descriptions of human sacrifice, maimings, cannibalism, and all manner of sexual activity including acts of homosexuality and incest. However, for the non-squeamish, it is a great, great work of recent literature."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I read this book while I was 15 years old and still in HighSchool. I still have that book, and today, I am purchasing &quot;Aztec&quot; in hardcover from amazon.com.This book shall last through the generations of my family (if I have to force it down their throats AND make them chew). A WONDERFUL story based on fact with multi-layered characters, amazing imagery AND (just to astound us more) historically correct (with a little room for author's invention).An epic. I dream of and dread a movie. Buy it (or borrow it ...gasp) and read it. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I realize I am one of the few who don't have a rave for this book. I bought it because I have recently began to read about Mexican history, which I find fascinating, along with the people. However, I regard the Aztecs as a blot on their history much the same as slavery is a blot on ours. Thank God Cortez prevented this bloodthirsty, cruel, perverted group from spreading by conquering, enslaving, and slaughtering the people they overcame. The Spanish were a nasty group as well, but the Aztecs had it coming.That rant out of the way, this is actually a very well researched, well written book in very many ways. The plot is fast moving and holds your interest through the 700 plus pages. Jennings has a gift for description-you feel like you are right there looking over the landscape and seeing what Dark Cloud, the main character, sees. The main reason I had to give it a 3 star is for the perverted sex, over kill (pun intended) on the human sacrifice descriptions, and the absolute degradation of women in the book in graphic detail. I feel these things took away from the otherwise brilliant writing technique of Jennings. On the other hand, sadly I realize that these things are all too often what \\"sells\\" a book now days.I had to laugh to see previous readers describe Dark Cloud as an Aztec Forrest Gump. That is very apt--but it makes for a great story with peoples and descriptions that would be difficult to describe without it. Dark Cloud is writing to the Spanish in a long letter which forms the book. He very subtly and sometimes not so subtly jabs at the hyprocrisy of the Catholic Church, while at the same time being a bit of a hypocrite himself. He thinks human sacrifice is OK--until it happens to his own family and friends, at which time he destroys the killers. I have to think that is how Cortez and company felt when they saw total strangers being sacrificed--they wanted to destroy that horrific system--and add to their gold collection. The Spanish had a lot of help from other indigenous peoples who sided with them to help rid the country of the Aztecs--that tells you something.Jennings make Dark Cloud a likable, rather sensible kind of guy if not a little exaggerated. Dark Cloud discovers eyeglasses, oil, forging weapons and many other things. He is easily the most humane Aztec in the book. The dialogue in the book is great, and the descriptions are just marvelous, if you can get past the perversion and slaughter.All in all, this is a great book with some serious flaws but still worth the read."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This gripping novel, well researched and at times utterly facinating, is marred by an incredible number of pointless yet lengthy sex scenes that seem to take up half the book and almost never develope plot or character. A pity."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Having read James Clavell, this book was a disappointment. I was glued to this book after about 400 pages (and thats a lot of reading) and the next 700 pages or so were entertaining but there were often moments when I was forced to gloss over paragraphs. The book is the narrative of an aztec native, who is interrupted every chapter and sometimes in the middle of the text by the conquering Spanish for whom he is detailing his life. This is more often than not very very annoying. If you can ignore such interruptions, and the excessive details thrown in for not so good measure, you might enjoy the book. However the view that this provides into the ancient aztecs is truely marvellous."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I found \\"Aztec\\" to be a very captivating read. The colorful and graphic depictions of certain scenes in the life of the main character are actually a plus, since they add considerable verve to a narrative as long as this one. The only thing I missed were subplots told from a standpoint other than the narrator's first person. Bishop Zumarraga's letters to the Spanish King give the reader some respite, but a few intertwined accounts added to the main plot might have brought more variety to the style."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"The writing was uninspiring and demonstrated the author's complete obsession with sex. Graphic depictions of sex acts among characters with whom the reader does not identify did not serve to enhance the plot, but managed only to divert attention from the more appealing elements of the narrative - descriptions of the historical society of the Aztecs and the Spanish conquerers. The review of Stuart Mirsky (please read above) is accurate."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I liked it, but unfortunatly the guy seemed to love adding the fact that the main dude in the book had sex with a 7 year old boy in graphic depiction, had sex with his 13 year old sister when he was like 10. Im suprised that the pedo sex and pedo incest sex got published. didnt add a thing to the book except to be disturbing"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Wow! One thousand and more pages of historical fiction surrounding the half-century leading up to the last days of the Aztec peoples. This story by Gary Jennings revolves around a single Aztec, or Mex&iacute;catl, named Mixtli, or Dark Cloud. He recounts the details of his life from his early child hood memories, to his rising through the ranks of Mex&iacute;ca working class and nobility, to the last days of the great Aztec empire as crushed by Hernan Cort&eacute;s. The dense and long chapters/ramblings are occasionally interspersed with letters from the Christian priest, who supervises the transcribing of his stories, letters directed toward the King of Spain.Know before you begin this book that it is more than 1000 pages long, and the pages are packed with many words. Unless you have several days to devote to reading it, do not expect to get through it in one sitting.While this reviewer knows nothing about Aztec historical fact, the story presented here provides an enjoyable and exciting exploration into what the life of one Azt&eacute;ca might have been like. The story is compelling and a worthwhile read. I've come away from the book wanting to explore more details of the real Aztec history, and perhaps this book will do so for many others as well. Underlining the latter third of the book, of course, is the reality that European conquerors decimated and destroyed a thriving and advanced culture all in the name of Manifest Destiny. You cannot walk away from this book without having to consider what would life in the new world, Mexico, North America, Canada, what would life have been like today for these cultures if white men had not so boldly and shamelessly invaded, conquered, decimated, and infiltrated their very lives? And of course, the next question becomes, Are we still doing more of the same but in a more palatable gloss of making the world safe for democracy?This book, being published over two decades ago, clearly shows some of the influence of the late 70s/early 80s with it's rampant exploration of sexual themes, incest, fredom of the man to romp sexually through anyone and anything he desires. It also shows way too much influence of American culture. At it's best, the book is an entertaining and thoroughly developed plunge into an alternate and perhaps lost culture. At its worst, Jennings has given us an Aztec Forrest Gump. So many things seem to happen to our hero, Mixtli, that it becomes a bit unreal at times. He has a Revered Speaker (an Aztec King, or President) take a liking to him as a boy and choose to give him free education, He goes to war and happens to kill the most fearsome opponent even though he is extremely nearsighted, He more than once becomes a successful merchant by bringing to his community some of the most exotic trades ever found, He discovers the true origins of the Aztec peoples, He advances himself to nobility, and He even becomes Christian, of a sort. I never cared much for Forrest Gump, and have a difficult time stomaching similar characters. But, even so, this Mixtli Gump does usually earn his rewards in a detailed and satisfying manner. His cousin Forrest, on the other hand, is a joke =)My most concerned criticism with this book is the assumption that the ancient culture is a reflection of the desires and values of American Capitalism. Too much of the Aztec way of life seems to be rooted in free trade (capitalism), a very defined nobility hierarchy, a warfaring and conquering daily life, and the premise that one can advance up through the hierarchy through a man's deeds, as our hero Mixtli does. Yes, there is a great deal of time spent on the details of the various celebrations and sacrifices which are a daily part of the culture, but the rest of the book seemed to be too much a reflection of western capitalism. I find it amusing that so many contemporary writers, historians, and scholars tend to impose a hierarchical system on ancient cultures. Why must they have noble classes, middle classes, and slaves? Why do they need to reflect our western economic structure? Why does everything need to be valued in terms of trade currency? Why must we assume that our way of life today is the penultimate system and that any previous great civilization by necessity MUST have had a similar structure to their lives? Where is the paradigm shift? There hasn't been one in 500 years of white occupation of Mexico? I don't think so.Unfortunately, there is little to corroborate my concern with these details. As pointed out by Jennings' Mixtli, there is little, if any, evidence of the actual histories of the Aztecs, or Mex&iacute;catl, or whatever ancestors there once were.The book gets three stars. It could have received four if it wasn't so over-laden with a capitalist and western overtones."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I know I'm in the minority but I wish I'd never read it! If you're not into blood and gore, don't read this book!I probably would have forgotten about the blood and gore which permeated the book but two things in the book haunt me more than 20 years later:1. The visual image of Tzitzilini with the one tear rolling down her face as she sat on display and how she went from being a beautiful, happy girl to a sideshow freak.2. The sight of the nighttime festival with his daughter dancing happily around the fire, only it wasn't his daughter...What amazes me is how many people not only loved the book, but reread it over and over. It's got almost a five star rating and a ton of positive reviews. Yes, it probably offered a glimpse into history but that's one glimpse I'd rather not get! We really are the savage beast inside."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"How do you think inhabitants of Mexico in 1530 AD reckoned time? Certainly not by minutes and seconds - but the main character uses such increments in the narrative (e.g., third paragraph, pg. 316 of the paperback edition). Modern man, with highly accurate timepieces, reckons to the second and below, but that was not the case in 16th century Mexico. When the author injects such a modern view of time into his narrator much of the historical flavor is lost, having become questionable."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Disfrut&eacute; de este libro enormemente. S&oacute;lo una nota de advertencia (no lea lo que sigue si planea leer el libro): ning&uacute;n inquisidor o autoridad eclesi&aacute;stica en general habr&iacute;a ejecutado JAM&Aacute;S a un prisionero en el cual nada menos que el Empreador espa&ntilde;ol hubiera mostrado inter&eacute;s. Me sorprende que Mr Jennings, tan detallista en otros aspectos, se haya plegado tan acr&iacute;ticamente al recurso facilista de la \\"leyenda negra\\".In enjoyed this book enormously. A warning note only (don't read this if you plan to read the book): no Inquisitor, no clerical authority would EVER have executed a prisoner on whom no less than the emperor had showed interest. I am disappointed that Mr Jennings, so detailed on other aspects, adheres so uncritically to the easy and unaccurate \\"black legend\\" Protestant clich&eacute;."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Regarding the review titled &quot;Minor Errors&quot; found below. The reviewer cites tha Aztec use of seconds and minutes as a flaw that ruined his appreciation of this book. The passage the reviewer is referring to quotes the Spanish conquerers citing of minutes and seconds, not the &quot;main character&quot; as he states.Secondly the reference was made as part of a calculation to the measurements of time which the europeans of that time were certainly familiar.All in all great book! Don't let the previous misinformed review discourage you!This is an epic tale that pulls you into the Aztec (pre-conquistidor) world. One of the greatest early civilizations in history."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This is an excellent fictional account of life before the conquistadors. I am typically wary of 1,000+ page books, but I was not disappointed with the story, and had a tough time putting it down. Quite a tapestry is woven by the narrator Mixtli of the 15th century Mexican &quot;One World&quot;, and what makes the book captivating are his travelogues including adventures, sexual diversions, and different ancient cultures. All this without the attention to detail and accuracy that Jennings injects would have been lost. All in all, this is an excellent book!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK. One that you will remember for a long time. It is historical fiction at it's best. A narrative of the life of what we call an Aztec and his life. The book was occasionally hard to follow, but well worth reading. It did have very detailed sex and violence. It was happy and sad, but just great. If you are a fan of Michener, Clavell, Jakes, etc...this is a book for you."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"My dad recommended this book to me and I've now read it 5 times and I discover something new each time I read it! I'm searching for a hardcover edition....anyone have any information?"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"After having lived and worked among the mexican people for two years, I found this book to be absolutley amazing. Part of my time in Mexico was spent in the Huastecas, a land that has been touched very little by passing of a few centuries. I have a great love for Mexico, and this book has only helped me to better understand a people that I lived with for a few years. I was amazed at how mcuh of the Mexican culture survived the brutal spanish conquest, and how much of it is existant inour own society. (Words like chocolate, mesquite, etc.) I cold not help but think that the great tragedy of the fallen empire could have been avoided. A deeply moving and poignant novel, I recommend it with the highest regards."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"In Aztec, Gary Jennings has created a time machine that pulls the reader back over 400 years to witness the destuction of the America's last great native civilization. The narrative is so beautifully descriptive, one is surprised to find they are in the present when pausing to catch their breath. The characters met and the lessons learned remain with the reader forever. I have read this book when it first came out, then again eight years later, and yet again this year. Reading it once again around 2010 is something I am eagerly awaiting. P.S. Mr. Jennings &quot;The Journeyer&quot; was just as good."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"You'll never put this book down once you start reading it"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"when I first started reading this bookI was a little annoyed at all the foreign words (i.e. Mitzpantico, Nezahuilpili, &amp;c.) but after a short while, I was so captivated by the storythat these foreign words came as second nature. A fascinating book about a fascinating people. This book can be a little graphic at times but it is essential to the story. I will be reading the sequel soon."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I'm a huge historical fiction buff, and even I was put off by the size of this book. When I finally did break down and buy it I couldn't put it down. To be honest, my life completely revolved around this book. The mail piled up, bills went unpaid ... it's *that* good. I'm a fast reader, but even I had to pause and savor certain pages. The descriptions are &quot;beyond description&quot; and the characters must have been real to be portrayed so vividly. Just read the book."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"As many of the other customer reviews have already pointed out, this book is a masterpiece of historical fiction which keeps you up reading late into the night as you can't put the book down. I enjoyed the book so much that I immediately bought the sequel and am finding it just as intriguing. Gary Jennings clarifies how &quot;primitive&quot; the Aztecs were compared to the Conquistadors: throughout the book I found myself thinking of the Conquistadors as the primitive, barbaric ones while I rooted for the Aztecs to defeat the invasion even though the end result is already known. An informative, funny, sad book which leaves you wanting more. Journeyor is definitely going to be my next purchase!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I liked reading this book and did not put it down till I was through to the end. It is very interesting, as the author has described the fascinating world of the Aztecs very well and with a lot of deep knowledge. I kind of felt right there among them, really living and feeling with Mixtli, the main character. However, there is a bit too much porno (not romance!) for my taste. I did love this book while I was reading it, and, because I am really interested in the pre-Columbian cultures, I went out to find similar novels about similar topics and found out that there are even better books out there - I recommend the following book to everyone who is interested in Aztecs, Incas, etc. &quot;The Incas&quot; by Daniel Peters."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"As a big fan of the historical novel, (Clavelle, Michner, et al..),I have got to say that this novel really got to me.I first read &quot;Aztec&quot; in 1980. I read it over every 5 years or so. Let me compare it with &quot;Andersonville&quot;(7.5) or &quot;Shogun&quot;(8). This book got me interested in the Spanish conquests of both the Aztecs and the Inca. You become so engrossed with the story you may throw the book down at one point (as I did). What a GREAT story this is. It has it all,sex, religion, history and much more. The only problem with this wonderful book is that you will never find its' equal. The closest I've ever found is another novel by Jennings.&quot;Journeyor&quot;(9)It is almost in the same league as &quot;Aztec&quot;.(about Marco Polo and his travels). I am so happy Jennings is about to release &quot;Aztec Autumn&quot;. I've waited 16 years for more &quot;Aztec&quot;, maybe this is it!? Read &quot;Aztec&quot;. You'll read it over and over."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This is a fictional life story of Mixtli, a boy, a brother, a student, a slave, a warrior, a husband &amp; lover...I don't want to give too much away. It's absolutely engrossing. This was a character I knew by the end of this novel. I have not felt such a connection with any character in a fictional book, except maybe &quot;Lestat&quot;, but that's different...this is a more personal account. I loved this book, didn't want it to end in fact, and savored the ending on a bench in the sun in my backyard. Gary Jennings can really make pages come alive. I was back in time in the Aztec empire and loving every minute of it (almost because you know what happened to the Aztecs!). It's worth reading again and in fact, I went out and bought a hard cover edition just to have....it's a keeper"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I am incapable of formulating the proper words to do this book justice. It is an incredible feat of writing - taking the reader on an incredible, thrilling, informative, vivid, heart-wrenching, exhilirating journey. Do not be daunted by this books size (over 1100 pages) - just do yourself the extreme favor of picking up a copy and starting to read. You'll never want to put it down, nor will you want it to end. This is historical fiction at its absolute finest."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Simply amazing!! I read peoples reviews who gave this book anything less than 4 stars, and surprise, surprise, most of their reviews on other books are extremely critical as well. Don't listen to them. If you have a passion for ancient cultures, are open minded and not easily offended, this book is for you! This man clearly did his research. Anyone who claims they could have predicted what life \\"really\\" would have been like in ancient Mexico, and thinks that there are discrepancies in this story has no way of proving it. Again, lets remind the critics that history is all interpretation. These differences can be so far as black and white. There is nothing wrong with filling in the blanks with your own marvelous imagination if you possess the talent for it, as Mr. Jennings obviously does.Oh, and by the way, about the book being too long; it wasn't long enough! I wish it were 10,000 pages!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I can only reiterate all of the praise for Aztec. It's a truly special work of historical fiction that, even after 1400 pages, leaves you wanting more."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"First read it several years ago in high school. Was completely enthralled from beginning to end. A mix of fact and fiction that meshed perfectly without rambling on. If could have only 1 book for the rest of my life, it would be AZTEC!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"When I found my hard copy at a yard sale amongst other interesting books I purchased I never planned on reading this huge book. Thank God I did! What an incredibly artistic way of introducing a person into the absolutely fascinating history of the areas that included the Aztecatl. Or perhaps one may prefer that to be Mexicatl since this is what became of the Aztecatl. The Triple Alliance, the Tolteca origins, the daily beauty and dignity of everyday circumstance. The coincidence, the verility, the pride, the love, the frugality, the shrewdness, the very Heart of The One World, and the splendor, the majestic splendor of the craftsmanship and the love, boundless love... It will draw you in until you drop your ethnocentricities and come to think after all, that the sacrifices were altogether not that more absurd than many other superstitions viewed in the light of their day, many of which are still employed today. I've read many books, am a big fan of Central American cultures but never really understood the Aztec part and always viewed them as latecomers on the Mesoamerican scene. This book enlightened me to the importance and grandieur of the Aztecs. Oh and not to forget, I still miss verile ol' Blood Glutton and the \\"Genaro-like\\" Nezahualpili, and I'll save a soft spot in my heart for Tlilectic-Mixtli &lt;Dark Cloud>! A whole life in one book, and a most filled one at that. Goodbye dear friends, I'm off to Tenochtitlan!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This book I must say is the best book I have ever read in my life so far. This book not only is educational, but very entertaining by the way it is so well written and researched by Mr. Jennings (Which took him 12 years to write). When reading this book you really feel transported back in time of the Aztec Empire. Being of Mexican decent and born in the U.S. I only had a little understanding of my culture, but this has change after I read this book. Not only do I have a better understanding of the Mexican culture; I can now make the many connections from the Aztec culture to the Mexican culture. Please keep in mind that this book starts off slow, but once you get through the first 100 pages you will not be able to put it down. After you are done reading it you will be amaze on how rich the history of Mexico is and it is just right next door to the U.S. This book should be made into a mini-series or hopefully a major motion picture."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Let me first settle with the (very few) unfavorable remarks in Amazon.com customer reviews of &quot;Aztec&quot;: No human can write a perfect novel. If your standard is perfection, perhaps you should seek other forms of entertainment.Second, let me explain why I probably responded more powerfully to &quot;Aztec&quot; than most readers would. I survived extreme poverty, humiliation, and violence in my youth. Then I left my home town to enjoy a successful music career for 15 years. While performing at night I completed a graduate business education during the day. Now I travel around the world for one of the largest corporations in the US. I have literally thousands of great friends from street musicians to CEOs all over the world. I am in love with my beatiful wife and five children. Finally, I am part Mexican.Given my background, I felt as though Mr. Jennings had spent several years writing my life story in the context of the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs.Mixtli, the Aztec who's life the book describes in wonderful detail, had an even more adventuresome life than mine - by far. He was both a worse and better man than I. But in the sense that his life followed unlikely, fascinating twists, in that he made friends in many lands, in that he rose from humble origins to great business success, in that he experienced one great romance, and in that he lived first hand one of the most fascinating periods in history, the match between his life and mine are extraordinary.So I loved this book as much as any other I've read, and I've read more than my share.Even if your life didn't match Mixtli's, I strongly recommend this book. You'll get ten times more entertainment and education from your $10 investment than you'll get anywhere else."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I could go on and write about how Jennings masterfully tells the story of the culture and the people of the ancient Aztec world. Or how the amazing stories telled through the eyes of the main character takes you on an amazing journies filled with blood, gore, sadness, and momements that are purely erotic. All I can really say about this book is get over the fact that it's 800 pages and just read it.

I first became aware of it, when I saw the man next to me reading a Spanish version on the metro.Two stops later a woman came into the car we were in, and at once set to continuing to read her copy -- Aztec in an English language paperback version.I raised my eyebrow at the man sitting beside me. He nodded.\\"Is it good?\\" I asked.\\"Unbelievable,\\" he said.So I ordered my copy from Amazon.comJennings is so skillful at plot that he weaves the fantastic story, from the point of view of a Mestic knight, through real historical events such as the arrival of Cortez.The Spanish appear much more cannibalistic than the Aztecs, whose religion involved human sacrifice and the eating of the victims' flesh, \\"well spiced.\\"The amount of cultural detail makes this a book you can't put down.Kyi May Kaung"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"If you want to be transported to the Pre-Columbian era, with quite a bit of reality, then this book is for you. I bought this for a friend since I got the Spanish version, and he has just loved it and haven't stopped reading it since it got in his hands. Jennings' depictions of the Mexica society prior to the arrival of the Spaniards is just marvelous, and quite accurate -being a Mexican myself, having learned this in books and school- with its amount of drama, action, suspense and intrigue (it's a novel after all). I've read 2 books by Gary Jennings so far and both have been really good. I strongly recommend the reading of \\"Aztec\\", if you're into historical novels, you're gonna love it!!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This book was an enjoyable read. It was also obvious that Mr. Jennings tried to give a good representation of what it would have been like to be on the receiving end of the Spanish conquest at a time when the Spanish acted a great deal like the Muslim invaders they finally completely expelled from the Iberian Peninsula in 1492. No matter what your political views and regardless as to your view of Catholicism, this book is a fascinating read. You cannot help but feel the protagonist's pain and share in his achievements. Mr. Jenning's writing was that good. He draws you into a world you can almost feel via in-depth character development. I was actually sad when the book ended - it was that good. It was so good that I re-read the book every five years or so. I also enjoyed the sequels. The setting for the story is so interesting and the real events that underlay the story so incredible that, combined with the excellent writing, this book should be a classic that never goes out of print. The only other historical novels that rival it are Herman Wouk's Winds of War and War and Remembrance"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This was the first Jennings book that broke out and the fourth I read.

Her last boyfriend before we met gave it to her as a gift since she was Mexican. She's not much of a reader and just put it aside. I saw the book in the house, but had never heard of it, and it was really long, so I never bothered to read it. Well 10 years later I was bored and looking for something to read around the house. I found the book again and decided what the heck, I'll check it out. I'm glad I did, because it is THE best book ever written. Most people, myself included, have no idea how advanced the Aztec civilization was before the Spanish came. Yes they were brutal, but advanced in many ways.Gary Jennings, the author, a white guy from Virginia, moved to Mexico for 12 years doing research before writing this book. I did not know it was a historical novel with many truthful events until after reading it. I reccommend this book to anyone who likes to read. Once you start, you can't stop. Do yourself a favor and buy this book!!!Joe"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Gary Jennings is one of the best historical authors out there. This book is the second of his that i've read.

I highly recommend it to anyone who loves to become one with a book. I'm going to send a copy to my honey who reminds me of Mixtli. :)"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I was completely unprepared for Aztec. One summer, I had nothing to read and I had no books in mind. I went to the large bookshelf upstairs and picked out the largest book. It was called Aztec. I started reading it and got sucked right in. After reading X-files, Star Wars, and Robin Cook, by the dozen, my mind had turned to putty. Aztec, though, cannot be compared to silly books like that. It had everything. The plot was so interesting, I could not believe it was based on actual facts. I went to the library and read about Aztecs. In school, I took the opportunity to study about the Aztec culture and history. Gary Jemming's book was not only a million times more entertaining, but it had more facts than all the books put together. If you are ever going to do a project on Aztecs, this book is number one on your list. I just finished it for the third time. The detail in the book is astounding. Who knows, someday someone may make a movie about it.This book has gone unnoticed for too long.Why do we have to read boring books in school because we can learn from them when we have Aztec? How come no-one has heard of Gary Jemmings? How come it's not required reading? I did not give a damn about Aztec history until I read Aztec. It is inspiring."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I have dreams that take me along the wonderfu l path of life in aztlan. I can almost taste ,smell, touch and feel the joy and painof Mixtil .

I got so sucked in that I spent much of the time reading in the hotel room, with my traveller's guide to Mexico right beside me. It was amazing how I could crossreference everything Jennings included about the history of the Aztec and the geography. I must say it made my trip in Mexico so much more meaningful and interesting...visiting places such as Palenque (Palemke in Aztec), Chetumal, and Tabasco (the land of the Tabascoob in Aztec) was so exciting after having read about Mixtli's experiences. I recommend this book to anyone interested in history, planning a trip to Mexico, or anyone who wants to become so emotionally involved in a novel that they have dreams about it."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Aztec was a stunning read! Like the other commentors, I also read it more than once. I once lent it to my father to read. When he reached one of the first of many of Mixtli's sexual encounters, he called me in disgust to say how dissapointed he was that I read books like that. A week later, he called me to say that Aztec was the best book he'd ever read in his whole life! The history in the fiction was overwhelming! I am now reading Aztec Autumn and I have to say that Gary Jennings has not let me down. I kiss the earth to the truth of it!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This is definitly one of the best kept secrets of the literary world. Our guide takes us through a land that few could imagine ever existed, from hazardous jungles to the wastelands of the desert, all the while keeping us entralled with a magical story of life, death, and loss. The customs of the Aztecs were bloody yet beautiful in a way few can relate to, are we not the same today? To think that the Aztec Indians, or Mexica, had all the luxuries that we possess now without the polution, and wanton wastefulness of the current generation is amazing, but to disbelieve the same is just plain ignorance. Read this book and understand the real tragedy of the modern world."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I stumbled on this book in a bookstore, probably back in 1983, read it, was stunned by it and obviously started to lend it to friends and lost it......Until March of this year 1997, I never was able to find it again. I found it at Russell's, a well known Montreal second hand bookstore: the owner glancing at me: saying:that is a real find! Three weeks ago at the airport I suddenly saw it republished.

The one flaw was one of the things that also made it so great of a read - the main character recalls details of his life from 50 years prior and up to the day of his narration in such detail, it is hard to believe him. Sometimes I can't remember what shirt I wore last week, never mind 20 years ago! This just made the book a bit questionable - perhaps Jennings should have made accomodations for this.

More recently it was recommended to me as a great historical read &amp;, since I love that kind of stuff &amp; had nothing more pressing to read, I bought another copy &amp; took it up again. This time I pushed past the part that stymied me before (by dint of great effort) &amp; have concluded that the book IS readable, but unexceptional, to say the least.It's a tale of a lower class Mexica Indian (in the old Aztec empire) who climbs the social ladder through luck &amp; skill (&amp; a little supernatural help?) in time to be there @ the top of his society when the Spanish conquistadors arrive to permanently alter the lands &amp; people they discovered in the New World. Regrettably, though the concept of the Indian Mixtli is intriguing (an old Aztec recounting his life story to the missionaries of New Spain and tweaking them in subtle ways by managing to be both informative &amp; annoying by turns), it fails to engage us. The protagonist &amp; the people he recalls never come to life in any real way, while the picaresque tale of his adventures around the land which was to become Mexico, never compels us. In fact the tale didn't really seem to catch fire, as a tale, until the last quarter of what is a very long book (nearly a thousand pages).In general it's not a bad read if you've got the time &amp; interest in the subject matter (which is certainly fascinating), but it's not in Shogun's class (for narrative sweep &amp; power) &amp; certainly not up to Hope Muntz' The Golden Warrior (in terms of the depth &amp; power of its characters &amp; sensibility). The &quot;voice&quot; alone is tiresome since it sounds, for much of the tale, like a modern man in a modern society, completely shattering the illusion of the old Indian recounting the last days of Tenochtitlan. And, though it is chock full of detail about the ancient Az! tec culture (much of it quite true, I'm sure, since the book appears well-researched) the descriptions indulged in by the author, in order to present this material, never manage to bring the times or the scenes presented to life. They are dull listings, at best, of facts and scenes and artifacts of the old Aztec lands, described in workmanlike fashion, but never with any pizzazz.The book is also marred by tons of kinky sex, seemingly included to titillate the modern reader &amp; serving, in parts, as a distressingly poor substitute for action &amp; character development. In fact the sex scenes, if some of these fairly grusome portrayals may be deemed that, fail utterly either to advance the action or even to titillate, thus weighing down the tale rather than causing it to take wing. And Mixtli seems a particularly boorish dolt in regard to the women he encounters, coupling with any and all he meets, but spurning certain of these for no obvious reason and generally to his detriment. (Moral compunctions in our Judeo-Christian sense don't really explain it since they seem out of place in the culture being presented -- or @ least they ought to be.)At best this was a plodding read, leaving me mystified by the rave reviews &amp; best seller status this book seems to have garnered elsewhere. --- Stuart W. Mirsky"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"AZTEC by Gary Jennings is not for the squeamish or easily offended, but for the rest of us it is an incredibly engaging, quasi-educational read that will make you think while it entertains.As you can tell by the other reviews, AZTEC is essentially the life story of one Aztec named Mixtli who lived during the last 50+ years of the Aztec Empire, and in so doing witnessed the civilization at its prime and then witnessed its downfall. Rather than get into the substance of Mixtli's many adventures here, let me just say that Mixtli leads a very extraordinary life. Through his unlikely but gradual rise from a commoner to a noble, every facet of the Aztecs' social, political and religious life is explored. Of course, as with all historical fiction novels, the reader should keep in mind that the specific events are fictiously rendered, and may therefore be exaggerated or otherwise altered to make the story more exciting. Also, because significant portions of the book concern aspects of Mixtli's life that have little or nothing to do with the Aztec civilization as a whole, the reader should expect to have his/her history lesson of politics, economics, war, and religion occasionally interrupted by Mixtli's oftentimes unconventional (even among the Aztecs) personal life.Finally, AZTEC is more than just a good story and a quasi-history lesson, it is also a social commentary criticizing Anglo/European culture and the Catholic Church. The Spanish/Catholics are portrayed throughout AZTEC as greedy for gold, and as terribly unenlightened hypocrits that regularly burned \\"herotics\\" but thought the Aztecs' human sacrifices to be barbaric. So, not only is AZTEC exciting and quasi-educational in the context of a history lesson, it also makes us examine the errors of our past so that we may possibly be more tolerant of the wide-array of beliefs and cultures we now encounter amongst our family, friends and co-workers each day."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I MUST ADMIT THAT IF A BOOK DOES NOT GRAB MY INTEREST AFTER THE FIRST 20-30 PAGES I USUALLY WALK AWAY FROM THE BOOK.FORTUNATELY FOR ME, I HUNG IN THERE. YES,IT TAKES MAYBE TWICE THAT MUCH TO GET ROLLING, BUT MR. JENNINGS IS LAYING THE GROUND WORK FOR WHAT IS ARGUABLY THE BEST HISTORIAL NOVEL THAT I'VE READ.THE BOOK CENTERS AROUND AN AZTEC WHO'S AT NEAR BOTTOM OF SOCIETY AND HIS LIFE AS HE MOVES UP INTO THE ROYALITY OF THAT TIME.THE AUTHOR CAPTURES AND DELIVERS ALL THAT WE LOVE TO READ ABOUT,ADVENTURISM, LUST,BARBARISM, BLOOD SACRIFICES, SINSTER PLOTS AND LOTS OF SEX. WHAT IS THERE HERE NOT TO LIKE?THIS BOOKS GOT IT ALL AND AFTER ALL THESE YEARS OF READING..( HOW MANY BOOKS DO MOST OF US REMEMBER AFTER 20+ YRS? ) I STILL THINK IT'S THE BEST FICTION FOR THIS PERIOD OF TIME.THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR EVERYONE, BUT.. CAN I RECOMEND THIS BOOK.. ABSOLUTLEY!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"First, let it be understood that *Aztec* is a Picaresque novel. It is properly compared with the likes of *Tom Jones*, *Anthony Adverse*, *Barry Lyndon*, and *The Egyptian*. A note to remember is that this is told from the point of view of first person personal, not third person omniscient as in *Barry Lyndon* nor that of a character-narrator, as in the Sherlock Holmes stuff. Comparisons with the horror novels of Stephen King are ludicrous. Style compares well with that of Mika Waltari.All the actions and primary interpretations thereof are those of Mixtli, the male protagonist. His views are, of necessity, juxtaposed with the Spanish interpretations of his history and his behavior, with the predestined consequences of what happens to the conquered by a non-understanding conqueror.Basically a good person, Mixtli testifies to the best of his memory about himself and of his people to a Spanish Court of Inquiry, but all he says is filtered through the minds of Spanish priests. This conflict of world-views is made obvious by Jennings, although he allows Mixtli to be somewhat oblivious to the fact that he says *this*, but they hear *that*. A tale of cultural conflict, told reluctantly by the victors, but in the words of the vanquished.Brilliantly researched and well written without much in the way of pedantic speed-bumps. Jennings leads the reader gently through Aztec naming systems, the calendar, their religion, and some popular customs of the time, as well as we understand them today. Through all of this, he meets the ultimate challenge of any writer of a Picaresque novel.... that is, he preserves the humanity of the participants while keeping our interest with a damned good story. We identify with and understand Mixtli, but also with the Bishop, the artist Chimali, the slave Cozcatl, and old Blood-Glutton the soldier. Jennings presents their value systems fairly, as *they* might have understood them rather then how the conquerers viewed them from the standpoint of Old World Catholicism.I would have rated this 4.5 but this provides no venue so to do.A good read for anyone who loves historical and anhropological or ethnographic novels."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Yes, this book was exciting. But I found the character's shallow and lacking depth. Gary Jenning's seemed to just be throwing in stuff randomly to be shocking and while that's okay I would like a little more explanation behind the character's motives. Now I can understand Mixtli being contemptous of the Spanish soldiers, and his indifference about the shocking ways of his people but there were other things that weren't very well explained. Such as the incest factor, that was forbidden even to the Aztec people and there didn't seem to be any strong motivations behind it even though the characters involved were risking death if they were found out. The characters showed no morals, they didn't care, it seems they would be a little remorseful about the fact that they were doing that was shunned by their culture. Also, it seemed to be lacking the fear that almost any kind of person would feel living in a culture that regularly sacrificed people, even if you believe that you are going to paradise, still it seems there would still be that base, basic fear of death and pain. Also, Mixtli seemed sort a wimpy to me, like he mostly just wormed his way out of situations. So I didn't like the main character. But Gary Jennings did wonderful research and it was entertaining and the descriptions made you feel almost like you were there. So that's why I give it three stars"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This book, although enthralling in it's historical accuracy, is so disgustingly graphic in the descriptions of the various sexual encounters of the main characters as to be sickening. This is the life story of Mixtli, a lower-class Aztec man born on the eve of the Spanish conquest of Mexico, as told from his perspective. This book has great potential, but unfotunately the pornographic overtones cheapen it drastically. Furthermore, the various experiences described in the first seven or eight hundred pages, although interesting, do not call for nearly that much length. However, the final two hundred or so pages are thrilling enough to partially make up for the earlier shortcomings. Furthermore, Mr. Jennings' talent for creating lifelike and vivid characters is a great asset to the novel. Unfortunately, he has a tendency to kill them off after a couple of chapters. All in all, this book is a predictable story of love and adventure that makes up for many of it's shortcomings with it's historical accuracy."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I was almost finished with this book when a booty call forced me to put it aside. For whatever reason, and despite my great love for the story, I didn't pick it up again until a year or so later. When I did I said, 'Screw this' and started from scratch and enjoyed those first 1,000 pages as much as I did a year prior. And the end . . . well, that was just perfect.Aztec history is inherently fascinating and Jennings sure did his research on Aztec civilization, the conquistadors, the church and about human nature as well for this book. The main character comes alive like few literary characters ever do.I've read Raptor and the Journeyer too and I love each of those books, but Aztec has to be the most well-rounded and mind-bogglingly brilliant out of the three.I can't see anyone not liking this book and I couldn't recommend it highly enough. Although remember, as you are approaching the end of the story unplug your phone and be sure not to answer the door . . ."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This book was a very entertaining read. As a person who has studied Spanish and Mexico in depth, I found it very interesting and accurate in many ways. (Of course I am not a expert on the Aztecs so you may take this with a grain of salt). I don't think that it portrayed the Aztecs in a stereotypical or negative way and it did a really decent job of describing one character's (Mixtli's) life before and after the arrival of the Spaniards. I'm sure that the author took a few liberties with his historical information, but I think overall this book gives a good description on how Aztec life might have been.It's a big book, but I could hardly put it down. Totally worth reading."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This book was about 1000 pages long and I wish it didn't end. It was so good. Considering that the history of Mexico is something many Americans know or care little about, I would highly recommend this book to change those perceptions.Had a man like Mixtli been in charge, perhaps Spanish would not have been the language of Mexico today.The main character Mixtli is so deep and his perceptions of things around him are so engrossing. What he accomplished during his lifetime (if he were not fictionalized) would be greater than anyone in history.I have read The Journeyer and Raptor (both phenomenal in their own right) also by Mr. Jennings and see alot of recurring themes. His main character is a wanderer that meets all the great people of the era and experience all of life's pleasures and horrors from human sacrifice to incest to homosexuality. Most of these topics can make us cringe but Mr. Jennings has a way of making these things sound provacative and compelling.His descriptions of events seem to always consist of just the right number of words."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This book changed me. It is one of the best books I've ever read. I recommend it highly to everyone. I have read it 4 times now and I continue to discover. It truly transports you back in time and the dreams I have while reading AZTEC are vivid &amp; colorful. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I completed this book several months ago and still find myself drifting off and wondering about the magnificent Mixtli, his life and his splendorous and misunderstood world. This is one of the best, if not the best book I have ever read. Having had a solid education in literature, I have had the opportunity of reading many of the classics, and very much enjoy current literature. I can't think of any book that has impacted me for so long as has this great work of literature. Jennings has a way of weaving a story and a setting which allows one to be there in all their senses experiencing what the central characters experience. Every human emotion is felt as one follows Mixtli through the story of his life, the life of the Mexica and the conquest of the New World in the name of God and country. After reading Aztec, I found it difficult to to find a book that motivated me the way it did. It is a must read for all history buffs as it is histroically very accurate, and if history repeats itself we have only to look at the conquest of the American West. Everyone else read it for the education, enjoyment, or for the shear escape."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Aztec is by far the best piece of fiction I have ever read. Absolutely mind-blowing. More vivid than any movie you'll ever watch. Read it now!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I found a copy of this book (hard cover) in a communal library in the basement of the apartment building I lived in back in the mid '90s. Having just had a motorcycle accident, I was looking for a book to pass the time. Without _any_ reservation, THIS IS THE BEST NOVEL I HAVE EVER READ. I've also read his other books. They all pale in comparison to this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"It's difficult to believe that there is no Kindle version of this incredible epic. I've read this book at least three times and was looking forward to reading it again on Kindle. I hope that Amazon will soon offer it on e-book form."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This is a wonderful book and took my breath away with the research that was done to achieve it. Yes,there's a lot of sex and human sacrifice, this was the Aztec Empire after all. One must read a little between the lines at what Mixtli often says and describes. The jabs at the Church and the Spanish are well noted and well deserved. Yes, the natives took down that great Empire with Spanish assistance, but soon learned to regret it when they later historically,became as expendable in the Spanish treatment of them.Still, the story kept me enthralled from end to end and this book has become one of my personal favorites and I keep it and read it over and over again.Unlike Tepetzalan's words to his young son, there may only be a first time, but every time I read it, it always feels as if it were the first time once again and I enjoy it as if it were."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I always thought I was a slow reader but it was just that I never found anything that captured my attention as this Novel had. Could not believe how quickly i finished this book and was very sad once it was over. Felt as if I really connected with the character and the story, which is exciting, dramatic, shocking and very funny. A must read for any one who is of Aztec or Mexican dissent."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"... why? Because I really, really don't want this book to end. Stop isn't the right word - pause is better, because already I can recognize that this is one of the best novels I've ever read, and once read, it will never be new again. So I go back, reread certian passages, and just reflect on an ancient civilization that was destroyed. Yes the novel is brutal - some of the things Gary thinks up are really really bizaar - and yet this is an epic story that grips me and leaves me imagining about the Aztec culture. Interestingly, I never really had an interest in the Aztecs before this, which again is the mark of an excellent story teller.One word of advice - don't read this late at night. You won't put it down and you'll never get any sleep."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"While wandering the basement of my local library, I came across an ancient novel simply titled &quot;Aztec&quot;. Since I had some interest in Aztec culture, mostly based on my research into various religions, I decided to look at this book.I must say, I was not disappointed. While quite a large novel, it is one which I would be more than happy to read several times over. I was amazed at the detail with which Jennings could describe the life of a typical Aztec person. I read the novel, devoured it quite thoroughly, and then stored in the back of my head.A couple years later, when it came time to choose courses for my freshman year here at the University of Pittsburgh, I stumbled across a course titled &quot;Colonial Latin America&quot;. I have a natural interest in history, but had it not been for my reading this novel by Gary Jennings, I may have simply passed over the course. As it is, I'm taking the course now. (Actually, in about 6 hours I will be attending one of the lectures.) I read one user review here on Amazon claiming that Jennings was not entirely accurate in some of his descriptions of day-to-day living in the Aztec Empire. So far, there has been nothing in my course to suggest that there is any truth behind this. Perhaps my professor would have something different to say on this subject -- I plan on speaking with her tomorrow about this book, and if she does have any negative comments regarding it, I will certainly post them here.I would have given this novel five stars, rather than the four which I awarded it, but as of yet I have only found two novels which I can fairly give that prestige to -- House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski and Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger. So do not mistakenly think that I found any noticable problems with this novel."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"First book to ever make me cry... excellent historical fiction novel, full of intensity, love, anger, and information. Jennings did a fine job in combining these elements into the story of the Aztecs!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"One of the things that really stood out in Aztec to me, was the characters. None of the characters were good, or bad. They were just human. Even the \\"evil\\" Spanish who have been so demonized in other books dealing with the conquest of the Americas are shown as what they are. People, albeit people motivated by greed, but people nonetheless. This can be said of all the characters in the story. Almost everything that happens through the course of the book can be attributed to people acting on their motivations. Even the most unsavory characters can do good things, and even the good characters can do evil. Do yourself a favor and pick up Aztec. You will not be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Do not be intimidated by the length of the book. I was, yet I read it anyway and at the end I wish there were more pages. All of the 5-star comments are true. This is one of the best books I have ever read. This is also the first review I have written on Amazon and I was so moved by the book that I had to encourage more people to read it. I highly suggest this book, you will NOT be disappointed."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Gary Jennings spent several years researching this book, and it shows. His intricate and detailed story, told by a fictional Mexicatl named Mixtli, follows Mixtli's longer-than-average life adventures: amorous, tragic, at times brutal or happy, through the years before the Spanish invasion and subsequent slaughter and enslavement of the Central American tribes. The details we learn about the advanced civilization of the Nauhatl tribes are surprising and I was relieved to see that at least some of this complicated culture has been rediscovered.Mixtli sees and travels quite far through the lands now known as Mexico, and we are treated to descriptions of the many countries and tribes, their beliefs and customs that were later wiped out by the Spanish through intolerance, ignorance, and European diseases. What we see is a group of advanced cultures, with their own traditions, writing, mythologies, and science. Although elements of the culture seem barbaric to us (the human sacrifices, for example), the people were certainly no worse (and certainly more broad-minded) than the Spanish that killed and enslaved them. The explanations given for the seeming violence seem perfectly understandable: there is no greater honor than being sacrificed to one's God.The conquest by the Spanish, however heinous, is told in a straightforward and unbiased manner, taking into account information that has been lost or changed over the last 500 years. History comes alive as we hear of Cortes' gathering of other tribes against the ruling Mexica before he turned on them and subjected those tribes to the slavery they had forced upon the Mexica.The language used in the story is florid and a little obsolete, in imitation of the style used a few hundred years ago, although it is eminently readable. Be forwarned that it takes about 100 or so pages before the book really starts going -- from there you will be hard-pressed to put it down! Once you finish, you will have a very different perspective on Mexico than you do today. I travel frequently to central Mexico, and have been seeing the area in a very different light. The current Mexicans have a confusing mix of cultures in their past; like the Germans, they need to look back and honor the best of what their heritage offers. This book may help them do just that."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"A &quot;1,000-page-plus&quot; novel that will draw you into its world and leave you with a greater understanding of the Aztec culture. The story is so compelling from the start... you will actually be delighted to find out that you are &quot;only a tenth of the way through&quot; and there are still 900 pages to go! The story is about one man (a member of the Mixteca tribe that occupied present-day Mexico City prior to and during the Cortes conquest) who, even at an early age, is able to reason and use logic to his utmost advantage. The main character in the story, Mixtli, has the ability to see through the ignorances of his culture and rebel against childhood customs that were sacred. We, as readers, are shown a great contrast of the Aztec culture that displays a population of super-sophisticated tribes who, ultimately, became the victims of their own narrow-mindedness. It can probably best be compared to the era of witchcraft in the U.S. You will surely be entertained by the adventurous, first-person omnipotent format that allows you to reflect on the actions of many and wonder with regret &quot;What might have been...&quot; Some will never even pick this book up due to the anticipated boredom of factual archives that would be better found in museum... but, any reader will notice after the first few pages that the &quot;facts&quot; are only used when it is important to the fictional story and where their use is entertaining. &quot;Aztec&quot; is one of the very few books that will absolutely &quot;shock&quot; you with the outcome of a particular side-mystery. If you are easily offended, I recommend that you do not read this book."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"You like historical fiction? Interested in the life and society of the Aztec empire? Start here. Although I was not exactly swept away by &quot;Aztec&quot; at first it wasn't long before the book captured my attention and continued to command it to the last page. The main character, Mixtli, is hard not to like despite some of the more barbaric aspects of his personality. After all, he is the product of a somewhat barbaric culture and as you read you grow to accept the ways of that society as if you were born into it yourself. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good adventure story in the tradition of &quot;Shogun&quot; or even &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. It's a good read filled with colorful characters but be prepared for some fairly gory violence and explicit sex. The biggest downfall of &quot;Aztec&quot; is that most of us know what finally happened to the Aztecs at the hands of the Spaniards (yes, Hernan Cortez eventually makes a cameo)and Mr. Jennings makes no attempt to rewrite history. We grow to empathize with the characters always aware that eventually their world will sadly crumble around them."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I read this excellent novel years ago and still remember its impact on me. I was entranced by Jennings' descriptions of peoples and empires long gone. His device of using a traveling merchant--pocheca--as his primary character was excellent. It gave Jennings the opportunity to take the reader to places and peoples distant from the capital in Tenochtitlan. His description of war, religion and human sacrifice is wonderful and reflects the obvious fact that Jennings carefully researched the subject.I especially remember the merchant's horror to find that his daughter had, without his knowledge, been offered up to the horrific Flayed God, Xipe Totec. He sees her in the form of a bloody skin worn by a dancing priest. Here I must mention that there are revisionists who deny that these things--wholesale human sacrifice--actually happened in ancient Mexico--that they were inventions of the rapacious Spaniards to justify their conquest. I can remember visiting the National Museum in Mexico City where you can see Aztec ceremonial bowls used to hold human hearts; chacmools used for the same purpose; sacrificial knives; and even an effigy of Xipe Totec wearing a human skin like a garment. Nowhere, however, was there a mention of human sacrifice. Political correctness. Political stupidity.In writing my own novels, \\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\", on the Conquest of Mexico from the Spanish perspective, I'm delighted to say I was decidedly politically INCORRECT.Ron Braithwaite"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"An inside look at the experience of Aztec living and the splendor of the pre-spaniard world. Very enjoyable and easy to follow. The adventures of an Aztec native are remarkable."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"MIXTLI wasn't that different from the average Joe from our &quot;Modern World&quot;.With the same worries about life and the problems that atributes us today with the only great exception that we don't have the threat of an invasion of strange and sadistic &quot;aliens&quot; from a far away land.

Now there are at least 2.Aztec started slowly and built steadily toward a crescendo as the book closed. Engrossing. Exciting. Gripping. With great characters whom we got to know well, Aztec has everything, including an education into a historically solid account of a great people.Aztec entertains and educates. It is a must read for anyone interested in great historical fiction."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"As a long time scholar of Latin America, and having lived in Mexico for nearly three years, I found Aztec to be thoroughly accurate and beautifully detailed. It is the story of the end of the Aztec (really Mexica) Empire told from the point of the view of the Aztecs. While tremendously long, it is one of those books you hate to see end."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I finished AZTEC two months ago and I can't find a good word to describe it, it's simply amazing. I had too many doubts about the documentation behind this but reading all this comments I noticed that Gary Jennings documented his work very very well. Congratulations Mr. Jennings, this is a GREAT book. Now we need a producer to make the film, because, as someone said, that would be a dream come true."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I read this book about five months ago.Gary Jennings transported the reader to the pre-conquest world. While I was reading I compared it with books and maps from National Geographic and found out how well documented it is.This is a refreshing view of the spanish conquest that helps to discover (to the non-latinamerican people) how the spanish conquered and enslave the new world in the name of religion and the spanish kings. What i found a little disturbing is the full charge of sexual themes all around the story, that became even boring. It is not that I'm against erotism but the line between a historical fantasy and an erotic novel vanished constantly throughout the story."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I bought this book for my mom for Xmas. She likes Indian books. I personally had no interest in Indians, or historical fiction. But just out of the blue I started reading it. Wow! Needless to say, she never got it for Xmas! One of the book's main assets is that it is not politically correct. It does not gloss over the brutality of the Mexica. It is told from the perspective (mostly) of one of the Aztecs, but it is the character hismself who is anti-Spanish and anti-white. The author, however makes it clear that the Mexica themselves were not in any way morally superior to the Spaniards. They were both brutal people. Thisbook inspired me to buy a history book about Mexico, called Fire And Blood by T R Fehrenbach, which was even fairer about the subject than Jennings was. Other things I enjoyed about the book were details such as how the Spaniards never bathed (which is not mentioned in either of the two history books I bought), and how many of the characters in this book were real and made to interact with the main character in one way or another."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Definitivamente uno de los libros escritos sobre las tradiciones y costumbres de este pueblo extraodinario que fue el azteca. En un lenguaje ameno y sobre todo descriptivo, Jennings,nos da la oportunidad de recorrer el henorme territorio mexicano en una epoca donde los espacios no tenian limites y la cantidad de pueblos, formaba un mosaico multicolor lleno de costumbres y tradiciones de lo mas variado. Desde las tierras selvaticas del sur, hasta los mas agrestes desiertos en el norte, podemos viajar con el personaje Mixtli, quien sirviendo dirctamente al emperador Azteca, recorre todo el Unico Mundo Mexica, con el fin de recabar informacion para poder ampliar las extenciones del imperio. En verdad una joya literaria llena de datos historicos que dificilmente antes se habian narrado en una forma tan gratificante."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"With a Masters Degree in History and a teacher of American History/Western Civ, I could not believe how historically accurate and detailed this tome was. The detail was incredible and the story was told with an obvious passion for the subject. I highly recommend this &quot;novel&quot; to students as an excellent primer to the Spainish conquest and settlement of the Americas. Keep up the excellent work Mr. Jennings!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"At a minimum, this work deserves a Nobel Prize! It begins with a letter from King Charles V. The one page and 1/2 of titles that this man had, if marked with pins on a world map, makes it look like a Spanish porcupine! The book is a history course in terms of social, military, sexual, commercial, religious, political, and sentimental behavior. Certainly no textbooks in any universities, including Mexican, teach history that way. The book is written from the Aztec viewpoint and the characters and tone are such that readers will side with them vis a vis the Spanish. Those of us who are latin americans of Spanish descent and who have been taught to despise or at least look down on indians can't help but wonder how much of this attitude was due to fear and envy of the Aztec civilization. Latin America and the Phillipines are the ruins of a once proud and powerful empire; the atrocities commited by its soldiers, the enslavement and exploitation of the native population, when compared to other European powers, was not the worst, just the first. The burning at the stake by the Inquisition was repeated elsewhere in Protestant Europe and America (meaning the Western Hemisphere). In closing, this great masterpiece relates directly to the identity of modern latin americans, all of us, including whites, indians, and mestizos. I can only hope that a way can be found to allow us all to live in peace. To the English-speaking non-Hispanic white American, a chilling reminder of what can happen to even the most powerful country if racial intolerance is allowed to rule. But the greatest lesson is that the Aztecs were not really that different from us. The had the same virtues, sexual behavior, pride, and vices of modern man. Everything has been done before. The book is wonderful; enjoy!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Even for me as Mexican, this was a breath taken story. There I was, in the militar academy in Mexico city, with my &quot;Aztec&quot; book in the militar History class. That book was more interesting than the class indeed.For moments I saw myself in Tlactli Mixtli's feet. Traveling all along the Aztec empire, and wishing have being in the conquest war against spanish troops.I think that the experience for me, was very special, because the militar academy's architecture, is based in Aztec meanings (i.e., the government office's shape is &quot;texcaltlipoca&quot;, the aztec's God of war).I finished that book in a few days, and until now, is still the best I've ever read.I would really wish to meet somebody like Steven Spielberg, and tell them to read the book if they hadn't yet, and make a production about it...that would be a dream becoming true...Thanks Jennings."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"&quot;Mixtpantzinco&quot;, everyone! I read this book twice, and I could never put it down. Jennings is nothing short of amazing, by far my favorite author! Being of Mexican descent, I felt very proud of the peoples of my bloodline, and was so fortunate to learn such a rich and diverse history of the various tribes of &quot;Cem-Anahuac&quot;, The One World. In this book as well as in Aztec Autumn, Jennings has portrayed these ancient Mexicans as intelligent, prosporous, ambitious, self-sufficient, hard-working, proud, and above all, noble. I've also read Aztec Autumn, Spangle, and The Journeyer. (If I thought Aztec was good, The Journeyer was even better!) Whenever I read anything by this man, I experience rage, fear, sadness, lust, shock, disgust, glee, and every other emotion. Currently I'm reading Raptor, and as soon as I'm done with that, I'm going to read all the other works by Jennings not as popularly known as these five historical novels. I've been losing sleep from reading half the night, but I don't care!!!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"AS A HISTORY BUFF, NEVER HAD I READ A BOOK SO ENJOYABLE AS AZTEC.

I was given it as an assignment in college for spanish culture and had to re read it again as I love the presentation. It is not for the faint hearted or prudish, you must have an open mind to experience their cultures and the clashes with responses not usually known.Enjoy this trip back into time when the Americas had their own period of devastion of the pyramid era!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I won't elaborate too much on previous readers' comments, as they are quite numerous. I gave this book 5 stars for the following reasons:1) It is very historically accurate. It is an enlightening and educational book, and any person who wants to delve into the world of the Aztecs before the conquest will really enjoy this read. My major was Hispanic studies, I lived in Mexico for a few years and am married to a Mexican woman from the state of Guanajuato; and I can attest to the accuracy of a lot of the historical events that take place in the book. If you want to cross-reference them, just go to wikipedia and read the articles on Tenochtitlan, the Aztecs, the Noche Triste, etc., and you will see how Jennings' portrayal falls in line with a lot of the historical record.2) Keep in mind this is a historical novel, so Jennings does add ficticious characters and sexual exploits that no doubt were intended to juice up the novel; personally I felt uncomfortable as the previous reader did while reading through some of these. I do not believe they were necessary and are symptomatic of our culture's thirst for sex in every form of entertainment(but keep in mind this was written in the early 80's). It is unfortunate, and it would be nice if there were an edited version of the book so that it could be recommended to a younger audience. But because of those scenes, this might be given an NC-17 rating. Rest assured, though, that the sexual exploits taper off after around page 400 or so; they are then few and far between and the novel takes on a much more serious tone. But he does add some shockers near the end. In spite of this, though, the book is incredibly well written and thought out. The college-educated and intellectual reader will not be disappointed.3) Jennings lived in Mexico for 10 years and did a ton of research on the subject, and the book is abundant with it. I really enjoyed his use of the Nahuatl language; any student of the Spanish language will enjoy realizing the Nahuatl origins of several Spanish words and places in Mexico that are described throughout the book. Nahuatl is still a language spoken by over 1 million natives in Mexico today, so it is not a dead language. In Mexico, the past lives right along with the present. For a deep allegorical short story of that theme, read \\"La culpa es de los tlaxcaltecas\\" by Elena Garro. It is an allegory of Mexico's past and present getting all mixed up, and anyone who has ever lived in Mexico can identify with this fascinating phenomenon.4) The book was very entertaining to read, I never got bored. I even got quite nostalgic during parts of this book, and had a strong desire to return to Mexico to visit. I would have to say that this is one of the best historical novels I have EVER read. I am excited about now re-reading the entire novel in Spanish, which is also available.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"A very interesting tale of the final days of the Aztecs before the Spanish conquest. If you have a strong stomach for sex and violence (which this book contains a lot of) and have an interest in ancient cultures then AZTEC is definately worth checking out."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Gary Jennings ability to carry you into a different time and space is akin to eating a nice cake. The fact that he also includes historical information is tasty frosting."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This is the greatest historical novel I've ever read. It is also the funniest. I got tears in my eyes I laughed so hard in some places. Buy the hardcover copy and keep it in your library. You won't want to give it away!!The protagonist of the story is a Mexica (aka Aztec) ambassador who, in the first half of the book, makes a grand tour of all the various tribes living in what we today call Mexico. The ethnic and cultural attributes of each tribe are described in detail, which provides a wealth of anthropological data.The second half of the book focuses on how the cultures of Mexico get fractured by the arrival of the Spaniards. This is a descriptive masterpiece of what cultural cross-pollination looks like."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I bought and read this book when it was first published and I was rather disappointed that it was published some years after having lived in Mexico.Mexico is a country rich in antiquities and historical sites, piramids temples and churches but dearly lacking in the details of what the society and cultures were like that built all those great wonders that have managed to withstand not only the ravages of time but also the ravages of the conquistadores.The Spanish conquerers were unable to destroy the fabulous piramids and temples of the Aztecs and only manages to cover the samller ones up in dirt and then build a church on top of the mounds.Mixtili the narrator and subject of the book manages to describe in almost lifelike detail the life and times of many of the different classes of Aztecs and their very bloodthirsty culture.5 stars do not give this book justice ....."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I heard that Jennings took 12 years to write this book.It reads like a life work. Be warned: its ultra-violent but the gore is the truth. Anything less would be an insult to history.I recently got a copy from the library and gave to a Mexican lady friend and told her she would learn the history of her ancestors from it. I hope she enjoys it like I did.Great job, Jennings!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"From the start this incredible tale of a Mexica known as Mixtl or Dark Cloud tells of his life , his adventures, love, jealousies and passion for the people who were,in a land now forgotten.The story is very gripping, it was almost impossible to put this book down.What I admired most was the depth of research that went into preparing this novel. The detail of the ceremonies, every day life, the language and the sorrounding communities of the ONE WORLD, brought together in a powerful story. This novel would make an incredible movie.I recommend this to people who want to have a true glimpse of life in the time of Mexica, that last great empire of The One World..."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Many books of this length tend to drag on until the reader grows bored and goes in search of another, but I'm happy to say that Aztec is not among them. The book's thousand-page span helps to make Mixtli and, indeed, all of the characters, seem less like characters and more like old friends with every page.Being only thirteen, it's size deterred me at first,(I hate putting down a book once I've started it) though once I began I found myself carrying it with me everywhere- especially at school- so as to get in a paragraph or two before the bell rang.As many people have pointed out, Aztec is not for the faint of heart. Jennings doesn't hold back a bit as he describes bloody ceremonies and oftentimes bizarre sexual situations. These aspects of the book didn't bother me personally, but as they occur frequently in the text, I would advise not trying to simply ignore them.In short, although Aztec might not appeal to everyone, I strongly suggest that you give it a try!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I've often been enthralled with the reading of historically-based novels over the past half century, but I must say that this is overall the best I've ever read. Too, it is the only book other than the Bible that I've been challenged to read in both English and Spanish versions (The Book &amp; El Libro-- Living Bible editions), the Spanish language version being titled Azteca. I just HAD to see if the tale would be any different; it is just as powerful in Spanish as in English and has been just as 'controversial' in some quarters... which in my view goes far in making it be the epic that it is, and especially in view of the fact that its publication has spurred further research which has added to the body of knowledge about the peoples of that time (especially the Purepecha, whom the Spaniards called Tarascan).Marvelous reads that are faithful to the tempo and tenor of the times historically are such as Michener's Hawaii (et al), Clavell's Shogun (et al), MacCullough's First Man of Rome (et al), Uris' Trinity (et al), McMurty's Dead Man Walking (et al), Auel's Clan of the Cave Bear (et al); all of these writers and others of their ilk who spend literally years on end researching their subject have this rather unique ability to REALIZE history and bring it alive for us in the present... enabling us to better comprehend how things were and how it came to be that things are as they are in the present while entertaining us at once. Enough has already been said in the previous 99 reviews that I don't need to go into further detail about Aztec other than to reiterate that it's the best of its kind I've ever read, Aztec Autumn was almost as good and certainly 'relevant', and I'm ordering Aztec Blood.I am saddened to find that Gary Jennings has passed on and that Aztec Blood had to be finished by a collaborator; he was one heluva author and Aztec creme-de-la-creme of the genre."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I started reading this book knowing very little about the native people of the area we now call Mexico and nothing at all about Jennings's other works. I have to say that this book is the most impressive that he's written. It covers the lifetime of a man who sees war, poverty, great riches, violence, sex, and most importantly, his whole world change. I don't think I ever learned half as much in school about the people who were here before Columbus &quot;discovered&quot; America as I did when reading this book. Yes, it is a fiction book, and no, it doesn't bore you down with tons of historical details. The narrator draws you in so you feel like you understand his world and are living in his century. This book does depict a lot of Aztec violence, some of which is very disturbing and not for the faint-hearted, but it also depicts the violence of the colonizers from Spain who destroyed much of the beautiful cultural aspects (as well as the horrific ones). This book is haunting from Chapter One until the end. The sequel on the other hand, is nowhere near as fascinating."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I think there should be an execption made, so I could give this book 10 stars. In Aztec lies the entire spectrum of humanity; emotion, sensation, adventure, philosophy... The experiences of Mixtli, from young to old, are told with so much attention to detail that it isn't surprising the author spent a decade in Mexico to write it. Aztec is so powerful that it will not only stay with you for your entire life, it will change you"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Como antrop&oacute;logo mesoamericanista la lectura de AZTECA como novela hist&oacute;rica, me enfrentaba desde un inicio a dos problemas que para el autor deb&iacute;an haber generado igualmente situaciones de dif&iacute;cil soluci&oacute;n: Por una parte, la exigencia de la rigurosidad hist&oacute;rico-documental en el contenido de la obra, por la otra lograr que ese esfuerzo no se transformara en una publicaci&oacute;n &aacute;rida o engorrosa, cuyo exceso de informaci&oacute;n documental la hiciese poco &aacute;gil e interesante.Jennings super&oacute; con honores ambos retos. La lectura de su obra nos entrega una historia s&oacute;lida, interesante, din&aacute;mica, profunda y excelentemente bien documentada.Gracias a 'Azteca', acompa&ntilde;&eacute; a Miztli y a sus amigos al calmecac, sent&iacute; bajo la planta de los pies la lisa superficie de las piedras calentadas por Tonatiuh en la explanada del Templo Mayor, me deleit&eacute; con el arte de la plumaria en los escudos de los Caballeros Aguilas, me envolvieron los gritos de guerra y dolor de la Guerra Florida y mis narices se llenaron con el copal que ahumaba los templos del Cem Anahuac.

Su cuerpo quemado por el fanatismo del irrespeto y la intolerancia se hizo estrella, se hizo un Pueblo que construye futuro.Por &uacute;ltimo, como agradecimiento a Gary Jennings que con esta obra nos leg&oacute; algo inolvidable, un escrito del Huey Tlatoani de la Ciudad de Texcoco, poeta Netzahualcoyotl: UN RECUERDO QUE DEJO&iquest;CON QU&Eacute; HE DE IRME?, &iquest;C&Oacute;MO HA DE ACTUAR MI CORAZON?, &iquest;NADA DEJAR&Eacute; EN POS DE MI SOBRE LA TIERRA?... &iquest;ACASO EN VANO VENIMOS A VIVIR, A BROTAR SOBRE LA TIERRA?. DEJEMOS AL MENOS FLORES... AL MENOS CANTOS."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"First of all, I had never heard of Gary Jennings before Aztec, I just happened to find this book on a magazine store, and I thought: \\"This book deals about the Aztecs, but a guy from United States wrote it, mmmhhh well, let's see if he did a good job.\\" I actually had to go back to my house to get the money to buy this book, and I really don't regret the 10 minute uphill walk home in the baking sun, hell I'll do it thrice for a good sequel not the ones that are out there...I found the style to be great, it was written as an autobiography, made to please the king of Spain, who wanted to know about the Aztec way of life... In this book you'll meet Mixtli, a Mexica, just like any other, a person that has many virtues, but as any other, flaws, which the author really doesn't hesitate to show them to you... A fictional character, that coexists with real life people, and plays an important role in history, but keeps a low profile, enough to be forgotten in history, that's what makes this so appealing...I found this book to be one of those that gather all the things right, climax situations, intrigues, plot twists that you didn't expected, that is rare on a book, and specially more on one as big as this... It makes you really get hung up with the story, really get involved, so much that you'll get angry at some things, to the point of throwing the book against the wall, and happy on others, to the point of going around with a stupid grin on your face for a while...One may think it's too long, it must be boring, but it certainly isn't, you'll find yourself turning each page quickly to find out what will happen next, and all of a sudden realize that you've managed to read 150 pages, and that it's 4 a.m. and tomorrow you have a final exam and you didn't studied because of this book, and...... well, you'll see that you can't put this book down even if you want to...Another thing that really increases the score is the fact that the author really investigated about the Aztec culture, he won't just describe a person, or the type of architecture, but shows you the way they talked, the way they performed their rites, all their customs, legends about their gods... I even found out things that were not taught to me at school, that's how deep this book is..."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This is one of the most engaging books I have read in many years. It is the story of a (fictional) Aztec who testifies about his life before a panel of priests who record the tales for their king in Spain. The details about the experiences of the narrator are only exceeded by the wonderful descriptions of how the people of that time in Central Mexico may have lived. The historical associations are extremely informative even if they are not all based on fact. One truly gets the sense of what life may have been in that part of the world before the arrival of Cortes and the end of the Aztec empire.The narrator himself is an interesting character. His scruples and values often fluctuate but he is a person of his time. His adventures enable the author to speculate about the surrounding tribal areas, the sexual behavior (there is plenty of this-some of which is hard to take as is the abundance of violence in the wars and ceremonies which are described) and the values of the civilizations he touches. He is a proud, highly achieving, adventurous man whose life is full of important and interesting encounters which occasionally are rather hard to identify with but which offer an entree into the life of the Aztec area. His cleverness is beautifully demonstrated by his comments about the Church of the priest/recorders and the similar values the \\"barbaric\\" Aztecs have with the \\"holy messengers of Jesus\\" and the Spanish church. There is subtle and often biting sarcasm injected into his story telling (almost Swiftian in quality.)The book is 750 pages long, full of action and clever observation. It is not an easy read but the narrative flows smoothly and the writing is outstanding. I enjoyed the book so much, I felt empty when it ended for me. It will be a treat for any fan of history or of good writing. Although this is a work of fiction, the research that went into it makes it quite informative as well. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I am not going to add much to all the reviews about this book.I understand that these times were particularly brutal but the way it is depicted in this novel is quite similar to showing close up pictures of mutilated bodies. You can see one by chance and don't feel good about it however the book is filled with such scenes that make its reading difficult at times. The overall historical aspect is quite interesting and the use of graphic scenes may have been a deliberate approach to transpose the reader into this world of violence and superstition.So a big warning, this book may not be for everyone and I would not advise it for a non mature audience.I don't regret having read it but will not go through it one more time. There are other novels as good without the torture."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"My headline just about says it all. I won't get into details, but let's just say this book HAS IT ALL. Blood (lots and lots and lots of it, both in war and in human sacrifices), sex (lots and lots of it, mostly kinky) and more plot twists than you can shake a stick at.But the culture explored is absolutely fascinating. The Aztecs are loving shown here, in all their alien rituals. We are repelled by their way of life, yet Jennings makes us understand totally where they are coming from, and we begin to accept that way of life as a perfectly viable one (not one I'd care to live in, but the people are not shown as cowering in fear either). When the Europeans finally invade and make life miserable for the Aztecs (and Incas and Mayans), we are totally sympathetic with their plight and totally engrossed in our major character. If you like historical novels, there is no way you won't eat this thing up, unless you're squeemish.If you don't usually enjoy them, give this one a try. It is far superior to most, in my opinion. You'll learn things you never knew (I guarantee it) and you'll love it.One word of warning...it's a long, long book, and the first 75 pages or so are a bit slow going. Stick with it...the remaining 1000 pages or so will fly by, and you'll be sad when it's all over. (Thank God there is a sequel...actually two sequels, but the third book was not written by Jennings, and is a travesty, I think.)"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I cannot say it is the best book ever written, for I have not read every book. But I say that if I had, Aztec would probably be the one I'd remember most dearly.In other words, you're not a book-lover if you haven't read Aztec. It will shock you, it will make you laugh, it will take you close to tears. It's the most complete literary work I've ever come across and it will probably keep this title for a long time.The main character is incredibly human, even more human than some people I know. I cringe when I call him a character, because after reading this book, he feels more like a friend. He makes mistakes, not stupid mistakes, but mistakes we would make if we were in his position. The people that he shares his life with are also noteworthy. Even Hernan Cortes isn't demonized here. The Spanish are noted as real people. As people with flaws, which are criticised with heavy doses of irony and sarcasm.I love reading books, but the biggest book I've read before Aztec was only 450 pages long. This is 1039. If you want to start reading long books (it's a step bigger than I imagined) than Aztec would be the perfect kind. The book is huge not because it has overly-long-descriptions. It's long because it's a person's life, and a very long and busy life I might add.I plan on finding a hardcover edition of this book. Just so I can keep it on my shelf, unread and in perfect condition. This is better entertainment than any other kind of media can give.Buy this book. Read it. Love it. Share it."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"As a student of Mexican history, an aspiring writer and a linguist by education, I'm possibly among the tougher readers out there. As a matter of fact, I rated the sequel to this book at 1 star out of 5... :)So here is my opinion, take it or leave it. I believe this work deserves the highest mark.Key Positives:- Specific, visual writing style that leaves no doubt about what the writer is saying. The quality of writing is well above average: the words are chosen with care, the scenes are complete, the text is easy to read. G. Jennings immediately created the 'style' of the book, unique and engaging.- Compelling main character. Mixtli is a joy to get to know. He's one of the richest literary personages that I know of. The insights into his nature are deep and disturbing.- Breadth of research and excellent presentation of it. The sites, smells, sensations of the time are reproduced with outstanding level of detail.- \\"Show don't tell\\" excellence: I forgot about time... the book is so visually and sensually compelling that at times I had an impression of watching a movie rather than reading a book. Or having a dream...- Tight plot. Some folks seem to expect a fast-moving plot from this book which is probably a 'milieu' (location) book rather than a commercial, event-driven story. The plot is the life itself. Every scene is in its place. Even the most disgusting scenes move the plot forward in more than one way. Superb planning and execution!- Honesty and bravery in covering even the most unpleasant details.Key Negatives:- Some characters do get repetitive. All the key women are coockie-cut: stunning beauties of unbelievable grace, who drench Mixtli in their generous unconditional love, etc. Everyone apart from his daughter (thanks goodness not his daughter) worships his member and indulges into the most questionable behaviour with him from incest to pedophilia.- Some historical data is plain wrong. The flow of conquest is distorted, the character of Montezuma, in fact rich and well-documented, is made into a cartoon junkie, Dona Marina is artificial, etc. I guess that's the 'right of pen' in action... but it does undermine credibility of the rest of the facts. Which, probably, is fine.- I'm sorry, but the compulsive obsession with how every woman's 'tipili' looks and feels, and with Mixtli's own manhood size is tiring. I've done my share of wild things in life, but even I thought it too much.Overall, a delightful book. It affected me deeply, and possibly changed me. How many books have done this to you?Cheers."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"In a word, Jennings' monumental work on the Aztec empire is outstanding. A simultaneous success on multiple fronts, Aztec is a gut-wrenching drama, a romance, an epic family saga, a titillating R-rated tale that pulls absolutely no punches over blood, guts, gore and sex, a history of the downfall of one of the world's major historical cultures and, finally, a scathing political indictment of the Roman Catholic Church and the imperial policies of 15th century Spain! Wow!Jennings discloses this tale through the first-person narration of Mixtli, an Aztec scribe and lord, held prisoner by the local bishop, Juan de Zum&aacute;rraga, for the purpose of providing accurate information and history from the local point of view to King of Spain. The manner in which Mixtli reveals his story makes very clear Jennings' disgust over the rape, pillage, subjugation and ultimate destruction of the Aztec people, their culture and their religion by the Roman Catholic Church and the military forces of Hernando Cort&eacute;s. But Jennings also allows Mixtli full rein when it comes to expressing his dismay over the Aztec's own responsibilities and failures - the division of Mexico into near feudal mini-nations that allowed Cort&eacute;s to pick them off, one tiny piece at a time, and through political maneuvering to set one nation against another; the spying and machinations of Malintzin, Aztec Mexico's own Mata Hari; and the vague, ineffective leadership of a procrastinating, equivocating Montezuma who failed time and time again to grasp opportunities that would have repelled the Spanish invasion once and for all!In the foreground of this magnificent, sprawling tapestry of Aztec history, Mixtli tells his own family story beginning with his birth as the son of a common warrior, his education as a scribe, his accumulation of magnificent wealth and, finally, his ascension to the position of Aztec lord and valued government councilor. And what a story it is - the sordid, tempestuous details of his incestuous love affair with his sister; the extraordinary manner in which he overcomes his extreme nearsightedness; his incredible mastery of dialect and language; the all-consuming love he held for his wife, Zyanya, and his daughter, Nochipa; his stupidity and utter blindness in failing to realize how deeply Zyanya's twin sister loved him as well; and, his exciting travels as an itinerant merchant and spy across Aztec Mexico and the Mayan empire in Central America. Mixtli's ongoing battle and gruesome revenge on Chim&aacute;li, his one time best friend and ultimately his darkest enemy, will leave you slack-jawed with amazement!Aztec is neither a short read nor a simple read! But you'll find it all here - comedy, drama, pathos, sex, violence, satire and political commentary. I guarantee you'll find that with every passing page, Jennings will pull you more and more deeply into Mixtli's magnificent but brutal Aztec world and, when you reach the final page, you'll be sorry it's over! Undoubtedly, a 5-star achievement!Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"The first thing that comes to my mind when I think about this book is what a fascinating and terrific read it is! \\"Aztec\\" is definitely a book with everything...and it shows. Yet, part of the miracle of this book is that every page remains as fresh and as sparkling as the one before (and this is a long book, my edition has more than 1000 pages). Quite an accomplishment!\\"Aztec\\" is \\"the\\" story of the Aztec civilization of Mexico, told at the very height of its magnificence and glory. The protagonist of the book, Mixtli, is a person you are guaranteed to never forget but will surely come to miss. Although Mixtli wasn't born to a high station in the Aztec world, he manages to rise above himself, becomming first a scribe, then a warrior, then a traveling merchant. As the latter, he travels over all of Mexico, then called The One World, exploring jungles, mountain peaks, deserts, beaches. And, he makes a fortune in the doing. Eventualy, Mixtli is elevated to knighthood and the nobility, both stations he well deserves.\\"Aztec\\" is, by turns, gruesome, suspenseful, sexual, adventurous, erotic, heroic and comic and everything is done on epic proportion. It has to be since Mixtli is not a man to do anything by halves, or to leave a task undone. He seems possessed by an unquenchable thirst for new adventures and new horizens and, luckily, we can travel along with him without risking the consequences Mixtli so often had to face.Through the pages of \\"Aztec\\" we witness, along with Mixtli, the gruesome Wars of Flowers, the nomadic life of the Dog People of the desert, the dignity of the Cloud People who live in the mountains, the one-time spendour of the Mayan jungles of the Yucatan, and the glory of Tenochtitlan, the capital city of the Aztecs.All is not glory and splendour in this book, however, and \\"Aztec\\" is certainly not for the faint-hearted or the squeamish. Some of the scenes, especially the sacrificial scenes, are so gruesome and blood-drenched that it can be difficult to read every word. And the book is, at times, quite tragic, for Mixtli, himself, does not escape his share of blood and gore.Some readers have complained about the violence and sex included in this book. I know much violence and sex is simply gratuitous these days, but it certainly isn't in \\"Aztec.\\" Sex and violence were simply part and parcel of the Aztec culture; had Jennings failed to include it, his book would have read like some watered-down, barely palpable version of the \\"real thing.\\" The Aztecs did everything on a grand scale; if you require drawing-room manners in your reading, you'd best skip this book and read Jane Austen instead.Lest you think Jennings forgot the other side of the coin, i.e., the Spanish point of view, he most certainly did not. At the height of his career (and at the pinnacle of Aztec civilization), Mixtli is sent by Motecuzoma to \\"welcome\\" the strangers who have arrived in The One World. Wondering if they are gods or mortals, Mixtli thus comes to meet Cortes and his band of conquistadors...the very persons who will destroy the Aztec civilization and very nearly wipe its memory from the face of the earth. Still, even in times as tumultuous as these, Mixtli has one more heroic deed waiting for him to accomplish.I've read that it took Jennings twelve years to write \\"Aztec.\\" I can well see why. The book is filled with detail about healing, about cooking, about sacrifice, about love, about anything and everything that made up the world of the Aztecs. Although I certainly wouldn't have wanted to be a member of that world (I'm far too peace-loving for that), finishing\\"Aztec\\" does cause me to miss the vicarious experience of it.If you like your literature uncensored and filled to the brim with life, in all its glory and all its tragedy, then \\"Aztec\\" might be the book for you. Just be prepared for a dizzyingly wild and wonderful ride like none you've ever experienced before."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"If you want a novel that has everything (adventure, history, sex, story-line, characterization, debunking of myths, humor, horror, human insight, etc.) this is IT! Jennings novel has to rank as one of the all-time stories for story's sake. Echoing other reviewers here, I was absolutely ticked off that the story had to come to a close. Unfortunately, I was equally disappointed by Jennings' subsequent tries at emulating this storytelling feat (particularly Aztec Autumn - what a bust!) The author apparently used up all his creative powers in constructing and researching this novel. Yet if I could have done even half as good a job as Jennings did in writing Aztec, my life would have been heroic! This is as close to creative genius as any historical novelist has come to in our era. I am not prone to hyperbole in my reviews, but if you haven't yet read this book, you are missing out on one of the true treats of contemporary fiction. Order it, now!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Aztec by Gary Jennings is like one reviewer said inside the critical acclaim portion at the start of the book, one book you will miss after you are done reading it.This story of the Aztecs is told by Mixtli, a son of a limestone-quarryman. He travels around in the One world as a scribe and later a warrior and trader. He learns the true history of the Aztec people during his education in Texcoco before he is the personal \\"aide\\" to a scandalous wife-to-be to the Chief of Texcoco.It is a story of many plot turns, twists, revenge, sex, blood, sacrifice and humor.You learn of the many gods of the Aztec people, bizarre religious ceremonies and incest.This book is shocking and offensive (not to me) but so is the bible (which contains almost exactly the same things). You'd know if you read it.Mixtli tells his story, 60+ years of experience to Spanish Roman Catholic friars after the conquest of Mexico, you cannot miss this one.I promise, this is the best ... value around, buy it, you'll be glad."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Yes, Aztec is more than a book. It is an experience that will stay with you the rest of your life (even as I write this, I am remembering some parts of the book and a chill is going down my spine). Just like so many other reviwers, I have given away copies of this book to grateful friends, my whole life revolved around the book when I was reading it, I dreamed (and still do) about the Aztecs, etc. The narrative and characters are perfect and the book is perfect, putting you thru the entire range of human emotions; you will feel mentally drained by certain passages (in particular, there is one episode about 2/3 of the way thru, right around the time Cortez comes on the scene, that is the most chilling thing I have ever read, and I have read a lot in 50+ years. You'll know it when you read it). In case you haven't gotten the message yet, read this book; it is just marvelous."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"&quot;Very Fortunate and Most Excellent Prince: from this city of Tenochtitlan-Mexico, capital of your dominion of New Spain, this twelfth day after the Assumption, in the Year of Our Lord one thousand five hundred twenty and nine, greeting&quot;.Prepare to witness the incredible life and times of Chicome-Xochitl Tlilectic-Mixtli, the brave Azteca who lived through the downfall of his world in the hands of the gold hungry Hernan Cortez and his conquistadors and found the time to tell his story to his Spanish conquerors.Jennings takes the art of story telling to a majestic level. Aztec is a fabulous journey into the lives of the ancient Azteca people and the various tribes that inhabited the Mexican territory, 500 years ago. The vigor of the narration, vividness of detail along with unforgettable characters and great adventures make Aztec a marvelous exploration and an intriguing account of the Azteca culture and customs. From a western perspective, many of the stories told by Mixtli are shocking, cruel, and repulsive; to sacrifice 15,000 people at the inauguration of the great Sun Temple is by all standards a bloody story and through the eyes of the Spanish prelate, the account is neither merciful nor understanding: &quot;Your astute Majesty can hardly have failed to notice that the earlier pages have treated - casually, without remorse or repentance - of such sins as homicide, prolicide, suicide, anthropopophagy, incest, harlotry, torture, idolatry, and breach of the Commandment to honor father and mother. If, as it has been said, one's sins are wounds of one's soul, this Indian's soul is bleeding at every pore&quot;. Mixtli gives his perspective of things and makes us understand his world, people, and times. No matter what your beliefs are, this book will not leave you indifferent. The western ethnocentric position is strongly challenged and questioned; what is good and what is evil, what is right and wrong, how shall we honor god...who has the power to decide upon these issues?Historic fact: the conquest of the Aztec empire was not dictated by the Spanish emperor. In fact, Carlos had no idea that Hernan Cortez was roaming Central America for his own personal benefit but in the name of the emperor. The Spanish ruler didn't even know of the Azteca existence until long after the fires in Mexico City had died out.I strongly recommend this book to all history fiction fans interested in the tumultuous age of the Spanish conquest of the Americas. The amount of historical research in this book is indeed impressive."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Jennings' research on the Aztecs and the neighboring tribes of late pre-conquest Mexico is very awe inspiring and comes through very clearly. As a work of historical fiction, however, it isn't satisfying. The narrator, \\"Dark Cloud\\" is not believable as a character, but is whatever Jennings needed him to be to convey the facts the facts about pre-conquest Mexico that Jennings wants us to know. Several previous reviewers have referred to Mixtli/Dark Cloud as an Aztec Forrest Gump, i.e., someone who was present at all the right moments of history. This is the fiction writers' prerogative, but Jennings really abuses the device of sending Mixtli on random journeys throughout Mexico just so he can tell about the people and cultures of these areas. The most ridculous example of this was having Mixtli's canoe be blown out to sea and drift hundreds of miles up the coast, just so Jennings could describe some of the savage northern tribes. This is gratuitous, silly and unnecessary. The book is too long, and the some of the outlying tribes are frankly not interesting enough to describe at the cost of further page bloat.But the real drawback of the book is Jennings' virulent misogyny. Jennings had an Ian Fleming complex on steroids; every female character unfortunate enough to cross paths with \\"Dark Cloud\\" comes to a terrible, horrifying end. After awhile, this becomes as predictable as it is annoying. Jennings also has a fascination, alsmost an obsession, with the freakish and the bizarre. Unfortunately, the \\"plot\\" of this book consists of little besides the somewhat tedious lessons in ethnography and geography punctuated by episodes of sadism and the destruction of the female characters. (He kills off the male characters, too, but quickly and usually without the dramatic sadism that he invests in the death of the females.)Jennings gives most of the credit for the conquest to disease, arguing that the Aztecs could not have been conquered but for their decimation by smallpox. He doesn't seem to like Cortes much, although he grudgingly acknowledges the man's audacity, determination and ingenuity, while highlighting his cruelty, greed and rapacity. There are a few historical liberties taken; for example, the events of the return of Cortes from the coast, the death of Montezuma, and the \\"night of sorrows\\" are all telescoped into one day, although the histories I've read spread these events out over the course of several days. Bishop Juan de Zumarraga was only bishop-elect in 1531, not being formally confirmed until 1533. Nor was he the Inquisitor of Mexico in 1531, assuming that office only in 1535, and the one time that Zumarraga did condemn a native to the auto da fe, or burning at the stake, that decision caused him to be replaced as inquisitor. But Jennings' historical liberties are relatively minor and within the rights of the historical novelist.Jennings writes with some obvious and justified sympathy and even admiration for the Aztecs, while not shrinking from a thorough description of their most horrifying, brutal religious rituals. In one episode, Mixtli takes a terrible revenge on a group of Mexica because of their unfortunate choice of a sacrificial victim; I think this episode is a tacit admission on Jennings' part that these people, because of their religious barbarism and cruelty, were due a reckoning, even if that reckoning came at the hands of a people who practiced their own religion in a cruel and barbaric way."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"\\"Aztec\\" is a masterpiece in historical fiction. Even though it's a huge book at over 750 pages, I couldn't put it down. I loved it so much that I read it again immediately. The first time I saw the Aztec books, I was in an airport in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. I have a deep, personal interest in the history of the Mexican people and their culture. Gary Jennings was extremely thorough in his research, and created a world that hasn't existed for five hundred years. He then wrapped it around Mixtli, a character so fascinating that he feels like an old friend. It was so well written that it made me gasp in portions and cry in others and laugh in others.I love this book, and I can't recommend it highly enough. I recommend it to everyone I meet. It is a masterpiece in modern literature."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Somewhere in this 1000 page epic, it dawns on you that it is not Mixtli-Dark Cloud but Gary Jennings weaving this absorbing story about a doomed civilization seized by a power-hungry Spanish outlaw.Jennings spent 12 years researching this novel in Mexico and the journey through this time period clearly illuminates this seemingly barbaric peoples. The story is extremely rich in detail and it does not whimper at the sight of blood and sex. In fact, much of Mixtli's story is centered around these types of actions, so please be aware if you are uncomfortable with these subjects.Overall, this is one of the best literary masterpieces I have ever read."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"One of my all time favorite books. This is an epic and mesmerizing novel that is very similar to Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth. Definitely recommended without reservation!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"The Aztec series by the late Gary Jennings is amazing in the detail that the author has included in the story line. Jennings spent years researching his books unfortunately limiting his output but any Jennings book is a superior read that you can't put down. Recommended are Aztec,Aztec Autumn,Aztec Blood the latter being finished after his death.other must reads are the Journeyer about the travels of Marco Polo,Spangle about a traveling Circus after the Civil War and Raptor about a Goth during the fall of the Roman Empire"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This book is simply mesmerizing. One of my top 5 of all time!Like all of Jennings's blockbuster books, it grabs you and holds on. You become so enmeshed with the characters that you don't want their story to end. Jennings had the gift of making his characters human--fallible and real.His research must have been exhaustive, because when you finish this book, you feel a little disoriented in our own world--like you've actually been living in 16th Century Mexico, actually experienced Aztec life and the Spanish Conquest. You understand Aztec culture, their point of view. It's that real.Yes, as in all of Jennings's books there are gruesome scenes, and plentiful-sometimes quirky-sex, but the same is true of real life.I was just immersed in this book. Though I read it years ago, I'll never forget Mixtli and the others who inhabited his world.Excellent reading from an amazing writer!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This is an awesome book. I won't say here what almost everybody before me has already said, just this: This book is a must read for everybody that calls himself a Mexican (like me).I already knew much of the history, but I have never read it in an objective way.And for everyone else (not Mexicans) I definitely recommend it, it contains not only very detailed history about the Aztec people but a very good novel within."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"My Uncle recommended this book to me. It's historical fiction about the Aztec Empire, specifically about one Aztec, Mixtli, who lives in the last decades before the Spanish conquest and the ultimate fall of the Aztec civilization. The story is transcribed by priests from interviews with Mixtli, and interspersed with letters reporting back to the King of Spain, who has taken a great interest in the exploits of this \\"savage.\\"Mixtli is a kind of Forrest Gump of the Aztecs, an adventurer of folkloric proportions, experiencing the history and geography of \\"The One World\\" often the benefactor of good timing and good fortune. As he makes his way up through the ranks, from scribe to warrior to trader, etc., we get an in-depth look at Aztec culture: it's religious beliefs, violent sacrifices, everyday life, politics, wars, and social structures.What struck me about the book overall was how light and comedic it felt for historical fiction. Whether this undercuts the serious \\"history lesson\\" aspect of it is hard to say. Possibly. But at 1038 pages, it's a welcome addition. It took me a long time to get through this dense book, and I put it down from time to time to read something else, but I was never bored by the story.Aztec is an epic adventure, an informative and well-researched history lesson, and a good story overall. My one complaint is that the gratuitous sex got old after awhile. It's not a puritanical critique--I just kept feeling like, yeah, yeah, then he gets another chick. And I'd flip ahead a few pages. But otherwise, pretty good."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I am not sure any book has ever seemed so big to me. Gary Jennings captures a life from beginning to end. In the process he has taken me to thoughts I would never have believed possible. For instance, how can a culture make human sacrifice an honorable ritual and then see it degraded by priests who glory in the killing and blood. The novel is incredibly complex, gloriously full of life and courage and frightfully descriptive of man's hypocracy. A thoughtful person can not help but learn alot about humans from this book."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I first read this book about 12 yrs back. In all the years since, I have read and read and read, but nothing approaches this book as far as epic adventures go. If you like Alexander, Ramses etc. (which are very popular and can be found in any shop - unlike Aztec), it might interest you to know that they vanish into oblivion in comparison. Jennings is a supreme story-teller, and this is his masterpiece. The book has nearly everything: adventure, violence, sex, intrigue, and has a feel of the romantic about it. I cannot comment on the historial accuracy of the events, but don't let that stop you from reading it - Lord Of The Rings is complete fiction too, after all. I promise you you will soon be feeling smug about having read this one when others haven't and you will be recommending it to them soon."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"The two things that change your life are the people you meet and the books you read.This book made an impression on me. Both the Aztecs and Spaniards were brutal and capable of horrendous crimes against humanity. Man's dark side is documented in detail in Aztec.The hero Mixtli, gives hope that man can rise above the crimes of civilization.I kept thinking of the Grahan Nash song (Cathedral) that states, \\"Too many people have died in the name of Christ for anyone to heed to call\\". The unsanctioned barbarity of Cortez does not dismiss the sanctioned cruelty of the Catholic church.Read this book."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This is by far one of the best books I have ever read! The saga begins at the end of the main character's life, the entire story is a memoir of sorts. Mixtli tells of the Aztec world as he lived it, a first hand account of the beautiful and gory civilization of &quot;The One World&quot;. From the multi-colored lights and pure white buildings of Tenochtitlan to human sacrifices and alien customs, Dark Cloud saw it all. Some parts were a little too rough to read though, Dark Cloud and Cozcatl for one, Jadestone Doll and Something Delicate for another. This book is not for the timid, it shows the magic and the savagery of that ancient time."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Aztec is a great novel, I began reading the book one day when I had some spare time, and after that day I MADE spare time to read the book. It draws you in and keeps you wanting to know what happens next, I admit some parts are rather bloody but you cant teach history without explaining what actually happened. There were times that I was very sad or angry at the situations that happen all through Mixtli's life. The story is engrossing, at times I cried, and other times I laughed. This book is perfectly written, and much worth the cost, it will give you a new way of looking at the events around you, and realize how much time you have wasted.Thank you for reading my review and I hope you email to me any questions you have,VP"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This book is tremendous....

A tale of courage and love and tragedy, &quot;Aztec&quot; is probably the best book ever to describe the clash of cultures, the inhumanity of the winner, the ignominy of the loser and the immorality of imperialism.

You will breathe the same air as Mixtli because the storytelling by Gary Jennings is brilliant. You are there. The events are real, the people are real.

Being of Mexican descent I kept rooting for the Aztecs to rout the invaders from Spain. This book feels like home to me.I am reading Aztec Autumn now and it is just as gripping!

Shortly after I read it I saw Apocalypto by Mel Gibson and I found some of the similarities pretty compelling though there was no mention of Gary Jennings anywhere.This book is wonderful and I am here today to purchase my own copy. I had rented it from the library. This if the VERY FIRST book I have ever read that I wish to read again.Sy-Leah"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I found this book immensely enjoyable, though I am not a particular fan of historical fiction. I only picked it up by chance but once I did I found it hard to put back down. I have to admit that my first time through I did not finish. About three-quarters of the way through, the story just felt complete and I couldn't see a point in slogging through the considerable remaining pages. I am SO glad that I did eventually re-read this book, and read it all the way to its end. Those unread pages became one of my favorite parts of the story.A previous review describes the main character as \\"The Forrest Gump of the Aztec World.\\" I had a bit of a giggle over that; I've described this book using those very words. It's an epic yet engaging life story as told by an elderly Aztec looking back. The central character has an uncanny knack for being at the right place at the right time and involving himself in momentous discoveries, inventions, politics, wars, and virtually every noteworthy event (real or not) of the fall of the Aztec empire. The author's somewhat irreverent sense of humor comes through loud and clear making much of the character interaction a delight to read.There *are* several moments in this book which - though I enjoyed them - may not be appropriate for all audiences. There is a great deal of graphic sex and violence. Some would call it gratuitous but in my opinion it all lent either to the story directly or to further defining and illuminating the characters. I wouldn't remove a single part of it. But I would warn that this book would probably not be appreciated by a reader that can't like or overlook: sex, adultery, torture, mutilation, incest, pedophilia, and graphic and gory descriptions of ritualized murder."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"An epic work of art. This book paints a living picture of the people and culture that was Aztec. It follows a young man to old age and takes the reader an a adventure that rivals any in literature.The author displays the brutality and beauty of the empire of the Aztecs blending fiction with history masterfully. A MUST READ. I'm on my third read."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"There's really not much I can say that hasn't been said already regarding this epic work. I'm giving it 5 stars simply because no other book that I've read has captured my attention the way that it has. I voraciously devoured all of it's 750+ pages within the short span of a couple of weeks. It has it all: sex, love, action, graphic violence, war, espionage, joy, tragedy -- all set within the context of a superbly researched history of the Mexica (Aztec) empire. WOW!!!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Gary Jennings ability to insert richness and detail into every book he wrote is simply SUPERB. I read these books (Aztec, The Journeyer, Spangle, etc..) over and over and over and even after reading them fifty times each or more, I still find new things and new details that I missed before. His books will forever be my all time favorites. And for someone that reads voraciously (fifty books or more a month) that is saying something."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This book may seem long and intimidating, but it will fly by! And there is so much to learn! Fascinating! Read it and you will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Living in Mexico, we were fascinated by this historic account of her beginnings. Brutal and raw at times, but softened by humor and a humanistic portrayal of the Azetca nation. A must read!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Could hardly put the book down. Jennings has a wonderful ability to paint word pictures in every paragraph. His mixing of accurate history with a fictional hero takes you through raw descriptions of human sacrifice, sex, religion and politics experienced in the days before the Spanish invasion. The hero travels through parts of wild Mexico encountering death, danger and crude uncivilized tribes to trace the origin of the Aztecs.A clash of cultures happens when the Spanish land and begin their conquest. The harsh beliefs of the Church are exposed as they encounter the bloody beliefs of the Aztecs."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I can't say anything except this if my favorite book of all time.

However, I always had the question about where history finishes and fiction starts.Enjoy the book if you like this kind of reading, but, again, please do not forget this is a novel."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I could not put this book down. It is one of the most incredible historical novels i have read in a long time. And Jennings has done his homework on aztec history and archaeology. Telling the story of the life of an Aztec commoner and how he rises through the ranks, and of the final confrontation with the Spanish invaders, Jennings gives you what i though was a very good approximation to the aztec's point of view of the whole thing. If you are into mesoamerican archaeology, you cannot miss this book."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This is a book for the ages. The story, actually history of Mixtli, is written so that it is also a history of the Aztec nation. You will be captivated by the splendor of Tenochtitlan, you will be disgusted by the barbarity of their sacrifices, you will become saddened by Mixtli's heartaches, you will love this book."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"My best read since Lord of the Rings! It is a great adventure novel that opens your eyes to the gruesome but noble world of the Aztec. Don't be daunted by the first thirty or so pages, which consist of eloquent but lengthy letters between a Spanish priest and the King of Spain. It picks up quickly from there. In fact, this is one of those books that could have ended in several places along the way and still rank among the top ten novels I have ever read!Aztec Autumn picks up right where this books leaves off. It is an entirely different adventure set after the decline of the Aztecs but you will find it is just as engaging and sweeping as the first. I understand it took Jennings ten years to write the sequel, but it will only take you ten minutes to rush out and buy it once your done reading Aztec!"},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Aztec is the historical fiction tale of Mexico from the late 1400s to early 1500s, when the Spaniards invaded the country. It is told through an elderly native as he tells his story of his life to the local clergy, who have been directed by their Spanish Emporer (King?) to learn of the region's history. The native, named Mixtli, has lived a fascinating life that has led him to travel by foot across much of what they called &quot;The One World,&quot; centered around Tenochtitlan, which became Mexico City. Through Mixtli's adventures, we learn of the customs, mores, and religious beliefs of the people who became known as Aztecs. As he becomes a highly ranked merchant, Mixtli also has access to some of the political figures of the time. We see through his eyes the invasion of Cortes from Spain, which according to Mixtli would have been better resisted had Montezuma (the Spanish distortion of Motecuzoma) not been a spineless leader. But then it seems that much of history works out this way.This book is rich in detail. Woven into the story are such topics as the features of the land, people's daily habits, the language differences among the different peoples, the values and social customs, and the military practices and technology of the time. Jennings does a good job of creating believable characters, both male and female, that have sophisticated emotions and behavior. Mixtli is a very engaging character, and he meets a wide array of interesting people, many of whom stay with us through long stretches of the book, so there isn't the problem of trying to remember so many characters that you stop caring about them. Still, the book has a very leisurely pace and didn't particularly compel me to find out what happened next. The book cover quotes The New York Times describing it as &quot;a dazzling and hypnotic historical novel;&quot; I'd agree with the &quot;dazzling&quot; but not with the &quot;hypnotic.&quot; It took me over a month to read Aztec's 1038 pages, and although it was certainly time well spent, I chose not to read the sequel Aztec Autumn. Still, I'd recommend Aztec as an enjoyable and very informative historical novel."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This is a very good book. It reads like a grand Greek epic. Mostly because it is full of tragedy. But its scope is so large that almost anyone will find something to like in it. I picked it out because I wanted to learn more about the Aztecs, and I was not disappointed. Be prepared to learn some Nahuatl. It can be confusing in parts, and starts out slowly, but after awhile it will start imposing upon your daily thoughts. I read this book while taking the Metro to work every day, and I damn near missed my stop."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This book was insightful, enjoyable, compelling, and hopefully historically accurate. Also, it was very funny. (At least the bits that involved Mixtli's conversations with the Bishop and the scribes.) Jennings did a great job in capturing the Aztec culture and its eventual downfall at the hands of the Spanish. I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading historical fiction."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"I loved this book, a definite read if you have a good stomach. Some people will be offended by this book, especially christians. It focuses a lot on sex, murder, adventure and more. If you like a book that you will learn from you will love this book. Mr. Jennings has done so much work in researching the Aztec's that it's a history lesson without the painstakingly boring process of learning....if only every thing was this easy to learn. This is one of the few books that I wished wouldnt end. I thought that the sequel to this book &quot;Aztec Autumn&quot; wasn't as great as this one, still good but not worth the read. I am currently reading another book writen by Mr. Jennings, called Raptor, very good but Aztec is the greatest."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"This Gary Jennings novel is so magnificent in every conceivable aspect, that the shadow of this book and the joy I received from reading it, will fall over every other book I ever read."},{"Title":"Aztec","review":"Mixtli is a fortunate character in this novel. He rises from the lowest class to that of nobility. Mixtli has many name changes throughout the book and each name fits the particular stage of his life. Aztec puts you into the head of Mixtli, so one can explore the reality of the Aztec culture. I now have a better understanding of the rise and fall of such a magnificent civilization. If only there could be more historical novels so enchanting and informative."},{"Title":"Colorado Rocky Mountain Wide","review":"I own this great book on the Colorado Rocky Mountains! Every page shows breathtaking pictures in the Colorado Rockies... from quiet streams and meadow wildflowers to the towering aspens and \\"purple mountains majesty\\".

Along the way he falls for a mysterious woman and tries to unravel her past. There's not much action, so it's more of a mystery than an adventure story. Parrish does a very good job of describing the desert and making you feel like you're there. Some of the story takes place in Sheridan, which the author correctly places in Kansas since Wyoming didn't exist in 1868. He makes Wild Bill Hickok the sheriff of that town- I checked a few sources and found that Hickok was in Kansas that year, but none of them said he was in Sheridan, so I assume the author made that up. The 'border' in the title is the imaginary one where the plains meet the Rockies.I'm sure that some people will get offended at the way the black man talks, but that's the way ex-slaves talked. Notice that the author also has the Irish woman speak in a stereotypical manner. Native Americans don't fare very well- the few times they're mentioned they're called savages, fiends and varmints.Usually the formatting of these free books is lousy, but someone spent a little time on this one. The table of contents is active, there are a two lines of space at the end of each chapter, and chapter headings are centered and enlarged."},{"Title":"Beyond Kenpo : Secrets Of Advancing The Art And Science Of Kenpo Karate","review":"The standup game will improve if your a kenpoist and you will be more formible in the ring,Not just the streets.I liked it for it gives a new take on old defenses and makes it applicable for the reaL WORLD.

For each root, the equivalent is given in other compendiums, such as Pokorny. A wide selection of reflexes are given for each root. I get the impression that Mallory and Adams talked to every scholar in Indo-European studies, asked what they wanted included, and included all of that. It is one of my favorite books; I read the whole thing straight through when I bought it, and still used it frequently.

You won't regret it.Please ignore the ignorant review entitled \\"bogus.\\""},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture","review":"In view of one of the reviews below, I thought necessary to add a short commentary about IE studies, and thus about this book. The existence of \\"one\\" Proto-Indo-European may not have BEEN as such: rather than one unique language, Proto-IE was certainly a tight compound of very very close dialects. But the genetic relation existing between Celtic, Germanic, Balto-Slavic, Romance, Indo-Iranian, etc languages, and which we call \\"Indo-European\\" is proved and is a scientific certainty, although there is many points that are not well-clarified yet.Thus, after the publication of Mallory and Adams' book (and many others), maybe one should wait, indeed, for the publication of a SERIOUS and scholarly book proving the non-existence of a Proto-IE language or compound of dialects.For now, I am still waiting for a relevant and convincing bibliography."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture","review":"More than half a century ago,Trubetskoy and more recently Demoule have very convincingly argued that the whole idea of a proto-IE is bogus.

Well It was a good book but I didn't think it lived up to the recommendations it has had. It was a bit slow throughout the book. I liked the fact that the Heor Malcolm MacFane aka the Black Wolf is not super strong but has had major injuries to overcome. I actually liked him and his friend Gavin much better than the heroine in the book, Ariella. At first I thought she would be a wonderful heroine, strong and willful but loyal and caring to her clam and to the injured Black Wolf whom she was to have been married to. Even though she helps ease his physical pain she doesn't seem to interested in helping him heal his emotional pain. She seems very cold to me. The other characters in the book make it very funny at times. The training scenes and the two old men are very humorous. All in all I would say its a good read but it could have been so much better."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"This story show us how a woman can give a man strength to be alive, Malcolm wanted to be dead until he saw Ariella, you also find out that if you want something you really have to fight for it, because if you don't do anything for yourself nobody will, and another interesting point is that maybe for you something is perfect, but for anyone else won't be so perfect.The story of the book is nice, not amazing, not incredible, just nice, is not a page turner but you can relax and read it, for example (as I did) on two or three rainy days, when you just must be at home."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"My second book by Karyn Monk - the first being &quot;The Prisoner&quot; - and I continue to be more than pleased with her work. This one, as in &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, is like a breath of fresh air. Different and delectable. A flawed hero, a brave heroine, and a beautiful love story that happens gradually - not love at first sight. A truly wonderful romance. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"I went to bed late and said to myself &quot;just one chapter.&quot; Well, I finished the book at 2:30 that morning and couldn't sleep.

Like a previous reader, I hope Gavin and Elizabeth have a story - or maybe young Catherine."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"This is a truly wonderful book, but having just purchased Ms Monk's next book &quot;The Witch and the Warrior&quot;, it can't quite compare. How wonderful that an author's books improve!My advice is to read this book first, then the next one (although they have nothing in common in their story lines). That will avoid any disappointing comparisons in the reading of this wonderful book. I agree with another reviewer who feels this author should be writing hard cover novels. I wish they were LONGER, however!"},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"All around terrible book. **very minor spoilers ahead**First of all Ariella (not a Medieval Scottish name) is unlikeable throughout. We are TOLD repeatedly that she is brave, compassionate, & will sacrifice anything for her clan. What she actually is is stupid, selfish, self-involved, and a compulsive liar. Worst is how she betrays & humiliates Malcolm with her unneccesary, convoluted plotting - all because she was too scared and stupid to be honest. Of course, he forgives her instantly. What makes this worse is that, if she had been honest with him, it wouldn't have had any major effect on the plot. We are left hating her for no reason, and wondering why he would be so in love with her in the first place(besides her being beautiful - that's all that matters in books like this).She also repeatedly puts her clan in mortal danger, by delaying actively finding a husband & male leader for her clan. Nevermind that in real 13th century Scotland, she would have appealed to the king for help, that is never mentioned here. Instead she relies on a vision from the clan seer that a perfect warrior will save them. Then she can give him a magical sword that will make him invicible. She interprets this to mean \\"sit around and wait for him to show up, if he ever does, no matter who gets killed while she waits\\". But when it suits the plot, she asks the first man she can think of to help, even though he doesn't fit the vision.Another major issue is that the author has zero education when it comes to Medieval Scotland. I would bet the average historical romance fan, with no other research, knows more than the author. I wish the story had been a fantasy, in a made up land, because then many major issues with the plot would at least make more sense. As it is, the author's version of 13th century Scotland never existed. The entire plot depends on this very wealthy, pacifist clan existing for over 100 years with no one ever once plundering or invading. They have no defences and devalue fighting. They have built a castle but purely because they are pretty (apparently) & offer good views. They are also rarely sick, have very modern ideas about medicine and physical therapy, they bathe constantly, they all read & write - on paper no less. And apparently they are never injured because Malcolm is literally shunned for exactly that. They all hate him, as the story begins, because they had asked him to help them in a battle but he couldn't do so because he had been injured and disabled. All because their seer \\"had a vision\\". Real Medieval Scotland, which was staunchly Catholic, never factors into their magical mindset. I don't need point by point historical accuracy from a book like this but I also could never get into the story because I was rolling my eyes at every page.That's another issue - the story itself is just slow and boring. The couple is never a couple for the entire story, even when they get physical, the entire time Ariella is telling herself \\"he is not The One\\" and planning her betrayal. The writing itself is so bad none of the characters ever feels real. It's impossible to just enjoy the story itself. And it is so repetitive, the same plot points and issues discussed again and again, exactly the same way. I forced myself to finish the last third of the book by speed reading and missed nothing of the plot.There are so many book so similar to this out there, why waste your time on this one? I'll never read this author again."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"I bought this romance based on all the good reviews and was very disappointed. First, although it is marketed as a Scottish historical, I really think it's more a fantasy. What Scottish clan in 1207 would have not known war or conflict for 100 years such that they no longer trained for it? That's mythical, so we're dealing in a fantasy at the outset. Then there's the sword of the clan that makes the warrior who wields it invincible. That's mythical, too. There were other things that were not believable to me. This is the story of Ariella MacKendrick, whose father was slain. She now governs her clan and is concerned for their safety so she disguises herself as a boy and with a few of her men, she goes to seek out a warrior, Malcolm MacFane, aka the Black Wolf, to ask him to defend the clan because their seer has said he will come. Now a broken man suffering from daily pain, Malcolm agrees to come at her request, ostensibly for gold. What was unbelievable was that he does not find it odd when the boy Rob speaks of \\"his\\" clan as if he were the laird and the clan men take orders from the boy who is really their mistress in disguise.Some of the language the author uses is more modern than this time frame. (\\"Get the hell out!\\" was one that seemed to come up a lot.) Then she engaged in long narratives I call repetitive angst...the same character repeatedly mulling over the same inward feelings. I skipped over those parts when I encountered them. As other reviewers noted, the romance itself was disappointing. I had no trouble putting this one down. I'm giving it 3 stars because if you don't mind the whole fantasy thing, or the long angst passages, the writing is otherwise good and she is great with dialog."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"There was something sublime and lingering how the Black Wolf got under my skin the further into the book I got. He reminded me of a physically broken Maximus in \\"Gladiator\\". His honor and heart broke through the trappings of his assumptions of his failures and the horrors created by being mislead one dark painful night. He was stripped of everything, drank himself into oblivion to deal with his pain, both physical and emotional, yet his depth of character crumbled the layers of defenses he had built around himself. I liked him very much.As for Ariella, I felt her character lacked in depth and emotion, and felt although courageous, determined, and duty bound, she was cold and unforgiving and created much pain in a man who had enough pain to deal with in his life.The book is a little off here and there, especially with the ending which I would have liked to have seen more developed, but overall, I liked it and would recommend it.For a really good 5 star read, check out Sara Bennett's \\"Lily and the Sword\\", Sophia Johnson's \\"Risk Everything\\" and \\"Always Mine\\", and Susan Carroll's \\"Dark Queen Trilogy\\",."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"I really liked this book. I was concerned before I read it that I might not like it. Some of the other reviews had me worried. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I have not read any of her other books so I cant compare it to those but I would definetly recommend this read. It is unusual to have a hero that does not have the perfect warriors body but I liked having that different twist. I didnt give it five stars because I wouldnt rate it with the best books I have ever read but time flew by and I enjoyed every minute!"},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"Ariella MacKendrick needs a warrior who is able to protect her clan(her clan is well trained in art and crafts but not warfare) and teach them to fight. So she goes in search for the famous Black Wolf, Malcolm MacFane, who is said to be unbeatable in battle. When she finds the Black Wolf, she is dismayed to find a drunken shell of the famous warrior. Although disappointed, she decides he still can help train her people in fighting and defense.This a great story of a broken hero mending himself with some help from the heroine. This is not your typical mighty warrior romance story. Malcolm is damaged both physically and emotionally. He suffered a crippling injury on the battlefield that has caused him continous back and leg pain. He also made a mistake years ago that caused him to be cast out by his clan. So he has been living in seclusion drinking away his physical and emotional pain. Ariella offers enough money for him to train her people and as he starts to succeed in making warriors out of a bunch of artists and craftsmen, he starts to get some of his sense of self worth back.Ariella is a little frustrating at first. She is very strong and resourceful, but she is not a good judge of character. She thinks her future husband should be a mighty warrior strong and brave and Malcolm does not fit her version of her perfect warrior. But what makes this story good is that hero and heroine have very human faults. Malcolm starts to mend both physically and emotionally, and Ariella realizes that strength comes from the inside of a person.All in all, a very well written and original story."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"Wounderfully written, I was swept away on a cloud of romance and intrigue.

Why does this strong heroine have to just cave in to the hero's decisions? Can she no longer think for herself just because she is in love? Except for the frustrating ending, an enjoyable tale. I hope Karyn Monk reconsiders weakening her females like this and allows them to remain strong even in the face of a man."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"I liked this book, but was expecting better. For one thing, I found it irritating that Ariella's identity was kept from Malcolm for so long...not until after over 100 pages did he find her out...also, while I really admired Malcolm for overcoming his hardships, I found Ariella to be rather bratty.The writing was peppered with humor that I found charming, but the characters lacked that spark that I love to watch burn between 2 people with undeniable chemistry.

But the Black Wolf was battling his own demons. He could not come. When he finally does he is forced to confront all that is lost, and all that may be.Comments:- Scottish Highlands, 1207, Romance.- 5649 kindle locations, 370 words.- m/f - not frequent, not very explicit.- Malcolm (the Black Wolf) has been horribly injured in his last battle. It is painful for him to move, and he drinks to deal with it. There is also some discussion of the innocents who are killed during battle (and elsewhere).Opinion:A story of forgiveness, of finding yourself, of accepting that which can not be changed. Finding a future together, and allowing the past to strive for a better tomorrow.There are times this isn't the easiest book to read. There are lots of betrayals, from imagined slights, to \\"for your own good\\", and grievous acts of Evil. You kind of start wishing everyone would just be nice to each other. But then it wouldn't be the interesting story it is.And interesting it is. Is it historically accurate? I did feel it was a bit contemporary-ideals-in-historic-location. Which can be jarring. Some of the background characters were caricatures and heavy-handed, but that is Monk's style - giving the background life, animation and humour, even if it lacks a little substance. But I really liked Malcolm. He was written with a deft touch and I felt his pain and anguish. I just wished Ariella would have truly accepted him so much earlier, and his willingness to come back from her betrayal hadn't been so generous.3.5 stars rounded up because it was pretty good over all. A good, solid book with a slightly disappointing ending. But definitely worth a read.Aside:Okay, a little part of me had all the smurfs running around celebrating the arrival of The Black Wolf Saviour of All.Other Monk Medievals:These all have a very similar feel, but are completely stand alone. (No series). Because the author does have some similar background characters and sub plots, I wouldn't recommend reading them all in one hit - it does feel a bit repetitive by the time you reach the third! They are, however, equally good.-Once a Warrior-The Witch and The Warrior-The Rose and the Warrior-CR-"},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"This was a story about a man who is weakened, scared, and almost disabled by his war wounds. He gets kicked out of his clan for a mistake. The heroine thinks he pretty much is a loser, but she comes to love him and he begins to heal. The story was totally unrealistic and over-the-top. I love romance and I love wounded hero stories. This story is nice, but I think it is for a younger audience (but it is not G-rated)."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"I've been very disappointed in many of the books I've purchased lately. Fortunately, this was not one of them. I loved the story and the characters were well-developed. There was also a developing bond between the two main characters, instead of them proclaiming to hate each other and then simply falling into bed with each other and leaving the reader wondering what they had missed. The heroine was a little too stubbornly resistant to the hero's strengths, but since that happens in a lot of romances, I still gave it five stars. All in all it was a sweet, well-written story that I'm glad I stumbled across. I only wish the author had more book available in Kindle format!"},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"One of my favorite authors does it again. She knows how to find the voice of that era and the right mood between the hero and the heroine."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"I had read other work by Karyn Monk, and considered her to be a good storyteller who always adds some new twist to historical romance. Then I read Once a Warrior and realized she's not a good writer; she's a great writer. Monk really shines in this story of a non-traditional hero.Too often, the heroes in romance have few flaws. Perhaps they're stubborn or focused on making a marriage for an heir or for money. But to have a hero so lost and seemingly beyond redemption was a pleasant surprise. The story is swift, keeping the reader involved and anticipating what happens next. A definite \\"stay up all night to read\\" book.This one goes on my \\"keeper\\" shelf."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"This was my first book by Monk and I wasn't disappointed. 'Once a Warrior' is a simple, funny, heartwarming novel, and within it, Monk reminds us that not all heros come in perfect packages. Ariella and Malcolm are meant to be together; both are strong-willed yet tormented by their pasts and their future duties. The MacKendrick elders, as well as Alpin, the seer, are a great comic relief. I was surprised at the end when the true traitor was unmasked - it wasn't who I thought it would be. If you like the works of Julie Garwood and Jude Deveraux, you'll enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"I never read books with trashy, bodice-ripping covers, butI happened across Karyn Monk's previous novel, &quot;The Rebel and the Redcoat&quot;, while stranded in an airport, and I was pleasantly surprised. Not only can she contruct a breathless, gripping plot, and create rounded complex characters, but also her grasp of historical details is more profound than that of many historians. Being an historian myself, I would recommend her novels above many textbooks. The new novel,however -- which I bought expecting to disappointed -- is not just better than the previous one, it is infinitely better, and it deserves to be issued in a more dignified hardback edition -- because it belongs alongside the very best historical fiction ever written. This is a major writer. Set in medieval Scotland, &quot;Once A Warrior&quot; paints the most vividly accurate picture of a wild and turbulent place and time, peopling it with characters so utterly believable they live on in ones heart and mind long after the novel ends, and threading everything together with what must be one of the Great love stories in every sense: intricately constructed, heartbreakingly beautiful, enormously touching, yet also aflame with passionate eroticism, and -- very rare in this genre -- real, knee-slapping humor. Many times I laughed out loud; many times too I was also moved to tears by Ms Monk's deep, compassionate understanding of the human soul. I thoroughly endorse this novel, because I cannot imagine anyone who reads not finding it among the best books they've ever had the privilege and good fortune of coming across. If there were more such writers -- ones who entertain as much as they instruct, who inspire as often as they entrall -- no one would watch television. I thank Ms Monk from the bottom of my heart for this rare masterpiece of -- yes -- literaure. In my books she ranks alongside Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf, Victor Hugo and George Eliot -- and still has something to teach these past masters about the mysteries of the heart and the exigencies of thorough research."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"I'm a sucker for the \\"tormented/scarred\\" hero in romance novels, and I discovered this one -- and the great work of Karyn Monk --through reading the reviews posted here on Amazon. Just wanted to add my five stars for this interesting, innovative historical romance. Instead of the usual \\"Braveheart\\" type warrior dashing across the moors that we've come to see in so many romances, here we have Malcolm MacFane who has suffered terrible injury in battle and seemingly has disgraced himself before his clan. We have a heroine, Ariella MacKendrick, forced to disguise herself as a man and to attempt to find a chieftain to lead her hapless clan. There is everything from humor to heartbreak in this book -- and the development of the relationship between Malcolm and Ariella is wonderful. Love scenes come later, but are wonderful!Even a little bit of \\"Arthurian legend\\" type elements come in with the powers bestowed by the MacKendrick sword. I've read other of Monks' work and know she is one of the most interesting authors out there. \\"Once a Warrior\\" won't disappoint you!"},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"When my sister lent me this book, I was a bit hesistant in reading it cuz the author was unknown to me. I also didn't think I would enjoy reading a love story with a drunken, shattered hero but as soon as I finished the Prologue, I got hooked. Unless I buy a copy for myself, I don't think I'll return this book to my sister just yet.Ariella and Malcolm's love story was truly unique. They're both full of mistrust &amp; sadness in the beginning then after mending each other's heart and spirit, love flows freely. The way Arielle denies her feelings for Malcolm was sad &amp; a bit frustrating but then again, this is what makes this story different. She wanted a perfect warrior not only for herself but also for her people. Malcolm was a disappointment to her, not only physically but she also believed his heart was not as pure as she once heard it to be. So despite what her heart says, she tries so hard to let her mind rule. She convince herself that Malcolm is not the &quot;one&quot;. Malcolm, however tall &amp; handsome, was a scarred hero. He walked with a limp and have back pains. He made a mistake once and was cast out by his own clan. He was depressed, had no more pride and self worth. He was pitiful until she offered him gold to help her clan. In the beginning, it was all because of the gold until Malcolm slowly found his pride back while training her people. He felt respect, he found his self worth and even felt he belonged somewhere. He also found love once more... Malcolm is more human than any other heroes I've read in any book. He wasn't the perfect hero I normally would prefer... but this book proved to be just as satisfying and perhaps even more intriguing, all because of Malcolm's realistic traits. Malcolm's &quot;transformation&quot; and Ariella's &quot;realization&quot; was the most touching part of this book. I have to say that their love making was the best scene I've read in such a long time. It was full of passion, full of love. Karyn Monk truly picked the most wonderful words. The emotional ways of describing their love making was heart quenching. My heart skips a bit just remembering it. I don't want to sound exaggerating but you will agree once you read this book that Malcolm and Ariella's love making scene was truly beautiful. I love this book.My small complaint is this book didn't have an epilogue. It would have been nice to read about them in the future, to know if they'll have children, how many? and so forth. Perhaps there will be a sequel? Oh well, despite that teeny weeny complaint, I still rated this book a 5 stars because it was truly an amazing read. This is my first book of Karyn Monk and I am more than please to be introduce to such a talented author. I am now in the process of reading the The Witch &amp; the Warrior. So far, it's just as fulfilling as this one."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"This was the first book that I've read by this author, and my feelings towards it were lukewarm. I wanted a love story, and this was more of a historical fiction about a Scottish clan with a love story tacked on to it.First off, the good points. The historical detail was vast and well drawn. I felt like I was really there experiencing what the author was describing. Her prose gave a vivid picture of Scottish clan life during the medieval times, yet it never felt overly wordy, or as if it detracted from the story. This is difficult to do, and I applaud Karyn Monk for being able to do this well.Also, I often find that books set in the medieval period seem to be very dark and almost devoid of humor. That was not the case in this book. This story had some very funny moments (like when Malcolm is trying to train reluctant poets and artists to become warriors) that had me laughing out loud.The action and plot was also very well done, and story had a good flow, and the pace was comfortable; interesting, yet not too fast or too slow.I also liked the idea of a physically imperfect hero. So many romances out there are about people so beautiful that they should be angels. Well, wonderful for them, but don't normal-looking people ever find love? I liked the idea of a tortured hero who will never fully recover, and yet the heroine loves him anyway. I'm so sick of novels about someone who's deaf, or bilnd, or crippled, etc, who just magically recovers. Again, can't someone who has a disability find love too? I really liked that this book tackled this subject, and the author did it well and with delicacy.My complaints? The romance part of this book was very weak. In 370 pages, it seemed that less than 50 were devoted to the relationship between the hero and the heroine. While I liked the fact that they didn't immediately fall in love (or lust), I felt that the romance aspect of this book was sacrificed for the sake of the plot. The love story was okay, but it didn't make me sigh with happiness or leave me with a warm glow, which is what I want with a romance. When they were seperated, I was not moved very much. A good romance novel usually moves me to tears when the lovers are parted. That didn't happen here.Also, this book had a secondary romance that had about 5 pages (or less) devoted to it. I kind of felt that the author shouldn't have put the second love story in the book, if she wasn't going to spend any time developing it.Still, this was an enjoyable read, and I never had to force myself to finish it. If I came across other books by this author, I might try them. Still, if you're looking for really good historical romance that has more focus on the romance, I suggest the works of Jacquie D'Alessandro, LaVryle Spencer, Sabrina Jeffries, Mary Jo Putney, Teresa Medeiros and Catherine Anderson. As for \\"Once A Warrior\\", I would recommend borrowing it from the library, as I don't think it's a keeper."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"Excellent story of a broken man and fate. A story that makes a point that the inner person is what counts more than what you see. Great story of the rebuilding of belief in your self. Malcolm was so real, not phony in his dealings with Ariella, etc. I fell in love with him. Story has great passion and desire. Also, Ariella's inner warrior spirit - fantastic. I think this story would make a great drama - comedy movie. The training of Ariella's people was hilarious! I did get worried if these two were ever going to have sexual intimacy. At about 3/4 way through the book, I just had to read ahead to see if and when it happened, and if after the build up, was the author going to give skimpy coverage to this event or the attention it deserved. Well, it was quite a love scene, full of passion, feelings, bonding, and all that both deserved especially Malcolm. He certainly knew how! One negative about the story was that I found it hard to believe that Malcolm didn't catch on sooner that Rob was Ariella. This was my first reading of a book by Karyn Monk. I was impressed. I will soon read another to see if she is as good as this one says she is."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"I have read other books by Karyn Monk and this one continues to prove her gift as a writer. With her unique characters, dramatic climaxes and quick wit, her stories are difficult to put down. I find myself lost in her stories, completely entralled with her breath-taking stories. Once A Warrior is an excellent historical romance, with lovable characters and an emotional plot. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates the beauty in romance novels."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"Malcolm MacFane has deteriorated from the mighty Black Wolf of legend into a broken man, steeped in alcohol to numb the pain of his broken body. Ariella MacKendrick needs a hero to save her peace-loving people from attack by a greedy outcast. She is sent to call upon the Black Wolf for protection and is disappointed to discover the man he has become.This tale of pain and withdrawal and redemption was brilliantly woven. It was the second of Karyn Monk's books that I've read and I'm sure to read the rest of them. She knows how to weave a marvelous tale incorporating characteristics that bring the hero and heroine off the page. One point of her writing that I do find a bit off is her tendency to throw her hero and heroine into bed based solely on lust. It seemed a bit out of character for the model of virtue that Ariella is portrayed to be, contemplating marriage to someone else, to invite Malcolm into her bed for one stolen moment of passion.I preferred THE WITCH AND THE WARRIOR, but I found this one to also be entertaining and would recommend it without hesitation."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"Once a Warrior is my first Karyn Monk book I read. I picked it up because of I just grew fond of the cover and it didn't betray me as I got hooked on at the very first pages. I love Scottish romance and I love tortured/imperfect heroes so this book is perfect for my taste because it's all about a shattered Scottish warrior. The hero, Malcolm MacFane, seems so real. He has weaknesses of a real human and I like that. The heroine, Ariella MacKendrick, is a real fighter who never falters. The secondary characters are also lovely and they pleasantly add life to the story. This book is very well written. Ms. Monk is blessed with storytelling gift. She also has a wonderful sense of humor and cleverly added a good portion of it to the story. All in all, this is a beautiful love story with unforgettable characters that will linger in your heart for a long time."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"This is the first book of Karyn Monk's that I have read. It was utterly brilliant. I read it in about 5 hours. Couldn't put it down. She had me laughing and crying the entire time. Wonderful story of honor, courage, committment, and self-forgiveness. Off to the bookstore now to buy all her books I can find."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"People often refer to romance novels as weak and plotless. Karyn Monk, however, has broken down those stereotypes, and written a romance novel with substance! Once A Warrior is a beautifully written book, with exceptionally strong main characters. The heroine, a brave woman, handles her responsibilites with a passion that is to be admired. She is strong-willed, but clearly displays a graceful and tender side as well. The hero, a refreshingly original character, has more than one battle to fight, adding excitement to this historical romance. VERY IMPRESSIVE!"},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"Pick up &quot;Once a Warrior&quot;, and be prepared to be glued to it to the end. Karyn Monk's characters are as unpredictable as predictable. Alpin, the seer, smacks of Disney's Merlin in &quot;Sword in the Stone&quot;; Ariella, the heroine, is the stereotype beautiful-slender-smart combination so loved in romances; Roderic, the villain, is the classic self-centered, cruel, but handsome bad guy. The surprise character in this book is the hero, Malcolm, a.k.a. the Black Wolf. A once fearless warrior, the man has been reduced to drinking excessively to kill the pain of battle wounds that twist and torture his body. The story is thick with deception and truth, realism and fantasy, humor and horror. You'll cheer for the good guys, snarl for the bad, and applaud for the entire book."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"Well I was very excited about this book when I first ordered it and I was really looking forward to reading it. Well It was a good book but I didn't think it lived up to the recommendations it has had. It was a bit slow throughout the book. I liked the fact that the Heor Malcolm MacFane aka the Black Wolf is not super strong but has had major injuries to overcome. I actually liked him and his friend Gavin much better than the heroine in the book, Ariella. At first I thought she would be a wonderful heroine, strong and willful but loyal and caring to her clam and to the injured Black Wolf whom she was to have been married to. Even though she helps ease his physical pain she doesn't seem to interested in helping him heal his emotional pain. She seems very cold to me. The other characters in the book make it very funny at times. The training scenes and the two old men are very humorous. All in all I would say its a good read but it could have been so much better."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"This was the first book I read of this author and I was a little worried when I picked this book up due to the other reviews. However, I really enjoyed this book. As you read the book your heart goes out to the hero, Malcolm and Ariella. If you are looking for an enjoyable read, this is for you."},{"Title":"Once a Warrior","review":"Seldom are love scenes written with such sadness as in this book, and the story was sweet and poignant, reminding me a little of Beauty and the Beast.

However, this is not the kind of book that McKitterick wrote or edited before. Academic readers, especially medievalists, may disappointedly find that this is what they need. Not to say that it is not good: It is beautifully printed and contains lots of illustrations and introductory texts about medieval Europe (a small part on China, India and the Islamic world). Thus it is suitable for non-academic readers to get into medieval history. For academic readers, the illustrations are too many and unnecessary; the texts and atlases are introductory and not detailed enough. They may be useful in undergraduate lectures but not in research."},{"Title":"Atlas of the Medieval World","review":"Well, I guess it's helpful as a quick guide, but their is a terrible lack of correlation between the text, the images, and the maps. In many cases, the geographical locations discussed in the text (even in the title of a section) is not indicated on the associated map!This work appears to be a collection of short pieces on various areas and times, with the associated maps being whatever Oxford University Press (OUP) had laying around for that period. Often, the main focus of the map is unrelated to the main focus of the text. Often, the spelling of a place name in the text differs from that on the map (they may both be correct, but the lack of consistency makes the use of the maps and text together more difficult, and further implies that the maps were not generated to support the text, or vice-versa).The maps alone may be useful, and the text alone may be useful, but you'll often go crazy trying to find a label on the map showing the area being discussed in the text. For example, the two maps in the section entitled \\"The Delhi Sultanate and the Vijayanagara India\\" indicate neither the location of the Delhi Sultinate or that of the Vijayanagara empire.The captions to images sometimes fail to even identify what the image is (e.g., a work of art with no reference to the artist or period or source).In one example, the page of text primarily discussing the Swiss Confederation (1300-1500) holds a figure related to Burgundy and a map (facing) of \\"Burgundy under Charles the Bold\\". Turn the page, and you find text primarily discussing Burgundy (1300-1500) with a map of \\"The Swiss Confederation\\" and a painting showing Burghers of the Swiss Confederation city of Lucerne being sworn in.On top of all this, there are far more typos that one would expect from OUP. Though many are minor (odd or missing punctuation, single letter misspellings, etc), the frequency indicates sloppy proof-reading.Bottom line - it appears that OUP rushed this one out; throwing in whatever maps covered the area and time period of the text; a quick proof read; but not much more. Even so, each individual section does contain a good textual overview, and the maps (considered as stand-alone references) can be useful for the purpose for which they were originally drafted."},{"Title":"Atlas of the Medieval World","review":"I love it, The book is colorful, comprehensive and covers non-European history, too, in depth.

The atlas absolutely overwhelmed me with both the maps and the teaser articles.Conceptually, it's a brilliant collection - It seems to be accurate with the myriad transitions which happened over the amazingly long, dark period it covers. I've ended up using it both as an adjunct font of research material and a printed source which is entertaining and enlightening to read.

Wars that were supposed to be about religious ideals mostly in reality seem to have been efforts for the maximum of territory to be conquered.I think this is one of the best ways to see how these systems worked.The horse and the sailing ship seemed to be a limiting factor to these empires and help to the smaller sane city states.I like the book very much."},{"Title":"Kept for the Master's use","review":"All of us are familiar with the hymn, \\"Take my life and let it be\\".

Like other nineteenth-century grammars (Gildersleeve's Latin grammar, for example, also highly recommended), this work starts from the assumption that you already know the basics. Once you've got a fair grounding in accidence (inflections, etc.) and can read a little prose, however, you are bound to start wondering &quot;why&quot; about all those rules. That's where Goodwin comes in. Thorough, systematic, carefully cross-referenced with plenty of examples (all translated), this is a veritable encyclopedia of classical Greek. It demands careful study, but it repays you for it handsomely. The only two provisos I have are that the print is very fine and may be hard on tired eyes, and that some of the terminology may differ from that used in modern texts (e.g., Gavin &amp; Betts &quot;strong aorist&quot; vs. Goodwin &quot;2nd aorist&quot;). I bought my copy when I was just starting Greek, and it sat on my shelf untouched for over a year. Now, however, I use it all the time."},{"Title":"A Greek grammar","review":"When I first tried to work through Goodwin's Grammar in learning ancient Greek, I was astounded at the sheer impenetrability of his system. It took me at least two weeks to find the verb &quot;to be&quot;! But once you get the hang of it, there's nothing like it for systematicity, thoroughness, and detail. Next to the LSJ lexicon, it's the most important volume for any student of classical Greek."},{"Title":"A Greek grammar","review":"There is a new reprint of Goodwin's original version.A Greek GrammarMy question is why did they not reprint this newer edition? I now own both books. A quick over view suggest the the 'Goodwin and Gulick' edition may be better than the original.I have not compared these books in great detail, but I would at this point recommend buying a good used copy of this edition first. It is cheaper, it is more up to date (albeit still circa 1930, it is hardcover in a nice binding, and it has a type set and lay-out, which is a bit more user friendly. Also, if you decide to buy the reprint of the 'Goodwin' grammar, buy the Macmillian press edition. I own a 1963 hardcover edition, it has a great binding and is much better than the the new soft cover I bought for my friend; the contents are exactly the same."},{"Title":"A Greek grammar","review":"As I tend to shy away from Grammar;and this book doeshave an air of rigor;it sat on the shelf for quite some time.Also,I am primarily interested in Biblical Greek;the socalled \\"crappy greek\\".

He is now out of touch with the world of the early 1990s, lonely and a heavy drinker because his third wife Penny has just left him for a younger man. His flat is in a grotty mess. He has gone to seed physically and suffers from various bodily indignities for which he regularly visits his pharmacy; and there he meets Celeste, in her early twenties, with whom he instantly falls in love. She plays along with him, but in fact - for no reason that is explained until the end - she is determined to find out all about his previous wives, and she manages to meet them all, their numerous offsprings, and a former flame as well. It is at first quite hard to grasp who everybody is: they are introduced in no particular order; two of the wives have married again (in addition to which, one of them had also been married before she married Buffy) and Buffy has seven children or step-children, the youngest now teenagers, the eldest forty. There are chapters about a woman called Lorna whose connection with his life is quite unclear until more than half way through the book. Then it breaks off to tell us about a couple called Miles and Brenda - how do they fit in?So don't worry too much about constructing a family tree - just enjoy the witty descriptions of all the characters and their thoughts, of London streets, and of the comic and/or zany incidents in the story - not least the unguessable d&eacute;nouement at the end. It seems to be a rather untidily plotted novel, but it turns out to be quite craftily constructed."},{"Title":"The Ex-wives","review":"Deborah Moggach is a consistently good read. 'The Ex-Wives' is another example of her ability to introduce characters with whom the reader can identify. They are sympathetic characters, with flaws, a complexity familiar to all of us. At the same time, the situations Moggach devises are unique.This particular novel has a happy ending, although some of her novels do not. However, rather than producing a simplistic story with the 'good' characters winning and the 'bad' characters losing, we are presented with a story that can be read at several levels.I found this novel an easy read, great for a night by the fire.

When he presented his well known \\"Bible Recitals\\" in which he quoted lengthy portions of Scripture and explained them, he would first reveal the historical background and contextual information of each passage. People began asking him for some of this information, so he decided to write his own introductory material and make it available. In 1924 he produced a sixteen page booklet of introductory information and began giving it out to people who wanted it. In time the booklet grew into a small volume, and he began calling it Halley's Pocket Bible Handbook, but before long \\"Pocket\\" was dropped from the name as the volume was too large for a shirt pocket.After an introduction, the handbook gives a survey of each book in the Old Testament, a short explanation of the time \\"Between the Testaments,\\" a survey of each book in the New Testament, and finally an overview of \\"How We Got the Bible\\" and \\"Church History\\" since the first century. What I especially like about it is all the archaeological notes which accompany the discussion of the Bible history, along with the copious maps and photographs. A copy of this book, commonly known as \\"Halley's Bible Handbook,\\" was in our home from my early days. I took it to college with me and have used it ever since. When each of our boys was in either seventh or eighth grade, I had them read a portion of the book each day all the way through as their Bible curriculum for that year. It has been said that \\"Halley's Bible Handbook contains more biblical information than any other book of its size.\\"One may not necessarily agree with every statement that Halley makes, such as his allowance that the days of creation might have been long geological eras, his implication that Noah's flood may have been a merely local deluge, or his suggestion that the ark rested on Mt. Ararat though the latter is a traditional view. However, in general he takes a basically conservative, creationist approach to the Scriptures. Of course, those who come from a liberal, modernist, and/or ecumenical standpoint will not like the book because of its \\"unquestioning literalist view of the entire Bible\\" or its \\"fundamentalist position\\" as well as its \\"anti-Catholic and anti-Muslim\\" language. Also, some have objected to Halley as a \\"white Christian supremacist\\" but I believe that this objection is the result of misunderstanding some things that he said. However, for those who accept the Bible as the divinely inspired, infallible, and authoritative revelation of God, the book is a useful resource for Biblical background information."},{"Title":"Halley's Bible Handbook - an Abbreviated Bible Commentary","review":"This handbook is a helpful guide in Bible study.

Also, old traditions attribute the Ararat range to a different area than where Mt. Ararat (formerly Mt. Masis) is located.On other points he talks about humankind seemingly only 6,000 years old (as most Biblical versions claim if generations are taken literally in Genesis). Well, like another book written in the early 1960's (The Genesis Flood) this book is out of date badly on the age of humankind as DNA studies have since totally proven human life is much older than the few thousand years these books claim.

It's a great resource to give you some background information without commentary, allowing you to come to your own conclusions. However, it is an abbreviated version of the Halley's Bible Handbook so it reads more like lecture notes or an outline. If you're looking for complete sentences and completed thoughts, get the revised and expanded edition, not this one.This book small enough that it's not too bad to carry around, but it's still about the size of 3 paperback books sandwiched together so it's definitely bigger than pocket-sized. My friend has the revised and expanded edition and it isn't that much bigger, so again, if you're looking for more than lecture notes, go ahead and get that one instead.

The hand book is easy to read it is not burdened down with difficult nomenclature, so anyone can get a lot from it.The handbook contains a bible chapter by chapter notes for the whole text, sometimes its verse by verse and sometimes chapter's on the same subject are group, but it overall is pretty comprehensive and can help one understand any difficulties they are having with the biblical text.

However I can't give it five stars because for me it just isn't deep enough. I find using a study Bible more useful for this type of overview, and there is a plethora of reference material available for deeper studies. Well done and useful, but just does not fill a need for me personally."},{"Title":"Halley's Bible Handbook - an Abbreviated Bible Commentary","review":"It is rather impressive that the 1961 edition is still in print even as there is an NIV version which is a complete re-write and not really Halley's book but just using his name. I actually own the 1965 edition which I think is pretty much the same as this one.I like the archaeology section in this book even if it is a little outdated. The book also contains a lot of interesting diagrams, charts, and pictures.My main gripe against this book is too much space is devoted to material that constitute the author's opinions and may not be that helpful to the Bible student. Halley claims in the Forward that he, \\"...sought to avoid featuring my own opinions on controversial subjects.\\" I can only imagine what subjects those might be, because as many people have pointed out the book is full of his personal opinions on many subjects.Church History section - this is mostly a long rant against the Papacy. Perhaps the Papacy was not considered a controversial subject since his intended audience obviously did not include Catholics. However, I think Halley should have stuck with talking about the Bible.A chapter entitled \\"THE SUNDAY MORNING CHURCH SERVICE\\" - The author tells us why church services should not last more than an hour and sermons 20 minutes. Why does this need to be in a Bible handbook? I have no idea. He goes on to say that \\"Congregational Singing, next to Bible Teaching, is the BEST FEATURE of a religious service\\" (capitalization is his). Personally, I think of communion as the best feature of Christian worship. However, communion doesn't warrant even a mention in this whole chapter, although the need for comfortable chairs is discussed in detail. I would think that he would have considered that some of his readers might be attending churches that observe the Lord's Supper more often than once a quarter on a Sunday night. Maybe he thought only Catholics observed communion on Sunday mornings.There is another chapter titled, \\"THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THIS BOOK IS This Simple Suggestion: THAT EACH CHURCH HAVE A CONGREGATIONAL PLAN OF BIBLE READING and THAT THE PASTOR'S SERMONS BE FROM THE PART OF THE BIBLE READ THE PAST WEEK Thus connecting The Pastor's Preaching with the People's Bible Reading.\\" Kinda says it all, I guess. The author actually states that his personal opinion on this topic is the most important thing in the book. Is this the same guy that in the Forward said, \\"In the main, it is a book of FACTS, Biblical and Historical.\\"?I would give the book less than three stars if it didn't happen to include a lot of interesting archaeology, pictures and maps which make it seem worth keeping on my bookshelf to refer to occasionally."},{"Title":"Halley's Bible Handbook - an Abbreviated Bible Commentary","review":"A good beginning handbook for the novice, Halley will give all students of Christianity a good, basic overview of the Bible's sixty-six books. His synopsis of what each book is about are especially useful. The only reason I don't rate the book higher is Halley's fundamentalist position permeates much of the book, leaving no doubt about his stance on every position. Halley is a traditionalist of the first order who maintains each book was written by the person whom it is credited to, and he attacks &quot;modern scholars&quot;, whom he accuses of trying to destroy the Bible through modern criticism, at every turn. In this respect, much of his &quot;scholarship&quot; suffers from a lack of objectivity or, apparently, historical and archeological fact. Of course, Halley is a product of the 1920's (when he first began writing the book) and his world outlook reflects that. He is also vehemently anti-Catholic and anti-Muslim, considering both belief systems a part of the curses poured forth in the Book of Revelations. Like I said, Halley is a good place to start, but not a very good place to finish. I would recommend it only as a first step."},{"Title":"Halley's Bible Handbook - an Abbreviated Bible Commentary","review":"Yes, Mr. Halley was something of a white Christian supremacist (but back in the 1920's so were a lot of Americans). He does appear in his handbook to use the good book to advocate the view of Japhetites (Aryans) being meant to conquer the earth and rule over Hamites (blacks) and Semites (Jewish people).Mr. Halley was very wrong to do this but then again a lot of people used to feel this very same way. And he was a young earth creationist. This was rare for a 1920's Christian, as in the 1920's Old Earth Creationsm was the way of the day for people who took the Bible so literally. However, in his handbook Mr. Halley shows that, while indeed an advocate for young humankind, he believed in a regional flood of Noah rather a worldwide one (unlike most YEC's). This is a sanity saving grace (no pun intended) on the author's part. Mr. Halley also discusses the possibility of the six day creation period being 6 long geogical eras of time. In short, his racial views are more offensive than his creationist ones (though the latter are sometimes still a bit ridiculuos looking too)."},{"Title":"Halley's Bible Handbook - an Abbreviated Bible Commentary","review":"I bought this book because it was free in the Kindle store for a spell. I'm glad I didn't pay anything for it.Overall, my problem with this book is twofold: 1) it takes an unquestioning literalist view of the entire Bible, and 2) it demonstrates a severe lack of intellectual curiosity throughout.I maintain that the result is worse than no study guide whatsoever.The fact that Christianity is a broad tent, and that the Bible has been read in various ways over the century and today, is lost to Halley. I do not mind the presentation of the literalist view if it were combined with other credible viewpoints past and present. But to assert that this is the ONLY way to read the Bible is doing a terrible disservice to a religion, and misrepresents it in a egregious fashion. Christianity has had a brief literalist bubble, and there is much that the thinking Christian can question about such an interpretation, which is perhaps why it is dying off.Let me provide a few choice quotes.\\"Accept the Bible just as it is, for exactly what it claims to be. Don't worry about the theories of the critics. The ingenious efforts of modern criticism to undermine the historical reliability of the Bible will pass...\\" It is terribly bothersome to me that a purported study guide is encouraging people trying to intellectually engage the Bible to suspend their intellect. For whom shall find Christianity relevant today if we cannot understand it in the context of modern science? Christianity ought not fear science, nor science religion; the two ought to be embraced together, and the religious can learn about the Bible from science.Regarding the creation story: \\"How did the writer know what happened before man appeared? No doubt God revealed the remote past, as later the distant future was made known to the prophets.\\" No mention of other viewpoints -- that it has strong parallels to other ancient creation myths, what science and philosophy have to say, etc. Even Wikipedia's Creation_myth page reminds us that the Church was not literalist.In the introduction, it advances the view that the Bible is \\"God's own record of His dealings with people in His unfolding revelation of Himself to the human race... Nor do we know just how God directed these authors to write. But we believe and know that God did rect them and that these books therefore must be exactly what God wanted them to be.\\"That is of course a rather controversial view, though it was perhaps widely held in some circles. But it boggles the mind, and ignores, for one thing, the multiple ancient sources that modern Bible assemblers must attempt to synthesize to make a coherent book.The only value I see in this book is a glimpse at the viewpoint of an earlier age. At that it may excel. As a guide for someone alive today -- frankly I am surprised that it has garnered such high reviews here."},{"Title":"San Jose State University: An interpretive history, 1950-2000","review":"For an 'Establishment' reading of the 'official version' of San Jose State University's rise to prominance in California's system of Higher Education this certainly was expected to be definitive. Unfortunaly, to dwell on the 'Administrative History' of such a great Institution of Learning on the west Coast, would be like writing about UC Berkeley in the 20th century without mention once of \\"Telegraph Avenue\\" or Sather Gate.Much of the political and social history of the San Jose campus is to be found in the role the surrounding community played in its story, and the critical account of the student body and 'town and gown' relationship of the Township shich frequented the College before and after it recieved Univeity status in the early 70s is missing.A survey of accounts by those that played a role on the National Stage as with Instructor Harry Edwards and Tommie Smith and their movement to boycott the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, or my own role in revising San Jose State's Governing apparatus in the late 60s and pave the way for University Status with the advent of an advanced and implementation under Rober D. CLark of a Student/ Faculty joint governing process is almost lost in this very managerial approach to the turbulant history of this great institution.My own Memoirs, or samples of several other accounts shedding light on such National and International events as the Olympic Boycott already mention, in addition to the impasse between faculty and administration under John Bunzel's stewardship in the 70s, and the critical story of the de-tente' that developed between the campus and nearby City Hall under the succeeding stewardship of Campus President, Gayle Fullerton is almost lost in the haze of irrelevant detail.A book that begs to be compared with other versions and accounts emerging of related important history of the surrounding Silicon Valley and the integration of the story to the surrounding region is dying to be told in its absense.Inadequate to the task. Perpahs only useful as a introduction to a radical era and Institution and its magnitude of impact it had on California's oldest institution of higher learning - and the State's history of the role higher education played in state and national politics and society.Tim K Fitzgerald"},{"Title":"Enduring Culture: A Century of Photography of the Southwest Indians","review":"Keegan's work serves as an excellent example of how American Indians continue to be photographed and marketed as exotic Others. For Keegan, as well as others who make a living photographing and selling images of \\"Indians,\\" American Indians only appear photogenic when they are wearing ceremonial regalia. The images of Indians taken at the turn of the 20th century that are slapped along Keegan's work in this text convey Southwestern Indians as frozen in time and unchanging. The picture of modern American Indians is a lot more complex than what is presented in Keegan's much blurred and distorted photography."},{"Title":"Changes in Attitude","review":"Changes in Attitude is a great read. The story moves along nicely, bringing delightful characters into the reader's life. I'm especially taken with Allie's assistant, Gil. Oh, if only he wasn't fictional!Shaputis did her homework for this book as well. Reading fun fiction is great, but reading fun fiction AND actually learning something...well, I think that bumps it up a notch or two.I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys great characters and an excellent story."},{"Title":"Changes in Attitude","review":"Allie Thompson has built a successful career in producing educational software in Southern California. She was content with her life until she realized something was missing: a baby. Not having the right man to share this desire, Allie decided on artificial insemination and headed to the Internet in search of a father for her child.With more help than she bargained for from her best friend, Soozi, and her business assistant, Gillian, Allie was ready for her pregnancy and beyond. That was until she met, Jack. Allie never expected to meet Mr. Right, after she got pregnant.The plot of this book is sure to touch many people's heart as more and more women focus on their career these days and may decide to have children when they are older. It is also not uncommon that these women become very particular about who they want to father their child (and rightly so) and end up doing what Allie did.A story revolving around a self-centered main character looking for something or someone to enrich her life, her alcoholic best friend and her gay and vain assistant certainly has a bit of chick lit quality to it. However, I found the writing style to be much more of the romance genre. The writer was so keen on repeatedly giving very detailed description of the physical appearance of the characters (which, in my opinion, had nothing to do with plot or character development) that it was a bit overdone; after all, how many times do readers have to be reminded of Allie's flat stomach or Gillian's manicured hands?Some of the dialogues in the books were fairly well done in the sense that when I read the conversation between Allie and her friends in restaurants, I could absolutely imagine myself stuck sitting next to a bunch of loud women gabbing and laughing, totally oblivious to the diners around them. On the other hand, a lot of the times, I could not help but laugh at the lines some of the characters had--for example, when one of them said, 'Just hold me', I had to wonder: who talks like that?If you are looking for chick lit and like the works of Helen Fielding, Jennifer Weiner, Jane Green or Sophie Kinsella, you might be a tad disappointed.Armchair Interviews says: This book is definitely a summer beach reading targeted at people who enjoy romance novels."},{"Title":"Changes in Attitude","review":"I loved this book. It was such a great escape from my own life. The story and characters kept me intrigued. I was eager to get to the end to see how it all played out, only to be saddened when it was over because it was so much fun. I can only hope there is a follow-up book!The writing is witty. The characters are charismatic. It was a joy to read.I would highly recommend it to Parrot Heads and non-Parrot Heads alike. Everyone should enjoy this one."},{"Title":"Changes in Attitude","review":"This is, by far, one of the worst books I have ever read. The dialouges were laughable and the characters annoying. The story has potential if not for the style of writing - there is a reason why I avoid the romance sections in bookstores; if I had known better, I would never have picked up this book!"},{"Title":"Changes in Attitude","review":"This is a \\"can't put down\\" book. The story moves along nicely and the characters are so much fun. And just wait until the end...you'll be laughing out loud.I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Changes in Attitude","review":"Wow!,every woman single,married,or divorced will love this story. The characters are fun and easy to relate too.(\\"I know that person!\\") Love Gillian's part in all of it. He makes you smile a lot as you're reading. PH factor will become a widely used household phrase! I enjoyed it so much, bought 2 more as gifts.Can't wait for the next book from Kathleen. Knowing too, Gillian will be involved."},{"Title":"Changes in Attitude","review":"Make sure the laundry is caught-up before you start this one because you won't want to put it down!"},{"Title":"Changes in Attitude","review":"It almost seems like Shaputis is just using Buffett references for their marketing value in this book. The main character is supposedly a parrothead, but she strays pretty far from what I would consider the key parrothead ideals in her shallow and pop-culture obsessed life. The MC's love of reading seemed like her only Buffett-related virtue. The rest of her life just seemed like a struggle to make and spend money- albeit occasionally on a rayon tropical shirt. She didn't seem particularly into the outdoors or the water, or the environment, or the tropics or flying or boating. Also, even the Buffett references stuck to the superficial. It seemed like the only songs and albums mentioned were the big moneymakers. Doesn't every true parrothead love a more obscure Buffett tune or two? Despite being in the female-parrothead-single-late-twenties demographic that this book seems marketed toward, I found it lacking. It was just too west coast yuppie for me."},{"Title":"Shifting Worlds, Changing Minds : Where the Sciences and Buddhism Meet","review":"Since this book is into shifting worlds and changing minds it is best approached with a perspective open to change. What you get is a systematic dismantling of the cult of rationality through an examination of human perception. The result is a simpler, more natural way of being, free from the limitations of particular belief systems. The idea is that the emancipated mind finds peace through awareness and compassion.It is clearly written, but a bit scholarly drawing from a broad base of scientific and philosophical thought. As such it organizes and makes accessible some of the brightest thinkers of all time."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"While updating 'Anomaly at Fortune Lake,' I searched for classic first contact stories. Of course, Contact is known as one of the best, and I wasn't disappointed. The book's real world astronomy, with technology not overly exaggerated, will appeal to readers of all ages. If you're an avid amateur astronomer, like me, you must read this classic. Endings are always the toughest part to write (I struggle in my own books), and Sagan has stepped up to the challenge, with a firmer ending than in the movie-version of this book."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I am normally not a science fiction reader. I enjoy non fiction and rarely dabble in fiction but i had to make an exception for carl sagan. I read essentialy all his other works and decided i had to read this book and lets just say i was not disapointed. This is a must read for everyone, especially fans of sagan or astronomy. It is well written and has a gripping story. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Great book. After 20 years I keep on going back to my favorite passages. I've always had a \\"thing\\" about initial contacts,the value of \\"pi\\" and its place in the universe. Contact ties math, science, and science fiction all together. Like all critics, I could chop out at least 50 pages to quicken the pace."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Good book to pick up.What Carl has done here is an attempt to imagine what first contact with an alien civilization would be for Earth, but utilizing a background of science rather than science fiction. It's a look at how two civilizations, grown up in different systems with little if anything in common would communicate (spoilers: a long transmission utilizing prime numbers as they don't occur naturally in nature). He proceeds with all the relations to human civilization that such a transmission would bring about, in terms of religion, culture, social interaction, interaction between nations and politics, the economics of (spoiler: building a machine with blueprints that the aliens have transmitted), and the search for what it means to know that we are definitely not alone.It's deeper than I'm making it sound, of course.The style is definitely different than most novels, which may be a little odd, but it's worth it. Give it a read or watch the movie. Free on Amazon for Prime members."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I had read a bunch of Sagan's nonfiction, and was sure he had some fictionout there, but when I read this novel I found that I was wrong. A very goodand imaginative work by a real Astrophysicist, man makes contact withaliens through SETI and build the device the aliens give them plans to sothat first contact can be achieved. The ending is not what you wouldthink, but is still very good. I would recommend this book to fans ofArthur C Clarke, as it is in the mold of 2001 and other books which portrayan alien culture as so advanced as to be beyond our understanding."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This novel for me was exactly what I was looking for in a Sci-Fi story. As other reviewers have mentioned, Carl Sagan does such an amazing job of extending from our current (well, his current...) time that the story becomes very believable. At times I had to remind myself that it was, after all, still a story I was reading, and not the present reality.The characters in the story were deep, and there were few characters introduced that the story did not build on extensively in some way. Relationships were well-developed, and earlier presumptions that I had about characters changed as the events of the story unfolded and roles were reversed. It was surprising to me how well this book was written, considering that the author was an physicist. It's almost sad for me that this was his only novel..I almost didn't buy this book, because I had seen the movie years ago, but I'm certainly glad that I did. Next in line for me is Cosmos, also by Sagan, which I'm hoping will be as rewarding of read as Contact was."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"The book arrived timely and was in decent condition for pre-owned. And I also enjoyed the little personal note about the previous owner; book lovers know there are stories not just within, but about the books themselves!!! Thanks :-)"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Another great book by Carl Sagan. I expected a great book by the Pulitzer Prize winner author of Cosmos... Carl Sagan ( see my review 5 stars) and I was not disappointed.As an amateur astronomer of 40 years I knew of the famous distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan. All of the basic astronomy used in this great Sci Fi I knew about but I know very little of Radio Astronomy. By reading this book I learned a few tidbits about Radio Astronomy. To me this book was fascinating.We see the central character Ellie Arroway growing up and eventually getting a PHD and becoming a world class astronomer in charge of a huge radio telescope... project Argus. Dr. Arroway leads a team and finds an ET signal originating from near the star Vega beaming to Earth. Project Argus receives a signal of prime numbers and then the The ETs beam back a radio signal received from us of Hitler and the Olympic games in the late 30s. Embedded in the signal is a message of instructions for us to build a 2 trillion dollar machine but there is problems getting the \\"primer\\" message to understand it. Eventually we get the \\"primer\\" and build the machine in the US, Russia and Japan. 5 people are selected to go into the machine ( Dr. Arroway is one of them) and using wormhole technology on double black holes are.....that's enough I wont ruin the book for you. Just to say the famous 5 are threatened to not say what they discovered and let the world think the machine did not work. But it did....! At the end of the book we learn the final message.Carl Sagan was a world class astronomer and scientist that also worked as part of the Viking Mars spacecraft team. One of the things I liked about Carl was his seemingly effortless way of making complex problems in astronomy and science understandable to the general public. That is a rare gift. Many times brilliant men/women can not write to the average laymen complex thoughts in a way for the less educated to understand. Carl was a master at this.This is excellent Sci Fi. Also some real Astronomy and some Radio Astronomy is used. The book reads very well. A fast read. The characters are well established and there is good interaction. As a novice to Radio Astronomy it was great learning a few very, very basic tidbits of Radio Astronomy.Also Contact was a major motion picture from Warner Brothers. I remember seeing the movie and liked it too. The book was just as good.5 stars for a very enjoyable book.Sadly Carl Sagan passed away in 1996. The world misses a great astronomer, scientist and a great man. Even though he never knew of me I considered Carl Sagan a friend who I respected very much."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I enjoyed the movie and thought I'd love the book but had so much trouble getting through it. Don't think I even read it all before trading it for another book."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I thought this book was excellent. Sagan does a wonderful job of predicting the reactions of various people --given their occupations, ideologies, worldviews, etc.---were contact with extraterrestrial civilizations ever to be made. Sagan's insight into Ellie's character is understandably, considering his own work as a scientist, apt and in depth --in my opinion.The debates between the scientists and ecclesiastics were something all too real for me, and I thought the interactions between different governments, and their marked suspicion of each other, was both appalling and accurate. One of the hallmarks of GOOD science fiction, in my opinion, is the ability to use real science within the story (of course the occasional divergence into the purely theoretical is sometimes necessary for things such as interstellar travel) and in this respect Sagan hits the mark head on. Definitely one of my favorite science fiction books, apart from the works of Adams and Asimov. I will be giving this book as a gift to a few choice friends."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This is an excellent book, both because it is so imaginative and so concrete. Carl Sagan's excellent science knowledge make the ideas plausible in a sci-fi kind of way. Where the book leaps up and excels is that it is so eerily close to what I could imagine happening in the real world, the government official are real, the talks, the deliberations, the project, and the reactions of people. If aliens contacted us tomorrow, this book would be the blueprint, there would be groups for it, groups against it, and groups willing to go to any length to thwart the meeting. If you have seen the movie, compare the end of the book to that of the movie, see who gets in the last &quot;blow&quot; science or religion. It is interesting to see how they differ. This is one of the most excellent books I have read."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I saw the movie Contact, and I wanted to read the book. Boy, this is a great book! Much more detail and plot than the move (no kidding right!). Once you start reading this book, you will not want to stop until you are done. It is not an overly technical book, but one everyone can read and enjoy... you may even learn something about science and space!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Contact is slow going at times, and the story wanders occasionally, but in the end you end up with an inspiring and alltogether magnificent novel."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This book was a terriffic read. I really enjoyed it. Although I am not generally a fan of Science-Fiction, I found this book amazingly realistic. However, the movie of this book was a big dissapointment. I found that the story was incredibly different in the movie, although the basics stayed the same. If you have seen the movie, then I suggest you read this, and be prepared for a pleasant surprise. In the copy I read, there were quotes relavent to the coming chapter on the page preceeding. This gave an extra depth to the story. I wasn't able to put the book down. This book is an amazing read for anyone who has looked up at the stars and has wondered if we are alone."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I read this book shortly after I saw the movie, just after completing my sophomore year in high school. The book went much more in depth than the movie; something that usually makes books better than the movies that are based on them; which is true in this case.If you can understand the complex math and science that is interwoven into the chapters (I didn't, but I read it anyway :) you'll probably enjoy it that much more. Otherwise I would have rated it five stars. A must for for the obsessive sci-fi reader (such as myself :)."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Normally, I don't read fiction, but when the author is Carl Sagan, I stand up and take notice. And Contact is well worth it to. What makes it even better is Sagan's accurate scientific detail that applies to the situation he is creating, although few people can appreciate this. Much like watching Star Trek, the scientific inaccuracies don't get in the way of a great series, but it sure would've enchanced it more!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Not only is this book appealing to science-fiction readers, it also stays true to the Sagan tradition of relaying True Scientific information to most anyone, be it the next Stephen Hawkins, or the average human."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I firmly belive there is intellegent life out there, and this book gave me the opportunity to experience the discovery long before it will likely actually happen. Being a scientist myself, I could appreciate Sagan's fine walk along science fact and fantasy and he leaves it believeable throughout. The ending is a final treat. What was espcially pleasing was that I read this book after visiting Aercibo and the VLSA referred to in the movie or book, and so had the atmosphere fresh in my mind."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This is one of those rare occasions where I actually liked the movie better than the book, though not by much. Most other times movies have been based on books, the movies have come across as complete trash - the plot not what it had been in the novel. This time, the *basics* of the plot stayed the same, although there were some changes made for the movie.Overall, I did like it, but as the summing line said: I could have done without the ending."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"After watching the movie, I _finally_ decided to get the book to see if it cleared up any of the (relatively few) plot holes that were in movie. And for me at least, it did. Fortunately, the book rarely used complex technical terms and so was very easy to understand. I couldn't recommend a better science fiction book!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Carl Sagan has done a good job of popularizing a sciences such as astronomy and physics and making them accessible to non-scientists like myself. The plot in the book is sort of cool but it just seem overly simplistic.Also, the characters were AWFUL. Just devices to carry the plot. I found myself not caring about a single one of them. Some of them were downright ridiculous. I'm glad that generally, Sagan stuck to non-ficton.There's better stuff out there."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Carl Sagan may be a brilliant public relations man for science. And for that I thank him. But he should have stuck to TV shows. I struggled to enjoy this book and eventually stopped halfway through. The general story line is okay, although rather prosaic, and done before, but his writing and development of characters is pathetic. I got no feeling for the passion that drives anyone to seek understanding. People seem to think that scientists are stoic &amp; unimaginative; nothing is further from the truth. Carl failed to develop real characters within an interesting story. My suggestion to readers - pick a real science fiction writer (who was also a scientist with passion) and read Azimov's robot series - much more entertaining."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This is one of those odd cases where the movie is better than the book. I saw the movie first and enjoyed it. Then I read the book. The book is drawn out and slow moving, the characters are poorly developed and it is full of Sagan's political agenda that detracts from what should be a fun sci-fi novel."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This is not a book for any fan of thought provoking science fiction. The writing style is plodding turgid and unsubtle. The book deals with the philosophical issues concerning the discovery of Alien intelligence as ludicrously juvenile simplicity. &quot;occams Razor&quot;, &quot;Does god exist or not&quot; Yech! reminds me of arguments I had when I was in High school! While such issues are of concern to the ignorant masses, real intellectuals, the sort of people who would actually detect and decode such a message would have no time for them. A much better Science Fiction book on the issue, sadly out of print, that deals with the same issue in an adult educated fashion is &quot;The Masters Voice&quot; By Stanislav Lem. Go to a Big library take this out and read it instead of this pulp drivel, you will not be disappointed! By the way I must add the disclaimer that I have always been a big fan of the outlook of Carl and very much appreciate what his non fiction books have done, and I also feel sad that he had to pass away in such an untimely fashion, its just that when it comes to fiction he should have stuck to his day job as a non-fiction writer."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"When I saw the film I felt there was a lot left out. The film's narrative seemed disjointed and rushed. The book while it does fill in some of those glossed in details has its own pacing problems. After spending pages and pages explaining why something can't be done, this road block is suddenly gone. Then there's the ultimate \\"trip\\" to Vega is just as disappointing in the book (though certainly more coherent than the cinematic version)."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"If you are a fan of the movie version starring Jodie Foster, you will HATE this book.Carl Sagan was a brilliant scientist, but a fictional writer, he was not. Instead of creating compelling characters, great dialogue, and a moving plotline, Sagan's Contact is filled with government and science community hearings that go on forever and ever.Almost every character and every plot and character point in the book is different from the movie--but the movie is infinitely better.For one, you cannot follow who is who nor are able to understand enough about any characters (sometimes even Ellie) to even connect name to information about them. Ellie, for example, never developes a relationship of any depth with Palmor Joss. In fact, Joss is a very minor character in Sagan's version, a lesser religious figure opposed to the machine. Instead, she's in love with Der Herr (whoever that really is?) and has a live-in relationship with him.The machine has five people who go, not just Ellie.Even Hadden is different and far less important than he is in the movie.This would be okay if Sagan's work was well written and sound as a piece of fiction. But it's not. it's confusing, hard to follow, and just not very well constructed. The characters are flat and uninteresting.I found reading this book a chore.I gave it away to a used book store as soon as I finished reading it!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I can't believe all the 5 star reviews of this title. I've read a lot of books, and this is only the 2nd one I've found that had almost no redeeming qualities. The biggest problem I had were the charecters. Not once did I care what happened to any of them, and the spice girls have more depth. The idea behind the book was okay, incredibly overdone, but okay. Now if only the author had concentrated on that instead of spending 10 pages telling me about a religious debate. After the first 200 pages I realized it wasn't going to get any better, and the only thing that kept me reading was the fact that I wanted to know what the message said (and even then I had to start skipping pages at a time to make it through). All in all, this book sux."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"With all due respect for the late Mr Sagan, he might be a brilliant astronomer but he was definitely not a good story teller for several reasons:1. Throughout the book, there're plenty passages which are redundant & irrelevant to the story development. For example, I found that you can actually skip the whole Ch 10 (and Ch 17 too) without affecting the story development at all - which is not a good thing for a fiction.2. Perhaps also due to the above, the story movt is very slow. At times it gives me the feeling that the author does not know how the story should progress, so every other 2 or 3 pages, he repeated & recapitulated the then situation of the story.Actually the idea of the story was great, but sadly it's a waste for the idea has not been developed into an attractive story. I like the movie but not the book.PS for a debate of science vs religion, I would recommend \\"Angels & Demons\\" by Dan Brown. The outline of ideas & controversy is far clearer than \\"Contact\\"."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I didn't see the film but I read the book and was disappointed. Sagan's agent walked into his office and said &quot; You have to do a work of fiction.&quot; to which he replied &quot;I can do that, I'll just put a couple of characters into COSMOS!&quot; I am awed by the amount of 5 star reviews that are here. Sagan seemed to have overwhelming optimism that humans might one day explore the stars, after reading the reviews of this book, I can only conclude that if these are the same people who show interest in said exploration than perhaps the galaxy is better off having these slack-jawed troglodites gravity bound to their homeworld."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I was excited to learn that a reputable scientist, Carl Sagan, wrote a book about our first contact with extra-terrestrials. What would a respected scientist have to say on the subject? What would he think the aliens would be like? Unfortunately Carl Sagan didn't write the book I thought he wrote. We don't meet any aliens in this book. In order to make contact, it's not enough to just make contact with ourselves. Without spoiling the ending, I'll just say that the characters don't end up shaking hands with Bob Schultz from the planet Nebulus. What this book is about is the stubborn, corrupt stupidity of the scientific establishment and the cowardice of our space travelers who knuckle under pressure. It's a stupid book. It's about as satisfying as banging the top of your head against the inside of your car after you return the ice scraper to the glove compartment. This is the only case I know where the movie is far superior to the book instead of the other way around."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"although, for lack of free time, it took me just under six months to read this book, I enjoyed it thoroughly. It seemed to help expand my imagination, and consider possibilities that I've never thought about before. It had all the elements to make a good book... and just in case you're wondering.... IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THE MOVIE!! :):)"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I read this book after I saw the movie. There were a lot of holes in the plot of the movie, I figured that it's a good idea to find out what's this all about.I finished the book in two days. It's a difficult book, with a lot of technical terms and jargons. But generally, it's a very good sci-fi book which stirs up your imagination. It encourages you to look at the sky at night and ponder about life.I am shocked by Sagan's knowledge about the history and culture of many other countries, like China, India, Nigeria, and former USSR. If you have read his Dragons of Eden, you will find that he knew a lot about evolution, animal behaviors and psychology too.Two problems exist though. He was not very good at dramatizing the important events, like the death of Drumlin, making the flow of story not very exciting. Another one was his use of love at the very end of the book, was that necessary?"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"OK... I read this book few weeks ago, and I didn't really like it. After reading all the reviews, i read it once more, and I still didn't get the idea.First of all, this book has nothing special. Have you ever read 2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke? The idea of Grand Central Station and extraterrestrial intelligence 'cultivating' civilization was already mentioned in 2001. The 'Machine' is just like the black monolith which transfers Dave Bowman to... somewhere. And the part when the alien (who disguised as Ellie's dad) talks about Beethoven and peace stuff, I couldn't help smiling. I think it is ridiculous and funny, or rather cute. And after all, why would the alien stay away from human being when the Five already visited them? To be honest, I think the whole story is a big HOAX. I didn't give one or two stars though, because I liked the last part. It was unlike other Science Fiction novels."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Carl writes a possible scenario for contact with beings in other galaxies, and the reactions of groups pro and con to such a contact. Being of fair mind as regards religion, race and sex, his characters are socially advanced for the mid 80's.The protagonist is a female astrologer who is the first to decipher messages from what seems to be outer space giving mankind the secrets to space travel. Aspects of the inevitable space trip are imaginative and interesting, as are the motives and suspicions of the earthlings.Carl shares his own investigation into the rhelms of religion, science, human relations and politics as he attempts to help us understand and examine ourselves.Although full of worthy philosophical questions and well written, the book takes the reader to the brink of something significant and then drops the subject. It's not difficult to read (quite admirable for an academic), and although it's examination of motives is stimulating, it tends to meander regarding a goal.His target might be for the reader to search and allow her/his imagination the freedom to find and evaluate truths... to consider the possibilities without prejudice.Maybe he did achieve a goal afterall."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I read Contact after seeing the film, and without a doubt, the book is leaps and bounds better. For one thing, the emphasis of the story is quite different. Rather than concentrating quite so much on the main character's beliefs and love interests, as the film tended to do, the book instead delves fairly well into how contact with an alien civilization might play out on a sociological level.For that matter, Contact also shows a balanced an forthright view of the battle between science and religion, and how the two are not mutually exclusive. On this point, it should also be noted that to interpret Sagan's writing in Contact as atheistic, as one reviewer here claims, is to have missed the point of a great deal of the book. Sagan's views as demonstrated by Contact and the characters he conjures in it are decidedly theistic in tone. Sagan makes it clear in several ways that the main character's strongest motive is a search for spirituality through scientific enlightenment. Also balanced against the main character's atheistic opinions are the opinions of several well-rounded characters for whom the spiritual and the scientific are complimentary and mutually reinforcing ideals. All in all, Sagan's treatment of the subject shows a high degree of sensitivity to the subtleties of spirituality, while also making it clear that extremists in any camp are dangerous and frequently irrational. Sagan's strongest criticisms in the book are reserved for the thoughtless, insensitive, and fanatical regardless of what their basic belief systems are.Also note that there are several major plot lines and characters found in the book that are wholly absent from the movie. Readers of the book are lucky though, as this difference is to their benefit. Sagan's characters are quite interesting and diverse, and the plot is much better, if a bit politically dated.I enjoyed reading Contact immensely. Those of a philosophical and analytical bent should get a kick out of the arguments between the characters and groups scattered throughout Contact.However, I'm not particularly enthused about the ending. I won't spoil it, but I will say that it's too obvious and strives too hard to reconcile science and spirituality.Contact was certainly worth reading however, and I wish Sagan had lived long enough to write more fiction."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"If you thought the movie was great, do yourself a giant favor and put this at the top of your reading list. Sagan's novel is light years better than its film counterpart.The writing, concepts, and characters are so wonderful I forgot this was Science Fiction I was reading. Even though I thought I knew the story from the movie (there are some big differences), I got wholly caught up in the excitement and possibilities. I really didn't want this one to end.An excellent touch presented by Sagan is the inclusion of quotations from a multitude of diverse sources at the beginning of each chapter. The persons and characters quoted are a well rounded group and really give a terrific perspective to the ideas presented in the novel.Perspective is what this novel is about. Though written more than 15 years ago, Contact is still very contemporary--especially during a time when it's difficult and even painful to see hope in our world. In this novel you can take delight again in being human. You come away feeling like a kid again.Highest accolades to this work--one of the best novels I've ever read."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"contact is one of my favorite movies. it has content, something lacking from most hollywood drivel. i figured, the universal rule is that the book is always better than the movie, so i should read the book. i was vastly dissapointed.the movie seemed to be more well thought out, have a more consistant theme, and have more parallelisms and symbolisms with respect to religion and science. there were differences on the order of detail, up to major plot changes, and in each and every case, i thought that the movie version was far superior.this is, without a doubt, a rare case where the movie is better."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Yeah, I saw the movie, that's why I read the book.This book runs at 431 pages, about 100 pages too long. There was time wasted... I found myself skipping the long, drawn out technical details (this from a zealuos Asimov fan) and the parts about the past histories of the characters. Speaking of which, they were uninteresting.But the plot, the plot! Perhaps the most important discovery ever is made! But where is the sense of wonder? Who knows, maybe it was the most extremely anticlimactic ending ever. Anyone who hasn't seen the movie would be thinking: &quot;allright, we get to see the aliens now! What will it be? Magnificient cities? Strange cultures? Exotic creatures?&quot; No, no, and no. Let me give you a hint: it's a family reunion, yawn. The same reader might be thinking: &quot;Man, no one's gonna believe this one, but the aliens are smart enough to give some evidence, even if they are total jerks.&quot; No again. The closest we get to evidence is some sand. Aliens who have gained great technology developed throught the FREAKING SCIENTIFIC METHOD expect us to take this stuff on faith!And you gotta agree with the skeptics here. They even provided me with a few out-loud laughs when they read my mind on several occasions.Despite all its faults, though, there was some good stuff. The philosphy stuff was well done, if not emphasized enough. But hey, at least it wasn't movie (that's a whole different rant)."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I actually saw the movie before I read the book, so was partially biased through that experience, but in spite of it, I was enthralled by the sheer brilliance on display in Contact. A brilliant story, challenging, stimulating and tightly-written, it's speculative science fiction at it's very best."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This book is about the human race's first contact with extra terrestrials, in the form of a radio waves from space. If you have seen the movie, let it be known: it simply does not do the book justice. The book is above and beyond the movie in almost every way, although the movie itself wasn't too shabby. The story provokes a lot of thinking in the reader by making them wonder what would happen if something like this occurred, and by also having conflict between the characters and between their religious views. If you are at all interested in science fiction or SETI, then I suggest you read this book!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This is my first book I've read by Carl Sagan and it was a spectacular ride. It teases all your emotions. So,what would happen in society in all parts of the world IF contact was made?, this is as real as your going to get in my opinion. I saw the film years ago and was upset by the ending but this book covers and goes over what really happened on that trip through the galaxy, and of course the novel is always better. What I got most from this read was an actual education, I learned more science in this book than in school(do they still teach science in school?),I finally understand Pi. Most worthy of what I got out of this book since I'm an Atheist myself was the discussions between characters about the interwoven arguments between science and religion. As well as what an entire world would go through mentally if a alien being was known to us. Fear,happiness,questioning faith,and a feeling that us humans are very very small, and how a world can come together in such a crisis or should I say 'such a moment in our history'.Sagan has a incredible style that is very well thought out and scientific, yet explains it to the reader in such an easy to understand way that like I said, is understood by the casual and hardcore reader. His character development is on point, with so many main characters its hard to fully understand their situations but Sagan had woven their origin perfectly and no character is felt as lackluster or incomplete. I had feelings for these people,loving and hating characters is a sign of great writing.I urge everyone to give this a try for you will learn something of the human race, religion, science, philosophy,and world government, economics and the lessons we need to learn if such a scenario did happen for REAL, the coming together as a species for the benefit of the world. A must read and I'm still thinking about this story days after I finished."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"While I have read hundreds of books, I can count one hand the books I have re-read. After recently watching the movie Contact again (one of my favorites!), I went to my library and grabbed the book (first edition) which I hadn't read since I originally bought it. I won't go into detail on the book because many other reviews have performed that function, but I did want to point out a couple of prescient things that Mr. Sagan wrote in the book which was published in 1985.At the start of chapter 8, Ellie is channel surfing and two shows are mentioned, Lifestyles of the Mass Murderers and You Bet Your Ass. Now, while Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous had been on TV a year or so prior to the publication of the book, I thought Mr. Sagan did a great job of predicting the popularity of reality shows and the fact that Ass is no longer a forbidden word on TV. In fact, Wikipedia tells me that there was a show on The Comedy Network in 2005 called You Bet Your Ass.In chapter 12 there is mention of \\"robot roving vehicles on Mars\\". While there had been two failed attempts to land rovers on Mars in 1971, it wasn't until 1997 that there was a successful landing. Given the success of the Spirit and Opportunity rovers, this comment struck me as much more apropos for 2009 than 1985. Good job Mr. Sagan!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I read this book several years ago. I still think it is the best sci-fi novel I have come across. Contact is the only novel Carl Sagan ever wrote. One of the most amusing and powerful plot points in this book was never included in the film version: it involved iterations of pi.I think that one of the other reviewers here is missing the point when he carps about Carl's atheism. It's not about God. We earthlings are way too hidebound by our petty, superstitious and in many ways self-destructive concepts and belief systems of God. This novel is about intelligence and the triumph of human intelligence as a key to communing with intelligence in the universe.Drake's equation indicates that there is a high probability of other intelligent life in the universe. The human species has only been around for a relatively brief time in the chronology of the universe. Scarcely a blip, actually. The presumption that we - who have only used our brains for barely 200,000 years, where most of our discovery has taken place in the last 50,000 years, with a concentration of technological achievement in the last 6000 years, where most strides have taken place in the secular societies of the last 200 years - would be superior to other intelligent life is absurd. LOL! We'll be lucky if we don't annihilate ourselves before we ever make contact.I understand that Carl had some big-time rows with the film studio; I guess it wasn't produced to his satisfaction. It would be interesting to get the details on that. Though the film was a powerful drama, the book still blows it away.Those who like science in their science fiction will be satisfied and entertained by Contact."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I recently re-read this book and was again impressed with Dr. Sagan's attention to detail and work. I am an astrophyscist and his work and research inspire many of us who deal in theoretical issues that this book deals with."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Few books will make your mind soar like this one can. Sagan's genius shows in this book again like it has in every other book he has written. What a wonderful book! It combines science, religion, philosophy, and literature. Each chapter begins with a wonderful quotation by some famous scholar or thinker.The most enjoyable part of the book is the debate between believers and atheists/agnostics. Definitely a very thought provoking book."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"The novel Contact by Carl Sagan was an excellent read. Carl Sagan tells the story of Eleanor Arroway's search for extraterrestrial life. The trials and tribulations that she goes through in order to reach her goal are amazing. After many long years of research, she is rewarded with a transmission that appears to be coming from near the star Vega. Ellie immediately begins decoding the message. Ellie's life is forever changed by her discovery of the transmission.Ellie has a rough time in becoming an astronomer and her life doesn't get any easier. Through college, she is the only girl in her glasses and is often made fun of by the other students. Following her graduation, she begins as an observer and works her way up to being the Head Supervisor of the Project Argus observatory in New Mexico. Fellow astronomers believe that the SETI project that Argus is focused is on is an extreme waste of time and money. Ellie must defend her position constantly. After Argus radio telescopes pick-up the transmission, Ellie is forced to deal with the constant nagging of government officials and religious leaders. Ellie never gives up on her search and continues it no matter what problems come up. The discovery of the Message spreads throughout the world and the decisions are no longer Ellie's to make. A great adventure begins that will leave the reader with a great desire to know what will happen next.This science-fiction novel is an excellent choice if one is interested in adventure and the struggles of a woman to have equal respect in the world. Although the novel is slightly jumpy at times, the adventure that the people must face is not too hard to understand. The novel also digs deep into the feelings and thoughts of Dr. Arroway. It allows the reader to understand Ellie's decisions while enjoying the novel. I strongly suggest that everyone read this novel and enjoy the adventure."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I would never have guessed that Sagan, a hardheaded, agnostic, scientific type would have in him a book with such a fine sense of character development and emotional pitch. Having read many of his nonfiction books, I was not surprised by the social and religious commentary, which I found to be both perceptive and very even-handed.The science was interesting -- particularly the mode of travel described -- and I found the use of messages buried in irrational numbers to be an imaginative concept that I've never seen before. As a sci-fi story, I would compare this favorably with some of Arthur C. Clarke's best work, including &quot;2001&quot; and &quot;Rendezvous With Rama,&quot; in terms of the scope and majesty of the universe he creates.My only problem with the story, in fact, is that it is a little bit too derivative of Clarke; the space/dimensional traveling sequence seems to be imitative of &quot;2001,&quot; and there are other similarities to Clarke novels, such as &quot;Childhood's End,&quot; that were a little distracting (that's why, on a scale of 1-10, Contact would get a 9, rather than the full 10 rating). Nonetheless, I found this a very moving story that has more genuine feeling in it than almost any S-F story I've read.This is a novel that is visionary and almost religious in its awe of the universe -- the movie was also enjoyable, but as is almost always the case, it can't capture the numinous feeling that the book has, despite a great performance from Jodie Foster.Don't let some of the religious nuts' reactions scare you away from this book -- it has more genuine spirituality in it than a whole room full of Baptists and 700 Club members."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"We meet Ellie Arroway as a child whose father dies. She marvels at the wonder of radio, notably the &quot;clear mathematical precision of radio waves.&quot; She becomes a radio astronomer, and in time joins, and even leads the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. The drama begins to heat up with the detection of a radio signal coming from the Vegan System. Questions abound. How can we capture this message 24/7? We need international cooperation.After deciphering many layers (good old mathematical precision), the message is clear; it is an instruction manual for building a device. Theories aboundoDoomsday Machine, Trojan Horse, Space Ship. Despite the outcry of the pessimists, two projects are funded and the unit is built in both the Americas and Asia. Both of them get destroyed.In the end, a Japanese parts supplier has been secretly building a third device on Hokkaido. Ellie is chosen for the crew.The international project to build the device becomes known as the &gt;Machindo Project&lt; and Machindo comes to be a byword for international cooperation. Besides various bureaucratic wheelings and dealings, religious zealots also take aim at the Machindo Project: They say &quot;If it is a message from the heavens then it's a message from God?&quot; This being so, many zealots reason, and many different responses arise.How Ellie rails against the imprecision of religion! For instance she determines there can be no God because so many people see God differently (Note-does that mean there is no George W Bush because many people see him differently?). She also considers that if there were a God, then man would know ALL even in the dawn-times of humanity.For those who've only seen the movie, the journey to meet the senders of the message is a bonus. Five passengers take the trip in the book vs. the one in the movie. And while each spacer believes they are gone for a week, in actual time only 20 minutes passes. The real fun begins when the machindo crew return to Earth. Each are individually cautioned by their countries to deny they ever took the trip! Their reports are dismissed in the crudest fashion. Once again, bureaucratic gamesmanship carries the day. Surreptitiously, Ellie continues to work on the information gained in her space flight. She redirects her Cray computer to work on transcendental numbers and finds THE TRUTH. No, Douglas Adams fans, the truth is not #42! If you like Contact in print, you can also see it rendered in movie and even an audio version narrated by Jodie Foster, who played Ellie in the Warner Brothers movie."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Contact is a story about how could be the first contact of humans with other intelligent beings in the universe. Although this is a very old theme, it is an entirely different book. As an astronomer, the author tried to be very realistic what yielded a story where everything is tied and where you will not find any contradictions. You will not only enjoy a very good and beautiful tale, but also will have a &quot;contact&quot; with real scientific worries and concepts related to the search of intelligent life in other planets. The book also touch in the conflicts between religion and science mixed inside all the story in a very balanced way: you would expect that Carl would only support the rational side in the book, but when you read, you will be awed and surprised (and will respect Carl still more).For those who saw the movie (that is an excellent movie, my favourite), the book has less untied knots, everything is clarified and has an end that the film has not. The end chapter of the book make you end your reading with a smile in your face.One final note, when Carl was researching to write the book, he contacted Kip Thorne to ask him about the possibility of interestellar travels through black holes. Inspired by Carl's question, Thorne developed the real physics concepts of travel through wornholes and, later, timetravel through them.If you like science fiction and science, read this book. Certainly this will be one of your favourites, if not the favourite itself."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Truly Carl Sagan's masterwork of fiction, &lt;u&gt;Contact&lt;/u&gt; somehow introduces several infinitely complex themes-- the conflict between science and religion, the awe-inspiring magnitude and complexity of the universe, and a plethora of political, social, and religious commentary-- and a great depth of information and analysis of each, yet remains entirely readable. A reader fortunate enough to read this book untainted by the terrible film version will find it both deeply provocative and thoughtfully entertaining; one less lucky must forget all that occurs on the screen before he can properly enjoy the book. Overall, &lt;u&gt;Contact&lt;/u&gt; is an amazing piece of work and one which I will happily read many times over."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"CONTACT begins with the greatest idea of them all--that somehow, someway and somewhere, life exists beyond the small blue world called Earth. It is in these moments of the beginning of this novel that a grand adventure begins to be spelled out. In that adventure rests none other than Doctor Eleanor Arroway, a woman whose intelligence and drive magnifies her far beyond those of her peers.It is one day, after an extremely-difficult line of work and a declaration that her SETI project will be shut down, that an unknown message begins to come from the Vega star in distant space--a message bearing, what appears to be, schematics for something far greater than anyone could ever possibly imagine.As a reader of speculative fiction, and a fan of the science-fiction genre as a whole, I jumped into this book with excitement shortly after viewing the movie adaptation that features Jodi Foster and Matthew McConaughey. Thinking that it would be vastly different than the original movie, I ventured forward believing that the book would be something different--something that, regardless of its genre's tenants, would absolutely blow me away. To say that I was underwhelmed would be an understatement, and for that I sadly have to say that I did not enjoy this book as much as I could have.With science-fiction, there is always a bridging line between the actual science and the fiction itself that can either make or break a book for a particular sub-sect of readers, mainly those who enjoy the idea of far-off worlds and alien civilizations but are not, in the least, intelligent enough to know specifics details about astronomy, radio waves and other technological jargon. Being a reader following into that sub-sect, I have to say that much of the time, I found the book doing just what it was I feel many science-fiction novels do in order to make up for the fact that there seems not to be enough \`science' and too much \`fiction'--mainly, of course, making the science much too heavy a role in the story. While I don't necessarily feel that this book lacked the essentials needed to make this a realistic story, I do feel as though the book (and its now deceased author) went to strong lengths in order to make this as set in stone as possible. For that alone I found myself cringing over three-page-long descriptions of certain scientific actions, theories and equations, and while that may have been beneficial to the story, I feel as though CONTACT could have done without so much of the science and more of the fiction itself.To say that the book is bad would be wrong. The writing is, at times, beautiful; eloquently strung together and written in a way that marks Sagan as someone who also, along with his astounding intelligence, had the ability to write. While reading certain passages, I found myself blown away at how they were strung together, worded, and ultimately assembled to create the overall mood of the science in the story. To say this is a smart book would be like comparing an apple to a seed, and while the scientific endeavors that line this book is great, I have to say that I felt little emotion connection to the characters--particularly Arroway, who, as our main character, should have had a stronger focus within the overall story--that dealt a huge blow to the fictional connection between reader and main character.While I would not recommend the novelization of CONTACT to most everyone, given its scientific-slant, I can honestly say that the writing itself is beautiful and, if only for a few chapters alone, should be given a chance. While I may have felt a bit disappointed with the novel, that doesn't mean others will follow my path."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Ever since the film came out it has remained my favorite of all movies and I watch it more times per year than any other in my collection. There is something uplifting and I end up being deeply moved by Dr. Arroway's testimony to a Congressional investigative panel. Her depiction of how we humans are both so small and insignificant when seen against the backdrop of the Universe, coupled as it is with how precious each and every life is....this gives me great comfort and I return to that sensibility like a warm blanket. Curiosity finally motivated me to get the book and it was quite easy to find a very inexpensive paperback. The book is a very quick read. As I read it I had the movie playing in my mind, chapter by chapter and the comparisons jolted me early in the book. In fact, as is known, there are two versions: the book version and the movie version and they are in many places so different that one can almost say that they are two stories instead of one. It reminds me of the various Leonora Overtures that Beethoven wrote for his one opera. As I read the book I kept asking myself, why did he not stick with this or that detail in the movie version? I considered the book version translated as is to the screen as a viable story and frankly I am perplexed as to what motivated Sagan to re-write the book version so thoroughly? Perhaps the director or the producers of the film pressured Sagan to re-work the material? In any case, the two versions are remarkably different in so many ways and if you have not seen the movie, some of my remarks here will be spoilers. For example, Palmer Joss is depicted in the book as being covered all over his body with tatooes and does not have a romantic affair with Dr. Arroway. Drumlin and Elie have a much closer and respectful relationship, Kitz wields much higher and very dramatic levels of power in the book and the President of the USA is a woman. Most strange of all are the depictions of the machine which had seats for 5 people and that 3 machines were built. These differences are only some of the many that one notices when comparing the book to the movie versions.About the book, I have read several Sagan books and I found his writing up to the usually high standards of creativity, style, drama and erudition. As a story I quite enjoyed it and I could not flip the pages fast enough....However, the premise of his astronomical theism as well as all SETI theology I have decided is completely insane. I do not understand how such a smart man as Sagan and all other SETI-ites can be so foolish as to believe, deeply believe, that sentient life elsewhere in our galaxy or in another galaxy would rely on the speed of light to transmit a beacon of information, greeting, data, etc. The distances between stars is known and is the most obvious limiting factor for two sentient civilizations to communicate with each other in a meaningful way. Despite this fact, known and understood clearly as it was by Sagan and the SETI gang, they still clung to the notion that it would be worthwhile listening in on the universe with the random chance that they might tune into an intelligent, unnatural wavelength. It beggars my imagination how sentient beings, stretched across the galaxies and universe, would communicate with one another if the only recourse is the speed of light. It makes zero sense on any level. Never mind how preposterous it would be for an advanced civilization to transmit the designs of a machine that could bore through time/space, even though it might take hundreds or millions of years for that information to go one way out into the ether. The way Sagan explains the motives of the Vegan's is for me ludicrous and when he starts talking about beings who can seed galaxies, then he really has entered the science fiction hall of mirrors and well, he can write just about anything, regardless of the sense of it.Sagan was a big believer in black holes and talked about them all the time. To this day though, they are not completely proven and even if there is circumstantial evidence of super powerful events happening around a star, there is no 'slam dunk' or 100% evidence that what is being observed is ONLY a black hole. He, like his colleagues even today, hold fast to this and many other beliefs in what is called the standard model of astro-physics. I have come to admire other versions of what is going on in stars and galaxies as explained by the Plasma Physics people. That Sagan toyed with the idea that the transport somehow or another involved itself with types of black holes is a predictable but silly idea that he was bound to come up with. The Einstein-Rosen bridge is a very interesting concept but alas, it still sits only as an idea that sounds more like science fiction than a reality that happens at any time in the universe on its own. Black holes or no, tunnelling through space and time might not be a natural event. Could it be so arranged for it to occur by artificial means, as described by Sagan as the machine? Who knows....that part of his story I liked the most.In summary, I really liked the book as a drama and story. I found the premise of listening to a remote signal a foolish idea. In my mind, if an advanced civilization wanted to reach out and CONTACT us they would certainly not send us a radio signal. They would get into their own device, (I imagine) punch a hole in space/time and come over for a visit. That Sagan spent his whole career downplaying and making fun of and lambasting all reports of UFO sightings as false is the biggest blemish on his legacy. His short sighted and tenacious clinging to the ludicrous notion that ET's would first send us a radio signal from millions of years ago never struck him as a futile notion. It is a foolish idea that is not based in logic. Though I quite liked the book, the film will still remain the favored version."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Politics, theology, and sci-fi possibilities abound in this book, blended together in a brilliant manner. Sagan develops his characters better than Arthur C. Clarke does, though that's not to say that Clarke's work is any less intriguing. But this book addresses the \\"what if\\"s quite adeptly, illustrating the classic attempt for some people to blend religion and scientific discovery (personally, I hate the idea of \\"guided evolution\\" myself, so I could relate to the protagonist's feelings of pure scientific discovery for its own sake; here, the discussion of whether life is out there and if it's truly more advanced and benevolent as we would expect is unanswered). Most of all, there's no happy, wonderful, flowery ending. Nor is there a bad one, but one that -like all of Sagan's works- leaves the reader thinking.At the end of a book, I want to ask the hard questions rather than have a forced discussion about what parts one enjoyed. This novel enables one to do exactly the former of the two: it sets up arguments, allows for critique and belief in the possibility that we really may be \\"it\\" out there, in spite of however much searching we may hope to accomplish. That's not an easy prospect, considering Sagan's \\"Cosmos\\" discusses the odds of discovering life and in which stages of development/advancement we'd find it; here, he lets us imagine that we may be the end of the road, and that the non-thinkers who tend to run our societies could end up ultimately lead to our ruination rather than let those who think out-of-the-box take the world by the hand and lead us forth. Hard stuff indeed. Great book, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I truly enjoyed the book--and would have enjoyed it more, I'm sure if I had not seen the movie first. So with that caveat, let me proceed....Sagan has truly done a good job of showing how it COULD happen. It makes sense...though at places it can drag just a bit. The large passage of time (the main part of the story takes place over 12 years) is not readily apparent to the reader. Is it weeks, months, a year, or years that have gone by?However, I give great credit to Sagan (of whom I was under the impression was an atheist, certainly an agnostic) for ultimately \\"playing fair\\" with religion. In multiple passages he uses his characters to skewer or belittle fundamental Christianity, yet he also displays respect (again, through his characters) for some very intelligent people who are thoughtful and practicing Christians.Ultimately, we find that the whole alien interaction serves as an analogy to religion. That is, things that are certain on the personal level cannot be \\"proven\\" to others' satisfaction. Deep truths and heartfelt emotions are looked upon with great skepticism by others. Just as Ellie, the main character, has done with religion.It leaves us wondering if perhaps our current religions came about the same way. Or perhaps that there are truths that are not accessible to all...except by believing the report of those who have experienced such things.And the fact that the \\"real\\" builders of the universe are unknown, even to the highly advanced civilizations of other worlds...well, that smacks of \\"God\\" in some shape or form.All in all, a wonderful read (though sometimes it gets a bit bogged down in technical arcana--but that may be because I saw the movie). I recommend it to skeptics and believers alike."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Contact is one of the most realistically written books of its kind. A young scientist finds a signal from outer space that appears to be the first \\"contact\\" with an extraterrestrial species. I won't give any \\"spoilers\\" but the story becomes very political, and dramatic as we see the way the Earth's governments and general population react to this unprecedented discovery. Everything that happens after the mysterious signal is discovered is very likely what \\"would actually\\" happen in modern day society. Sagan's writing style is special because he finds ways to give you a history and science lesson as he tells the story. But he does go into tangents quite a bit, for example he will go off topic to discuss Russian politics for and extended period, but it's still relevent to the overall story. The Movie is very similar, but the book of course has the wisdom of Sagan's tangents woven into it."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This was a great story. I am a science and astronomy buff so this was right up my ally. Sagan did a wonderful job and I love how he put an agnostic scientist in the place of not being able to prove the experience she had with aliens. I read this book years ago and when the movie came out I couldn't wait to see it. Sagan was a wonderful human being and tread lightly when it came to the beliefs of others."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Sagan was a very intelligent man and it shows in what he wrote about. Rarely do i see a movie i really like with the book being as good or vice versa. The different ending to the book is maybe more interesting than the movie but is more of a cerebral subject. Discussing pi in a movie and implications of it would not work as well but in a book, very interesting.I wonder how much this book has contributed to the explosion of books analyzing pi and its history?"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"\\"Contact\\" is, in my opinion, one of the best science fiction books written to date. Carl Sagan addresses one of the fundamental questions facing the world today...does life exist elsewhere in the Universe?Beyond the scope and inherent engaging elements of this question, \\"Contact\\" is so good for a number of other reasons as well: it is credible, the characters are interesting and engaging and the tone of the novel is one of suspense coupled with science education coupled with an undercurrent of what this all means for humankind.\\"Contact\\" is a great book for all readers, but especially good for readers with an interest in science and technology."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Although this science-fiction novel is different than the movie, it was an interesting and fascinating read. Contact, by Carl Sagan, is the story of a woman in search of extraterrestrial life. The main character, Ellie, encounters a transmission sent from the stars above and begins to decode the message. In the process of decrypting the message, Ellie is challenged by government officials, religious leaders, and personal feelings. While Ellie is allowed to finish deciphering the message, what it contains becomes a world issue causing world governments to take control of the project, and remove her from her position of supervisor. Although she is irate about the situation she has been put in, Ellie finds what she is looking for in the end.This intriguing novel is a great story whether one is interested in astronomy or not. It is filled with the search of extraterrestrial life, but more so with the life of a woman who is obsessed with the search of other existence in the universe. If given the opportunity to read this novel, one should not pass the chance, but take advantage of it."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Let me start with a few key points about the book, the movie, and the original screen treatment which precedes both.&quot;Contact&quot; (the film) is NOT an adaptation. Carl Sagan died in the midst of production, but up until that point, he was on the set working with actors, directors, and prior to that with writer James V. Hart every single day. Sagan and Druyan initially planned Contact as a film, but the idea was EXPANDED in the book. The book spans many, many years and has multiple perspectives. Although it would be possible to do the same with the medium of film (and in a select few instances, Zemeckis chooses this approach), it's a much riskier approach and, if you know your Contact history, not what Sagan and Druyan originally intended.The main theme (as evidenced by its placement in the book's resolution) in the book is Ellie's isolation. As for science and religion, it's less about conflict and more about faith: Sagan notes (as others have, though less eloquently) that faith is no less necessary for science than for religion.As for Ellie...brilliant! What's unique about Sagan's characterization of a woman in science is the exploration of her faults: her stubbornness, her self-absorption, her inability to truly connect, her own xenophobia...the list goes on. So few authors can present a character in a balanced manner without suggesting that she will somehow be punished for her humanity. In the end, the only judgment that comes to Ellie is her own--despite her self-absorption, Ellie has little sense of her SELF. All her confidence--all her strength--has roots that Ellie herself has been unwilling to recognize. The film does not, in my estimation, present Ellie as a &quot;sanctimonious whiner,&quot; but there are certain limitations of the medium, especially considering that the book is written with Ellie's THOUGHTS in mind while maintaining the distance of a 3rd person narrative. How do you bring what is on the inside out?To the reader who said he or she &quot;bought the book the next day and will never bother with another film adaptation of Sagan ever again (and will be hard pressed to justify seeing anything made by those who defiled Sagan in this movie),&quot; I remind you that Sagan was among those filmmakers. See the film. Read the book. Make up your own mind as to how you will treat them. That, after all, is the point."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I read this book after I saw the movie. OK, so it wasn't as good as the movie, but it was still pretty good. I liked it better when Ellie Arroway was alone instead of with a group. And Palmer Joss's character was more developed in the movie. But it has a space on my shelf, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in astronomy or physics."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"CONTACT is an incredible book. It isn't just your average sci-fi movie with little green men. It's a more realistic story line. Carl Sagan was a genius. He didn't just plain out attack religion, but was subtle and more reasonable. One thing that I especially enjoyed about the book was the way he divulges into true human nature, not the first time he has done so. the most interesting part is the part about pi, and how the discovery of something like that really could change the world. I just plain loved it."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Words are impoverished to adequately explain how I felt upon completion of this book by the late Carl Sagan. I was just stunned. While opinions will evidently vary when it comes to interpretting the meaning behind the work, for me it was obvious: the vaildation of experiential spirituality. Dr. Arroway, a hardcore and relentlessly critical scientific woman, has no room for unprovable experientialism, as seen when the tone was set between herself and theologian/philosopher Palmer Joss. Then upon returning from this epic journey to... somewhere... she finds herself on the very side she has scrutinized and criticized her entire life. She finds herself having experienced something that she cannot prove, and understands the frustration. But the book was about so many other things as well. It was also about necessary cooperation of religion and science for all mankind, and how we cannot have one while not the other. Both are equally important. Science serves to satisfy our questions of &quot;what&quot; while religion satisfies our questions of &quot;why,&quot; and the one can never hope to take the place of the other. Science can never answer &quot;why&quot; just as religion is inadequate for answering &quot;what.&quot; Although it is not in the novel, the line from Palmer Joss's book (as seen from the movie), &quot;Losing Faith,&quot; sums up what I am trying to say like I never could: &quot;The one thing that mankind truly desires---'meaning'---is the one thing that science can never offer.&quot;An exceptional work of science fiction, and Carl Sagan's greatest masterpiece."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"the bottom line is whether a book is an enjoyable read. Some think this book is 'hard' sci-fi but if you look closely it has as much fiction as any other book in the field. I enjoyed it and others that were the same and different: DUNE by Frank Herbert, 2001, HYPERION by Dan Simmons, AREA 51 by Doherty. Read them all for a spectrum of science fiction books."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"It's a rather romantic representation of science at it's current stage, but I think that's one of the things about Sagan's work that tends to draw in so many people. He's not afraid to dream, whilst still remaining rooted in science fact. It's an excellent delving into human nature on so many levels, as are his other works. The one scene in the book where Ellie is clutching the ground, and can &quot;feel&quot; the earth churning and spinning beneath her ... I can really identify with those sorts of things. It was amazingly touching, but perhaps not for a steadfast science-only type of person.All in all, I loved the book. I *thought* the movie was excellent, but it simply does not compare once you read the novel. This book is well worth the six or seven dollars it costs. It's a colourful book filled with fascinating descriptions and characters."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I first read this book a few weeks ago and I didn't really enjoy it... After reading all the reviews, I read the book once more and I didn't really get the point. I don't think this book is really scientific: too much about alien science was unexplained. This book also had some boring parts and some ridiculous characters... The worst thing about this book is the concept of the extraterrestrial intelligence... Have you ever read 2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke? The 'Machine' is just like the monolith which tranfers Dave Bowman to... And the idea of 'Grand Central Station' , and cultivating civilization is also mentioned in 2001. 2001 was written in 60s and this book was written much later... Now it is clear that who copied who... Finally, the alien being is so human like... It is ridiculous for an alien to talk about Beethoven (I might have mispelled it... They know too much about human being, and this fact makes them more unconvincing than powerful. ) The reason I gave this book 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 is because the last part of the story... It is quite touching..."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"In Contact, Carl Sagan deftly encompasses many facets of humanity. The reader picks up a mass of astrophysics effortlessly with Sagan's easy prose. The somewhat abstract concept of pi is explained and its significance as the universal constant is reveled at as the probable key to otherworldy contact. Other more earthly concepts are explored: secularity, adultery, love. When this book is finished, the reader has hopefully experienced a minor epiphany, as the wholly remote idea of the universe and its properties are boiled down into an engaging story. This book is a different body from the movie, but both stand alone as excellent works of science fiction."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I first read this book between the time when the movie was in theaters and when it came out on video. I never saw it in theaters, so I thought I'd read the book until it came out on video. Contact has to be the most intriguing story I have ever read. Those who criticize the ending are simply after too much action. The ending is probably one of the most thought out of any book I have read, and it leaves many questions for us to answer ourselves. Then I saw the movie. The movie is probably one of the worst pieces of garbage to come out this century. They brutalized the story line in so many ways. For instance, they cut the space travellers from 5 down to 1. This destroys a large portion of the interaction. They also left out the government conspiracy and the most interesting portion of the entire book, the secrets of pi. All in all, it is a great book, but a horrible movie."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"After seeing the movie Contact, which immediately became my favorite film ever, I was anxious to read the book, and it did not disappoint! Obviously the book &amp; the movie had to be different, but their differences were well-done, and each told a slightly different, though equally beautiful, story. Ellie Arroway was a well-written protagonist, finally a real woman, and written by a man! Impressive! As a spiritual person *and* a scientist, I knew there had to be a way to bring religion &amp; science togethe, and this book does it wonderfully. I loved that scientific Ellie was also an &quot;incurable romantic.&quot; Sagan does a good job in bringing Ellie's childhood thoughts back when she is an adult, and skillfully weaves poetry in with scientific prose."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Cheers for Sagan! Not only does this book emphasize the wonders of space exploration and the expansive universe, but he incorporates important and profound ideas pertaining to religion, love, faith, and skepticism, both religious and scientific. The blend he uses makes many enigmatic problems blossom. He analyzes religion for what it is: faith, and shows that not all things can be explained, as Ellie has found out. Ellie is a classic example of the scientific skeptic who yearns to understand and process everything. It is at the point that when her story is deemed incredulous that she realizes that faith in herself and the acceptence of a God who created the universe, is something only her eyes and those with her saw. This is what she has and it is this link that makes her believe with a passion similar to Palmer Joss. This book is perfect for people who are searching, not for answers, but for examples of faith and understanding and the consilience of them."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"As usual, Carl Sagan has proved that he is the master of science fiction. The book raises interesting questions about how we would react if we were to meet alien life. The theological and scientific debates are certainly thought provoking and I found myself thinking about a lot of these issues while reading the book. The heroine of the book, Elie Arroway witnesses a signal from outer space, which raises many controversies about this message undermining the importance of god and about aliens destroying our world. A must read for everyone interested in debating on theological and scientific topics relating to alien life."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I saw the movie and immediately got the book. Overall, the book is better. But I thought that the character of Ellie was weaker in the book. I thought Jodie Foster was great in the movie, but in the book, the character isn't very interesting. But the book is great anyways. Really recommend it."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Absolutely the best fiction book I have ever read. Carl Sagan was a master of science, and extending that knowledge to science fiction made it one of the best books ever written."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"HE CHALLENGES EVERY THOUGHT AND ANGLE POSSIBLE. A TRUE GENIUS. THERE ARE NO REAL WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE IMPACT HIS WRITING HAD ON ME. I HOPE EVERY HUMAN BEING CAN READ SOMETHING FROM HIM."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I found this to be one of those books that inspires you in your own work!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This book will challenge your beliefs, whether they are science bound or religious, or both. The way Sagan combines the hard science approach of radio-astronomy with social and religious relations is brilliant. This book is a must read for any one who enjoys challenging their beliefs"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Carl Sagan's Contact is truly the most masterful work of literary art published in the twentieth century. The novel, originally published in 1985, and the posthumously released film that followed in 1997 are among the most fascinating and moving stories of all time. Human words can hardly describe the emotions, sensations, and fascinations triggered by reading this gripping book. Even the most skeptic and cynical reader will be forever touched by this enchanting novel. It mesmerizes a reader like no other novel can.Contact is the only novel written by the late astronomer Carl Sagan. He should have written more. He was the only man in all the years of his study of science to boost anyone's interest in this fascinating field to the extent that he did. I also strongly recommend his many other books, including Cosmos, Comet, Broca's Brain, and Pale Blue Dot, just to name a few.Contact flawlessly debates and explains many prepossessing topics at once, all while telling a spellbinding story of the seemingly endless quest for truth. It is about the search for meaning and fidelity in our troubled lives. It gives us an answer to our questions about the constant battles between scientific proof and faith. Sagan predicts the future of the universe through this spectacular narrative. I'm happy with his answer."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I think this book is in several ways very similar to the Name of the Rose, by Umberto Eco, in that there is a very simple plotline inside which conflict of ideas takes place. It is truly a book about ideas. Additionally, Eco and Sagan use in my opinion the same brand of irony in that many of the characters show examples of vast ineptitude at their jobs. Unfortunately, I read the book only after seeing the movie (and I hold the movie as one of the finest ever made,) but I felt that the book did not live up to its vast potential as the basis of that movie. Both Forrest Gump and Contact focused on a central character, but were driven by auxillary characters; I don't feel that Sagan had fleshed out his characters nearly as well as they were delivered in the movie, which is unusual for a book/movie comparison. If you have seen the movie, I would reccommend the book *only if* you seek more depth on the science component of the story."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"A radio signal might be the common way many civilizations make &quot;contact&quot; in the universe. Just as we make a simple phone call to family and friends around the planet, opposed to getting in a plane or car, traveling hundreds of miles, just to say hello. Interstellar travel, although well theroized, at best reaches only a small percentage of light speed necessary for travel to be commonplace and practical. It would take thousands of years to travel between planets and systems outside our own. The reality is that Radio waves, already traveling at light speed, would be the first &quot;wave&quot; of intelligence signals detected in the COSMOS. This book opens up the possibility that we may not have the technology to build masssive starships right now, but we have been, for over 60 years, traveling to the stars at lightspeed through the simple medium of radio! Think about it! I don't know about the trasport/ship build in the story, but there are theories of wormholes in space. Maybe, through extreme dynamic physics and advanced radio technology, we could gain access to interstellar teleportation and transport ourselves into the universe as invisioned by Dr. Sagan...expand your mind..read this great book!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"In telling a story about first contact with extra-terrestrials, Sagan has managed to explore ideas about religion, politics, and science, without sacrificing character development, plot, or suspense. He engages the reader, not only in the life of the protagonist, but also in the exciting interplay of intellectual arguments. Contact is a book that asks the reader to examine his or her own assumptions and beliefs, and in doing so, the reader gains a better understanding of the book, and the world."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This book was written well (it wasn't breathtaking prose, but it was sturdy and understated.)about mortality and life.The plot is not merely about making contact with extraterrestrial beings, but emphasizes the relationship of humans between each other and the infinte quest to understand the mammoth question every person asks himself: &quot;why?&quot;. Alongside the factoids (which he manages to explain in a clear manner), he has woven a story of characters that we sympathize with and relate to. He intertwines religion and science, facts and faith to come upon an understanding that it is somehow connected to all of us and everything we know. The only drawback is that towards the end, there is a lot of scientific jargon, which can become a little tedious. But overall, this is not simply science fiction, it is a book on the human condition."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"People have always considered religion and science to be separate entities. However, &quot;Contact&quot; provides a tangible explanation to this subject which is usually thought to be highly esoteric.Ellie Arroway is a scientist, but also a person who needs faith. Throughout her life, she seemed to believe that fulfillment and significance lies in the beyond, that she will not be able to find it on Earth. However, though Arroway is firmly atheist, her experiences open her up to a totally new school of thought. She was reaching for something that had always been with her; she traveled only to realize that she could find fulfillment where she began, and in other people.It seems ironic that Ellie was a woman of science, but yet her search, her mission, was for enlighenment. For some, enlighenment comes from a book of religion. For Ellie, it came from science. Perhaps this is Sagan's theme: we are all searching for enlightenment, but we use different vehicles to find it.The novel is filled with beautiful symbolism, as well as realistic social, political, and economic predictions of what a journey such as that decribed in &quot;Contact&quot; would have in this world. It is purely Sagan; his philosophy is evident throughout the novel. I was taken by it; &quot;Contact&quot; is not a good read - it is an experience.- Sheila Bapat :-)"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"'Contact' is one of those rare gems which educate,entertain, postulate, and theorize, taking you along for the ride. It belongs to a genre that I have begun calling &quot;Science Faction&quot; - science fiction stories that are too real and almost possible; stories that could be plucked from the newspaper headlines of tomorrow or next week; authors like Michael Chrichton.'Contact' is about discovering a radio message from space and its effect on humanity. The science is thick but generally explained. Science and religion are played against each other, not as enemies attempting to destroy each other, but as opposite sides of the same coin and possibly not as different as people might think. It is a story of journey and discovery, of answering one of our most sought-after questions - 'Are we alone?' - and what happens when we are faced with the possibility of an answer - do we believe enough in ourselves to accept the answer, to respond to it, and to not fear the unknown?"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"For those who have ever pondered the question of life on other planets, or, who are pondering it now,read this book.It addresses many of the religious,scientific and philosophical concerns that one would have on the subject.Excellent"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Carl Sagan, one of the most renowned Authors of non-fiction, and probably the most famous astronomer ever, captivates and interests the reader immediately in his book Contact, his first and only fiction onus.

It is honestly THE best book, I have ever read"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Carl Sagan's book really had me engrossed and captivated with his book like few books have. I compared his narrative and imagination to that of Tom Clancy's first book, &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;. As writers they both have what I call the &quot;Krazy Glue&quot; effect. Once you pick up the book and start reading, you can't put the book down. Like Red October, I am anxiously waiting for the film to come out"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I first read this book several years ago when it was first published. I've re-read it a couple of times since then. I've never been much of a Carl Sagan fan, but I am a fan of hard SF and I figured that an astronomer who was so dedicated to SETI would have an interesting take on first contact. I was right. The science is great, the character development is better than minimally acceptable, the writing is excellent, and the story is a hoot! I have a hard time believing that anyone who likes hard SF won't love this book. I think it's destined to become a classic"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"It is not simply about science: it's about personal achievement, polotics, religion and human relations, about a dream you have for your life and pursue until you get it.This was the first sci-fi book most of my friends read and they simply loved it. You can't stop reading.."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"First published during the mid-1980s era of nuclear jitters, Sagan's novel borrows its premise from the 1952 film &quot;Red Planet Mars,&quot; in which astronomers get in touch with our planetary neighbor by broadcasting the number &quot;pi&quot; (and receive, in response, a broadcast of the Sermon on the Mount). While much of Sagan's book now seems quite dated technologically, and bound up in the context of the late Cold War, it's still an entertaining read, and one that might lend encouragement to aspiring future scientists"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This book is among the best I have ever read! The story line starts immediately from birth of the lead character, Ellie Arroway, and ends with her realization of her true life. Throughout the novel, Sagan subtly satirizes government, humans, science, and, of course, religion.The way Sagan leads from one subject to another is amazing. He has a way with words that is unique in itself.Contact with Aliens that Earth receives &quot;the message&quot; from is questioned, and at the end, science is on the same questionable footing with religion. A richly developed book with not too exquisite details lets the reader flex his/her imagination to the fullest extent. The book is not about mere superficialities involved with aliens; it deals with personal struggles of an individual and the planet Earth"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I read this book years ago when it was first published.I remember thinking then that it was the best science fiction novelI'd read. Still do. Very intelligently written, but thenwhat else would you expect from Carl Sagan. It's good to knowthat his 'creative' (fictional) writing equalls his non-fictionalwork. He's talented in either venue. What a wonderful imagination...so detailed, makes one wonder if it really is 'fiction'."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This is a book about first contact with aliens, writtenby a prominent member of SETI, the Search forExtraTerrestrial Intelligence. Sagan makes excellent use ofSETI's current search methods as well as his ownknowledge of astronomy and physics to bring a sense ofreality to the book. But above its literacy, philosophy,and speculation, it is an entertaining story that is notovershadowed by gadgetry."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This book has good ideas and characters as well as a nuanced story, but for some reason I just didn't think it was all that good. I liked Ellie, the chief protagonist, who was psychologically complex and a striver for discovery - she had a funny relationship with her father and step father, which influenced her ability to get close to men, perhaps focusing her on the search for intelligent life. Of course, she makes a great discovery and then fights the bureaucracy to get a chance to travel to the new beings with the technology that they transmit. Then of course there is the journey and the disappointing reactions of mankind, etc. THis is a solid and believable plot.That is fine so far as it goes. Somehow, it just felt static to me, rather than pulsing with the life that a novel by Octavia Butler or even Frank Herbert does. Perhaps it is because I regard the best hard scifi as genuinely great novels that I found this so mediocre. The characters are more vehicles for ideas than living beings, perhaps, or they just weren't all that interesting outside of their amazing adventure.Tepidly recommended. Go elsewhere for great hard scifi."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This is a passionate book that seems to be the sum of everything that Sagan cared about. I've always loved it.Has anyone else figured out the origin of Ellie's name? It's an anglicization of \\"Arouet\\" which was Voltaire's original surname. There are several references in \\"Contact\\" to Voltaire's writings, especially his \\"conte philosophique\\" Microm&eacute;gas."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"We chose this novel because it is the original &quot;Contact&quot; (first published in 1985 by Simon and Schuster in hardback ISBN 0-671-43400-4) Reading this novel was a credible journey into galactic realms, by 5 humans and thus humanity itself. It becomes a journey of soul, science, religious belief and politics simultaneously. Mr Sagan's career in science lends him the perfect tools to describe the intricate work of the central figure, scientist Ellie Arroway and her fantastic discovery. His cultural knowledge is deep and enriches the other characters who journey with her. There is enough of the book given over to science, romance and fantasy to make this a perfect book for any generation, it leads it's reader into an opening of the mind beyond our own galaxy, beyond where many of us ever go in our lifetimes. It gives value to contemplative star gazing and faint traces of credibility to intelligent life beyond our small earth-bound domain. Wow what a trip to take by anyone needing some sense of order to ones fantasies...he makes it scientifically believable.I enjoyed the religious debate and felt it appropriately elevated beyond our own earth based beliefs to seem credible, pushing one towards something larger. A larger concept of God or the Creator as we know them. It moved one towards a concept of preserving the world for the future generations, a more unified world, a single humanity, a true global village!I enjoyed the book because of it's balance of all realms: theological debate, science, humanity and it's struggle for survival and search for love and truth. All vital statistics for a fantastic voyage. The film is less intricate but recommended. We also read Ben Bova's &quot;Mars&quot; and found it equally fascinating.This book is a mind and heart and eye opener, it will send your spirits souring to the heavens amid a cascade of science, of human emotion and human politics."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Being a fan of Carl, I was expecting something a little more. The general idea of the galactic highway was very cool, but the book was too long on the set up, and when they get to their destination, there is maybe a chapter of nothing exciting at all. I am very disappointed."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"To this day, Contact remains one of my favorite books. I love the fact that Jodie Foster narrates it in this version too. Of course, it's probably better to buy this on CD, or download it these days, but I'd recommend this audio book to anyone who enjoys some light science fiction."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"What a wonderful book! After having read it I find myself wanting to send a copy to every loved one I've been separated from in my life.

Just get it and read it and let it change you. :) Peace"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I have always enjoyed the movie Contact with Jodie Foster; I has a copy. When I was in the my church library recently, I discovered a book titles CONTACT with Carl Sagan as the author. Who would have thought? The book ties in well the movie, i.e., some differences but entirely believable."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"J. DoughertyApril 14, 2009Amazon.com Book ReviewContact, by Carl Sagan, is about Ellie Arroway, a scientist with an interest in extraterrestrials. While working at Argus, the first astronomical station just for the search for extraterrestrials, Ellie discovers a code of prime numbers in a radio frequency from the planet Vega. This brings the world together to complete an objective of deciphering the code. Ellie finds the primer deeper in the message and it contains the blueprints to build a machine. Without the world unity, however, the message would have probably been lost.The U.S. is well on its way to building the machine when a bomb destroys it. Mr. Hadden, a wealthy eccentric, finances and builds the machine in Japan. Ellie and four other people go to Vega on the machine through black holes which are used as portals to a huge landing platform. Once they arrive in Vega, the aliens read their minds to get questions answered on the human species. Then the aliens say they will leave Earth alone.When the space travelers get back, people think the trip to Vega was a hoax because the journey only took twenty-five minutes. The U.S. government tells Ellie if she ever gets proof about the aliens, she can come out with what she saw. In the meantime, the government is going to say the machine failed.I think Contact accurately portrayed human nature as people have always been initially uneasy with new ideas and ways of life. I thought the book was insightful in how an extraterrestrial encounter could really happen. However, I thought there should have been some action in Contact because there was virtually none. In addition, the transitions between the main points to the story, such as finding the message and building the machine, took too long and were a bit boring. All in all I thought it was a good book and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a book that makes you think."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I think this is one of the best books I've read in my short avid-scifi-reader life. Carl Sagan took the same &quot;easy science&quot; from other works such as Cosmos and put together a great novel to everybody's reach... No hard-to-understand science greatly written, great plot, great characters. The movie? It's SO bad compared to the book. The book is just superb eventhough I loved Jodie Foster on the movie. It will keep you hooked up to the very last page... and this is not a clich'e."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This a was a spellbinding book! The chapter that portrayed Arroway's meeting with the TV Evangilists was a tremendous piece of literature. It was up there with Bertold Brecht's Life of Gallileo. The movie was a dissapointing because of the ommission of this scene."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"A believable account of what first contact with extraterrestrial beings may be like. Sagan tells an interesting story of an astronomer and how a message from space effects her life and Earth's. He has arch-typical doomsday sayers in the book, but I guess in actuality, there would be some. He has an interesting take on theology and science. Being a scientist, and a agnostic, Sagan's ideas make me want to look for God in my own work. Of course, the book is better than the movie because you can get into the heads of the characters. As usual, there are significant changes in the movie. Finally, the ended in the book, is extremely thought provoking."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Contact is simply the best book I've ever read. The book's a bit different from the movie, the plot of the movie may be better, but the message Carl Sagan brings to us through the book is definitely more compelling. We realise how tiny we really are compared to the whole universe, and that all of us are actually equal. Though the book lacks a little of the excitement that the movie has, the book certainly is more stunning. Some people say that this is the BOOK, not the MOVIE. But tell you what, I've seen the movie for at least 5 times now (I still love it!), and I can assure you that the book's even better. Just a reminder though, if you're not really into scientific stuff, this isn't for you."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Contact is a marvelous sci-fi novel about Dr. Arroway and her search for the truth. This quite relating to the X-Files with Mulder's search for aliens. The story talks about some thing I am able to associate with because I always liked the idea of extraterrestrial intelligence. The search for aliens by using radio telescopes is so much fun. The story takes place that spans about 15 years. The plot is filled with adjectives that are terrific. If you watch the movie you can almost hear them talking when you read Contact. This is a must read book."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"The best novel I've read, so far. Eleanor Arroway is smart and devoted to her interests, which include mathematics and astronomy.The book fills in a (for lack of a better phrase) whole bunch of plotholes the movie has to where it has an entirely different background (one downside to the movie).The first part--like in all books--is rather boring, and you're stuck waiting for the plot to get a move-on, but when it does, you find it hard to take your eyes off the book.In the end of the book there is five people in the machine, so the end is more complicated than the end of the movie, and is more interesting.Carl Sagan is poetic and shows great devotion and love toward family values, theology, ethnics, mathematics and astronomy. I wish to read more of him and will.5 stars...no less!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Both the book and the film are about encounter with aliens, not of the &quot;Abyss&quot; or &quot;ID4&quot; sort (i.e. little grey men), but rather like those in 2001 and Stanislav Lem's / Tarkovsky's &quot;Solaris&quot;: larger than life, totally unhuman entities.Nevertheless, the film is not a good point to start, the plot being too simplistic and the ideas more on the &quot;America a is great place&quot; side...The book is - perhaps - the best scifi book around. It is true that sometimes Sagan bothered more to expose his ideas and beliefs than get the plot moving - but this is not necessarily bad. The way the book's Arroway interacts with the rest of the characters (and, indeed, the mildly utopic society of Sagan's 1999) is intricate but interesting.Finally, some passages are worth reading again and again either because they are fit for a crash course in the philosophy of science or for the sheer pleasure of it!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I first saw the movie , when I hear about it and that it was based in the novel of Sagan I really wanted to see it , but it was a H.School project the one that made me go to the movies and see it. I swear I saw it like four times !. But the movie's different from the book , the books more deep and interesting , although I must admit that there are things that hapen so sudenly that you don't understand theme at first. Dr. Sagan would be happy of reading all this reviews about his book , but unfortunately he can't. A greate read for any one interesting in on of the biggest questions of men."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"A top rating (10) is something that should be reserved and only used for something special and excellent in every respect. Contact deserves a 100. I recommend the book and the movie both. It is hard to imagine anything better!!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I saw the movie first, then read this book. You must see the movie first because the story in this book is so deep than the movie's. Actually, I have no religion, but this book made me think of my faith and also between science and religion. In my opinion, Carl doesn't deny any religion itself, but he tried to convey what we should be thought about ourselves, the earth and the universe as long as we are given our life. To me, this book was not just for read but gave me the chance to look into myself and my future. I really thank late Dr. Sagan for his great contributions for us."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Most of the self-help books are full of excerpts and extracts written or remarked by other medical doctors or specialists, with or w/o Ph.D titles, collected and edited by the so-called authors, I've found CONTACT an interesting mix-up of a non-fiction with all the dialogues spoken by many professors with Ph.D titles and edited by Sagan, a failed novelist, often interesting but also bored you to death sometimes. A book published in '85 and resurrected in '97 covering an on-site space-&amp;-time travel mission in the year of 2,000 (or on the eve of 1999) being actually so close to the present that making the reading still dealing with the Cold War; the heroine and mucho other secientists trying to dig out the to&amp;fro E-mail MESSAGES between Earth and Vega(?) buried so deep in layers; trying so hard by Sagan to depict the E-mail era of the 90s in the early 80s when telex was still the only real deal, making Sagan a prophet who knew a revolutionary com tech would occure shortly. All in all, Sagan was so good at wri"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I first read this book in the '80s, when I was pre-teen. I adored it. I still rank it in the top 5 &quot;first contact&quot; novels, along with 2001, Childhood's End, Gateway, and Rendezvous with Rama. Other reviewers here have covered what's so good about this book in the months before the movie opened in Japan, so let me tell you why I took off 2 points.First, Sagan rubs his belief in the moral equivalence between the United States and the Soviet Union into the book. Sagan is entitled to his beliefs; after all, that's what the Cold War was about. If the movie was more true to the book, however, I think this point would have put off thousands of people from going to the theater and thus prevented them from receiving Sagan's worthy messages.Second, the way scientists deal with facts is not as simple as the book and the movie put it. I am not a postmodernist, but everyone uses a theory to register what he or she sees as a fact. All theories have core assumptions that cannot be refuted by facts alone. The difference between science and everything else is in how those assumptions are formed, modified, and discarded (if ever). Maybe Sagan felt that he could not give this away, given the strength of fundamentalism and postmodernism in the United States.Apart from this, I recommend this book heartily."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"For me, this book was mostly like a fairytale. Not everything was realistic as far as I have knowledge to todays science, but it might be somewhere in the future, and that facinates me about Carl Sagan. His ability to make you feel that you are there when it all happens, and in the moment you read it, everything seems possible and nothing seems unrealistic. You just can\`t stop reading, and when you\`re finished, you wish you didn\`t read it that fast because you want to have those fantastic reading experiences over and over again. Carl Sagan was a great author, and I can assure you that you won\`t regret if you read this interesting and extraordinairy book. Run to the store and buy it, it\`s an investment for a lifetime!!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I found Sagan's fictional work interesting fromthe standpoint of it's scientific base.I enjoyed learning about MESA and the search foraudio contact from others in the universe. The characterswere believable, and the weaving of the social,political. and economic implications were thoughtprovoking.I can't say it was a page turner, but I managed to turn them all."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"If you had one Carl Sagan book to read, thiswould probably be it. It reads as if it werea &quot;Best of Sagan&quot; containing many of hisnon-fiction themes in a science fiction setting.Emphasis should be placed upon the &quot;science&quot;in the &quot;science fiction&quot;. While it may containtechnobabble, it's believable technobabblebecause so much of it is based upon Sagan'sreal-life work.All of his favorites are here: the dodecahedron,the SETI project, commentary on superpower mistrust,who speaks for the Earth, and the conflict betweenreligious and scientific belief systems.It does get a bit heavyhanded with the recurringthread about the persecution of astronomerswho are so much smarter than everyone else(another Sagan favorite).I enjoyed the fact that Ellie Arroway was figuringout the problems of the universe, but could notresolve her own family problems."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I really like it. If you have not read Sagan's science non-fiction books this is a good chance to learn and have fun at the same time. Through out the novel you get to know Sagan's skeptikal point of view and his strong positions about religion. To the science he added some good speculations about traveling faster than light. And to the meaning of God too! Good hard Science Fiction, if you like this genre. Also a good summary of the author's points of view expressed earlier and later in &quot;Broca's Brain&quot; and &quot;The Demon-Haunted World&quot;. So, if you haven't read Sagan or if you like his non-fiction books, this novel is for you."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I read &quot;Contact&quot; several years ago when it was first published. I remembered that it was a good book, but not much more. When the movie came out, I was really excited. I rushed out to see it. It was such a good movie that I decided to re-read my book. I was amazed. The book was so much better. Although the basic premise was the same, subtle changes were made to the movie version that in effect changed the story. During the re-read, I found myself comparing the movie to the book and thinking, &quot;they should have done that in the movie&quot;. It was great fun."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I have 16 years old and i feel like my life is the main caracter of the novel. What I hope to be when I grtow up is basically in this book.."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"this was a very good book to read,Sagan was a good writer,the movie however,was not what i expected it to be , it could have been more like the boo"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I loved how Sagan pieced together this novel with telling the reader about Ellies life and gave us all a common bond with her. The detail and the philosophical parts of the book made it intellectual and believable. I loved how he starts with things like her drives on the road with the rabbitts. Then goes on to talk about such things like singularities, but brings us back to the rabbitts.I expected a message from E.T. to come from this book, but I admit from God I didn't. This book isn't for the Roswell fan. It's for the person that likes to think about why we are here, what's right, religion, and ethics. Read this book"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Well, I am positive it has all been said before but I loved this book. Sci-Fi isn't really my thing, I usually prefer autobiographies and real life stories but the movie version of this book with Jodie Foster blew me away. I saw it years ago, and I just picked up this book 2 weeks ago. I just finished reading it earlier today... Jesus, where should I start? The character of Ellie Arroway was amazing... So many things about this book are just so great. Gilgamesh, chapter 22 is in my opinion the best chapter of the book... I won't give it away, but I will say that I would love to do what Hadden did lol BUY THIS BOOK!!! you will not be disappointed, I promise...I will say this though, it isn't perfect. It had some dull parts like when Carl decided it was a good idea to go pages describing in great detail the history of a minor character or two, but don't let that turn you off, it is a great book.... I didn't understand alot of the math though, but I loved it anyway... lol"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Any author can write a story about science in the not-so-distant future, but Carl Sagan is the genius who portrays today's science and scientist in a realistic light. These are people worried about obtaining grants, and dealing with aging parents, trying to advance up the glacial-paced science hierarchy. The portrayal of science reminded me of Kim Stanley Robinson's Antarctica while the interpersonal relationships reminded me more of real life.Reading the book could be either an interesting perspective or a bit of daily drudgery continued. Of course what keeps it moving is the story, which lays out like a mystery: find a clue and it only opens more questions. Sagan builds this right to the end and then cleverly continues it out. It is a fitting model of science -answers only leading to more questions, curiousity opening up whole new worlds- that is refreshing in contrast to some of the other aspects portrayed in the book.An excellent read."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I picked up this book and was fascinated just from reading the first few paragraphs. I disagree that Ellie was not a strong character, nor did I find any other characters to be lacking. I really liked Ellie as a character, and really disliked some others!I admire any book from a female viewpoint written by a man, because the generic character is usually male and I think males think from a female viewpoint much less than women think from a male viewpoint. In the early chapters he describes her frustrations about sexism very well and has some pretty specific observations about it that make me think he went to a lot of effort to understand women. And if someone as brilliant as him could see how silly and unfounded sexism is, it's about time some other people do too.This book goes all over the place. Lots of different types of characters, lots of beliefs, lots of debates and conversations. Carl Sagan is a great writer and there are certain descriptive paragraphs that I still remember and just think \\"wow\\". One main theme of this book is the ongoing science vs religion battle. I think he is kind of saying that science doesn't exclude spirituality- in a way it makes spirituality much larger than what we can imagine.My main criticism of this book was that the scientific and mathematical babble was difficult to comprehend. I basically had to just use my imagination for large sections of it. I wish I could understand more (although if there is anyone who has helped this clueless person understand science, it is Carl) but possibly some people (with degrees in science!) didn't have this problem and maybe liked these sections.Even though I didn't understand all of what he was talking about, I still wanted to read on! This book wasn't what I would call high-suspense in every chapter, but there were so many possibilities to what could occur and I really wanted to find out what would happen next. Some science fiction books just use characters as props, without getting too involved in their motivations and personal lives, but I think this book had a lot of emotional appeal, and this was a nice balance to all the techno talk. There are also some surprises, especially one in the ending. I think when he wrote this book, he put his heart right into it."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"No, that's not an afterlife recommendation. It is what the paperback I read in 1987 and the hardback that I just finished reading say on the spines when they are laying horizontally on the bookshelf. I still have a perfect picture of the gold on letters black, same size, same font, lying on a bookshelf in Foster City, CA. I just laid the newer one on a shelf that I can see from my desk chair.I enjoyed it as much this time, I think, as I did the first time. I was reminded pleasurably of how Carl dealt with the subject of religion, which was a very big part of the book. He depicted the preachers-for-money as the buffoons they still are. The subject of religion itself is treated with respect, as are many of the religious people involved. It is about as evenhanded a treatment as can be expected from an atheist.Even more, I remembered the clarity of his words and his vision, shining through the words of his characters and his description. Carl Sagan knew many things, factual things, that made him a very impressive figure. But his ability to put the facts together and discuss the combinations, to weave a story out of them, to educate the reader, was magnificent. There are too few people who are able to present complex facts and issues with the clarity he could.I miss him."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Like a lot of Sagan's work, Contact is really about the place of humanity, and life, in the greater reality of the universe. Are we a random accident of nature or is there a more fundamental meaning behind our existence?As a novel Contact is an entertaining, but sometimes cumbersome, read. The payoff is a brilliant little twist at the end, completely absent in the movie. It is original, delightful and a complete surprise, and by itself it raises a pretty good book onto my short list of personal favorites.Some readers won't get it, or won't get the significance of it, but those who are fascinated by the big questions and reasonably literate in scientific/mathematical thinking, will stumble upon a hidden little gem here."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Dr. Sagan was an intelligent and creative man. I would have been more satisfied if he had left out the twist between daughter and father in the story but the symbolic of the situation bode well with the whole fiction. Having a woman as the President was a marvelous idea especially as it may come true in near future. His futuristic interpretation of scientific developments happening at the start of the millennium was clever. Maybe I am being biased because of Dr. Sagan's real life's achievements as a scientist. My favorite character is none other than the inventor with an attitude. All in all, although the story line is simple and predictable, Contact is still a skillful art at science fiction by a man with many commendable qualities. The day he passed away was truly a sad day for the science community."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Jodie Foster does a very nice job reading Carl Sagan's wonderful book, and for those of us who have seen the film, it's easy to imagine her as Dr. Arroway as she leads us through the story. This audio book version, however, is only four cassettes long, and leaves out large chunks of the book, sadly. Still, it's an enjoyable and exciting journey as scientists receive the signal from outer space and rush to decode it. They find multiple layers to the signal, and over time, layers within layers. As the scientists learn that the signal is actually a series of instructions, they must fight many battles, overcoming paranoia and international politics to build The Machine. Finally, the quest for knowledge overcomes even military leaders, and Earth sends five scientists to find out what lies beyond our own small solar system. Their journey, and the answers they find, leads mostly to more questions, and they realize that this is only the first step of a very, very long journey, but that we are not alone in our quest, and that there are many things in the universe humankind never imagined.Fans of the movie will find some elements much different than that adaptation of Sagan's story, though both the film and the book have much to recommend them, and I feel that most people who enjoyed one version will likely enjoy the other - as long as they allow for the inevitable differences that occur between books and movies. I saw the movie first, and read the book second, but still enjoyed both very much."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Carl Sagan was a genius on this book. His truly visionary ideas mixed with the reality of politics and social fads(how people would reject the project at one moment and love it the next) was truly stunning. His idealism about us being silly to think of ourselves as the only living beings in the universe is visionary and seemingly accurate. The excitement of evolving sciences and the wonder this book fills you with are all well worth the time to read this book."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"In Contact, Dr Sagan is writing about a possible scenario in the event of mankind receiving signals from another civilization. The main plot with its subplots and very interesting characters is great. There are some subtle and clever analogies here too.I have read this book several times before the movie came out. I loved it from the first chapter and then it just got better and better. Also, reading it several years after the movie came out I feel that I understand more of this book for each time I read it. It's just excellent, this is how scifi should be written!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. I couldn't stop thinking about it after I read it, and I still think about it. I've always believed in life on other planets, it's stupid to think we're alone, in my opinion anyway. In this story Carl Sagan describes an intriguing and exciting scenario of how first contact with an alien species would be made. He uses scientific facts and scientific theories as the basis of all the events that happen. So it's more than a fantasy story, it's actually believable. The movie contact, while it was good, made me very angry. Sagan's story was about contact with aliens and just that, while the movie was about politics and conspiracy to gov't to hide information from the public. I wish they'd stuck to the real story, which was more scientific than political. Anyway, this book blew me away and I'd recommend it anyone."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I am not exactly scientifically inclined but I enjoyed this novel very much. This is an intensely involving story that draws you into the heart of wonderment and discovery.

Instead of a distant god, a very distant, fantasy civilization speaks to man from the great beyond. Ho-hum. Sagan proves he is just another flying saucer nut who hopes some alien people from way, way out there (&quot;billions and billions&quot; miles away?) will eventually come and save mankind. He substitutes one wild unscientific premise for another. Reads like the work of a man who would be defending the medieval church if he had lived during that time because it is clear that he has a strong mystical bend of mind; hardly the temperament that lends itself to clear thinking. Fun movie, but then, so was &quot;Star Wars.&quot;"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"\\"Contact\\" is the story of one Dr. Eleanor Arroway, a radio astronomer whose work is responsible for Earth's first contact with an extraterrestrial species. From the start, Dr. Arroway is presented as a curious, confident, rational, independent lady--the ideal scientist. His description of her childhood and adolescence especially is poignant and serves to establish the Dr. Arroway we see throughout the novel.Though Dr. Arroway is the quintessential inquisitor, she is still a human being, subject to human yearnings and human desires--and, primarily, human failings. This plays significantly throughout the book, as the political obstacles she must deal with are often complicated by her romantic and professional involvement with scientists in key influential positions, both in and out of government.Faced with opposition from the Department of Defense, which is worried about what the Soviets; religious evangelists, who are concerned that they might not like the theological implications of contact with an alien species; and envious colleagues, who are worried that they might be publicly embarrassed, Dr. Arroway is forced to make compromises and concessions to reacher her one goal--the construction of the \\"Machine\\" described in blueprints transmitted to Earth by the alien civilization.It must be said, though, that the primary purpose of this novel is to build support for government funding of scientific work, especially projects such as the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). At this, the novel fails miserably. Dr. Sagan's argument takes for granted that government has any place funding any sort of scientific work in the first place, a tenet that many (myself included) do not accept.Dr. Sagan wrote \\"Contact\\" to present a fantastic case for continued funding of SETI. What he produced was a fantastic story--in fact, the best science fiction novel ever written--but did not make his point."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"5 hours I'll never get back in my lifetime...

It is extemely well-written and interesting. It satires nationalism, sexism, religious fanaticism, and government in a funny way we can all relate to from personal experience. The plot itself is original, a big &quot;what if?&quot;. Few works of fiction are on such an epic scale, few are as intelligent, and few inspire such a sense of awe and wonder. It goes very deep into the issues of religious philosophy, faith versus skepticism, and the possiblity of extraterrestrial life. These are the many good qualities of Contact.There are some bad qualities, too. The basic theme of the book, that you can have faith in something even when there is only evidence to the contrary and when everyone else ridicules the idea, seems to be pretty stupid. A Christian fundamentalist-scientist-preacher who rejects evolution and the age of the universe, and rants about messages from God and Satan and the immorality of scientists is made into a hero. And the thing about Pi (as in 3.14....) at the very end is absolutely ridiculous.Conclusion: a well-written, interesting read that has a stupid theme and is sometimes ridiculous."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Althought I have found may of the works by Carl Sagan enlighting this book was not one of them.I found it boring to the extreme and could of been written in a better style.Carl spends too much time explaining the science of everything and not enough time on the story.

It very realisticly explains how contact may someday be made. It touches on politics, science, religion and sexism. I highly recomend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"While taking care to keep the fantastical adventure scientifically sound, Sagan seems to have given into his didactic nature. The book is a novel in the sense that it focuses on the central characters' thoughts, feelings, and experiences, but it is also an examination of human culture and philosophy. Fascinating . . . it will provide enlightenment for all future generations."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I have been a fan of the movie since it came out in 1997, but everyone who has read the book told me that it is far better than the film. And I agree. As good as the movie is - it is a joke compared to the book! There is far more detail here, which is understandable - if the filmmakers put all the detail that was in the book into the movie, the movie would end up being twelve hours long! For anyone who thinks they dont need to read the book because they've seen the movie: THINK AGAIN! The endings are a lot different. The end of the book has to do with Ellie's mother, stepfather and an idea the aliens gave her, none of which were even in the film."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I hesitate to give 5 stars as it seems to suggest perfection. My 5 stars are to indicate my overwhelming satisfaction with Sagan's book. It ties in the following areas neatly into one sci-fi genre book: physics theories and findings, social science, political science, human behavior, and religion. Now, anyone who can put these categories together in one book is pretty good, anyone who does it seamless is great, anyone who does it seamlessly and keeps you entertained and has a clear point is great - Carl Sagan was great.First of all, this is a sci-fi book. What differs this from thousands of others is that everything physics related in Contact is either a proven or a proposed theory. Sagan is a phycist by practice.Secondly, Sagan humanizes the plot line. You are confronted not just a bunch of science jargon or some romantic story but rather a combination of the two which allows both an everyday reader and an astronomy enthusiast enjoy the book equally.Thirdly, it incorporates our current world beatifully. It is rather mind boggling to think about the kind of research that Sagan had to do in order to write this book. He wrote about many different cultures and fairly protrayed each. Sagan also did a great job portraying power play within and among the governemntsFinally, Sagan remembered his audience and never forgot to be entertaining and ever so gripping.Just as a personal note, for a physicist Sagan writes elegantly and descriptively - a rare gem really.Have fun with the book."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I read CONTACT long before seeing the movie and that gives one a different perspective than seeing the movie first. It is that rarest of works, science fiction popular with both scientists and readers. One detects the brilliant mind behind the prose giving us a work that is intelligent, probing and scientifically literate. Missing are space fights, dangerous aliens, gutter language, random acts of insanity, ESP, invisibility - all so common in today's current crop. Instead, it is the story of a scientist drawn to the search for alien life despite opposition from both both scientific and lay communities.Many scientists conclude that SETI is a waste; biologists in particular consider intelligence such a rare development (requiring incredibly special circumstances and literally billions of years to develop) that they despair of ever finding another species with which we can communicate.On the other side, religions object that a search is against the &quot;will of God&quot; and fear that Earthly belief systems will be adversely affected if it is known that creation is not unique. The real message is philosophical: Humanity (to quote the movie heroine) is so small and so insignificant and so precious as seen against the background of the universal panorama. This conflict between science and religion is explored without being didactic.He explains that science, unlike religion, never demands belief without proof, that its findings are always subject to change and challenge, and that it is an instrument that expresses our humanity in ways religion never can. Ellie's greatest epiphany is evoked by communion with the Universe, not with God.The plot has been bandied about before but it is the masterful blending of character, story, theme and conflict that makes this particular saga so enthralling. The movie necessarily differs from the book and while I miss the voyage of the five (and the rather incontrovertible proof that provides) the ending is not only pleasing but satisfactory. Every character seems almost perfect from the point of view of the book.I have read this book more than once and discover new nuances h each time. Dennis Overbye shares Sagan's spirit of discovery and humanity and any books by him are worth companions to this."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Contact is an entangling story about Ellie, an astronomer, who stumbles upon what she had been searching for her entire life, a message from other intelligent beings. The author does a fabulous job predicting the political, scientific, and personal struggles faced with a discovery of this magnitude.Carl Sagan is one of those authors that appeal to a select target group of readers. Born a scientific mind, writing fiction with scientific undertones was purely nature. After graduating from the University of Chicago with his Ph. D Sagan went on to participate in councils and organizations that revolved mainly around astronomy.Although this in-depth story is a type of mental quicksand for all kinds of readers, the scientific undertones are usually only grasped by those who embrace mathematics and think like a physicist. The answers skeptics, like us, constantly search for have been laid out in front of us in a fictional book providing possibilities we can only dream of. Giving everyone the ability to expand our horizons and think like a theorist, people create their own answers rather than listen to others."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"There is more imagination and intriguing conflict in the book than in anything Hollywood could produce. Sagan was a gift to readers who value thought above hyperbole and substance over style (though the book lacks for nothing in the style department). The best aspect of the book was the author's ability to take broad and complex ideas and theories from the realms of science and religion and make them completely understandable to the layperson. It was extraordinarily easy to read yet at the same time so packed with great characters and dialogue and thought-provoking material that I felt compelled to pause to digest and appreciate and reread quite a bit.The movie was utterly mediocre. It glossed over virtually every conflict and resolution and made the Arroway character (one of the strongest and most dynamic female characters I've ever read) into a sniveling sympathy magnet. If not for a few amusing political subplots and some entertaining effects, the movie would qualify as the worst adaptation of a novel that I have ever seen. It was a waste of some serious acting talent and an insult to a modern fiction masterpiece.If you've already seen the movie, do whatever you have to do to forget it, then read the book."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Carl Sagan should have written more fiction, as this is one of the best written and most intelligent books in the genre. The characters are fascinating, the human element of the story truly inspiring, the conclusion radical and eye-opening and it's written on a level anyone can understand.Sagan's writing conceptualizes science without sacrificing an enjoyable story. Open minded readers will appreciate the symbolism and irony absent in the film version as skeptics becomes believers and the tables turn on the debate between science and religion.You won't be disappointed. The ending in &quot;Contact&quot; is the most surprising and satisfying that I've ever read. It really gets you thinking about the universe, it's origin and our place in it."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"What a beautiful book! Until recently, I had never read any of Sagan's work but this book was spectacular. There is so much heart and emotion and feeling here that I felt like immediately reading it over again once I'd finished. I'm also ashamed to say I hadn't seen the movie until after reading the book, but I guess that was the best way to go at it. The character of Ellie is completely real and made me miss the relationship I had with my own father as a child (and also question by believe in God). Anyway, a great read! Also, for anyone who really enjoyed this book, I recently read a book called The Space Between by Ronald Damien Malfi and I felt the book had a similar feel, if you're looking for a good next read. I also recently read Islands in the Stream by Ernest Hemingway, but I guess that's a bit different than these other two."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"One of the best (and most realistic) first CONTACT(no pun) yarns ever written,,with wonderfully fleshed out characters(unlike the sterile Asimov and the ridiculously cartoonish Niven) without the sometimes overly mystical quliities of Clarke and Bradbury. A moving and touching capstone to the work of a true giant in the SETI field CONTACT is a paen to &quot;hard&quot; SF that speculates on the possible in the here and almost-now rather than the sometimes ridiculous space opera with mythical laser gun battles and aliens that speak perfect English. Reminiscent of Asimovs(un-Asimovian) The Gods Themselves and the recently published &quot; A Quiet Invasion&quot;"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Despite being hailed as one of the greatest scientists (astrophysicist) who had dedicated his entire life to popularize science and humanitarian values Dr.Carl Sagan proved himself to be one of the most insightful story tellers as well in his one and only fiction work &quot;CONTACT&quot;! It was during my early teens I started reading Dr.Sagan;I started off with &quot;COSMOS&quot; followed by most of his available works. He has that uncanny knack of putting forth some of the most difficult concepts in the simplest language possible, such was his erudition and simplicity! Reading &quot;COSMOS&quot; after more than a decade was a totally different experience altogether because it is only then I happened to read the &quot;Dedication&quot; part. It read: &quot;In the immensity of time and the vastness of space it is my joy to dedicate a planet and an epoch with you&quot;. These words had a magical effect on me for, these simple words revealed the innermost recesses of a passionate man with a cosmic vision and Compassion unbound. Ever since that day I had always wondered what would it be like if he wrote fiction. He answered this question with &quot;CONTACT&quot;! Though it appears much like a science fiction novel, I consider it to be one of the most philosophical novels ever written exploring some of the vital facts of our existence with lot of autobiographical elements intertwined. While depicting the life of the Astrophysicist protagonist Dr.Elle who sacrificed a lot to pursue that which she thought to be of utmost scientific import and public concern, Dr.Sagan also speaks out with effortless ease the fierce inner conflicts at the emotional level of even the most undettered. Being the main scientist who initiated SETI, Dr.Sagan gives a clear account of the latest research in the field of Radio Astronomy and Planetary Studies around the world. Every chapter has a few header quotations, which helps the reader resonate with what follows. While looking for a message from outer space Dr.Sagan ferrets out that message from our inner space which all of us bypass in our mad race to survive..This echoes these words of T.S.Eliot:&quot; Where is the Life we have lost in living..?&quot;.Yes, all through her life Dr.Ellie was looking for a message from outer space, all through her life she was busy debunking the creation myths of others while remaining oblivious to the simplest message that &quot;FOR LITTLE BEINGS SUCH AS WE HUMANS ,THIS VASTNESS IS BERABLE ONLY THROUGH LOVE&quot; .It is here we find the perfect blend, a rare combination, of intellectual vibrancy and emotional sensitivity which brings forth the enlightening awareness of being Intellectually Sensitive!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This book is beautiful, stirring, and breathes life into science, religion and life in general. The overall effect is one of intense and complete humanity. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever pondered the meaning of anything."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"It's hard to know where to begin this review. I just finished re-reading this book and my thoughts aren't really settled yet. That happens every time I read it - the ending is so powerful and yet so simple, it inspires strong emotions.I guess the thing that gets me with \\"Contact\\" is that it works on so many levels. It's an adventure story (receiving a signal from space and the events that follow). It's a biographical account of an incredible woman (the main character). It's an interesting look at our recent past (the late 90s) from a 1985 perspective. It's an interesting comparison of religion vs science, written by a scientist who obviously was not ready to completely give up on religion.There are also a couple of messages that always hit me when I read this book.First, a common argument between science and religion is the age of the universe and the role of \\"God\\" in creating the universe. Various religions have their stories of how God created the Earth and the Heavens and human beings, etc. But what if \\"God\\" is actually responsible for creating billions of galaxies and planets and beings? What if the universe isn't a random collection of atoms and molecules...what if it really is all part of a plan so big that it really can't even be comprehended? Isn't that even more incredible than what's in the Bible or the Koran or the Tao Te Ching?And second, in a universe so vast, how can we - who are so small - make it through? How can we not be overcome by the galactic forces that are so powerful? By believing in the strongest galactic force of all - love.Probably not the messages you would expect in a science fiction book, but then, \\"Contact\\" is not your typical science fiction book. It's really a simple story of hope. And that's something we could all use more of."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Science fiction/fantasy written by someone who knows science is refreshing. Reminds me of Asimov. Or a more accessible Feynman. I mean that it the best way possible.The book touches on many subjects, including academic egos, technology, religion vs science, science vs government, government vs government. The book revolves around the means that some totally unthinkable culture might communicate a complex message. The latter was of course Sagan's passion and was the whole reason for the book.It also touches on issues such as Your Sneaky Government, sexuality, and sexual bias with a 70's academic slant (not in an in-your-face way however.)Basically, everything Sagan had to deal with is represented. He says the characters aren't real. I think he's lying :-DWhat happens in the book? Sometime in the mid-to-late 80s, a dedicated, brilliant, and somewhat boring radio-astromomer is Director of a radio astronomy facility. One of her dishes gets an interesting signal. Of course, things snowball. The novel finishes sometime in the beginning of the new millinium... That's all the spoilers you get!How did it read? Pretty good. The characters tend to be a very believable mix of pettiness, heroism, strength, brilliance, and quirkiness. Even the heroine has her share of issues.Recommended. While I rated it a 4, it was more of a 3 in a literary sense, but it is a _worthwhile_, thought-provoking book. It made me want more science and didn't give it. Sagan's such a tease."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"If you like science fiction that leans heavily on the fiction, then this novel is not for you. There are no Dragons of Pern or Swords of Shanarra. This is the real deal, and provides the most reasonably realistic way for the human race to receive communications, and ultimately, make physical contact with an extraterrestrial civilization. As for the review that put the pu pu on the last chapter...suggesting Sagan was throwing a bone to the religious...I say he was throwing a bone to the ultimate question any thinking being can ask...WHY IS THERE SOMETHING INSTEAD OF NOTHING?"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"The owner of my local sci-fi bookstore recently complained that science fiction has a bad name. If you write sci-fi in America, you're probably going to be stuck writing sci-fi for the rest of your life. It's why we see so few mainstream authors cross over into science fiction, and it's a shame. The problem, of course, is that too much sci-fi is written strictly to be fun reading. There's nothing wrong with this, but critics want more flesh in their reading. Some science fiction has that flesh, and it is upon such works that we science fiction fans must pin our hopes for any future acceptance of the genre as 'respectable' literature.Carl Sagan's Contact is without a doubt one of the best examples of this sort of work. The story is set in the near future, a 1999 envisioned from the mid-eighties. Its protagonist, Eleanor Arroway, is a brilliant young astronomer who has dedicated her career to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. When she finds it, the discovery changes her world in ways both radical and global, and personal and profound.The story's scope is grand. It discusses seriously the effect of the aliens' Message on the nations of the world, and also on the minds of mankind itself, which must now face the fact that it is not alone. Despite a few awkward digressions, Contact is masterfully written, engaging, and stocked with interesting and believable characters. The perhaps over-hashed subjects of &quot;man voyages to the stars&quot; and &quot;man meets slimy aliens&quot; are downplayed in favor of introspective considerations of &quot;man realizes the size of universe&quot; and &quot;man acknowledges the Other.&quot;Science fiction, like any genre, can and should produce fun reading. It is a joy, however, to find that it can also produce stimulating, thought-provoking reading. Fans and foes of sci-fi alike should read Contact and see the potential of the oft pooh-pooh-ed medium."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I saw the movie about a year ago, and I must say that this novel FAR surpassed my expectations. I expected it to be dry and a challenging read, and although there were some places that were dry and difficult to get through, the book as a whole was engaging and intriguing. Some of the science was over my head (physics? red shift?), but for the most part, Sagan breaks down the science into simple language that most people should be able to understand. Mostly, however, this book is an examination of the relationships between science, religion, and politics. Throughout the entire book, for example, Ellie runs into obstacles just being a female scientist. Then, when she stumbles upon the radio signal from Vega, she is chastised for not keeping it secret from other nations and asking other scientists, who are also unencumbered by political pettiness, for assistance. Thus, we have to wonder -- if we DID discover communication from another planet, would we ever manage to work together to answer the call, or would we still try to one-up other nations? Even more prominent -- and controversial -- is the discourse between faith and science. As someone who has long ago reconciled science and religion, this book is extraordinarily refreshing. Science and faith are not mutually exclusive, and everyone -- even people who fancy themselves \\"atheists\\" -- has faith in something. This book calls for theists not to cover their ears and shout \\"LA LA LA\\" in the face of scientific discovery, and for atheists not to shut themselves off from anything they may not be able to prove firsthand. Loved this book from start to finish, and will definitely read it again in the future."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"As a youngster, the vastness of the universe and the possibility of life beyond our planet fascinated me. That probably explains why, when as a teenager I first saw the movie adaptation of this book, I was moved greatly.A lonely young woman, who misses her father who passed when she was a child, devotes herself to the pursuit of making contact with life beyond our planet. That contact is made at the facility she manages, and the entire diplomatic and economic strength of the world is thrust behind the project to decode the Message and build the Machine. All of our conceited, egotistical superstitions, as well as our secular nationalist quarrels, are put aside as we are confronted with the reality that we are not alone.When our protagonist does makes contact, what does she learn? That there are others in the cosmos who have been here much longer than we have and are much more advanced, but do not have the answers to the fundamental questions that plague our shared existence. She learns that they have been looking for the same answers too, but in all their searching have found that what is really important is our connections with one another.Beautiful.While the film was able to be faithful to that central theme of the book, I think that the occasions of digression cheapen the message. Carl Sagan's written version is much, much more dynamic and ultimately intellectually and emotionally fulfilling.*Spoiler Warning*In the book there is no distracting romance between Dr. Arroway and Palmer Joss, the dialogue between the proponents of dogma and the proponents of science are much more interesting, there is no asinine suicide bomber sabotaging the Machine, the presence of the Five rather than simply Dr. Arroway adds to the concept of a shared human experience void of nationalistic identity, and in the end the \\"meaning of life\\" is something that Dr. Arroway ultimately learns rather than something she is simply told.*/Spoiler Warning*This is a fantastic book that I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of science fiction and has an overactive imagination regarding the cosmos and the possibility of life beyond our little planet. I had anticipated Sagan's literary style to be dry and unappealing and therefore delayed reading this novel, but I could not have been more pleasantly surprised. This book was for me a literal page turner."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"If you're expecting an alien shoot-em up, you will be disappointed. This is a novel that is extremely relevant to the times we live in. Though written in the 70's (with allusions to pre-internet and now seemingly archaic technology) it still has an impact on humanity as a whole with the dawn of a new millenium.The novel is about contact with life beyond our tiny little planet. However, rather than exploring the &quot;aliens&quot;, it explores us as human beings and as a unified global entity. Will we act as a whole unit working together harmoniously to achieve a common goal? or will our petty squabbles be our ruin? Will our prejudices and stereotypes prevail over our need to work together or can we survive and learn to put aside problems? Can we as a race survive the technological revolution occuring now as we speak? These are questions that Mr. Sagan explores through exploration of racism, religious fanaticism, sexism, and many -isms present in our our world.With a lot of detailed descriptions and hot debates that show both sides of every conflict, his novels presents what is quite relevant in our world today, namely how will we react if (or when) we find out we are really not alone, in a manner that makes one really think about our global society. Using his mastery over being able to explain to the every day Joe complex scientific ideas and making them interesting, Mr. Sagan opens the mind and spirit to the possibilities of what can quite literally happen in the near future. He ties together science, literature, religion, and philosophy into an exceptionally beautiful novel that delves into the very heart of human nature. More than highly recommended....10 stars and two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It really is first-rate science fiction, especially coming from a guy for whom writing science fiction wasn't his \\"day job\\", but I thought in some ways that it was an odd book for Carl Sagan to have written.Sagan never made any bones about his atheism, at least in a functional sense, but this is a very \\"religious\\" book. Consider the climax of the story (Spoiler Alert!) - five intrepid voyagers traverse the universe and meet the Caretakers, while to all outward appearances their capsule never left the ground and the mission failed. They can produce no tangible evidence of their journey except their own testimony regarding an experience shared only by the five of them. Moreover, their account of their journey, and of wise and powerful beings across the universe, is taken as evidence of psychological distress. Not terribly unlike a \\"conversion experience\\".Or, consider the Caretakers themselves - ultra-wise, deeply moral, all-knowing, and powerful enough to manipulate galaxies. They are not only super-intelligent, but also personal. You don't get to see them as they really are (you couldn't handle that), but only as they deem it best to show themselves. The impression slowly dawns that these alien beings are just . . . like . . . God.But we know that Carl Sagan had little use for ideas of God. Why, then, if God is a concept so unpalatable to Sagan's mind, does he find the idea of alien beings congenial - alien beings who are a pretty good first-order approximation of God? If he can't accept the idea of God, why CAN he contemplate aliens who have so many of the same attributes as God?Just curious.All that being said, this is very good science fiction - it speculates in some very interesting directions, and the \\"moral\\" at the end ('love is what makes our lives bearable') brings the book to a warm conclusion. I heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"After reading the book, seeing the movie and reading these reviews I can see there is an element of science vs religion. The book was great because Ellie wasn't as meak and intimidated as Jody Foster portrayed in the movie. Matt McCaunhey was just too quick in the movie with illogical retorts of how all the information she was receiving could have been God. I would guess Sagan needed to feel the need to appeal to the theist to educate them in their faulty logic. I did like the ending of the movie in that Jody Foster helped the next generation by telling the small group of children to keep looking for answers. The movie had an element of absolute farce, Ellie saw her Dad who was dead. The fact that time was an element did entertain me. We have created time and to see Elle travel through all those visions in a few seconds, leaves me wandering what if we could ultimately understand in outerspace. Though we hardly fathom time travel as factual, the intellectuals are working on making this a reality. I mean it's only been thirty years since we landed on the moon. Could you imagine telling your great-grandfather we will land on the moon? He would have said impossible. Luckily our tax dollars are being used to explore science projects despite all the opposition of people who think we are the center of the Universe. Sagan should be admired for his ability to make us think of what we can attain through space exploration. If I had to recommend one over the other, read the book."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"...Or to the heart of the human mind....?? This is indeed an excellent book which is worth reading a coupple of times to get all the details straight. There are so many neuances to it, and so many questions to think through. It differs from the movie, and that is probably why I didn't like it the first time I read it. I was also two years younger then, and I feel like I've gotten a much better perspective on things since then. I believe you have to be mature enough to read the entire book and not just skip the parts you find boring, to fully enjoy Contact.Carl Sagan has been critizised because he connected religion and science in the book. I think these people were very reigious, and couldn't handle that the two things may be compared to each other. Both come down to a search for something greater than ourselves, wether it is an omnipotent and omniscient god, the natural laws,or maybe something else out there..Even though Man considers himself the center of the Universe, we are indeed not more than an ant in the unimaginable vastness of space.....I would like to recommend this book to everybody, but particulary to those who feel lost, cut off, alone. Because you're not. The only thing that makes the emptiness bearable is each other....."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"First, since most readers who pick up the novel &quot;Contact&quot; will be comparing it with the movie &quot;Contact&quot;based upon this, Carl Sagan's stiff legged sci-fi romp, let us release the good news. Carl Sagan really DOES know how to treat a woman! Far from conveniently dead in the &quot;shades of Disney syndrome&quot; (see film version) our heroine Eleanor Arroways's mother is alive and communicative throughout most of &quot;Contact&quot;, providing her brilliant daughter with lots of pricks of conscience and many a petty annoyance. (Plus a next to the last page revelation that is both juicy and confusing.) Not only that, but Sagan 's U.S. President for the 'nineties is a political dynamo who happens to be female. The book therefore achieves a balance between the sexes missing up on the big screen. Sadly, Sagan is not gifted with the writing abillity to truly lead us into astronomer Arroway's world, so much of the book reads like a giant footnote--information we receive to help us catch up. I don't mean to quibble. I'm grateful Carl Sagan wrote &quot;Contact&quot;. It is, after all, 430 pages of a really fun idea - the whole world works together and five people get to see God tip his hand. Now, where do I go to post my movie review"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I get goosebumps every time when I think at the idea of this book!Carl Sagan (unlike it has been suggested here in other reviews) was trying to believe in God but he wanted some scientific proof of that, which of course would have made that science and not religion.Well, the end of the book comes up with an idea to reconcile the 2 seemingly opposite ideas!Only a person like Carl Sagan could have come up with something like that! Oh, and the movie! It does not even touch any of this area, so consider reading almost like a 'different' book."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Contact is not just an ordinary literary book, I've read Carl Sagan's books and Contact is the most touching of them all. I have seen the motion picture version of the novel, even though the two do not blend very well , the motion picture conveys the same message as the book does, science and religion's main objective is the search for truth, whether that truth was in a heavenly god, or the big bang and evolution, the two are not necessarily exclusive. I have cried after reading the book, Carl invites you to live in the life of the young scientist Ellen Arroway for which Jody Foster has perfected her role in Contact the movie. From a stubborn child to a pioneer scientist, every single plot is beautifully drafted. After reading the movie I felt that everything in the world is beautiful, but not everyone sees it. Read the novel, it is nostalgia to something this world misses."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"How would society and the individual react to the idea of another intelligent, advanced life form 'out there'? This is the question asked and answered by the late Dr. Sagan in his book 'Contact'.Through his protaganist's eyes Dr. Arroway, Sagan pushes the idea that science is the way to find answers for everything. Too bad though, that science is couched in jargon which fortunately Sagan explains well. Fortunately too, Arroway's character is interesting: intelligent, strong, with the prerequisite emotional baggage. Even though it shouldn't be brought up in a book review, the movie version with Jodie Foster as Arroway was a casting triumph. With Arroway's character supporting Sagan's thesis, the book just rises above the ordinary.Read the book to understand a man of science's philosophies and wishes, and note Sagan's debates between religion and science in the book, and you will find yourself subconsciously taking part in it. But this book cannot be a classic of contemporary fiction, because of the improper development of the drama within the plot."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Carl Sagan's only attempt at fiction has a fantastic premise, but the story is often overwhelmed, not just by the scientific terminology, but also by ham-handed characterization. The basics of the story are preserved for the movie, which eliminates much of Sagan's clutter (some will argue that the meat of the novel was lost, as well). Sagan struggles to find his narrative 'voice' here-perhaps understandable for a first time prose author, who almost certainly relied heavily on his co-author, both for the novel and screenplay.I saw the movie some years ago, and by comparison, I felt the story works much better onscreen, without the 'near future' setting(which had become contemporary by the time the movie was released), and less emphasis Bradburyesque 'advanced technolgy' that sounded outdated long ago. The de-emphasis of mathematics in the film made the story much easier to follow, if not as intellectually 'weighty'.The gist of the story is Ellie's voyage of discovery, and I feel this aspect works better in the movie, without the extraneous supporting characters seen here. Sagan tends to go off on tangents on both scientific and socio-political matters, which renders some sections very 'skippable', without really affecting the story. This is a bad sign for what should be a thought-provoking exploration of faith and the 'limits' of humanity and the universe. Instead, we're forced to endure needless verbiage as Sagan tells us the life story of each crew member in excruciatingly dull detail, simply so we'll understand who their loved ones were later on.Some of Sagan's attempts to have certain characters 'sound' like credible 'spokespeople' for the religious community are rather hollow, given Sagan's personal viewpoint on spiritual matters. He only partially succeeds in preventing his personal feelings from spoiling the story. Scholars of mathematics will no doubt find this more interesting than the average reader, or even the average science (or science fiction) buff. Too many segments read like digressions in scientific lectures, rather than plot or character development of a novel. Sagan gets carried away building and explaining the technology of the world beyond the story, and sometimes only grudgingly advances the plot.For those who disliked the movie-sorry, but I recommend that more highly than this book. I was a bit generous with the stars-but Jodie Foster and Robert Zemeckis' vision of 'Contact' has more to do with that than the original text does!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Although Sagan's novel wasn't bad, the movie was in fact better. Sagan tends to go off on a tangent for three chapters and goes into extraordinary amounts of detail about some things, and not nearly enough about others. The book seems to be even closer to how such an event would happen in real life than the movie, but to the point where it becomes tedious and boring at times. Character development in the movie was actually better. Read the book if you have the chance, definately go see the movie!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Most readers of science fiction are not interested in character development, or even plot. They are interested in Big Ideas. Contact has reasonably good character development and plot, especially coming from a scientist, not a professional sci-fi writer. But then, that's not what this book is about. If that's what you seek, read Hemingway, Steinbeck, or Proust.This book is about a Big Idea, and what a doozy it is--it will truly blow your mind. I first read Contact in high school in the '80s and spent several hours in a daze upon completing it. I recently re-read it, and had a similar reaction. The final pages contain the single most impressive Big Idea I've ever encountered in science fiction.After building a so-so story around &quot;meaning&quot; as it is perceived by the religious and the rational, Sagan proceeds to close the book with nothing short of a mathematical proof of the existence of God. The protagonist, after earlier demanding of religious leaders, &quot;Why would God make himself an article of faith? Why not reveal himself unequivocably in nature?&quot;, is finally given her proof. God wasn't hiding, it turns out. Mankind just wasn't smart enough yet to find Him deep within mathematics. With Intelligent Design proven, faith and reason are united, and mankind sets off on the next level of development.This is what good sci-fi is all about.Too bad it's fiction. A fitting final work for Sagan, a scientist who wished desperately to reconcile faith and reason.btw, the movie leaves the whole Big Idea out. Apparently the producers felt the mathematics would be over the audience's heads. Pity."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed hearing the late Carl Sagan's innermost aspirations lived out in the life of Ellie the radio astronomer. His descriptions of what might happen if a non random signal were received from elsewhere in the galaxy through a radio telescope inferring intelligent life as the source of the signal are creative and fascinating. The flight to a distant paradise-like world to meet god-like beings who are all knowing, all wise and good leads one to hope that such things exist. Carl Sagan's description of the multinational, years long, and no costs barred effort to decode and understand the message that turns out to be a blueprint for a complex machine is in fact occurring today! Truth is stranger than fiction. There is currently a collaborative effort over many years, by universities around the world costing millions of dollars to understand the message encoded within DNA which is the blueprint for the human body. The effort is justified because of the spin off benefits both medical and economic that will result.I sense that Contact reflects a aspiration to find God, to find purpose in life and fellowship in the universe. Just as the skeptics doubt the story the 5 travelers bring back of visiting the center of the galaxy and meeting other beings, so too many today find a purposeful message in the stars above or the cells within too incredible to believe. Just as the \\"machine\\" was built to transport people to its designers in space, so too our Designer desires to bring our souls to Himself through our earth bound bodies. \\"Yet in my flesh I shall see God\\"."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I read the book and loved it, and I almost didn't see the movie because Contact seemed to me like the sort of book which would translate badly onto the screen. I didn't trust hollywood not to ruin one of my favourite books.Well, it wasn't ruined. I was annoyed by some things - for example, the sexual relationship between Ellie and Palmer Joss. Why can't they understand you don't need romance in every movie? In the book the ambiguous relationship between them was one of the best parts.But this is a review of the book, not the movie. I found it extremely readable, with believable characters and politics. But the best of it was the UNDERSTANDABLE science. So much hard sci-fi provides details you feel obliged to try to understand. I'm 17 and I quit science last year. But Sagan makes it easy for the ignorant to appreciate the science in the book.I think Sagan combined science, politics and religion better than any other scifi I've ever read. He doesn't push his point of view, but leaves the argument open.A very good book with a strong plot, interesting characters, emotion, visionary concepts and intelligent religious comment. Now we can believe in God the creator AND the Big Bang."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This book is wonderful. I would recommend it to anyone who has seen the movie, but beware the book does turn out different. This book keeps the reader involved and always wondering what is on the next page."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Reading this book in 1998, I found that many of Sagan's fictional premises have now entered into the realm of science fact. The idea that a supermassive black hole exists at the center of the galaxy has been confirmed by the Hubble Telescope. It's a shame that Sagan did not live to witness the findings, but CONTACT is a testament to his vision. I found that book was too long-winded, and could have been trimmed to half its length. The movie used only one pilot--Ellie--in the dodecahedron capsule rather than a whole team, and this seems to work better dramatically. Of course, the real treat of this novel is Sagan's treasure chest of technical knowledge, which he showers on the lay reader without condescension."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Carl Sagan's idea here is much more important than his technical expertise or writing style. Contact gives us the means to reflect on our loss of faith in a scientific world. It is not preachy, nor does it to try to make us Christians. The point is to recognize the greatness of the universe and the things we do NOT understand about it. Science will destroy humanity if it is applied arrogantly and ruthlessly enough. I also liked the perspective gained by reading Contact. Seeing the earth from afar makes us realize how ridiculous our wars and political boundaries are. I think people should read this book if they can. It is quite inspirational."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I enjoyed this book. It posed many interesting conflicts between science and religion. However I feel he did have a farily one sided view of the religion aspect of the storyline. It also presents the issue of goverment funding. Eventhough he does not come outright and say it in the text, it does make it clear through the character dioaloug and action that goverment funding is an issue. The movie does not give the book justice. However the movie was quite good."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I loved the book, but was a little bit disspointed with the ending."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"In Contact, Carl Sagan introduces all types of popluar genre and precludes scientific jargon while still maintaining a very technically backboned storyline.

The plot is believable, the characters are alive, and the science-oriented references give the story some added depth - especially for those who have some previous science knowledge. Religious issues are confronted by Sagan with great fervor, who isn't apprehensive about expressing his opinions. All in all, a solid science-fiction novel.

You are left to decide for yourself which has the most impact.A Wonderful book, I'm ready to read it again....."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"With so many science fiction books and movies screaming of vicious, drooling aliens and invasions it is a relief to know that some writers, such as the late Carl Sagan, are making intelligent comments about our relationship with the universe. The movie is excellent, but the book is even better. With a very different and more elaborative plot it is able to explore not only outer space but real human virtues"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Real Carl Sagan fans will already own the book. So what am I doing at Amazon? Well I think the book is at my parents house; and I want to reread it. I was raised on Carl Sagan and to see the 'Contact' movie was to bring me back to what I used to be. The movie will disappoint those seeking the latest special effect-ed aliens; but it will move those who as children dreamt of answering the big questions and/or traveling to the stars. Was I the only one who asked himself, &quot;If I could travel to a distant civilization at the speed of light never to return or to return to a charred, aged earth, would I go?&quot; and naively but seriously answer, &quot;yes&quot;? While one's ambition may still secretly long to represent one's planet, maturity (call it spiritual or moral maturity) includes an understanding that we aren't alone in the universe (even lacking aliens and lacking God) if we can share and communicate with other sentients, and these are the ones we love"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"While this book is in need of editing and is at times a much too explicit an advertisment for Mr. Sagan's scientific philosophy (read _The Demon Haunted World_), it is still a good book with a very well done ending. This is not science fiction in the traditional sence as much as it is a sort of a science novel, in the safe vein as Gregory Benford's _Timescape_ (which I enjoyed more than _Contact_). The other major problem with this work is that Sagan's forte is as a nonfiction writer and not as a novelist. So at times _Contact_ shrugs under the weight of too much wordless narration without dialogue. Many of his ideas are interesting but feel out of place in the novel, thrown in to boost the page count. Nevertheless, it's worth reading if you're a Carl Sagan fan or a fan of science fiction, but don't expect incredibly wonderful Arthur C. Clarke-esque things. There are better &quot;first contact&quot; novels out there, like Clarke's _Rendevous with Rama_ or _2001_ to name two of the best.I don't intend to see the movie, since a _lot_ of things from the book appear to have been changed"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This is not a simple science-fiction book, although to some it may seem so.

He should stick to making kids laugh... For example, at one point he causes a character to remark that information can be found in the digits of pi. And the writer seemed to have no idea that ALL information can be found SOMEWHERE in those digits. Why? Because the digits of pi are infinite and random. So, somewhere is your phone number, and somewhere else is the product of your zip code multiplied by the square root of your zip code added to your age. Get it? ALL information can be found to exist in an infinitly long and random string. The only issue is how much computing time will be required to find such. Anyway, his character was supposed to have a good knowledge of math and did not understand this simple fact. In fact, she was quite driven by her ignorance of such things."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I very much tried reading this book with an open mind, and it wouldn't have mattered to me in the least if Ellie's character was an atheist. But Carl Sagan had to try and place biblical doubt in the mind of the reader by expressing his own apparent atheist views, by saying the Bible is contradictory. It's too bad that Carl Sagan couldn't have just written a fascinating Sci-Fi book without critiquing the word of God.Without a doubt Carl Sagan was a brilliant scientist. I viewed Cosmos open-mindedly and was fascinated. I understand most scientists are unbelievers of God, and they place their beliefs on the Big Bang theory, Evolution, etc. And that's fine; they have the right to believe what they choose. But please do not critique other people's beliefs.If you want to read a very good Sci-Fi book, check out 2001 a space odyssey.I know my review of this book will strike a nerve with other reviewers. Though, as a believer in God (as I am) and someone who values God's word (as I do) I refuse to give a book a good review when said book critiques the Holy Bible as \\"Contact\\" does. For the unbeliever in Christ, and those who hold no value for the Holy Bible, Carl Sagan's book, Contact, will probably be the next best thing to the creation of Star Wars. For those who value God's word, this book, Contact, has way too much Blasphemy in my opinion. Once again, it's too bad Carl Sagan, couldn't have just written this Sci-Fi book without having to \\"TRY\\" and place Biblical uncertainty. That's all that needs to be said. The \\"point of the book\\" is meaningless. I wish very much that I did not even have to bring up religion when giving this book review. Quite possibly many people will love this novel. But being as though this book really did speak negative about the Bible, shame on me if I didn't at least warn anyone who values God's word, and who might be thinking about reading this book."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Contact is an excellent book! Carl Sagan keeps you wanting to read more, as the Message suddenly streams in. The Message contains plans for an intricate machine, which will take years to build, it took about a year to finish downloading for the plans. After they build it, the have 5 people enter the machine, and they turn it on. The travel through space and time (although they don't know that at the time). They travel through what they can only describe as a Black Hole, and they suddenly pop out at Vega, the system that they were receiving the Message from. As they orbit around the star, they see radio telescopes, and another black hole. They are sucked into the hole, and pop out at another. This goes on for a while, until they arrive at the center of the galaxy. Now this is where it gets a bit confusing. They dock at the massive port, and they are in an area that is exactly like a deserted beach. During the night, the races that are there somehow retrieve all of the information in their brains. Suddenly, it's time to leave, they get back in the machine, and power back to earth. On earth, it has only been 20 minutes, and all video evidence was erased. Nobody believes them. This was an excellent book, but because of the confusing end, I have to give this book four out of five stars."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"OK... I read Contact few weeks ago, and I didn't really like this. After reading all the reviews, I read this book once more and I still didn't get it. This book has nothing new... Have you ever read 2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke? The 'Machine' is just like the monolith which transfers Dave Bowman to... somewhere... The idea of Grand Central Station and extraterrestrial cultivating civilization across the galaxy is already mentioned in 2001. And the part when the alien (who disguised as Ellie's dad(not really...))talks about Beethoven and peace stuff, it was ridiculous and funny rather then overwhelmed by the power of ETs. And this book is not very scientific: it sounds scientific, but only few of the scientific stuff was explained... Anf after all, why would the ET avoid the encounter with human being after 5 scientists visited them? The reason I gave this book 3 stars, however, instead of 1 or 2 is just because I liked the finishing part of the book. It was quite touching... But I wouldn't say it is the best science fiction book..."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Are you interested in SF but are tired of laser-guns and strange power-fields and want to read something more close to reality? Then I would recommend &quot;Contact&quot; by Carl Sagan. If you didn't know Sagan was (he died about a year ago) professor of planetary research at Cornell University and has written many books on astronomy and popular-science. This is as far as I know his only novel but it is a good one, very serious and well thought-out. Ellie Arroway is a radio astronomer who has devoted her life to SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) but is strongly counteracted by her colleagues. One day however, her stubbornness bear fruit. A radio signal from the star Vega in the constellation of Lyra is detected. The signal isn't just a &quot;Hello ! we are here &quot; but it's a sketch of a machine that turns out to be some sort of transport of people, perhaps to the the star Vega. Many questions arise such as, should the macine be built? If so ,who shou! ld go? Are the Vegans friendly? Etc. The machine is enormously expensive but at last it is decided that it should be built and the crew makes ready to go. This book is basically devoted to describe how we would react the day we understand that we are not alone, both politically and religiously. With the exception of Arthur C Clarke's 2001, not many books have taken this interesting subject so seriously as Sagan's Contact. The book has also been filmed by Robert Zemeckis (Forest Gump) but as always the book is better than the film."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I'll state right now that I haven't seen the movie. I've read the book. It's a good read. It begins with Dr. Eleanor Arroway's father dying. The lonely little girl soon finds a way to relieve her grief by trying to send ham radio messages to Vega. It's now December 1999 and the new millennium is just around the corner. Dr. Arroway and a team of international scientists receive a message from Vega. This message contains the instructions on how to build a spaceship. The scientific community greets it with great enthusiasm. A fundamentalist minister sees great evil in this message and denounces the scientists as godless atheists. The scientists build the ship and go to Vega. They return twenty-six years later and Dr. Arroway's mother has died in a nursing home. She wrote her a letter saying that the man she thought of as her father wasn't her father and that her father was the man she'd had an affair with. She calls the fundamentalist minister and asks him to perform her mother's funeral. He agrees."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"If you are like me, then you don't know an incredible deal about science and all of it's complicated theories and laws. Carl Sagan, of course, knows a great deal about these things - and he isn't afraid to show it off. &quot;Contact&quot; reads like a long, scientific lecture; the good stuff is over before you know it. When we are first introduced to Ellie Arroway, the book's likeable and intelligent heroine, we are told in short sections about her intelligence which was a gift to her, literally, from birth. Over the next twenty years, Ellie suffers through the death of her father, the sexism of college classmates, and betrayal as her mother marries once more. We skip ahead a few years to see Ellie working happily at Project Argus, a facility dedicated to the search for Intelligent Extra-Terrestrial Life. And, lo and behold, Ellie finds it! The odd thing is that her discovery doesn't FEEL to the reader like a discovery. It is presented with surprisingly little hullaballoo and before we know"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This would have made an excellent short story. There were good philosophical and theological undertones. I felt that the story was too long. I think the first 50 and the last 100 pages would have made the story. There seemed to be a lot of chapters that did make certain points, but were not very relevant to the book"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"A young scientist is a dedicated researcher, astronomer and SETI type. She detects a signal from space and finally works out what it is, in that it is instructions from a group of aliens on how to build a machine that will allow transport/or communication with them.A fairly understated style of story, the heroine has to deal with the self serving politicians and the religious nuts to try and get the job done."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"It has a lot of interesting ideas, and I would say that it's worth looking into.However:There's a hell of a lot of filler, and it's in all of the wrong places; the author tends to exhaustively detail irrelevant side-topics while only barely touching major plot devices. Worse still (to me, at least), the language is extremely dry. The characters are very bland and one-dimensional, not so much people as they are idealized Shakespearean characters that go on long soliloquies about how very beautiful caterpillars are.I'm about halfway through, and I'll finish it, but I can safely say that it's not for me."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I didn't necessarily think that the ending was some sort of cop-out, my problem is this: We as a CIVILIZATION undertook the most massive feat of engineering in the history of the world just to teach a SINGLE person a lesson in faith? What about the rest of the world? But this book did have some redeeming qualities though. Sagan tries to show that there is a common ground between science and religion: the dogged pursuit of the truth. Why are we here? What is our purpose? It is just that these two schools of thought attempt to discover this truth in different ways, one through the scientific method, the other through faith in God. The argument between the two though is who is right and who wrong? One thinks the other is evil and the one thinks that the other is delusional. Sagan does and excellent job of summarizing this conflict. Good novel but has some faults."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"What's to like about Carl Sagan's one and only SF novel? The characters are stiff, the plot is simplistic, and the ending is unfulfilling. I find the author's contempt for organized religion disappointing. CONTACT should have been a short story --- the shorter the better!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I agree that this novel was creative . . . for a non-fiction writer. It provided an excellent basis for one of the best movies I've seen of late. I am definitely not a conformist, however, and I don't regret to say that when Mr. Sagan presented his opinions of the different factions of life, he didn't consider a valid arguement: that science and religion are inherently inseperable. The novel is presented like a prolonged debate between the theological line of thinking and the equally unlimited world of the scientific reality. It is essentially an arguement, although it appears to be passive. The characters in the novel exemplify the limitations of both lines of thinking by not allowing them to intermingle. It places a stone wall where maybe none is needed. Yeah, the book makes you think, as you can tell by my comments, but by no means does it represent existance as it likely is, only a few ideas of what it could be."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Many are the people who, for some existential reason, seem to find peace, or an ideal environment for contemplation, while gazing upwards on a clear night. So vast, so unknown, yet, as far as we know, so, so empty. It just boggles the mind that there can be such a waste of space. Not surprising that such a vacuum has drawn a whole lot of fictitious accounts to fill it up. Carl Sagan's foray into fiction, CONTACT is, truth be told, a rather enjoyable contribution to that library, giving us a very readable story about mankind's first encounter with an alien species.One big reason that CONTACT works is that Sagan interweaves several elements at once. Unlike many genre books (and I think especially sci fi) Sagan does not focus so heavily on the fantastical storyline that character development gets short thrift. The story of man's first encounter with the little green men converges nicely with character development, with neither really overshadowing the other.The same is true for the scientific features of CONTACT. Not so dense as to be beyond the average lay reader, not so sophomoric as to flunk the giggle test, Sagan presents enough science here to live up to the 'science' part of the fiction, but avoids laying it on too thick. Most people with enough intellectual curiosity to pick this novel up should have what it takes to 'get it' and not wind up all befuddled (and I say this as a non-scientist).Sagan does, unfortunately, throw in some social criticism that does not hold up very well and which can come off as a tad condescending. Several mentions are made comparing the advanced civilization and knowledge of the aliens to our own. No surprise ours is paltry by comparison. Yet Sagan includes man's economic systems in with such comparisons. But economics, unlike mathematics, physics, etc. is a social science, based upon the psychology of humans. Comparisons on this point fall flat and remind one of those 'which one doesn't belong' types of assessment tests.Although not overtly hostile to religion, Sagan does portray it as buffoonish, and, like many scientists, attempts to portray the religious as antagonistic to science. Although this stereotype may have a kernel of truth, it is, to a large extent, false and an example of people (in this case scientists) believing their own propoganda about others. Again, though, it's not so heavy handed as to sideline the story.In terms of genre fiction, I usually prefer crime stories to sci fi. But a simple truth holds for both - there is an awful lot of poor writing, two-dimensional characters, and stories so ridiculous that it makes one's eyes roll of their own volition. Separating the wheat from the chaff is a task unto itself, but CONTACT makes the cut."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This book was a great treat for me. I have always viewed Carl Sagan with much respect. There is-I believe-no one better qualified who could bring to reality this idea of \\"contact.\\" Carl Sagan filled his book with such details that made the idea of extraterrestrial contact seem-for once-plausible. He brought his knowledge and wisdom, as seen in Cosmos, to this novel to make it extraordinarily realistic. But it wasn't only his great detail of scientific facts that made the story seem rational; it was also his painstaking detailed descriptions of the lives of all the characters. I don't believe his only message in this novel was that of \\"contact\\"; he had many other messages especially in the intercalary chapters and flashbacks. Contact is an extended parable in a sense; Carl Sagan had much to teach us in both philosophical aspects and in individual and societal thinking. Another facet that made this book an incredible read, were all the quotes at the beginning of each chapter and each part; it makes the reader think more into the story. Carl Sagan's writing style also was attractive. His style of writing is uncommon and makes the read easier. The underlying but prominent theme of Contact is knowledge is power. Carl Sagan knew this very well and he tells us to acknowledge everything in this world and if we do so, we will find the truth."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I absolutely loved Carl Sagan's novel. The movie did absolutely nothing for me. The novel speaks to you on so many levels. It is the true Sagan speaking. From his feelings on contemporary political agendas, to his thoughts on religion, Sagan gives his readers an insightful look into the issues of the modern world. I think what disappoints most readers of this book is that Contact is not only about &quot;contact&quot;. The movie may have been, but the novel is not. I think that this is what makes it outstanding novel. The movie was made so that fourth graders would have no problem understanding the complexities of contacting an alien race. The novel was NOT created for fourth graders. It was created for intelligent adults who are able to gain insights from something other than television. I was not disappointed by Contact. It lived up to my expectations completely. I loved the ending and can admit to crying (as well as laughing) during various parts of the novel. If you want to experience the real Contact, and not the dumbed-down movie version, read Sagan's novel. You won't regret it. In fact, you may be amazed....."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"The movie \\"Contact\\", based upon this book, is a good one...but the book (and I'm sure you've heard this before) is ... stellar! (little astrophysicist humor).It's engrossing and entertaining and definitely a PAGE TURNER!There are a TON of things left out of the movie (necessary for a 2 hour movie), and these details, for me, make the book great.Also the ending is MUCH more fulfilling than the movie. In the movie it's more of a nature of 'faith' dilemma....definitely not Sagan's message. In the book it's more of a 'fabric of space' ending...and I won't say more...no spoilers.Buy it, read it, if you like Sagan, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"What a great read! I have become quite the fan of Carl Sagan after reading this book. It was a required read for a Astronomy course I am taking - initially I was a little taken back that the professor would require a science fiction novel to be read for the class, but upon finishing &#34;Contact&#34; I understood why.Carl Sagan ingeniously incorporates real science and an honest opinion about the unexplored frontiers of space with a very beautiful, artistic view of our real world, and real emotions that we deal with every day.One of the best books I have read in a while. I immediately sent it to a friend to read and he loves it too."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I was a big fan of the movie and wanted Carl to expand the world even further. However, it makes for dull and difficult reading. It takes a while to get into it, but it warms up in the end. I guess I like it spoon-fed to me in visual form."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Few people have expressed just how insignificant the earth appears amid the backdrop of the entire universe more eloquently than Carl Sagan. He spent a lifetime impressing us with how well he conveyed the grand scale of the cosmos, and in Contact Sagan has brought that same style and vision to fiction.The story develops around the intriguing idea of a message received from another star system. Contact deals with questions of space, time, faith, religion, and the essence of the universe as a whole. Sagan's incredible mind and imagination give this story all the intrigue that is needed. Thus even without creating characters with significant depth that so often describes good fiction this story maintains its quality purely for its engrossing ideas.Sagan deals directly with some of our grandest questions, and instead of simply providing answers he has widened the horizon of potential answers. Many ideas are proposed that reach beyond what most would normally ponder. Sagan is a master of spatial awareness and imagery and in this story he has examined the realm of possibilities in a manner few are capable of accomplishing. The conclusion of this story is so well done that it will be pleasing to views of any persuasion. The book is far superior to the movie adaption and I'd recommend Contact to any fan of science fiction."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Carl Sagan's Contact is a very well-written, enjoyable books that manages to get a scientific point across and be fun to read at the same time. Many books have approached the problems of first contact, but few have examined it as thoroughly as Sagan does here. Also, he approaches it in a different way from most. Rather than have the aliens visit the earth, the human race instead picks up artificial radio signals, which allows us to go to them."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Contact is one of those rarities where the book and the film of the book are of equal excellence.The book works because the science is accurate, due to Carl Sagan being a physicist, astronomer and cosmologist and his underlying plot for the book... the interception of encoded transmissions from deep space being something that the scientific community was and is working on as embodied by SETI, the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence, which was located at the Paracebo Telescope on the island of Puerto Rico.The concept is a simple one. That a non Earth-based intelligence would probably try to communicate with other developed intelligences in the galaxy by the use of radio telecommunications. Sagan uses the intercepted broadcasts of radio pulses which occur in the same sequence as prime numbers and it is this property that identifies the signals as non-random radio transmissions which draws the attention of the astronomers and causes them to investigate further.Eventually, the investigating astronomers discover a television signal underlying the pulses and when they reconstruct it they find themselves looking at a the broadcast of the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. The hypothesis is that the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin were the first TV transmissions which were broadcast around the world and that these had been recorded by another intelligence and re-broadcast to Earth. These TV pictures themselves had embedded within them the technical schematics for the building of a machine which would enable a human being to make a journey through space-time in order to gain knowledge of a more advanced civilization. I won't spoil the denouement.Contact is a powerful book, because the detail is accurate and Sagan is stimulating our imaginations and yet staying within the realms of the actual and the 'doable'. The idea of traveling through a worm-hole, is, as yet, theoretical but according to Professor Stephen Hawkins, his theories do not break the Laws of Physics.Contact is a great work of science fiction and an uplifting one.[...]"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"In my opinion, Dr. Sagan is undoubtably one of the most talented science-fiction writers of our time. Contact is yet another example to renew that belief. After receiving and decoding a message sent from space, Dr. Ellie Arroway's marvellous journey with her four colleagues to an unknown corner of the universe is an immediate classic. The rich characters with their political and moral undertones make for a believable cast that anyone can identify with. See the movie first, otherwise compared to the book, it will be disappointing. The book elaborates and expands many of the plots that the movie simply could not explore. You will not regret reading this book!."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This book is about more than just an invitation from Aliens: It shows what would happen, IF we got in contact with another species. It describes all the conflicts, religious problems and how the government would deal with such a unknown situation. The book is much more detailed than the movie, and that's probably why Carl Sagan (the author) didn't like the movie. I enjoyed reading the book because it makes you think. And you stop reading a lot of times just to think for yourself about the topic! Nevertheless, some scenes seem to be too unreal, like Dr. Arroway's trip to the Space Station during such a hectic situation while planning the &quot;Real Journey&quot;. No wonder the film team left those sequences out. The book also gets some times repetitive. To sum it up: I would say it is worth reading, but don't expect any unknown wisdom in it!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I recommend Contact by Carl Sagan as a summer reading book for anyone who is looking for an exciting and intellectually stimulating book. The main character, Ellie Arroway, discovers a signal from aliens. After decrypting the message, she and other scientists find that it gives instructions on how to make a spacecraft. The book gives a views of different groups in the world and how they react to the message and building the spacecraft. The way that Sagan writes the book gives the reader the impression that the book is actually about the human race. Carl Sagan's writing is well done and makes the book exciting. He challenges the reader to think and to look at the world from a totally different perspective. He incorporates various intellectual studies, especially philosophy, to give his book power and to make his themes apparent. Because it is well written and incorporated a lot of ideas, this book left me speechless and wanting more."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I have seen many one star ratings to this book, and all those reviewers compare this book to Issac Assimov's job, well i am going to tell something to those guys: THIS IS REALISTIC SCIENCE FICITION!, the book it's long but fun to read, although in the first chapters the descriptions are long and almost without any dialogue, they are interesting, also the book it better than the movie, the movie was boring, but this book it's exciting, also, this book it's better than that &quot;Red, Blue, Green Mars&quot; by Kim Stanley Robinson trash, altough sometimes this book it's unbeliveable, (at the end), but at least it's more realistic and not as dumb and boring as that Mars trash, this is a book that will make you think, it really potrays how religions are like, unlike the movie were it was offensive this book seems a lot more well not offensive, i give the book five stars, while to the film four and a half stars."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Definetly this book proves that Carl Sagan it's better at writing fiction than science, this book it's amazing!, way better than the movie itself, it shows more deepness, altought the descriptions are too long, they are entertaining, there is no much dialouge in the first three or four chapters,but the descriptions are very interesting on the way that Carl Sagan does, this is why this is his best book ever!, also what i loved about this book it hows it describes religion, sexism,well everything, but i don't recommended to a &quot;closed minded&quot; reader and for a very hard scinece one, because when they make contact to alien beings it's on 1999, this book was written in 1985, so please forget the real facts and enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I think most people that read this book don't get past it's surface of a search for extra-terrestrial life. Certainly, it's a flashy surface to the story. This book is really more one of faith, and how a faith in science and a faith in God are not necessarily contradictory, and in fact are very much alike. This is NOT a book about little green men, it's book about how different people believe in different things, and how their goals can bring them together to do great things, even when the reasons behind their actions are very different.Worth a read!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I loved this Carl Sagan masterpiece for three main reasons: (1) it is an intelligent, realistic look at what would happen if we actually did make contact with an alien civilization; (2) it is an insightful commentary on the relationship between religion and science; and (3) it is wonderful fiction, with characters as realistic as the plot and the science. It is the kind of science fiction that is only one step removed from science fact: Consider it a realistic story with some fantasy elements, rather than a fantasy story with some realistic elements (a la Star Wars). I saw the movie first, and it's the only movie that has made me want to go out and buy the book. And the book did not disappoint; in fact, it was even better than I had expected."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I have seen the movie, Contact, about 20 times, and every time i watch it i love it. I am on my second reading of the book which has made me think a lot more. It had made me more interested in the universe - how infinite it is, how beautiful it is...and it is shown beautifully in both the movie and the book."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Historically, intellectuals have philosophized their ideas about god. Hitherto, those philosophies have gained popularity in many's minds. The soul of one's spirituality, faith, and belief is similarly touched in this single work of fiction by one of those former intellectuals. Carl Sagan shows us the universality of faith and spirit in all of our lives, and whole-heartedly encourages us to frame our own ideas of faithful reasoning. Ellie Arroway, the main character, shows the puzzlement of our minds and Palmer Joss, her friend, lover at times, is it's firm-minded, though not closed minded, mediator. Her journey from agnostic to enlightened agnostic occurs with this truth seeker throughout lighting the way and proving connections, comparing the scientific mind with the religious, showing that fine line which separates them. The end of the book shows no conclusion, merely the importance of being open-minded and having an astute mind, an accepting spirit and a rational sould as their parent."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I first saw the movie, thought it was fairly good, then ordered the book. Far better! I especially liked the stuff at the end involving transendental numbers. Sagan's imagination really comes through here."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I don't what those two 1 stars guys' beef was w/ contact, but REALLY! Either they were some sort of scientists, and were looking at it from a biased perspective, or avid fans of sci-fi, who don't accept a more realistic novel. I did see the movie before i read the book, and already loved the movie. SERIOUS sci-fi, with a heart, a relatively realistic situation, engaging topics, not to mention Ms.Foster's tremendous acting ability. (Or Matthew .M's good looks) I dove right into the book very eagerly. Expecting something wonderful, I was more impressed than I expected to be. This story, simply put, sweeps you away. And you'll most likely walk away from it extremely optimistic about the future of, well, us. WARNING! Please, please, please see the movie before you read the book, or else, i expect you'll probably hate the movie."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I read 'Cosmos' when I was a boy and I became a scientist(but, biologist). When I read the the Contact', I was so impressed with the book again. Real humanism and devotion for the science! What can I say more? I cannot express fully because I am a asian(Korean) but I recommend the book as well as movie(it's really rare case! Both are extremely excellent equally). I lost the book but couldn't buy another in Korea, so I will purchase one soon! A must!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Carl Sagan really belived that the universe was full of wonder and this book explores all that and much more. The people who search for alien civilizations in this novel also search for the meaning of life at the same time. Sagan has taken his rightful place alongside Arthur C. Clarke and Ray Bradbury as among the best contributors in both science and science fiction."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Although maybe a little too optimistic, &quot;Contact&quot; is one of the best books I have ever read. I saw the movie first (yes, I did like her going alone better) yet the book had a stronger message than it. Make sure you have patience when reading this- it's worth it. This book forces you to think, like it or not."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Killer Read... Sagan was just a bit too optimistic about how far technology would come in a short time, but I find this to be true of all near-future writers."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Dr. Sagan's book is an amazing experience that the film with Ms. Foster recaptured with extreme intensity.I wondered what else could be achieved on the audio version, and I found that a difficult symbiosis had been performed: Ms. Foster performance built an atmosphere with such force that all the scientific passion and humanity on the book surface harmoniously, and goes beyond the mere verbatim.Close your eyes and participate on the true galactic search..."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I did think it started out a little slow but once the message was recieved the book really took off. This is a beautiful story and Carl Sagan once again inspires me with his hopeful writing. His vision of the universe, shared with us, is a beautiful and optimistic one. The writing may be a little dry at times but the message is worth the wait. This book remains on my &quot;favorites&quot; shelf and on my list of books to recommend."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed many parts of this story. There was always some new unrevealed scientific finding from the signal, there was something that the scientists had to deduce and come up with a solution for. There was government involvement, there was private interests, all the things needed for a good book. The problem that I saw was that the character development lacked quite a bit. There was excellent explanation of certain scientific practices, and certain &quot;theoretical&quot; arguments between groups that would be interested in the well being of such a project, but I found that we have the characters, they solve problems or we have characters and they have a certain belief and it's changed by what happens within the story. Sagan is an excellent thinker, he knows the difference between polar modulation of radio frequencies and he knows that bits of information can be sent by the side to side motion of certain electromagnetic waves, but does that make a good story? I really don't believe so. Ellie the main character was a strong willed woman with ambition, and desire but she was merely some ambitious girl who I didn't feel the slightest bit of care whether her mission was completed or not. I feel the book really must be read to get the full meaning of what a paradox is created when religion and science are mixed together, but I feel that if you would like a story about dynamic characters who you feel a deep respect and hope their desires come true, I'd suggest the movie."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"We don't know for sure if there is life out there.But we know for sure that we are intelligent beings and Carl Sagan used not only his amazing intelligence but also his vivid imagination to create a story about the greatest moment in human history: the encounter between humans and extraterrestrials.Unlike any other science fiction book this has a story that is not only very believable, but also very touching, making us feel a part of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.With this book, the reader really makes a voyage to the stars. Carl Sagan will never die."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I love this book. The movie was fantastic, but the book is better. I'm not going to explain to story to you because there are lots of people who have already done that here. I'm simply going to give it my highest rating and let you read it to discover why."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"After reading this book, you will likely agree with Dr. Sagan that humanity has reached a turning point in its maturation. We, unlike other creatures, have the intelligence to choose our course. We have the technology to destroy ourselves -- or the technology to make &quot;contact.&quot;This book is very exciting and serves as a reasonably good introduction to the efforts of the SETI program. The book brings up questions about the nature of intellence, our place in the universe, and the nature of our possible brothers of intelligence in the universe. Since these questions are not yet answered conclusively, the book cannot hope to tell us the exact setting of the contact. So keep in mind that the &quot;findings&quot; of this book are not inevitable, and that they are not based upon any single and fully successful scientific study. But it does illustrate conclusively the depth and scope of those questions, and the fact that if and when contact occurs it will be wonderful in ways that most of us cannot currently imagine.On a slightly different note, with all of the problems facing mankind in the near future this book's message stands out as a beacon of hope. I highly recommend it to the open-minded reader."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"No one ever accused Sagan of being a poet, but his first novel did bag film rights, even if this was not his intention. It would have been a better read if written by Rev. Palmer Joss, more poetic, less dodecahedral. I read all Sagan's books back in the 80's, including this one, and almost attended Cornell just so I could take a few of his classes. So I saw the movie. Then I listened to the audiobook, then re-read the book. Of course the movie had to have romance between Ellie and Palmer, how else could you get a producer/studio interested? But Jodie Foster gave a standout performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. So too some of the special effects, which gave me shivers on several occasions: the opening, and especially Ellie's arrival at the window on &quot;the world.&quot; The Apollo astronauts gave similar accounts on seeing the Earth from afar. The big disappointment was Zemekis replacing Sagan's &quot;Ms. President&quot; with Bill Clinton. Maybe Zemekis will finally get his invite to a White House dinner. The book is scattered with science faqs which sometimes distract, but the story is original and prophetic. The audiobook is yet another feather in Foster's cap...and I wasn't even a Foster fan. The day of first contact will come eventually, and the then-inhabitants of Earth will react in all the ways Sagan imagined. Humanity will, for the first time, have to consider what it means to be only one of many. Does every galactic civilization have a savior who died for their sins? Would the Creator not leave us a message or clue, or is creation itself the proverbial 'watch on the beach,' the beauty of which cannot be accident? How does a government of a civilization a million years ahead of us function? Would such civilization have free-enterprise, or communism ? Would they even need business, government, or political parties ? If they squashed us like ants, would they feel any more remorse than we do stepping on a cockroach? On first read I found the ending odd if not disappointing, but the more I listened to the audiobook ending, and re-read his ending, the more I thought Carl's on to something. Humans want to know how (or why) the world began, but his aliens are more concerned about its future. This is infinitely more believable given a second look. When development eventually blots out the last green spot on earth, and politicians &amp; taxes destroy our last hope, we'll reflect fondly on our pale blue dot, and the naive if creative &amp; loving inhabitants who used to live there. Sagan's alien saw this good within us, and it was Carl's hope for mankind. This book is about more than its contents. It's about making us re-think everything that matters. And for that alone, it merits a 10, as did Carl Sagan's life. Earth is our cradle, but one doesn't remain in the cradle forever. Thanks, Carl, for all the years. We'll break out your book on first contact, drink champagne, and call you 'visionary' - if we too have the vision to make it that far."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Carl Sagan made a name for himself by making science, and astronomy in particular, more accessible to the general public through a series of books and, of course, his TV show, \\"Cosmos\\". In the mid eighties he decided to try his hand at science fiction, the end result being this book. His goal was to speculate on what a possible contact (hence the title) would be like from intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, and to the extent he sticks with this theme, his book makes for a highly engaging read. Unfortunately, he just couldn't resist going off on a number of different tangents, which is really too bad, since what he mostly does is reveal his own ignorance and prejudices as opposed to offering up enlightenment.What's best about this book? Well, as to be expected, the actual core story, which is, of course, about what happens when a project designed to detect signals from alien civilizations actually makes contact with one. Sagan, who in real life was a passionate supporter of the SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) Project, brings his expertise to bear, and the result is a thoughtful and imaginative take of how just such an encounter might occur. As the story begins, we are introduced to Dr. Eleanor Arroway, an expert on radio astronomy, as she and her team intercept and start to decode what is clearly a message from outer space. In due time the signal, which has multiple layers woven together, is translated, the result is a set of plans for a complex machine, the purpose of which is impossible to determine. After much international debate, the machine is built, and Arroway and four companions, noted scientists from around the globe, enter the completed machine, start it up, and are whisked of to some unknown portion of the galaxy to commune with the beings who sent the message. Giving credit where due, Sagan serves up a nice mixture of science, speculation, and mysticism as his tale unfolds.The problem, however, is Sagan simply can't leave well enough alone. As a science writer, Sagan excels, but as a novelist, he's got much to learn. With the exception of Arroway, most of the character development is poor and there are some rather odd plot developments, most notably a bizarre twist at the very end concerning Arroway's stepfather. But bad writing isn't the primary fault, hubris is. For some reason, people like Dr. Sagan, who are brilliant in one realm of human endeavour, begin to think themselves as experts in others in which they are actually quite clueless. This shows up in a number of spots in this book, but none more notable than his efforts to put religion in its place. Sagan himself is apparently an atheist, which is fine, but he devotes a rather large portion of the book to, for lack of a better term, shoving his views down our throat. He does this by having Arroway engage in a number of \\"debates\\" with a pair of preachers, which by itself wouldn't be bad, except that he resorts to the classic \\"straw man\\" tactic, which is to say, rigging the contest by having the opposition represented by easily refuted buffoons. In this case, the preachers are, for the most part, ignorant bible thumpers who spout clich&eacute;s about Creationism and other sundry topics, the end result being, of course, that Arroway (and, by extension, Sagan) comes across as sensible, rational, and enlightened while religion is shown mainly as a tool for exploiting people's fear and stupidity. It's one thing for Sagan to use a work of fiction to expound his opinions on religion, but at the very least he should have had the intellectual honesty to give the opposition a fair hearing. There are any number of learned theologians and religious scholars, rabbis, and so forth who could have been used as the basis for an intelligent argument in favor of religion, but Sagan probably didn't want to risk having to examine his own views too deeply for fear of finding that perhaps they weren't as infallible as he thinks.And that, in a nutshell, is my principal complaint. Sagan has always been an articulate advocate for science, and a passionate supporter of anything that adds to our knowledge and understanding of the universe. His experience as an astronomer and his work with SETI put him in a near perfect position to write a fictional account of a possible contact with extraterrestrial life, and that part of the book is thoroughly enjoyable. It's only when he ventures off onto other subjects, most notably, his obvious dislike of religion, that he starts to make a fool of himself. It was notable that, when a movie based on this book was made; they cut out most of the extraneous stuff and focused the central issue, the \\"Contact\\" with another civilization in the universe. This book is by no means bad, and contains quite a bit of thought provoking material, but to be perfectly blunt, if someone were to ask my recommendation, I'd suggest they see the movie instead."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"You think you have read the best of science fiction? Have you read 'Contact'? Then, you might want to think again. Sure, you'd have faithfully watched every episode of the X-files; perhaps even maintain a fan site for Mulder and Scully; watched every alien encounter movie from Strange Encounters and ET to Independence Day and War of the Worlds; you might even have SETI@home running on your system, and a record of Alien Invasion Week on your VHS. But, it takes a true scientific spirit to look at both the objective and the humanistic sides of a scientific endeavour, and Sagan shines there bright in the sky. Two thumbs up!His erudition is displayed unabashedly in the quotations at the beginning of every chapter; he ceaselessly opines on worldly problems throughout the book. Unlike the balderdash that people like Dan Brown et al. write, Sagan knows what he is writing about; his scientific pursuit does not defy logic; there is every reason to believe in the possiblity that the exact sequence of events might happen; and concludes with a brilliance, that might disappoint the arch skeptics and delight the agnostics. Unlike its contemporaries, Contact maintains the same pace of movement throughout the novel, and pays attention to little details to breathe an air of scented nuance.There are a few downsides to the novel - sometimes, the narrative, and the dialogue, becomes clich&eacute;d. Banal details about all the scientists could have been avoided, given that we know the protagonist well. And Sagan could have handled imagery much better. But, these are trivial compared to the scale and the ambition of the novel, and its unique attempt in provoking boundary-crossing and unifying thoughts. For that, Sagan deserves full credit.A word about the movie. In my opinion, it is better to watch the movie first )given the brilliant direction by Robert Zemeckis) and then turn to the novel, as the versions are drastically different. One who watches the movie after reading the novel will certainly feel disappointed. Given a choice, I would always recommend the novel."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"As most everyone agrees, the movie is never as good as the book. The better the book, the more disapointing the movie seems to be. Perhaps this is why it's my opinion that Contact movie is one of the worst adaptations of the book given all the changes made from the book to the movie. Spoilers to come. One of the key changes in the movie is Ellie's relationships - one of the key relationships in the book was her relationship with the preacher and the whole message of the book became acceptance between faith and science and even a bit of merging of the two. The movie radicallized both sides and made it about the battle between the faith and science - the book's point was entirely different. In the book, the clash led to acceptance, while in the movie the clash led to Ellie not being selected as the sole person to go (antoher change from the book, given that a team got to go in the book) and the first device being destroyed by religious extremists. While the destruction of one of the devices was in the book, there was an entirely different reason for it. So, all in all, given the content of the book, which I recommend, the movie was totally disappointing and diparts from the book to the extent rarely seen in recent years."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This book is one of the best novels of our time! Carl Sagan was such an extraordinary human being! I highly recommend this book to anyone! Especially if u have seen the movie, regardless whether u liked it or not. The book is, of course, very different, and, of course, much better than the movie (although the movie is pretty good too). It seems there are very few books like this one who manage to talk about all the big and important issues of our human race."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"My regrets that I watched the movie and then bought the book. I read the the first few chapters and was a little thrown off by the difference in Dr. Arroway's character. A few months later (book half read) I received the audio version as a late birthday present, and I was absolutley captivated by Jodie Foster's voice as she took me through the book. Without a doubt the book offers the reader something the movie just could not deliver. I would suggest reading the book first and then renting the DVD. It's fun to pull together the theatrical elements and the very philosphical points that Carl Sagan throws in there for the atheist and agnostic reader. Thought provoking and a very good read."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I chose to read this book for my book report in school. It has a captivating plot about science and religion intertwined in one story. Why can't religion and science be in the same book. I think religion proves science and science proves religion. Why can't God have created and follow the rules of science.The story had a great plot and had good meaning, but was bland and dull through one third of the book. Carl Sagan would go off for pages talking about things that are irrelevant to the story and disrupts the flow of the events.All in all, the \\"Contact\\" was good, but could be revised and be made into a more captivating and intriguing story."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"There are not a lot of books that I read from cover to cover without setting down for a break now and then. But this is one of them. I was enthralled with this book from word one and loved every word of it.If you have seen the movie, yes, there are some differences. Different good? Different bad? I don't know, I think some will like the book better and others the movie. I thought they were equally fantastic and told best by their medium of communication.The basic plot remains unchanged. Earth realizes that man is not alone when messages from Vega start appearing. Using the \\"language\\" of mathematics it is easy to tell that this is not random noise from the universe (an echo of the big bang maybe?) but a message from an intelligent life form from outer-space. And within the basic message is another message, instructions on how to build a machine. What does the machine do? How do Earthlings respond to the message? How does religion become effected by the messages and the realization that we are not alone?There are two wonderful things I really like about this story, both well portrayed in the movie and the book. The first is the message. If aliens were to communicate with us, how would they best do it. I love how easily Carl Sagan figures it out. We all have a common language no matter which corner of the universe you are from: mathematics. Everything is mathematics that people after the Renaissance could figure out... all that is required is a bit of technology to pick up the message. In the book, mathematics plays a bigger role especially at the end of the story when the aliens find a message within pi (you know, 3.1415....). Carl Sagan shares with us the message, which actually made me laugh. One because it was rather creative. But two because it probably isn't too far off of what Douglas Adams would have come up with. But I think it made the story interesting none-the-less.The second is how this story is shown from the points of view of many peoples. How would religion react? Government? The skeptics? The believers? Many reactions are shown by various groups and I appreciated the depth of characters that are in this book and even shown in the movie.If you are looking for a good read, pick this up. It isn't just a good story, it is also told very well by the author. If you liked the movie then you've most definitely got to give this book a go. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"It fascinates me to learn that this book was written by *the* Carl Sagan. I had seen the movie when it first came out, at a very early age, and one of the things my parents and other adults told me was how unrealistic it was. Despite their comments, I adored the movie.Imagine my surprise when years later, I learned that the book was written by him. Carl Sagan, for those of you who don't know, was extremely involved with the scientific community's search for extraterrestrial intelligence, including being one of 11 attendees at what is probably the first conference ever held on the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Another reviewer mentioned Drake's Equation, the equation that projects the possible number of advanced civilizations in the galaxy. What they didn't mention was that Sagan was actually present at that first conference when Drake's Equation was first unveiled and discussed, which is a fascinating story in itself.Please don't misunderstand me. Contact, at its core, is still a science-fiction novel. But its roots are a lot deeper in science than many believe."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"CONTACT is a novel about the global reception of a message from space. Radio observatories around the world pick up the length-repeating signal and manage to piece the whole thing together. As the code is broken the signal is revealed to be visual. When put on a screen for the first time the scientists are treated to the image of Adolph Hitler. The images are from the German Olympics which were the subject of the first strong television signal broadcast.Underneath the picture data is more hidden data. This is eventually deciphered to be the blueprints of a device. As the world reacts to almost indisputable proof that we are not alone the device is built and a team is assembled to test it.Upon activation the scientists find themselves traveling at unimaginable speeds to a distant location. Each traveler is individually greeted in a form to make them comfortable. One is greeted by a deceased father. After glimpsing the almost miraculous peace of this civilization, the travelers return at the exact moment they departed and all of the records of the trip are blank. Everyone refuses to believe that there actually was a trip except the travelers themselves.While CONTACT starts out on a firm scientific basis that is gripping and well written, I found the novel as a whole to be disappointing. What starts as good hard-core science fiction quickly transforms into the account of what can only be called a religious experience. At least one bookstore actually shelved the book in the religion section. While I personally have no problem accepting both science and religion I felt that this book did a poor job of joining or reconciling the two. Despite my objections to the plotting I will recommend the book as it is quite well written."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"One of Carl Sagan's great interests was advanced alien civilizations and the possibility of contact with them. What I think he really wanted to do in this novel is convey some of the sense of wonder and even awe that we would experience if we did manage to contact someone. And he does this very well.But one aspect of the novel that I found a bit tedious was the romance between the lead characters Ellie and Palmer Joss. They just seemed to be such an unlikely match - she, a highly professional, intelligent intellectual, and he, a fundamentalist Christian. I understand that Sagan needed some dramatic tensions to help flesh-out the novel but it went on too long and strained my credulity. Likewise I was unimpressed with the ending where he has the aliens investigating the discovery of a hidden message in Pi - implying an intelligent designer/s of some sort. Whether this reflects his true beliefs or not I don't know but I hope it wasn't just an attempt to appeal to religious readers.Anyway, it was a great read, and I also like the movie with Jodie Foster playing the lead role. I'm very sad of course that there'll never be a sequel now."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Let me first say I'm not a &quot;reader&quot; by nature, so it's rare for me to say that I &quot;love&quot; a book. This book is deserving of the &quot;love&quot; label, because once it grabs your attention, it doesn't let go. I seem to have a short attention span usually, but Carl Sagan wrote a great novel that doesn't overtake the reader with too much scientific mumbo-jumbo. There is science stuff every once in awhile, but nothing that overpowers the reader -- it's VERY easy to understand.The story goes very in-depth with each character, but leaves just enough questions in the readers mind to keep up suspense. If you liked the movie, you'll like the book. If you hated the movie, you should read the book -- it explains SO much (they are very similar, excluding a couple things). Great book overall."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"It's important to not draw any conclusions about this book till you've finished it. So many questions are addressed, and so many different philosophical points of view presented, it's tempting to try to second-guess the author's own perspective on the question of extraterrestrial intelligence. Specifically, did Carl Sagan believe in God, or not? But he doesn't truly reveal himself till the last few pages. And it's worth the wait; the story's closing is very satisfying. One caveat: The book can get pretty bogged down in the development of too many characters. I myself only really cared about Ellie Arroway and Palmer Joss."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"A pioneering piece of literature written by one of the pre eminant physicysts of our time. I was very much impressed by the author's writing ability, considering his background of very much academic and scientific work.At last contact has been established with a foriegn life form, from a distant solar system. This book delves into how the earth as a whole might respond to a situation where everyone has to work together to achieve the desired goal. It also brings to light the classic, but somewhat sleepy struggle of scientific evolutionary principles versus literal interpretation of the Bible. Great dialogue and a wonderful array of perspectives make this book an adventurous and intriguing one to read. This book is well written, and gave me a real sense of the vastness and beauty found in our universe."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Definitely the most thought-provoking science-fiction novel I can remember. No, the movie was OK, but don't read this book because of the movie.Sure, if you like Matrix or Star Trek, just the sci-fi aspect of the story would blow you away. But here is more:If you want to know how to reconcile between Religion and Science, Carl Sagan offers such a good view on this ever-controversial topic, I can't help but feeling a subtle shift in my own fundamental philosophy after reading this book.Why are there so many Christians, Catholics, Islamics, Buddhists, or even athiests? You would find such distinction a bit ironic once you read &quot;Contact.&quot;Bravo, Carl Sagan!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"There's not really much I can say about this magnificant work other than I've read it close to fifteen times,and I read something new each time.Packed within the thrilling,brisk narrative are amazing passages in which characters argue-intelligently,insightfully-about all the philisophical,theological,and scientific ramafications of actually making contact with another life-from.Protaganist Ellie Arroway is obviously an alter-ego of Carl Sagan,as she shares the same passion for exploration and knowledge as he did.He was one of history's great thinkers,and his influence and boundless enthusiasm for the very fabric of our existance will be sorely missed.Anyway,like I said,there's not much I could say to elucidate this classic story any further,just suffice it to say that if you're a fan of a great read,and enjoy asking questions and actually THINKING about things,then this is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I have read numerous science fiction novels and this is by far the best I have ever found. I have read several of Carl Sagans other fact-based scientific books and am not surprised that he could make this story so believable. The story is based on radio astronomy and the SETI (search for extra-terrestrial intelligence) program.The main character, scientist Dr. Ellie Arroway, finally receives a radio message from space that turns out to be the instructions for building a machine. The story revolves around the machine and what happens when it is built and used. A truly gripping tale that will keep you spellbound till the end.This is the best science fiction tale ever written, Thanks Carl."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I am currently reading this book for the fifth time. It is one of the greatest books I have ever read. The characters are vivid, the ideas explored are profound. It is a positive book; it gives one hope for the future of this little planet. I would recommend it to absolutely everyone."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This book was shaping up to be a five star novel. I disliked the movie (which I saw first), but having read and enjoyed much of Sagan's non-fiction, I figured that it was the usual case of a good book being badly translated into movie form. There are definitely a lot of differences, and the book is far superior to the movie, but the same thing that I really hated in the movie is present in the book also.I can't be really specific with what I disliked about the story without giving everything away, especially since it is at the end of the novel. The problem is basically the reams of implausibility, with regards to both logic and science, that take place in the last 50 pages or so. Things just simply couldn't have worked out the way they did. There was too much evidence. I can't understand why Sagan would ruin an otherwise excellent novel with such a badly thought out ending, especially given the quality of all his other work.This is a mostly excellent novel, well written, and with some very thought-prevoking discussions in it, but the ending is simply unforgiveable."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"The movie was excellent. So that got me wanting to read the book. Bought it and started it right away. I was disappointed. I just read half the book cause Carl Sagan can't right worth anything! His idea was something I could never imagine it's just the way he wrote bore me and I quit reading it. I wanted to finish it to compare the ending to the movie but the guy just dragged me page after page and I couldn't stand it anymore. Go see the movie."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Scientific writer is like a chef who wants to put all the ingredients in one dish, and making it quite weird both in outlook and taste. Endless elaborations and repeats making the heroine look like Vega, shinning, bright yet distant exactly like a male Sagan himself. A novel should not read like a textbook. If the writer cannot achieve such basic requirement, he should write no-fiction to elaborate his billions, billions ideas with lot of clauses which never end. Showing off all the books you have read and all the concepts you have acquired in your lifetime were fine, but you should not put them in a novel, instead, you should jam them in non-fiction writings. This is the reason why the movie has to be completely changed and deformed in order to make it more seeable (readable), otherwise, the cinema would only hear lot of zzzzzzz snorings. At the end of the movie, on the lower right of the screen, a short note was shown: FOR CARL. It meant so well and so appropriately, since they finally made Carl Sagan's"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I think this is a three or four-star book. I have mixed sentiments. The first time I read it, I remember being impressed by the witty dialogue on the issue of religion and science, the reasons to doubt as opposed to the reason to believe. Religion and believe makes up an important theme of the book, and Sagan's insights (as expressed through the characters) are important and still useful. But in another sense, Sagan is merely substituting a more impersonal, science friendly religion for what he perceives to be an older-time worn formula for religion. His caricature of religion seems to omit that anyone could have a liberal sense of religion, and focuses mostly on the fundamentalist view. I just wish the book weren't so \\"chatty.\\" Honestly I think it could have been edited to be much shorter, more succinct. In a nutshell, I think there are important themes of religion and science here, and that it is a still a worthy read - if also a mildly flawed one."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Contact, by Carl Sagan, is overall a mediocre book. There are three parts in the novel. The first part, The Message, is mostly about Ellie, the main character's childhood and background. This is a very boring part in the book. It is basically a biography of Ellie. There is not really any reason for me to care. There is no action or suspense. There are no interesting concepts that would intrigue a reader. In fact, there is little science fiction in this part of the book. The only aspect of science fiction prevalent in part one of the novel is the fears, hopes and dreams of Ellie Arroway. That sounds interesting, doesn't it?The second part, The Machine, is mostly about the interpretation of the Message. Also this part includes the building of the machine. In this section of the book, it is still very boring. There is a pattern for the chapters in part two. The beginning of the chapter starts with an uninteresting concept or theme in math or science. The middle of the chapter expands on the concept or theme. The beginning and middle of the chapters are dull because of this. The only exciting parts in the chapters occur at the end. They introduce new interesting concepts. One example is the introduction of the idea of the Trojan horse theory. Someone suggests that the machine they are building is a way for the aliens to voyage to earth easily. The problem is that they do not expand on the concepts that I, the reader am interested in. Instead they waste most of each chapter on uninteresting dull concepts that my chemistry teacher would find boring.The third part, The Galaxy, is a very interesting part in the book. I could hardly put the book down. The main reason I liked the third part of the book was the abundance of science fiction. In this part of the book, Ellie and some other scientists are using the machine to travel to Vega. This part of the book deals with technology and perceptions of reality. In the third part of the book, they throw out many new concepts. One example is the \\"space subway\\". The machine that they build allows the people to travel to the center of the galaxy by using a galactic subway. The third part in the book introduces a lot of cool concepts like that. The main reason the third part was the best is because of all the action. There is not much action in the first two parts. In the third, the scientists travel to the center of the Galaxy and also have to prove to everyone that they are not lying. Perceptions of reality play a big role in the third part. People on earth do not believe the Scientists, because the voyage seems to only take the scientists 20 minutes. To the scientists, their adventure takes a day and 20 minutes. The third part of the book was fun to read.Overall, I think it is an okay book. It could have been better if the author had further developed the concepts that I found interesting."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"rating 3.5I have to admit that I enjoyed the movie. I think it is a quite provactive work, from anything more than a simplistic analysis anyway. That probably explains why it didn't make billions of dollars: it wasn't obvious enough nor had enough kill-em-all action.Anyway, the book. The main character Arroway is the same. However she is compelled by far different motivations in the book. She is also not hounded by Drumlin for pursuing a percieved marginal science such as SETI (reflects the time in which the book was written: 1985, when science, especially astronomy was still blessed with the charm to do pure research on the taxpayer dollar and follow such things as SETI- challenger hadn't crashed yet!). The movie obvious takes a different tack, reflecting the harsher realities of now: justifiable science, where dollars must produce results (whether this is right or wrong is never explored in the book, because it isn't an issue). This has skewed the movie in different direction, along with greater knowledge of physics.The book does develop the apprent conflict of science and religion as managified by the message (yes the psychology, philopsophy and the symbolism is reasonably obvious -&gt; more so in the book than movie). In fact this is something the book does delve deeply into. Possibly a little too deeply because it becomes a little preachy in an issue that all of us must decide for ourselves. I can respect however the need to develop this aspect of the story because christianity and science basically underpin (to an ever diminishing extent) western civilization. And provides fertile soil for the battle between them. Yet tangible and active zealotry on both sides is not explored to any great extent, particularly from the religious camp (unlike the movie).The actual physics of the machine and the journey aren't as strong as they could be (the machine, because we're not supposed to understand it anyway...however???). And the interpersonal relationships between the key characters are fairly restrained (reflecting reality). Also the decryption of the message could have been more interesting (compensated by the pi idea however).The main protagonist from the movie, Drumlin doesn't get much of a run here and whatever contact there is between him and Arroway is nothing like the movie. Nor is the backstabbing!I guess you could say that there is a grinding inevitability about the book. There isn't too much in the way of suspence because the plot, though arching and fluctuating like a dampened sine curve, never deviates that much from it's linear path and becomes more supressed toward the linear as the story progresses. It felt obvious at time. Inevitable. You just know what is going to happen (having seen the movie didn't help).I really wanted to like this book. And at times it was wonderful. But it also left me dissastisfied as well. I don't think it reached the heights or depths it could have. But this perhaps reflects the time it was written? However, if you're looking for a deeper version of the movie's plot...you won't get it. They are very dissimilar.Ultimately, I think you have to make a choice: either like the movie and the book or the book or the movie. Accept their differences and avoid comparing the two if you can, thereby enjoying both...if you can't, pick one of the other and completely avoid the one you didn't pick. And enjoy the one you did pick.Prose-wise the book is very well written."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I saw the movie first, which made the book a lot easier to visualize. Although, I would say the movie was better altogether than the book. The book seems a little too drawn out, especially in the end. At times, Sagan seems to drift off and get lost in some minute detail, and he'll spend an entire chapter on it. This may just seem like this to me since I saw the movie first, and it's relatively fast paced.Another thing I think the book lacked that the movie had, was the relationship developed between Ellie and Palmer. In the movie, they develope this love-hate relationship with each other, and in the end I thought they both learned a lot about each other through that. In the book this is almost completely nonexistant.Other than those little things, this book is awesome. It held my attention every time I picked it up. One good thing about reading the book after watching the movie is that you have a picture in your mind of Ellie going through wormholes and the magnificence of the machine itself. Then when you come across these scenes in the book, it's easier for me at least to understand and picture what's going on. Great book. The best depiction of First Contact ever!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"This book arrived in a timely manner and was in excellent condition. I am completely satisfied with this order."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Ellie Arroway is the director of a project that monitors radio telescopes used to detect signs of extraterrestrial life.When a repeating series of prime numbers is detected, Ellie discovers a message--plans for a machine that seats five people. The machine is built and five people (Ellie among them) travel through a series of wormholes. Ellie and her teammates meet beings who suggest the existence of a higher being who created everything.Though the travelers had an experience lasting many hours, when they return to Earth only 20 minutes have passed and no video footage survived the trip. Left with no proof of their experiences, the team members are accused of making up the whole thing."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"OK... I read this book few weeks ago, and I didn't really like this book. After reading all the reviews, I read the book once more, and I still didn't get it. Basically, this book has nothing special. Have you ever read 2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke? The 'Machine' is just like the black monolith which transfers Dave Bowman to... somewhere. Also, the idea of Grand Central Station and extraterrestrial intelligence 'cultivating' the civilization was already mentioned in 2001. This book is not very scientific either: most of the science were written as if they make sense, but in fact only few ideas were explained. The part when the alien(who disguised as Ellie's dad) talks about Beethoven and peace stuff, I couldn't help smiling rather them being overwhelmed by the power of those aliens. It was ridiculous and childish. And why would the aliens want to stay away from us after the Five visited them? The reason I didn't give this book one or two stars is because I liked the finishing part. It was unlike many other science fiction books."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I have read this astounding scientific book by Carl Sagan Contact. It has left me a lot of good impressions about this book. This book is well written and well detailed for many people to read. This book goes over a lot of detail, compared with the movie that came out in the theaters. There are couples of passages in the book that I would like to discuss with everyone. They are as follows: \\"the search for extraterrestrial intelligence-everywhere abbreviated SETI, and except by those who talked somewhat more optimistically about communication with extraterrestrials intelligence (CETI)-was essentially an observing routine, the dull staple for which most of the facility had been built.\\" Page 49, last paragraph. This paragraph talks about the many types of organizations that are designed for searching for extraterrestrials. In the book Dr. Arroway seems to be very involved in keeping up to date from the sponsors of the program and to see that everything is going as scheduled. She's always trying reach for the things that would seem impossible from other people's perspective. One example would be that she always explores every opinion that he could find before she says that something would not work. My second passage: \\"No Ellie, this is endless. After dozen years you will find no sign of anything. You will argue that another Argue facility has to be built at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars in Australia or in Argentina to observe the southern sky. And when that fails, you'll talk about building some parabolic with a free flying feed in Earth orbit so you can get millimeter waves. You'll always be able to think of some kind of observation that hasn't been done. You'll always intent some explanation about why extraterrestrials like to broadcast where we haven't looked.\\" Page 47, 2nd paragraph. In this passage it got really interesting for me, because it went to the heart of the story and the goal that the character is trying to achieve by using more sophisticated and more up to date technology than before. In this passage she always looking for someway of improving her observation and never give up in the process no matter how slim the chances are. When Ellie was little girl she was every much interested in electronics, the functionality of different type radio, and also mathematics. As she grew up she got more and more interested in the career in radio astronomy. As she grew up and got her degree she started looking for a way to communicate with the Alien in the universe. The one thing that I like about this book was the strength of the character in the story, and her ability to push herself to the edge, and try every option that she could think of before going on to the next phase. For my final passage from the book, it talks about one of the most frequent conversation the Dr. Arroway has with the collogues at the work place: \\"there's a chance that dozen of additional dishes might be added to the Very Large Array, and make it into a dedicated SETI observatory. They'd do some of the usual kind of radio Astronomy also; of course, it would be a superb interferometer.\\" Page 50. 2nd paragraph. In this passage it talks about the project named SETI, and how it's developing among the scientific community. In this book it talks about the way SETI would help the community and be able to profit the research for scanning the skies for radio signal that some life form would be broadcasting to the other planets. In this story the word SETI comes up a lot and it represents the beginning research project in radio astronomy. I had a lot of fun reading this book and I was able to obtain a great amount of knowledge. I would recommend people reading this book, and especially to those people that have the academic level of high school and up, and are interested in astronomy. This book would be a book that you would never want to put down and want to continue reading page after page, chapter after chapter."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Carl Sagan was Absolutely one of the greatest minds of out time. He was the only person so far that has expressed a complete understanding of both science and religion truly unambiguously, and with the most comprehensive, nevertheless beautiful poetic voice, a work finer than Cosmos.

The movie was great too."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"What a great way to explore the realms of science fiction! This novel evoked exciting and mystical thoughts in me about the burning question of are we alone in the universe? I enjoyed the part in which Ellie imagined another form of life existed on a certain star looking back at her. I also thought it was a nice twist that the return message from space was a film of Hitler delivering a speech. This book will stimulate the curiousity of those interested in space and the possibility of life on other planets. Keep reaching for those stars and you just may find the answers you've been looking for. Three,two,one,and contact!"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"When I saw the movie Contact, I loved it. After reading the book, I say &quot;its good, but could been better.&quot; The development in both were very good, showing how scientists really are, but the movie do not tells us anything more than 'they are out there'. The book tells more than that. I was terribly dissapointed that a 3 hour movie could not present the impact that the contact had in Ellie. Leaving the movie behind, this book is great! You love and hate the characters and the story is told from a scientist perspective. It can't get more realistic. Beign a scientist I also see this book as an opportunity for non-scientists to feel how we work, and why things are done the way they are done. The conflicts between scientist and non-scientists in the book are seen everyday in real life."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"I'm only a fourteen year old but belive me, you will not want to miss out in reading this book.
