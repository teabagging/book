He went to a great deal of trouble to track the book down and get it for me for Christmas. If he hadn't gone to all the trouble, I would have chunked this in the trash after 2 or 3 pages. More than 800 pages later, I felt like I'd been trapped in a Seinfeld episode (not much happening, but spending a lot of time talking about it) without the laughs. Unfortunately, he bought 2 of her books for me so I also read the book of short stories - The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories - it was marginally better as the stories were short."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"What a great waste of time, and 782 pagers of paper stock. I give the book only 1 star out of respect for an author that can string together that many words. The book would have been a halfway ok at half the number of pages. It's a frustrating read filled with half-baked characters and a story line that does not hold together. But, more importantly, it's such and uninteresting book to read. Unless you have a fetish for 19th century English culture. Otherwise, as a fantasy, it's a dud.

The story is written in a VERY dry, rambling style with ubiquitous footnotes - many of which are almost an entire page long and totally off subject! I waited patiently for the pace to pick up, but it never did. It was only in the last 100 pages of the book that my imagination was finally prodded out of coma-mode. This book is defnitely NOT worth the $30!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I enjoy big fat books, Dickens, fantasy, a wide variety of books of all kinds. Somehow this book was beyond strange, it simply had no point, no tension, it was almost a documentary on 2 made-up magicians in a fantasy world. Worse, I kept expecting it to get better, to go SOMEWHERE with all of this other than just random imaginings with no real connecting theme. After all, so many critics raved about it. So I read about 600 pages before I dumped it in the garbage, a fate that very few of my books ever suffer."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I won't try to write a clever review of this book discussing the range of the characters and so forth. I am going to be honest and straightforward. Simply put, this was a very long, boring book that went off on tangents with footnotes galore. The author might have thought this quaint, but it only added to the tedium. I only mildly enjoyed the last 100 pages of the book and forced myself to finish it.There are many more books out there worth the time and effort, but not this one. Too bad too...the storyline had potential."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I'd read such enthusiastic reviews of this novel that I wondered, as I started to read it, why I wasn't enjoying it more. I persevered until the end of the first part, which at over 200 pages is longer than a lot of complete novels. I just couldn't go on.This is a dry as dust novel about English magicians during the Napoleonic wars. Mr Norrell is a magician who wants to use his magic to help with the war effort, but finds himself using his magic to restore a dead young woman to life. Then he finds that she has fallen into the power of the Fairy folk, as has her black manservant. I suppose one eventually gets to find out what will happen to the lady and her servant, but I just couldn't be bothered to wade through another 600 pages.I did not find the characters or the plot at all interesting. The men are dull, the women insipid, the plot boring.If you want to read a really fun novel about magic in the Regency period, I recommend 'Sorcery and Cecelia' by Patricia C. Wrede and Caroline Stevermer, it's a lot more fun than this."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Possibly the best thing I have read in years. The prose are quite wonderful.

But in my many years of reading, it is plainly the most boring book I have ever read. That list of boring books includes many of the so-called classics we were forced to read in grade school. I kept trying. I got three-fourths of the way through when I gave up. The footnotes did not bother me too much, I have seen that happen in some very good textbooks and classics. It was just that nothing much happened. There would be something happened and some 100 pages of nothing much. Just a lot of \\"explanatory\\" text. I am sorry, because I wanted it to be good. Even the characters were boring. Mr. Strange was somewhat interesting, but that did not help much. As far as I am concerned, it could have been half as long, and been a much better book. If you enjoy long expositions of society and life and how magic is not around, then you will enjoy the book. Otherwise, skip it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I found this book to be very good bedside reading. Normally when I read a book I MUST read it cover to cover. I lose sense of time and space and immerse myself into the world I am reading. I was unable to do that with this book. I found it very easy to pick up and (more importantly) to put down.I thought it was written in a very dry style that reminds me of books written in a bygone England. As that is the main setting of the book, might have been the idea. I, however, found it tedious. However, I did enjoy reading the 'footnotes' scattered throughout the book. Many of them were mini-stories in themselves.I would recommend first checking it out from the library before buying it to ensure that the writing style is one that you enjoy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell brings magic back to England in the early 1800s. Mr. Norrell is an eccentric gentleman appearing out of what seems like nowhere to show the self-proclaimed magicians of York that he is the one true practical magician in England. From York, he travels to London to introduce as many as people as possible to his abilities and the revived practice of magic. Enter Jonathan Strange who has also proved himself adept at practicing magic. Norrell fears Strange to be an enemy and competetor, but soon keeps his enemy close by taking him on as a pupil. What ensues is a facinating work of losely based historical fiction that explores the allegorical history of magic and a wonderful story of how the magic was applied.Despite being almost 800 pages long, this book is a page turner from start to finish. Toward the end I read even slower in order to savor every word. Additionally, it is a smart read that entertains as well as seems to educate along the way. On top of the magical entertainment, this debut novel addresses love, master/servant relationships, social hierarchy, war, friendship, and loyalty. Susanna Clarke has done an amazing job with this first work and I cannot wait to see what she turns out next."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I'm a fast reader; except where history books are concerned.Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell really is a history book -or an alternative history - of England. Here is where magic and magicians have a place amongst some of Britians historical figures, like the Duke of Wellington.It is also a social comedy along the lines of Jane Austen's novels and the classic British series Upstairs, Downstairs.Ms. Clarke infuses the novel with extraordinary detail with tons of footnotes -most of them very humorous - and characters that jump off the page.It took me a long time to read this book, and I waited until the paperback came out to take it up. I knew - at 845 pages - it was going to take an effort to fully understand her intentions, and I so hate dragging a thick hardcover around.I was also aware of the mixed bag of reviews this book got when it came out over a year ago, so I'm sure this was also part of the reason it took so long. As much as I try to be partial after hearing a review of a book I want to read, sometimes as I read a book, those thoughts crowd into my brain.Anyway, it is worth the read as far as I'm concerned. It packs a lot of information in its 845 pages, including poking fun at Harry Potter and reminding me why I love British humor.And its not a many \\"fantasy\\" novel that could easily crossover into the history section of your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell tells the story of two magicians who come to power just as the forces of magic return to England (Between 1807 and 1817). Mr. Norrell is a aging, dull, stingy scholar of magic and practical magician; he has been holed up at his estate, Hurtfew Abbey, for nearly all of his adult life, until an argument with a magical society in York entices himself to make himself useful to the English government.Jonathan Strange never intended to be anything but independently wealthy, or a \\"gentleman\\" as they would say. But boredom and a prophecy from a London street-tramp turn his interest towards the magical arts. Mr. Norrell hears about this young upstart magician, and takes him on as a pupil.All goes well for a time - but Mr. Norrell is an extremely secretive man, and cannot trust any one enough to share all that he knows about magic, and so Jonathan Strange must strike out on his own.This is threatening to Mr. Norrell for many reasons - his incredible ego cannot take it - how could Strange ever leave him? But what is more troublesome is that Norrell is hiding a dark secret - one that could damage English Magic for good.If you enjoy reading any of the following: Fantasy novels, historical fiction, a good love story, a novel with: characters that walk a fine line between good and evil, that resembles Jane Austen, Anthony Trollope, or any other Victorian author of social comedies, a good war story, or evil men who meet fates worse than death, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I was rather intimidated by this audiobook, which comes on 26 CDs. It was slow to start, but it intrigued me, so I kept going. I'm glad I did, though I didn't feel like the ending finally wrapped up as much as it should: I had hoped it would explain more about how things came to be as they were at the beginning. Regardless, I enjoyed its rather rambling story with its engaging characters, moments of laugh-out-loud humor, fanciful footnotes of magical history, and magical descriptions of magic. And the narrator did an excellent job of bringing it all to life, with distinctive voices for each major character."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I can think of other books I've read that were more thought-provoking, more multilayered, more \\"important\\". But I'm hard pressed to think of any that were more enjoyable. \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" is 800 pages of sheer delight.Susanna Clarke spins an enormous tale of magicians, fairies, and Napoleanic battles and weaves them together like one big wonderful magic spell. Strange and Norrell are magnificient characters, vivid and three-dimensional: two men who need each other badly, even when there's no one else in the world they'd prefer to avoid more. There are wonderful discoveries to be had and fascinating inferences to be mad (such as the true, unspoken identity of \\"the Raven King\\").But what's most surprising about the book is how realistically (or at least reasonably) it depicts magic. You can't help thinking that if magic really existed, this is very much the history it might have. Even the footnotes provide entertainment, sometimes melding ironically with the text that follows, as if the characters were reading the footnotes right along with us.In terms of glee and sheer scope, I'm reminded of Pynchon's \\"Mason & Dixon\\". But this book is much more fun and, not incidentally, a lot less work. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Both my husband and I were captivated by this story! We listened to it on audio CD, which for me, made all of the footnotes easier to bear. (I don't know if I could deal with jumping back in forth between the footnotes and the story in the book version) We loved the story and it kept our interest to the very end."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I used to say that no book should be longer then 300 pages, and that even a good 500 hundred pages book can turn into a great one in the hands of the right editor. However this book changed my mind, i wouldn't change a word or leave a chapter out of it, even though it is very long.It felt at time that this book was written especially for me, since it combined 3 genres I love - Jane Austin period novel, fantasy that's involves a twisted version of this world, like Phillip Pullman's \\"his dark material\\" or harry potter and books about magic, like \\"the history of magic\\" by Alihpas Levy or \\"the book or black magic\\" by Edward White (in parts of it it was even a book of magic, but you'll have to read the first few chapters to know what the difference is between books of magic and books about magic).I loved the pace of it, the way the plot very slowly develops over time, the way that though most of the character aren't very likable and all have many faults, you do get very attached through reading, Sussana clarke sense of humor and wit made me burst in laughter in very strange public places and i got very observed in reading.My test of a good book's what left with me after the plot's done, and I think this book showed me a few very interesting point concerning being a magician, being honest and finding a person's original way through life and his \\\\ her art.This addition's very beautiful it's probably one of the most handsome books i own, the design's minimalist and pretty, the paper's really superb and the uneven pages cut's amazing, however since i read mostly on the bus, it was quite a load to carry for a month and a half and nothing else fits in my backpack. However, it was so worth it!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It's London at the turn of the 19th century. Governement ministers in powdered wigs argue about how best to defeat Napoleon on the continent. London socialites shop for the latest fashions and fill the city with whispered gossip. Servents polish silver and stay in the kitchen. The roads are muddy, and the countryside is perpetually wet, cold, and filled with dark and twisting trees. Enter Mr. Norrell, a fuddy-duddy extraordinaire who, it seems, is a capable \\"practicing,\\" and not just \\"theoretical\\" magician. Along with his dodgy servant Childermass, he seeks fame in London as a \\"professional\\" magician, something not seen in England in many hundreds of years. He soon encounters Jonathan Strange, a gentleman whose lack of knowledge about magic is surpassed only by both his natural talent for it and his obsession to rediscover the dangerous English magic of the great Raven King of the past.With this set-up, Susanna Clarke has written a unique work of fiction. As noted in the title of my review, it is 1/4 fantasy and 3/4 Jane Austen, a fact which might surprise some readers looking for a more traditional work of fantasy. The practice of magic is merely the backdrop for the story, not its essence. Rather, dry humor is the order of the day, and Clarke has an ear for it. A great example is when Strange confronts a dislikable social outcast in a tense scene, threatens to transform him by magic, and then yells \\"Abracadabra!\\" and falls down laughing as the man shrieks in fear from this phony \\"magic.\\" Very funny. This was the main pleasure of the book for me: a story concerning magic that read like a witty upstairs-downstairs Victorian comedy of manners. The characters (and there are a lot of them), are fully fleshed-out (as much as a Victorian can be fleshed-out), and their actions are not undertaken to serve the plot. Rather, they act like they, as characters, would act, and this is very gratifying. The relationship between Norrell and Strange, which obviously drives the narrative, is particularly well done.That said, the book is long, and sometimes felt needlessly so to me. I was not always compelled to read it. There are a lot of interesting narrative lines which do not seem to lead anywhere, such as the shopkeeper in love with Stephen Black (a prominent character). There were a few chapters of this story, and then \\"poof,\\" like magic it was gone. Further, while the many invented footnotes are a nice touch, they are sometimes a bit tedious and I'm not sure its necessary to insert multi-page footnotes just for atmosphere.In sum, however, Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is a fine book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is written in a unique and fascinating voice, inhabits a fully-detailed world, and tells a great story. Not five-star worthy, but definately a solid four-star effort that will repay your time in reading it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"To compare this book to the Harry Potter books does it a disservice. Quite simply, this book is the best fantasy novel since Tolkien.The characters are deep, complex, and believable. But despite the fact that the book is character-driven, there is a sense all the way through the book that they are careening towards some unavoidable fate.The author uses \\"fake\\" footnotes to give a sense of verisimilitude. In this respect, it is very similar to something by Borges (who also used this literary device).She adeptly weaves her characters into early nineteenth century English history.By the time I hit the last 200 pages I could not put the book down."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is beautiful to read. Many others authors have forgotten how to write something that is wonderful to read on each and every page. You still want to read further and find out what happens, but each single page is enjoyable and great to read. The plot is subtle and consuming. I found this a nice change to books that are so driven to a climax, that creating ambience and good, strong characters is often overlooked. I would suggest this book to anyone who loves to read, for the sake of reading itself. You will find this book enjoyable and surprising. I loved the book and I felt a twinge of sadness when I finished, because I had to say goodbye to the world the book the author had created."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I found this 800-page monster of a book in a NY Times (or something of the sort) bestseller shelf in my local bookstore and I asked myself . . . how could a book with this heft end up there. And its about 2 magicians who lived during the Napoleonic Wars that's written in a style that only a Jane Austen/Dickens fanatic would love. There must be something to this book . . . I thought.If you are a Jane Austen or Charles Dickens fan (or like myself, a person who has been reading Regency Romances since she was 12) and you also love fantasy (which I do although I only use the term \\"fantasy\\" because there are \\"faerie\\" elements in this book-- like some of the reviewers say--this book cannot be pinned to any single genre), and you DON'T have the attention span of a sandwich . . . then THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU!I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the \\"practical\\" side of magic. For example, Jonathan Strange in an effort to help the British win the war against the French, would move churches, and towns and make rivers flow in another direction but he could not be bothered to return them to their original state . . thus gaining the ire of the displaced townspeople and confusing mapmakers for decades to come.The writing is witty. The footnotes are droll. (If the author fleshed out the footnotes, they would make entertaining stories by themselves.) There are many characters but each one has a destiny to fulfill. The narrative was smooth. Imagination . . . boundless. And there's a pinch of horror too--here and there. In places you don't expect them to be.If I could string 2 sentences together . . . this would be the book I'd write."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Really, really good. I dislike the \\"Harry Potter for grownups\\" blather, because it's like comparing apples and oranges. True that it's darker than Harry, but it's also downright quirky in places, without becoming annoying. I found myself believing that the history was real, even to the point of thinking about it as I went through my day, as though I'd have to remember some of the facts for an exam or something. The footnotes are DENSE and would form a novel themselves. They make it very fun to read. It honestly took me awhile to get rolling on this book, and rightly so. At 800 pages, it's a daunting thing to lug around with you, let alone try to prop up on your chest as you read in bed late into the night. Brew a pot of tea, find a comfortable chair, and give it a try. The other reviewers are correct; the action doesn't explode off of the page the entire time, but you find yourself not caring so much. At its heart, the characters are real and engaging, and I found myself hating to leave them when I finished. If \\"intellectual fantasy\\" appeals to you, if I can call it that, this won't be a waste of your time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is a big thick book, with a very complete and wittily drawn world. It's basically an \\"alternative history,\\" set in early 19th-century England, but an England in which a former half-fairy king is accepted as part of the past the way we accept that Alfred the great existed.You'll enjoy this more if you've read Austen, Sterne and other eighteenth and nineteenth century writers, because Clarke has caught the style to a t-- even with archaic spelling. But the story moves along at an excellent pace.There is real magic at work-- it's delightful when Strange, one of the magicians (and at first, a student to the stuffy but rather dear, though pompous, Mr. Norrell) works for Wellington and ends up creating enchanted roads and moving Brussells around in order to confound the French, for example.Another lovely element of the book is the whole other world of Faerie. If you listen to old ballads you'll see that that world is often a very frightening, sad place, and so it is in this book-- the \\"gentleman with the thistle-down hair\\" is charming, funny and altogether amoral and bloodthirsty. Being stolen away to his world of \\"lost-hope\\" is to be forced to participate in dreary balls and processions-- part of the joke is that their dreariness and the humans' response to them is utterly missed by the Gentleman, who can only perceive that it must delight them as it delights him. The sad bells and mournful tunes of Faerie contribute to the atmosphere.The invention of John Unksglass, the legendary Raven King, is so convincing you find yourself forgetting at times that no such history existed.The ending disappointed me a little bit, but perhaps it means there's room for a sequel?Altogether a charming book. It really isn't \\"Harry Potter for adults\\" stylistically, but like that book, the book tells of the education of magicians. Wholly original and entertaining."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It is a bit reductionism to call the great \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" a Harry-Potter-for-grown-ups -- albeit marketing smart, this strategy diminishes Susanna Clarke's talent and skills. Her novel is much more than Harry Potter, albeit both are excellent books in their purposes. The size may bring fear to some readers, but those who don't care their reading being big will certainly find a lot in this novel.To begin with, there is more than one single plot, but in the end they all come together. The main story follows to magicians, Mr Norrell and Jonathan Strange, throughout the course of ten years or so. Gilbert Norrell is a Yorkshire magician arrives in London with the aim of rehabilitate the reputation of English magic. After a couple of events, he becomes famous and soon the young and impetuous Jonathan Strange arranges to study with Mr Norrell. But later, after helping in the Napoleonic wars the two magicians will find themselves competing against each other. At the same time, John Uskglass -- a sort of King of the magic and other worlds -- is back to claim the throne of England.At some points, Clarke's text reads like the m&eacute;lange of Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Ann Radcliffe and J. K. Rowling. And this mix delivers perfectly. Of Austen she brings the society watching quality, describing meetings, people and their attitudes with humor -- sometimes black-- and irony. Her dickensian element makes social observation -- mostly of the XIX Century society strata-- plus Radcliffe's gothic elements. From Rowling, of course, there is magic.But Clarke is a writer of attitude therefore, one can notice some references in \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" --some intentional, and others not -- the reader can also notice the writer has a voice of her own. She writes like her novel was an old book. The most strange thing is the spelling, the use of \`chuse' for \`choose' or \`shewed' for \`showed'. These devices only enhances the pleasure of the book, that while strange is still amazing, because sometimes we are so immersed in the narrative that we don't even notice these archaic spellings.To make the novel looks like non-fiction she brings footnotes from time to time -- some longer than one page, some are a story of their own. Most of them read like a parody to scholar material, what make them very funny. And sometimes she ironies even the novel format. A character, for instance, says he despises novels. Those who a different from him, and immerse themselves in this huge novel will never forget it. And the bad part is when it is over we start missing Jonathan, Mr Norrell, Mrs Strange and even Drawlight."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is best described as a fantasy history. Suppose there were magicians aiding the Duke of Wellington in his battles against Napoleon? There are also several subplots including one about a particularly malevolent fairy.The book is well worth reading, and will especially appeal to fans of fantasy. It has been well-described as \\"Harry Potter for adults.\\" I would suggest it for adults not because of cautions about language, sex or violence. There is no bad language, no sex and less violence than in the Harry Potter books.My concern for both children and adults is the book's pacing. The pace of the novel is frustratingly slow. It is not so much the footnotes (which are often delightful) as the author's style. The book is 800 pages and seemed longer. It would be a better book if it had been more tightly edited and been published at 600 pages."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I never write a review unless I like a book very, very much. As my mother taught me, if you can't say anything good, keep your trap shut. Well, mother, I really enjoyed reading this book. Ms. Clarke has to be a real smart lady to write such a detailed book about a non-existent subject. She almost convinces me that practical magic really did exist in Englandand that Norrell and Strange were the preeminent practitioners. Too bad Peter Sellers is no longer with us as he would be a prototype Norrell and I can see Peter O'Toole as Strange searching the moors for Arabella, enchanted by the man with thistledown hair. Great stuff!! Being a Welshman (we're naturally humorous, you know.), I found this book highly entertaining and hated to see it end. I hope there is a sequel and that it doesn't take 10 years for Ms. Clarke to write it!!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book will really appeal to people who enjoy early nineteenth century British literature (Bronte, Byron, Shelley, Keats, Rosetti...etc. The Romantics for the most part). A lot of reviewers have been comparing it to Harry Potter, but I think it has more in common with those writers. Byron even shows up in this book as a character for a while.This book is very detailed and I really enjoyed all the footnotes that delve into the specifics of magical history. It was written with such authority that I believed it, even though it was all the author's creation.The Napoleonic War chapters (the British use magic to beat Napoleon) were ok, but I was more interested in the bits that had to do with Faerie and the Raven King. The pseudo-history was interesting, but the magical history was superb.This book does take some time and dedication, but I think it is worth it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I just finished reading this book. To my great delight, it's neither \\"Harry Potter for adults,\\" nor a Lord of the Rings clone.Then what is it? It's a beautifully written, witty, and enchanting tale. It's full of deep and interesting characters, it's full of imaginative little anecdotes and fables, and it's full of adventure. There is more imagination and detail in this book than could possibly fit within its 800 pages, and so I can only suspect that it has been enhanced by the subtle use of magic that its main characters are more than capable of. So no, it isn't Harry-Potter-like, or Tolkien-like.However, if you dislike footnotes, be warned, for there are many of them, and they can reach impressive lengths. Similarly, if your attention span is only a couple of seconds long, then maybe Harry Potter is more suitable to your taste: In Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, not every chapter ends in a cliffhanger. It is a compliment to the author's skill that no such cheap tricks are needed, and that the story is engaging and involving despite its (initially) leisurely pace.This book is hyped up to be THE book of the year (or last year), and having read it, I am quite willing to believe it. Don't hesitate to pick up a copy of Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Three days ago I finished reading Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norell (staying up until 3 and skipping some of the footnotes). For two days I wandered about missing the characters, replaying scenes and seeing their world more clearly than mine, until, like vivid dreams do, they lost their sharpness and turned back into people from a book.Like a dream too, filled with sudden diversions and turnings, the book mixes scenes of humaneness with the ugly and cruel. In fact, at first I feared I'd found a story brilliant in its setup of a magical England, perfect in its form - with writing that perfectly mimicked early 19th century literature, but with characters that I simply didn't care about. Then young (funny, hopeful) Jonathan Strange joined the story and I kept reading. But still I mistrusted the book until I realized that the author had not only created a world for us to look in on, but she had also created a world view, a syntax, through which to view it. And it was part of that perspective to experience a distrust and jadedness and to gradually warm to other voices who at first appear arrogant, weak, furtive, or greasy.At the end we see the two magicians as specks in the eye of their creator, their movements directed like puppets; but such human puppets we anyway must care for them. It made me laugh to realize this, and I felt that indeed my reading, my freedom to judge the book, had been directed by a puppet master too, a clever and gentle-handed one."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I would recommend the audio version of this book. The narrator is one of the best I've heard and he makes the book fly by. There are many lengthy footnotes in the book, which could be confusing while listening to - but the narrator handles them in a way so you don't lose track of the action. I later bought the book to see the illustrations and re-read my favorite parts."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I enjoy long novels that I actually have to read because I don't want to race through a book in two days. This book could be a bit tedious at times and I found myself counting the pages I had left as another reviewer did :). But I loved the book overall.Strange is quite a character and you root for him and his quest. You want him to succeed and you feel sorry for him when bad things happen. Mr. Norell is a bit stuffy and self-righteous but you come to love him too.The plot is played out through the whole book and while you might wonder once in a while what a particular chapter has to do with the book, it might actually be important later so pay attention. There are also little tid bits of information that seem triffle and they are important later - when the reader will know what is going on but not the characters. The supporting cast of the book was well written and you seldom got confused on who was who.The seperate chapters are short and nice so you can stop once in a while. The footnotes are okay - I could have done without them sometimes. Sometimes the footnotes were funny and helpful and other times I thought the footnotes were pointless. I think that she could have done without the footnotes and included the stories right in the text.This is not the next Harry Potter although I loved that series; this book does not move with that same pace. It is more historical fiction but has this fantastical element in 18th century England.The ending was a bit sad but I see hope for Mr. and Mrs. Strange in the future.If you want to take time and read a well put together story - then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"What a spectacular read. the story is intricate and exciting. I particularly loved the crafty stories buried in the foot notes. I can't believe that this book held my attention so thoroughly. The only negative is that I sprained my back lugging it around."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is phenomenal. It is witty, it is inventive, it is imaginative, and it sucks you into the world so much that you come out of it half-thinking that this all really happened, at one time or another. It is absolutely extraordinary, although to some it might be a little slow-paced. The story is absolutely overwhelming with an ending to die for! There is good, evil, love, hate, magic (which is described with utter accuracy and visual ease), wit, character (a great variety of delights!), fairies, magicians, gentlemen, soldiers, Indians(!), and much more that could not possibly be described well enough without reading the book. The subtexts give the story extreme depth and add quite a bit of fun to the experience of English magic, since we are, of course, ignorant to much of the first dealings with fairies and such. Clarke is so kind as to put it all down without taking away from the main story. In fact it adds so much to the plot through understanding the backstories of various things, that it makes this more than just a novel, but a textbook on magic history in England. Excellent. I should be surprised if I am ever able to read a better book in decades to come."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"A very charming book, written in the style of Jane Austin. The pace is fairly slow but the writing is so clever and polished that you'll want to read the book slowly (or even better, read it aloud.) The footnotes are a little distracting at times, and the ending is a little too pat; still, this is a gem."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I knew this day would come....I knew that one day, I would turn the page and find that there were no more words...I remember, like other reviewers, many times where I checked to see how many pages I had left....not because I wanted to be rid of them but because I worried their numbers grew too few...My only solace is that a sequel of sorts will be written.Jonathon Strange & Mr. Norrell stared at me from the bookshelf in every bookstore I encountered. I would pick it up, open it to a random page and find a spattering of seemingly dull dialogue. I would put it neatly back upon the shelf and walk on. Still I couldn't shake the feeling that I was missing something good. Almost as an afterthought, I picked it up cheap at Walmart. From the very first page, I recognized that Clarke is a master at her craft....imagine, this is only her first novel!This isn't a novel that is easily sorted into a particular genre. I've seen it placed in fantasy and fiction, and it won the Hugo award...most commonly awarded to works of science fiction. Yet most people have come close to describing Clarke's style when they compare her to Austen and Dickens. Clarke weaves a meandering tale over the social fabric of old England. Yet, in using the word meandering, a very positive connotation is intended. Clarke employs a series of long footnotes that work to secure the reality that she creates and foreshadow events in the tale. I've never read a fantasy novel that created a world and system as believable and concrete as Clarke's.True, this isn't a novel for the thrill-a-minute type. I dare say, however, that this is because Clarke has created something that truly lives up to the label of high art. As good as Tolkien's books may be, and as much as he may be the father of the fantastic, Clark has achieved something more difficult...hers is an exercise in wit and subtlety.In fact, JS & MN is humorous and witty from the very first page. In an interview, Clarke says that her favorite author is Austen; I dare say that Austen would look quite favorably upon the way Clarke uses the social fabric of her society to invoke irony and wit.At the same time, the plot itself is higly suspenseful to those that enjoy a good tale about human nature. Others have already written enough about the details of the plot, and as with any movie or novel, I always contend that one is best off not knowing any of the specifics of the plot. Be it enough to say that Clarke juggles a wide array of characters and subplots with such skill that it seems IMPOSSIBLE that this is her first novel.Finally, Clarke's general use of language is simply enchanting. She has a way of describing scenes that breath life into them. She is one of those rare writers that know precisely which couple of details will allow an entire picture to unfold in the mind of the reader.I could write a good deal longer in praise of this book, but A) others have done just that and B) I would undoubtedly repeat myself. Suffice it to say, I don't understand why this book isn't better known. Sure, literary publications cried for joy at its coming, but every person I've mentioned it to (at least 20 and counting) has never even heard of it. I can only hope that the book gains recognition through word of mouth, because it deserves to be an absolute classic. Upon finishing the tale of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, I have determined one thing: Whether Ms. Clarke decides to write about cherry pits or the anatomy of giraffes, I will read every word she publishes."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I wrote a huge, long, extremely well thought-out review... but stupid me wrote it directly into my browser and it didn't post correctly... so here's the second (and much abridged) edition:JS & MN is perhaps the most intriguing and detailed representation of a fantasy setting I have ever encountered. The quality of the prose was extremely well suited to the subject matter as well, adding to the book's over quality -- that is, of a historical/literary telling of two powerful (but very different) magicians in Britain's past.All that said, I had a love/hate relationship with this book. It was masterfully written, and both characters (Strange and Norrell) were complex, sophisticated, and well-crafted. One was significantly more delightful than the other. Having a less-than-likable protagonist might irk some readers, although it didn't bother me.The \\"hate\\" side of my relationship (yes, I said relationship) with this book is that it was a very (veeery) long. Too long. It was also a book that demanded your full attention while reading it. At times I wished I that could stop reading it, yet I couldn't, because it really is worth it. I suppose it's like climbing a particularly steep and rocky cliff face - very challenging and very rewarding... just be sure you're in the right frame of mind before you start to climb!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I was afraid that, at it's size, this book would be overly pedantic, but I was surprised to find that it was actually relatively engaging. This is a hard one to rate, really, because it doesn't fall into the star category very well. It IS engaging but the story sometimes seemed to take a while to get where it was going. I think I'd give it three and a half stars. The characters are well-developed and sympathetic, the story is interesting, honest, and believeable. I got a bit annoyed at the somtimes full-page footnotes, and the sometimes rambling plotline, but for the most part, I found the book entertaining and quite readable. Rarely does the story pick you up and carry you with it (I was usually not that upset if I got interrupted, and I didn't stay up til all hours reading as I have done with other books) but it is a good, well thought out, entertaining story."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The term \\"thaumatomane\\" is referenced in Chapter 28 of Clarke's novel as coming from Samuel Johnson's \\"Dictionary of the English Language\\". It means \\"a person possessed of a passion for magic and wonders\\". This book is for those special, patient thaumatomanes who are bibliophiles with a refined sense of humor and who like to linger and savor the descriptive, literary alchemy in Clarke's prose, even when magic isn't the immediate topic at hand... and don't mind an occasional wandering into sub-stories. Many reviews have already given the general storyline, so I won't repeat that here. What I will focus on is the unusual, mysterious nature of the magic that Clarke portrays. When she was asked whether she believed magic really exists, she said: \\"The answer would have to be no. The magic in Strange & Norrell is purely literary. It's not based on the work of actual magicians of the time. (I read a book about eighteenth/nineteenth-century occult scholarship recently; it was very dull and rather hard to follow.).\\" Although it is true that the magic is only literary, there are short references to real historical figures who are implied to be magicians. For example, in a footnote on consulting dead magicians as a magical procedure, the Raven King supposedly had conversations with Merlin, the Witch of Endor, Moses and Aaron, Joseph of Arimathea and \\"other venerable and ancient magicians\\". Also, reference is made in a couple places to Valentine Greatrakes who, in reality, was an Irish healer who toured England in 1666 and cured people by the laying on of hands. Aside from these references, genuine historical figures such as Wellington, Napoleon, and Lord Byron play more notable, non-magical roles.In addition to the genuine historical figures that make an appearance, a genuine occult item does as well: the Marseilles Tarot deck. Childermass, steward to Norrell, owns a crude, self-created version of one that he occasionally uses for \\"fortune telling\\" to the dislike of Norrell who, strangely, despises them and actually believes that the future cannot be predicted. In fact, what Norrell has in common with theoretical magicians such as Segundus and Honeyfoot is the lack of belief in prophecies which they associate with charlatans. Yet, interestingly, both Norrell and Strange are essential parts of a prophecy (and spell!) of the Raven King, the founder of English magic! What makes the story even more interesting as well as comical is that Vinculus, a street \\"sorcerer\\" and charlatan who is despised by Norrell, apparently has the only magical book written by the Raven King and can quote the King's prophecies by heart. Significantly, it is Vinculus who plays the crucial yet seemingly haphazard role of introducing Jonathan Strange to magic as a profession.The magic in the novel is mysteriously, fantastically, even humorously portrayed (For example, in 1138, the Raven King himself is reputed to have caused the moon to disappear from the sky and travel through all the lakes and rivers of England. Hmmm... how big did they think the moon was back then? Perhaps some of the magic was illusory, like our modern-day legerdemain, but who knows.) Relocating landscapes (including buildings, towns, troops, etc.) is learned more quickly than other feats which some may think should be easier. Fairies (feet tall, not inches) have an influential, magical role. According to Richard Chaston (1620 - 95; yes, he's fictional), \\"men and fairies both contain within them a faculty of reason and a faculty of magic. In men reason is strong and magic is weak. With fairies it is the other way round: magic comes very naturally to them, but by human standards they are barely sane.\\" This footnote occurs in Chapter 25, over 200 pages into the novel. It partially explains why Strange later tries to use madness to contact a fairy. The influential role fairies play is seen in the fact that the Englishman John Uskglass (later known as \\"The Raven King\\") learned magic from fairies after he was stolen as a child and taken to Faerie (a.k.a. \\"The Other Lands\\" by magicians) where he eventually became a powerful leader. According to Strange, the Raven King is the most mysterious of the Mediaeval AUREATE (Golden Age) magicians. He came out of Faerie to establish his kingdom of Northern England some time ago, then several centuries later he \\"departed\\" (Norrell says \\"abandoned\\") England in 1434, going who-knows-where and leaving the influence and practice of English magic in decline.Scattered throughout the book, especially in the footnotes, are details regarding the Raven King and magicians/magic in general. One learns that magicians only applied themselves to writing books when magic was already in decline (the AUREATE magicians learned their magic experientially and with the help of fairies, not books). The AUREATE magicians included, along with the Raven King, Thomas Godbless, Ralph Stokesey, and Catherine of Winchester. Martin Pale (1485 - 1567) was the last of the AUREATES and he was tutored by Catherine of Winchester, a student of the Raven King, 200 years AFTER her death. Next in practical magic's decline came the ARGENTINE (Silver Age) magicians who were scholars first, magicians second. Some of the names given for these include Thomas Lanchester (1518 - 90), Jacques Belasis (1526 - 1604), Nicholas Goubert (1535 - 78), and Gregory Absalom (1507 - 99). When exactly practical magic left England isn't entirely clear, although the first thing a student of magic learns is that there are books OF magic, written before magic ended in England, and books ABOUT magic, written later. Norrell's 19th century claim-to-fame was that he's a genuine practical magician, not a theoretical one like every other so-called magician of his time. It is he who hoards all the books OF magic which forces Strange to learn practical magic primarily the way the AUREATES did: through experience. In fact, before Norrell decides to accept Strange as an apprentice, he is fascinated by a magical act performed by Strange who isn't entirely sure how he did it!The book implies that the greatest magic (used by the Raven King and some if not all of the other AUREATES) is innovative and rooted in a type of nature mysticism where natural objects like trees, stones, water, sky and even birds (incl. ravens, of course) can speak and be spoken to as spirits in a mystical way to form alliances, something that the rationalistic and book-dependent Norrell calls \\"mystical nonsense\\". Norrell can do some startling things, but how much of his magic is really based on his own innovations and alliances rather than those of others via books? \\"Shape-changing\\" is also mentioned as something generally employed by the AUREATES during their travels in Faerie or other lands beyond England, but it isn't given prominence in the book. It is said, however, that the AUREATES were aware of its liability to abuses.Norrell, unlike Strange, has animosity towards the Raven King, partially because he failed to magically make contact with him in his early years. Also, he doesn't like the idea of depending on fairies or the King to do magic, although he depends on magical books and secretly summons a fairy via a book (which becomes a nuisance to others throughout the remainder of the novel) to raise Lady Pole from the dead so he can make a name for himself as the one who will restore practical magic to England.Clarke has revealed some of the literary magicians that inspired her own. Included are the magicians in C. S. Lewis's Narnia stories, although she says her closest model was Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea stories. She liked the idea of a magician with no name such as Earthsea's magician: \\"the Grey Mage of Paln, whose magic was so dubious, his name was forgotten\\" and the magician in The Lord of the Rings, \\"right at the very end, who comes out of Mordor to do battle against our heros and no one knows his name because he himself has forgotten it.\\" However, since she wasn't sure what to do with a major character with no name, the Raven King \\"acquired more names than most people\\" such as John Uskglass, The Black King, the King of the North, and the fairy name no one can pronounce. Although Clarke doesn't mention Edward Bulwer-Lytton's magical English novel Zanoni (published in 1824) as an influence, I wouldn't be surprised if she read it since it involves two different-natured magicians like Norrell and Strange, both with longevity of life like the Raven King. I can see a few very general similarities between it and her novel.A movie of Clarke's magical tome is under production. Unlike Le Guin who didn't have much of a say in how the Earthsea movie turned out, Clarke has a hand in producing her book-based movie. I look forward to it and consider Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell one of my favorite novels."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Enjoyable book, written in a very interesting style.

Yes, I know that not everyone will find it awesome and I respect that, but for me AWESOME hardly describes how I feel, I found it that good. Let me attempt to explain. By nature, I am not someone who appreciates magic or the fantasy genre with a few exceptions that I read as a child such as The Chronicles of Narnia. I haven't read Harry Potter or seen the movies because I just don't get into the sorcerer thing. I rarely feel motivated to pick up a 1,000 page book. Although I like books set in merry, olde England they don't impress me anymore than say, a book set in Laos or Bermuda. So, what amazed me about this book?First, of all, I loved Clarke's writing style. The use of a select few olde English words and spellings such as chuse, surprize, faerie were just enough to sprinkle a magical olde feeling over the book but not used to frequently to become a chore to read. Her style was easy, but yet charming. I don't think I hardly read the entire first page before I was interested, and only a couple pages in before I knew I would finish the book.Secondly, the plot was not formulaic or contrived like so much modern fiction. I never guessed right once about what would happen next. This was a book that was a pleasure to read. Yes, there were a few murders and ghastly deeds but they weren't dwelt on nor were they the focal point of the story. It was nice to read a book that wasn't full of horrors, that was an escape like fantasy should be. I always looked forward to reading my chapter-a-day.Thirdly, along similar lines, I appreciated Strange's code of honor that he could use magic to kill someone, but that a gentlemen wouldn't, so he wouldn't. Magic wasn't used in a petty way by Strange.I'm sure I could go on and on about what I loved, but this review is already much longer than I intended. Last thought: If this book would have been 2,000 pages it wouldn't have been too long. It is the first 1,000 page book I read that I didn't want to end. .7.5 Stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"If you want a totally engrossing lengthy novel, you will really enjoy this book. The world building is excellent and the story telling is well organized and thoughtful. It can be a bit slow sometimes, but in general I found the book wonderfully enjoyable."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Britain is, for lovers of literature, a magical place. Its history of poets and wordsmiths tangles back to time out of mind, conjuring images that exceed its small area and population. But if you read recent Brit Lit, it has a distinct atmosphere of discouragement about it. So when English author Susanna Clarke recaptures pre-Victorian times in a heroic fantasy, we know exactly what she means when a character asks: \\"Why is there no more magic done in England?\\"Clarke tells a story that delves into two worlds at once. Her plot, stripped of the language in which she clothes it, tells of two men, wanderers outside their time. Gilbert Norrell is a collector, an introvert, a man with his head in the clouds. Jonathan Strange, who first apprentices to Norell before they descend into rivalry, is eminently practical, a man of the people. And both of them happen to be wizards, with power unmatched in Britain since time of myth.But Clarke doesn't strip the story of its language. The events of her story don't just happen; they happen in a very specific context. Hers is the world of Jane Austen and Laurence Sterne, of Mary Shelley and Sir Walter Scott. And the language she uses painstakingly reconstructs the time in which its set. Clarke infuses her words with the intricacy, lyricism, and humor of Britain's pre-Victorian heyday, a time when, for literature lovers, England still had magic.Because the time in which she sets her story is so well known, Clarke feels free to insert characters who will be instantly recognizable to readers. In addition to the title heroes, Clarke trots out stock characters like Sir Walter and Lady Emma Pole, and the slave Stephen who possesses practical wisdom his masters don't share. She also uses historical figures: George III, Lord Nelson, and Lord Byron make cameo appearances.Any college-level Brit Lit survey course will spend the longest amount of time on the years surrounding the Napoleonic Wars. Ironically, the years when England produced its greatest linguistic magic corresponded with the years when the land was nearly at greatest risk of disappearing from the globe, second only to the Blitz. Perhaps the fear that their culture might not last long gave the Limeys reason to remember they had a culture.And the works produced in that time have been a mixed blessing. On the one hand, the linguistic flowering that began with Marlowe and Shakespeare bore fruit in the days of Wordsworth and Johnson. On the other, because the pre-Victorians accomplished so much, they have linked British letters to a veritable industry of nostalgia. Now wonder English Literature progressed through Victorian weariness to the sooty, emasculated world of Amis and le Carr&eacute;.Clarke at once channels that nostalgia industry, by recapturing the pre-Victorian tone, and challenges it, by forcing a conflict between the past and the present. Just as Austen's excessively prim patriarchs subtly mocked the mores of her time, Clarke's wizardry mandarins, frozen in their worship of the past, point the finger at today's professors and librarians. Our best work is not behind us, Clarke says. But we have to actually do that work.But it's not just about who creates the work. By mocking the nostalgia industry, Clarke also indicts us readers for keeping our eyes turned backward. We, like the authors, are not living up to our potential. We are creating a system of rewards in which all of us feel free to rest on the accomplishments of the past. And we have convinced ourselves, by lionizing how good things used to be, that we can never be that good again. Shame on us.As the forces our title heroes unleash turn on them, forcing them to overcome their rivalry for the greater good, Norrell and Strange go on a journey in which they come to grips with the future. Neither Norrell's dusty historical scholarship nor Strange's practiced applications mean anything when apocalyptic forces threaten. England is changing around them, and they must find the strength to change with it. They have so much to accomplish, if they (and we) will survive.And the same applies to us. The broad, fantastic world Clarke reveals indicts us for accepting smallness and diminished hopes. She challenges us to honor the past by making a present, and planning for the future. In short, she tells us that, if we fear there is no magic being done in English, we have no one to blame for that but ourselves."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I personally loved this book. However, as many others have said, it's not a book for everyone. I don't know why anyone would compare this book to Harry Potter, though. It's nothing like it, either in content or style. A better comparison would be to Gregory Maguire'sWicked: Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of th (Wicked Years). Both are heavily character driven, both deal with the struggle between free will and destiny, both have beautifully written prose, both are purposely ambigous at times to allow the reader's imagination to fill in the gaps.

While the history of magic is important for the reader to truly grasp the world Clarke has created, her fantasic story gets lots in all the backstories, footnotes and slow-moving narrative. It wasn't until chapter 40-something that I actually started taking interest in the story and the characters. By chapter 50, I was riveted until the conclusion when the story unfortunately loses all momentum and ends with a whimper.

Raven King, who mostly lives in footnotes, is a fascinating character. The problem is that the novel has grandiose ambitions which it is unable to fulfill. Characters fail to build. Action fails to build. After 800 pages of episodic adventures which lead nowhere, magic supposedly returns to England, and the Faerie are conveniently tamed...we know this, because Clarke takes a chapter or two at the end to tell us so. The plot and the characters, however, do not go there naturally.Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"A pleasant and endearing work. Transports you back to a slower-paced, proper and polite bygone era. IF you're willing to spend MANY evenings patiently communing with these mild and temperate men, slowly unfolding their noble (yet flawed) character and depth, you will savor this story. The slow pace pulls you in, as though these are your friends of many years and you are settling in for a quiet and reflective evening with them in the drawing room.If, on the other hand, you prefer your fantasy fast-paced and action-packed, then this ISN'T the novel for you.I particularly appreciated the willingness of these characters to gently overlook faults in others, to readily forgive, to respect each other even in the face of disagreement--we could all learn a thing or two here."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Set in early 19th century, pre-Victorian England, this unusual novel posits the existence of actual practicing magicians in the midst of English society during the Napoleonic Wars. Having gradually deteriorated through the preceding generations, an individual appears (Mr. Norrell) with the goal of reestablishing magic as a noble and useful profession. As luck would have it, a second, competing magician appears on the scene (Jonathan Strange).Parts of this novel are intriguing, as actual historic events (Waterloo) are merged with fanciful, magical twists that sometimes work (as a literary device) and other times do not. Some reviewers seem to be put off by the archaic language and spelling used by the author (surprize, chuse, etc.). Others are perturbed by the extensive use of footnoting. Neither of these devices bothered me overly much (though a three page footnote IS a little extreme), as the underlying theme and execution of the work itself simply didn't work for me. Arguing about footnotes and spelling seems to be nitpicking when the actual work itself is found wanting (kind of like complaining about the food served aboard the Titanic).It is too long. It is, at times, quite boring and at others ridiculously silly. There are moments of amusement and entertainment, but they are few and far between."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"And the fairies are very well dressed, with satin coats the color of deep despair.

It is definitely a matter of taste, and not for everyone - the prose is dense and Victorian in style, the plot is slow and meandering, and many of the characters are maddening in their flaws. You must understand: this is not a fantasy novel in the traditional sense of the word. Rather, it is a novel about fascination with magic, represented here as any other discipline, i.e. history might be. It is also a very in-depth character study. Whether you sympathize with characters or abhor them, you will not be left unmoved. Don't mistake the slow pace of the plot development for an absence of one. The author takers her time to deliver each valuable piece, as if stringing precious pearls onto a necklace, but at the end I was floored by how beautifully and naturally all the pieces came together to offer a conclusion. If these events had in fact taken place, there would have been no other resolution possible. Not a single false note. Not a single concession to readers' sensibilities.

Apparently I am not the only one to think this book is a marvel. As I write this review, it is shortlisted for the 2004 Whitbread Award for First Novel.In early 19th century Georgian England, the big news was the seemingly never-ending war with Napoleon Bonaparte. Of lesser interest, except to a few, was magic. All over the country small groups of men, theoretical magicians, scholars all, would meet from time-to-time to discuss the practice and history of magic. No one had actually practiced real magic for hundreds of years. A small society of theoretical magicians lived in the city of York. They had heard of a magician in Yorkshire, a Mr. Norrell, who had an extraordinary library of rare books on magic. They assumed that he was a theoretical magician, like themselves. A delegation of two were selected to pay a visit to Mr. Norrell in order to see his wonderful library. Norrell, reclusive, self-centered and socially inept, hoarded his precious volumes and seemed reluctant to share his books or his knowledge. The two magicians from York asked their host, \\"...why magic has fallen from its once-great state in our nation? Our question is, sir, why is no more magic done in England?\\" Upon which Norrell replied, \\"It is a wrong question, sir. Magic is not ended in England. I myself am quite a tolerable magician.\\" When the collective York society heard about Norrell's proclamation, they doubted his \\"active magician\\" status. They asked him to make some magic to prove his claims. Norrell, incensed at being called a fabulist, agreed to perform a magical feat in the York Cathedral on a given day and time. He then made a bargain with the society members that if he failed to live up to his claims, he would give his oath never to make any such claims again. However, if he should succeed, the members of the society would disband and promise never to claim the title of \\"magician\\" again. Need I say that Norrell proved himself beyond anyone's expectations?As the only practicing magician in England, Mr. Norrell, whose ambitions began to grow after the York event, moved to London with the intent of bringing magic back to his country. He also got the notion that he would like to use his magic to aid the British in their war efforts, thus bringing fame to himself and practical magic into the spotlight. Sir Walter Pole, a cabinet minister, saw no reason to utilize Norrell's services - after all, he had no military training. Then Norrell performed a truly unbelievable act of black magic for Pole, the kind of magic which he had thought to never use. That act persuaded Pole to accept the magicians assistance. Norrell's participation in the war managed to terrify the French. Unfortunately and unknowingly, Norrell's dark magic brought a thistle-haired gentleman from the land of faeries to London, who worked some very nasty magic of his own, and wrecked havoc in the world around him - as well as the Other World.Meanwhile, Jonathan Strange, a wealthy gentleman who lived near the Welsh border, wanted to marry. Desiring a career, something meaningful to occupy his time in order to please his pretty young fiance, he decided to become a magician after finding he had a talent for the practice. Strange was quite different from Mr. Norrell, being young, handsome and charismatic. He too moved to London where his path crossed Norrell's. The older magician took the younger man on as a pupil. Norrell actually shared his books and knowledge with him, but his underlying motive was to control Strange's magical knowledge. When Strange decided he no longer needed Norrell, exactly what the older magician feared most, a feud began between the two which estranged them. Neither man, however was aware of the strange and dangerous being from the land of faeries who had entered their world.The above is just a brief summary of this tale's beginning - a tiny taste of the enchanting plot - and doesn't begin to do it justice. The book is narrated in a scholarly, (but not dry), manner, complete with footnotes which are almost as fascinating as the main story. It's as if a magician, perhaps a former colleague, were looking back in time and relating this history. The thread which ties the entire novel together is the prophecy attributed to the shadowy figure of the Raven King. As a child he was taken by faeries and later became king of both England and Faerie, and the greatest magician of all time. His prophecy: \\"Two magicians will appear in England. The first shall fear me; the second long to behold me. . . .\\" It is Susanna Clarke's spectacular, rich narrative that makes it all work - like magic.Ms. Clarke's characters are magnificent - so real they practically leap off the page. Her descriptions enable one to really get a three-dimensional picture of each one in the mind's eye. Ms. Clarke also gives the reader remarkable insight into human passions - envy, greed, ambition, friendship, love and redemption. Her take on English society during this period is often satirical, and very humorous at times.Oddly, I have heard some compare \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" to \\"Harry Potter.\\" I don't understand the comparison. The only commonality between the two is the world of magic. I could better compare this novel to the work of Charles Dickens, especially the way Clarke's characters and settings are brought to life by her vivid descriptions. I highly recommend \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" - a novel destined to become a classic.JANA"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is a wonderful, beautifully written and witty book. It is unfortunate that it could not have been printed in a more user friendly format- it is so fat that it is very uncomfortable to read. Despite this, a very readable and highly recommended book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I guess some people really like this sort of thing. Hundreds of pages prose with characters speculating about what they are going to do, then doing things that don't seem to have a whole lot of connection to their speculation or to the fantasy-reality world that the reader is supposed to imagine.Clarke really missed a chance for greatness. She could have developed a few threads along detailed lines that would have provided for a \\"realistic\\" explanation of how magic, politics, and the British empire could have fused together to conquer much of the world...come on, it has to be more than a technological edge and blind devotion to ethnocentricism and the \\"white man's burden\\".Instead she jumbled things together in a way that causes speculation about what the characters actually think and do, but doesn't really give enough information or background to help the reader resolve the issues. Strong on 19th century style and pretention, weak on plot and historical context.The book tantalized with just enough development to keep me going. I'd come to a point of tossing the book down and moving on. Then I'd think, maybe she will do something interesting with this. But I'd come to the answer of a question and imagine, is that all? Serialistically episodic with little internal coherence.Clarke has captured Henry James's style without his depth. She has copied Charles Dickens's structure without his crafty plot resolution or the intriguing development of character.Oh, for a Miss Haversham or Sydney Carton."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Looking over the previous reviews it is obvious that camps have formed and that this novel has both its fans and detractors. For all this disagreement, few reviewers have put energy into understanding why they do or do not like Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell. Most of the problem, at least from my viewpoint, has nothing to do with the plot per se, but a great deal to do with Susanna Clarke's writing style. Not only does she set her tale in the late Georgian and Regency periods, but also she has adopted the writing style most popular in that period. A style which, all other factors being even, is so in love with its language that it can take forever to get to the point. You will either like this, or you won't.In my personal case, I find it tiresome. We are no longer in an era where the only thing we have to do to fill long hours is sit and read extended novels. Susanna Clarke is a pleasant writer. But she is no Charles Dickens nor is Jonathan Clarke the equal of Sense and Sensibility. The innermost plot arc - an attempt by one of the most powerful of the Fay to establish power in England - gets short shrift until nearly the end of the book. In fact, is may be quite a while before the reader is positive that there is a plot.Despite having sole possession of the first two words of the title, Jonathan Strange does not appear for some time. Instead we first meet Mr. Norrell (the nearly next to last magician in England) and a host of lesser characters that will continue to play a part throughout the story. Norrell himself is an unsympathetic character, very much wrapped up in his own talents and self importance, including a very strong belief that magic is best served by not practicing it. And when he does, he manages to make one of magic's greatest mistakes, setting in motion a plot that will only crystallize hundreds of pages later.By the time Strange advances onto the book's stage, the reader's reaction is likely to be a sense of relief from Norrell's dour outlook on the future (and present) of English magic. And for a time it seems so. Norrell becomes Strange's tutor, advances are made, and the two become enmeshed in England's battles in Europe. As often as not these smaller arcs have some humorous content as Strange journey's about in the service of Wellington and Norrell minds the home front. This serves to distract us from the undercurrent of disquiet that frames the story. All is not roses and Norrell's deal with a prince of Fairie is due to bear unwelcome fruit.The competition between Norrell and Strange comes to a head, and several crises drive them to separate. Strange has some very real challenges in the way of his dream of recreating the great English magic of the Raven King, and he is beset with personal tragedy as well. He will face madness, ridicule and loss before he can resolve a threat that is only partly personal. For what lays in his way may very well destroy his homeland as well.The book's style is primarily one of laying one story arc on top of another until the final effect is of a giant clockwork. One that is more complicated than is absolutely necessary, and that masks the real underlying story for most of the book. My real complaint is that this is a book that asks whether it is the magicians or their spells that are the real magic, and that expresses a firm belief that there are elements of the world that are self correcting. Yet these topics are brushed by as we advance on a conclusion that is both a bit abrupt and fails to deliver on the book's promises. The story is well written, but scatter plotted, and I feel that Clarke has let her prose get in the way of her intentions. The book is more of a spider web than it is a narrative and I will have to confirm that, indeed, you will either find it hard to put down, or hard to pick up."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Nicely written, but I'm 200 pages in and I don't know enough about these people to care to continue. Maybe it was the wrong choice succeed The Forsyte Saga."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I've always described Jonathan Strange as a fusion of Jane Austen and Harry Potter, but rereading the book makes me wonder how accurate that is. Yes, the book plays with the same world and social circles that Austen wrote about, and creates as vibrant and indelible a portrait of the times as Austen ever did. And, like Rowling, Clarke creates a world where magic is just another fact of life. But limiting a comparison to those two authors ends up missing out on so much of what makes this novel wonderful. Sure, the Potter books are filled with magic, but while Rowling treats magic as just another task, Clarke creates magic that fills the reader with a true sense of wonder and awe, treating the subject as something monumental, not mundane. And while Clarke still writes of the upper-class, she also writes greatly about lower classes, creating a London that feels as much of Dickens as Austen. But there's so much more to write about - her plotting, which allows the characters to breathe and yet spins a far tighter web than you'll realize at first; her characters, who feel like true, living, breathing people; her depiction of magical worlds; her rich and complex mythology; her sense of history...the list goes on and on. When you start reading Strange and Norrell, you feel as though you're entering into a rich world you could explore forever; when the final page turns, you're saddened for having to leave it behind. Clarke has created a modern masterpiece, telling her tale about two men, their friendship and rivalry, and how they reshaped England. It's the story of fairies, magic, seduction, glamour, power, war, love, and more, and it's one of the richest and most satisfying books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Yes, I said it: there are enough needless words and pointless side stories/footnotes in this book to create 4 more novels. Now, some books are detailed, and account for the details later, but in the book, the author goes rambling on about the most needless things that do not come back around in the story. You could easy cut this book down to 1/4 it's original length and still have a great story, maybe even better.Seriously, much longer than it needed to be. If the story were amazing (which it is not), then we could overlook this word-packing.Now, as for the CDs, another personal pet peeve: the CDs do not alert you that you have come to the end of the disc. My CD player just returns to the beginning, so I have to drive another 5 minutes before I realize it is replaying itself. Some of the better CD sets tell you the disc has ended and to \\"continue on disc __\\", which helps a great deal while dodging traffic on the freeway.If you must: get this from the library, but DO NOT pay money for it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is a fascinating novel. It unlike nearly everything I've ever read.It's about two men, the first real magicians in a couple centuries, as they rediscover the old magic lost to modern academics, and use that magic against Napoleon's armies. It's about their relationships-- between the two men, with their families, with their friends, with their servants, with their academic/political peers, with their patriotism, and even with their magical forefathers. Both men have dramatically different views about what makes good or bad magic, about how it should be used, when, and by whom. This comes out gradually over the course of the novel-- nothing is rushed here. Which isn't to say it's slow, it merely takes its time in tracking the course of these two magician's careers, fully developing events and relationships so that when things build up and Stuff Happens, you have a deep, grand understanding of all the players involved.If you like historical fiction, if you like traditional ideas of British fantasy along the lines of Faerie realms, magical items, spells that turn out more trouble than they're worth, magic in warfare, and a great love of knowledge in the form of books, you'll like this story. A huge theme of the novel is the conflict between learning by reading and learning by doing: being a theoretical magician is safe but ultimately limited...being a practical magician means no end to the knowledge and power you can acquire, but the danger in learning is infinitely higher. Is it better to study or invent? Is it even possible to separate the two acts? That's the source of philosophical conflict in the book, and as a premise if fascinates me. Will magic see them through the day or will it ultimately destroy them? Honestly, it could go either way."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I might not have started this book if I'd known what it was about, but I read every footnote of this atmospheric literary pastiche -- George Eliot meets Harry Potter. Not a lot of real substance, but this atmospheric entertainment is an impressive feat by the author."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"If you have read both you know what I am talking about, if not go read the two first."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is clever and is obviously well written. For my taste, however, it's slow and overly long. The style is passe. There are some very amusing comments (like when the end of the war is celebrated so that the English no longer have to go to Scotland to observe strange races). To compare it to Harry Potter is absurd. Potter is a kids' book; this is an adult book. On the whole, I think I prefer HP."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Described by some as \\"Harry Potter for adiults\\", I'm sorry to sya it isn't. Where Rowling's plots are well constructed and move well, Clarke's move with the speed of a glacier. She is also enamored of the word \\"Oh!\\" - exclamation included - which starts almost every conversation and on some - many! - pages gets annoying. Nice try but someone called an \\"editor\\" would have been most helpful to omit the \\"Oh!\\" plethora and keep the plot a bit more on track. Don't bother."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I gave this book 1 star only because I could not post my review without one. I have just finished reading this boring, boring, boring book and I cannot believe that there are so many people out there who love it. The most tedious and boring read I have ever had the misfortune of coming across! The story is very slow moving and the footnotes are more interesting then the text of the book (although their length is quite annoying). I have read several other reviews and still cannot figure out what everyone else has seen in this novel. This book, like it's main character (Mr. Norell) is boring, tedious and given to long silences. Ms. Clark spends most of her time on character development of entirely boring characters -- some of whom are not important to the story. The entire story is told in the last 80 pages of the book although the reader is expected to plod through 720 pages of drivel to get there! If you are looking for an entertaining read, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I borrowed JS & Mr. Norrell from the library. My suggestion is to do the same and if you can make it though the first half of the book then purchase it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is NOT all it's cracked up to be. I had a hard time making it through the first 100 pages and had to force myself to keep going. I wish I would have gotten it from the library so that I could return it instead of wasting my money at the book store."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I give it one star to give the author credit for being able to spew such a very large amount of prose.I love big books. War and Peace. Anything by Dickens. Big 18th century novels. Even big 20th century novels, like Gravity's Rainbow. I'm not a snob that way. I know that when a big book is good, it is very very good.This one is awful. The author cannot muster up a voice one can listen to and abide with for this length of text. Her attempts at imitation early 19th century prose verge on the insulting, especially since she lacks the wit and imagination to do so convincingly. Her struggle to do so results in a text that is stifled, constrained and uncomfortable.The writing is anipathetic to a good reading experience. The author neglects to offer the reaer an interesting or compassionate route through which to enter the story. The characters are remarkably uninteresting for a tale of a fantasy parallell reality. The plot moves along so slowly that the book's finest feature, for this reader, was its ability to induce sleep.I suspect it was the publisher's intent to market an adult Harry Potter-type fantasy franchise. It won't work with this author, these characters or this storyline. It's an insulting marketing ploy.Don't bother."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I had high expectations for this book. Although I would give the author high marks for atmospherics, I think the whole thing was ruined because of contradictory premises at the heart of the novel. At first it was just a vague, sneaking suspicion, but after a couple hundred pages, I couldn't get it out of my mind.See, this book has two core premises. One is that \\"magic\\" is real: that by contorting one's fingers into odd shapes and uttering some arcane Latin, one can indeed summon demons, cast spells, blight crops, whatever.The other premise is that this art has been \\"forgotten.\\" There's a society of magicians, of a sort, who set themselves to addressing the question, \\"Why are we merely historians of magic? Why do we no longer practice it ourselves?\\" This is not an idle aside: it's the central thrust of the first half of the novel.Unfortunately for Clarke (or anybody else) these premises can't go together . . . even in a work of fantasy.If magic were real, there is no way it would have been forgotten! It wouldn't have happened! Are you kidding? Work all day with my smelly ox under the hot sun breaking this earth when I can just utter a few syllables and have magical servants do it for me? What? Build an expensive and dangerous scaffold when we can just utter a few syllables and levitate this heavy block of granite right up to the top of this cathedral? How's that? Risk our priceless argosies to the whimsies of sea weather when we can just utter a few syllables and have calm, safe seas? Are you nuts? Where do we sign up?This is the kind of knowledge that humanity simply wouldn't have lost in the first place -- yea, even during the darkest of the dark ages. The only reason I can swallow the premise of its being \\"forgotten\\" is that it was unreliable bunkum. If it worked, it'd be something that would have spread all over the earth to the point where even the most unlettered serf in Siberia would have known basic spells for making his life easier. They'd have been posted on every refrigerator, written on every palm!I couldn't get this out my mind while reading this book. I've seen fantasy novels that asked you to believe something that was impossible and you were glad to oblige -- mainly because they suspended, say, only ONE law of nature and then got on with it. But THIS novel asks you to suspend disbelief not merely in all the laws of nature, but every insight ever gleaned about human psychology, economics, and anthropology. Good luck with that."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I am an avid reader and felt compelled to agree with the majority of negative reviews with regard to this book. Unfortunately the book is very boring and hard to get through. After reaching the midway point I am trying to decide to keep on going or throw in the towel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It escapes me why this book was the darling of a number of critics. The only gripping episodes were those involving the gentleman with thistledown hair, Stephen, and Lady Pole. The lengthy footnotes could be entertaining but grew tiresome as the book progressed (and it is a long book, to put it mildly); Norrell is more a spoiled whiner than a threat to Strange; and the use of magic in the Napoleonic Wars never attains the suspense and drama of a real battle. In short, steer clear."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"You know I have been plowing through this book, and I just realized the reason why I can't seem to finish. There's not a character in the book I want to identify with! I certainly wouldn't compare it with Harry Potter. Harry although gifted, never seems to see himself as special or perfect which the main characters in this book sure seem too.Do read the pages available before buying, make sure you like the style- IT DOESN'T CHANGE FOR THE WHOLE BOOK."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I should have known something was up when my daughter-in-law said, \\"here, read this book!\\". Her tone was uncharacteristically challenging. I struggled to finish this tedious tome. It simply wasn't fun, and I didn't like the characters. When I read about magic I expect wizards and the like . This book isn't about that and to be fair it was handed to me I didn't buy it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I am glad I borrowed this book from a friend, who kept telling me it was marvellous.I tried, I really tried to read it. I stopped after more than 200 pages where almost nothing happened. Oh, well, to tell the truth, \\"some things\\" happened, but they were so uninteresting that I could not believe. The plot? Nonsense. The style? A bad joke. No humor at all, terrible characters - I wished all of them died horribly, so at least something would happen.I have read many, many books, all my life. Dante, Milton, Tolstoi, Dostoievsky, Sinclair Lewis, Joyce, Dickens, Tolkien, J.K. Rowling. I like big books, I like historical books, I like fantasy and fiction. The problem here is that \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell\\" is tedious, overrated, a total waste of paper. It is the first book I was glad I didn't finish. I regret every single moment I spent trying to find some sense in it. I kept reading, thinking something would finally happen. It didn't. It is simply stupid, bland, annoying.Save yourself some precious time and money, avoid this mess."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Never having been one to be interested in magic, I was not at first intrigued by the premise of this novel. But the story, while dealing heavily with the subject, can be read on an entirely different level. Four and a half stars."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I totally agree with many of the earlier reviews that this book is so slow that it demands you to be in the top .00001% in patience to finish it. Overall, a truly boring book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I slogged thru the first third of the book but I found it quite boring. I think it had to do with the author's style of writing as though she were a novelist in the late 18th early 19th century. I can't read unabridged Austen nor Dickens either."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I am an avid reader of all Genres and I was given an advanced copy of this book by a book store owner. I usually give a book 100 pages before I give up on it. I went to 300 pages with this book ONLY because the book store owner wanted a review. Not one of the characters was interesting or likeable. The pace is slow and the plot is tedious and boring. The writing is self-conscious. The only reason it is on the bestseller list is the marketing ploy which hypes this work as \\"Harry Potter for the adult\\"."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I got this book hoping to enjoy it based on many rave reviews. I DON'T GET IT! I have not been so bored with a book in I don't know how long! I bought this at Amazon.com from an Awesome Deal I found on DailyTool.com."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I was excited to get this book. I had it on hold at the library for months. When I finally began perusing it, I discovered to my chagrin that it was actually just a mildly more adult version of Harry Potter. Not just because its subject matter is magic--that is the least of it. I was excited to read a dark adult book about magic. No, the story, the characters, the consequences of the magic that is done, all combine to make you soon realize that this is a book for children. Everything is so droll and quaint, no one's reactions to the plot points are anywhere close to realistic, the writing is simplistic, like a child's christmas story. It's also one of those historical fictions where the author continually makes painfully obvious little anachronistic statements. Like suddenly people are saying all this feminist stuff, or all this ridiculously modern stuff about racism. It does not feel like a historical novel, but rather like someone poorly aping the vibe of this moment in history. I don't understand why it is marketed to adults. It falls in the Harry Potter demographic. It is saccharine, dumbed-down, and, again, clearly written for babies. I don't understand everyone raving about how it is written in the style of Jane Austen. Just because you liberally sprinkle your writing with words like \\"madame\\" and \\"alas\\" and just because everybody rides horses does not mean you are writing like Jane Austen. This book feels like it was written by someone who loves Jane Austen a lot, but just doesn't really have the chops to pull off anything truly clever or interesting.If I sound bitter it is only because I anticipated this book so energetically and waited for it for so long. If you are one of those grownups who loves Harry Potter, you will surely love this book, and more power to you. If, like me, you are looking for a deep, dark, intriguing adult historical fiction/fantasy novel, you would do better to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"At first I thought this book would be right up my alley -- a long, period, British novel about magic. How can you go wrong? The first thing that began to bug me were the elaborate footnotes. They really did not add to the plot or understanding of the characters and only served to frustrate me as I debated whether or not to read them.The book starts out well but my major problem was that none of the characters are really gripping. Mr. Secundus, who does come back much later (though not in the 3rd of the novel I read) is moderately interesting. But the main character for most of the first bit of the novel -- Mr. Norrell -- is not very likeable or compelling. We never learn much about him. When Strange finally makes his appearance I was happy, thinking this might perk things up, but again, the author has one thing after another happen but nothing really seems to further one's understanding of, or concern for, the characters. The main \\"character\\" in this book is the author's creation of the history of English magic. Unfortunately, this was not riveting enough to keep me going.I saw one review who said that if you like Dickens, Elliot, etc., you will like this. I could not disagree more. They are great English novelists. This is not a great English novel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"There is no reason to bother with this book, as far as I can tell. (I tossed it aside after 250 pages.) The prose is a poor imitation of that of the age the book depicts, and, though there is (contrary to some reports) a plot, the plot is entirely uninteresting. Again in opposition to some reports, the footnotes here are actually the most interesting thing in the book.In any case, any novel that telegraphs plot twists exactly 102 pages in advance (this figure derived from the mass-market paperback edition) cannot be counted as anything but uninteresting. There are, of course, worse books, but none I can recall now that has been so widely praised.Apparently, fans of the Harry Potter series might like this; let me recommend instead just rereading the Potter stuff or, better still, turning to the originals of which this is the tv movie version: Wilkie Collins' \\"The Woman in White\\" would be a fine place to start, and you can probably borrow that from the local library instead of wasting the money on this."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"In 1806, while England is under attack by Napoleon and English magic has been dead for centuries, theoretical magical scholars discover a single practical magician: Mr. Norrell, whose debut makes statues sing and disbands the society of theoretical magicians. Soon, a second practical magician introduces himself to Norrell: his name is Jonathan Strange. Strange studies under Norrell, and together they begin to restore magic to England. However, the two men disagree on all points--none more so than the role of John Uskglass, the Raven King, the last and perhaps most influential magician in England. Their magical growth, partnership, struggles, and competing views on the Raven King make up this book which defies genres: part fantasy, part noir, part history text (complete with footnotes), part satire, Clarke has an incredibly unique writing style and creates a book that is lengthy, filled with magic and antiheros, and exists entirely and unapologetically within its own reality. Strange & Norrell is a lengthy, slow read, but undeniably well plotted and written. If for no other reason, I recommend it for being one of the most unique books I have ever read.The greatest drawback to this book is its size. Admittedly, it is only 800 pages, which is long but not unreasonable. However, the printed book is gigantic, especially the hardcover edition. The mass of this text makes it seem all the longer, as does the unusual writing style, which is meandering and has footnotes that can sometimes take up pages in and of themselves. All of these factors make up a book which is a long, slow read. I never became enraptured, and until the last 100 pages never felt anxious to sit down and read large chunks of text in one sitting. I'm a fast reader, but this book still took me two weeks.However, as a part of the writing style, this lengthy, slow storytelling appears to be intentional and is part of the book's overall style. As for the style: I've never read anything like it. The characters are almost universally antiheros, the writing is dry and regards the characters and events with a removed, wry eye, and the book includes footnotes that explain, in the tradition of academic writing, details and stories that are mentioned in passing in the text. All of this makes absolutely no reference to our world--that is, our own history. The style is distinctive, unapologetic, and both darkly humorous and, on some levels, meaningful and realistic.The plot meanders from war to learning to old magic, the book reads slowly, the characters are as painfully irritating as they are lovable, and there has never been a book like this. Illustrated in black and white, the book also reads like it is in black and white: stylized, unique, intentional, and at the same time irreverently meaningful. The style is the highlight and creative force of the text. I don't know if this is a book for all readers, but I do recommend it. Pick it up, read the first chapter, and see if Clarke's unusual world and unique style appeals to you. If it does, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I finished rereading this book today after the first time a few years ago, and I must say that I'm even more impressed now than I was after the first read.This book, more than others, I think, will be a love-it-or-hate-it kind of thing. Set in an alternate Britain, it follows the revival of magic propelled by the fussy Mr. Norrell and the bold Jonathan Strange. The plot is perhaps the most original thing I've read in a long, long time, weaving real history with the convincing tale of magic's rebirth.Clarke is a master of words. Her humor is dry and impeccable, reminding me of Rowling and Austen (perhaps a British thing?). Every chapter had something that made me smile, if not laugh out loud. Her characterization, which is aided quite a bit by her humor, is remarkable as well. I came to be just as agitated at Mr. Norrell as many of the secondary characters were, and I enjoyed reading about her villain, a malicious and pretty hysterical fairy, more than anything else in the book.I admit, despite all that, many will be turned off by this book. At times the book really feels like it isn't going anywhere, though, for me, Clarke's writing alone made up for any lulls in the plot. Her sense of humor probably isn't for everyone. But hopefully, you'll get as wrapped up as I did in this history-that-never-happened, enchanted until the last page which will leave you begging for more."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"A marvelous work, a Harry Potter saga for adults (not that adults cannot enjoy Harry Potter, as I do very much, but it is a bit much for the typical 12 year old). Rich in description and plot and wonderful footnotes that are worth the price of the book all by themselves!This is no breezy read, both long and complex - something to soak in for a couple hours at a time in a comfortable chair."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I've never reviewed a book on Amazon, but this book compels me to do so. It was unlike anything I've ever read. Part historical fiction, part fantasy. It had humor, great characterization and the story was well paced and interesting. I'm an avid reader and actually prefer longer books, but usually by the end I'm ready for it to end. Not so with this book. I dragged the last 50 pages out so it wouldn't be over. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I hate to contradict myself in one sentence like that, but honestly is the best policy. A friend recommeded this book, and I picked it up at the library. The first 100 pages was fairly smooth, but as I went farther into this long book, I rapidly lost steam. It is not the easiest read in the world, there is something antiquated and almost romantic in the way it's written, which is great at first. But when you're reading page after page it was difficult to get lost in the story when I'm stumbling over the prose. I'm going to eventually try the audio book. It is a very interesting story, and if you like a slower read, this is your book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"So many reviews already detail this novel so I'll just say that i really liked this journey. I'm just amazed at the imagination of the author. One of the things which pleased me was how the author kept the characters on track and true to themselves."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is an excellent book. My kids got me into Harry Potter, but this is a much better read for adults. Nothing graphic, just a more complex story. Intrigue and a believable story line make for a better read. It is somewhat difficult to get into the story initially, I found myself reading late into the night about 1/3 of the way through."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"When we LOVE a book, we want to recommend it to other readers, but how does one describe the marvelous tale of Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell and who would enjoy it?The setting is early 19th century England. The wit, subtle humor, and bittersweet romance bring Jane Austen to mind. On the other hand, the large cast of lively, vivid characters dealing with life's most basic themes of good and evil; greed and retribution, most definitely give this novel the feel of Dickens. Then, there is all the incredible detail about the history and legend of magic in England and the elegant magic itself performed by Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell. This is a long book (782 pages, illustrated with delightful, eerie black and white drawings) that left me hoping I could soon return to the world of the two English magicians.As a person who works in a public library with many teens as patrons, I am always looking for book recommendations for our young adults. As a reader who was enthralled by Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell, I am eager to pass this title on to potential Strange and Norrell enthusiasts and I think teens would make excellent candidates for this recommendation.Young adults are a group of readers looking for something that has the same lure as the books they enjoyed when younger (Rowling, Tolkien, etc.), but more sophisticated and complex. Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is such a book. In the world created by Susanna Clarke, a key moment is Mr. Norrell bringing a beautiful young woman back from the dead in order to become the most famous magician in England. He does so by enlisting the powers of \\"the gentleman with the Thistle down hair\\" and the Kingdom of Faerie. With this act, he does nothing short of bargain with the devil and it is the catalyst for all the many twists and turns of this well-crafted plot. I was enthralled by the world created by Ms. Clarke and I think many teens would love to be transported into this book's realm."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book has a certain charm. The style is similar to Jane Austen. That said, you could cut 300 pages out of the middle and not miss very much.The story revolves about the workings of two rather incompetent magicians named Strange and Norrell. They intend to restore magic to England.Norrell wishes to exclude everyone else from practicing magic, and Strange seeks out knowledge of the Raven King. The Raven King ruled 3 kingdoms: northern England, Fairie and Hell.The plot drags on over a decade, and a great deal of the back story is contained in footnotes (I hope you like agate type). One plot aspect is that Norrell summons a fairie to perform a task. This fairie is essentially at war with Norrell and Strange through out the book, but neither of the magicians understand this until maybe page 600.I guess I expected something more rousing when you consider the hype this book received.I think the writing is quite good, but the novel suffers from a touch edit and too many pages."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is a true pleasure, beginning to end.

I read well over 1 book / week, and consider myself fairly patient in the interest of building a story and its characters.

I will go back to the greats like OS Card, and Neil Gaiman!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I am an avid SF and Fantasy reader and had expected much from this book's reviews.

I kept thinking \\"Surely something is going to happen, someone doesn't write a book this long with no climax or intense build-up!\\" WRONG WRONG WRONG.This is possibly the WORST book I have ever wasted my time on. I have read reviews on it and they angered me so greatly I was forced to create an account to add my own critique. People seem to think books today are too \\"fast paced.\\" There is a difference between a slow book with inricate build up that takes a long time to play out, and this book. Nothing whatsoever happens in this book. If you've already wasted your money on buying it, skip to the last 3 chapters or so and spend the rest of your time breathing, you'll be doing yourself a favor and experiencing a lot more excitement than this book has to offer.

This book got great reviews but I struggled to finish it. Why? Primarily because of the lack of a viable plot. I thought a fiction book had to have a plot to be published. I was wrong.Plot SpoilersThere is the potential for this book to have been interesting and original - the faeries' world, the refiguring of history, the magic duel between the main protagonists, the disturbing outcomes of faerie encounters. Evidently, most of those who gave this book 3-5 stars thought the potential was realised. I am afraid to say I did not. The main reason for this is the lack of a plot thread, a purpose to the main conflict, the lack of an interesting cast of characters, the lack of a true antagonist; I could go on. I did finish the book but it took me several months to do so, with other books fed in between."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I gave up after 250 pages.

This book goes on without substance and will do nothing but put you to sleep. I am more than half way through the book and I am seriously considering dumping the book!

Maybe this is who gave 5 stars.Everything other reviewers have said is true. Boring expressionless characters. Painfully simple plot that never builds up to any climax.This is like the scenes in Harry Potter when they go to the the strange train station and then see the school with its oddities for the first time It is wonderous for the first 100 pages but instead of the story continuing this scene just keeps looping endlessly with different descriptions and dialouge for 900 more pages.Mabye this is enough for some people.If I had spent the countless hours watching clouds pass, it would have been more exciting.Only the most acute and active animals are capable of boredom.-Nietzsche"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I rarely write these reviews because I'm too busy. But I had to write about this one. OK, it is a decent book. But I bought it because it was touted as an adult (grown-up) version of Harry Potter. This was one of the hardest books to get through. The whole story jumped all over the place and in the end you still did not know what the plot was.Buying this in paperback might be worth it. It is not the worst book I have ever read (actually it is the next to the worst book) but it certainly is a borrow from the library level of bad. You will not want this in your library."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"If you are looking for a real modern masterpiece, you must read this book.A bit too long but the exprience will stay with you for a lifetime."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"FOOTNOTES ARE AWESOMEAnd I thought In The Lake of the Woods had fabulous footnotes.... Clarke blows O'Brien out of the water! (I'm about 1/3 of the way through. It's 1,000 pages)________________________________________________________I have now finished this book. It has been the best read since The Historian. I have already purchased The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories because I am in denial that JS&MrN; is over. I have bought 2 more copies of JS&MrN; to give as gifts, but now I want to keep them so I have a copy in every room.Excellent writing. Long book but not loquacious or self-indulgent. Smart and fun and beautiful and dark. As soon as I finished, I started reading chapter 1 again.

She wove the tale of two magicians as masterfully as Charles Dickens! Her complex storyline took us through all sorts of labyrinthine subplots -- and I just wanted to linger in each one!

Definitely worth attempting.

What a grand character! Give it a try..."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I recently purchased this book on a whim off the bargain table. I was immediately hooked! I left my copy in a B&B so I went out and bought another. This book is a charmer. It's funny, it's engaging, it's smart and it completely captures the feeling of the period. Frankly I don't know enough about the subject of English majic to know if Susanna Clark made up all the footnotes or if they have any basis in fact. DON'T SKIP THE FOOTNOTES! They are half the fun. I'd just finished Pride & Prejudice for the first time and this was a great follow up to that. This book isn't for everyone, but I'm glad I found it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I didn't think I would like this book becuz it seemed for women, but I was wrong. It is very long book but so good a read. It is about a magician, but not at all like Harry Potter, so don't think it is. It is so much better than Harry Potter. I found myself thinking more of Jim Butcher's excellent DRESDEN FILES series, that I also think is great. There is no romance stuff in it, so don't worry about that.It takes place in the 1850s or so and follows the exploits of Jonathan Strange on his quest to explore the world that cannot be seen. He makes \\"jumps\\" into a vast unknown area to go to other places and follow a mysterious figure that eventually begins to wreck havoc on the world of humans.These characters come to life and is hard to put the book down, even though it is very very long. But you will be glad it was long when it is done and you will still want more. I am waiting for a sequel"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"JK Rowling meets Jane Austen. A lovely fantasy set in an alternate Regency period, this book is not a fast read by anybody's count (and I am usually a very fast reader), but it's well worth the effort as the author spins a charming tale which affords a tantalizing glimpse into the whimsical, frightening world of Faerie amongst the drawing-room humor. As the story moves deeper into the magic, the tone becomes darker, drawing the hero into an otherworldly quest of sorts. The scholarship is thorough but unobtrusive. A challenging but ultimately satisfying read!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The book is definitely worth the read. At 800+ pages, it may look a little daunting, but - trust me - there isn't a wasted word in the entire novel.It's good to see a female writer doing something so different in the field of fantasy. The only complaint I might possibly have is that the book is told by a very distant, very omniscient narrator, which makes it intellectually stimulating and humorous, but lacks a strong emotional connection to any of the characters. All of the characters are likeable, even the unlikeable ones who simply make us a laugh at their absurdities.One thing that I can say is a big plus: I truly didn't see the ending coming until right before it hit. I knew that the plot was going somewhere, and it made steady progress through the hundreds of pages, but it actually has a pretty satisfying ending, which is rare in a lot of books I've read lately."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is a very strange and wonderful book. Its genius lies in Susanna Clarke's ability to paint such a clear picture of magic in her readers' minds that magic somehow acquires a texture, a color, a sound, and a taste. (Sometimes I could even swear that the colour and the taste are, impossibly, the same thing...) Magic is never reduced to wandwaving or incantations, but is allowed to be an elusive, dark current running throughout England and English history. It's malicious, it's dangerous, and it's always mysterious.I have read this book at least three times, and each time I find new details to admire and enjoy. Its plot may meander, but its wit is incisive.If you like to inhabit books rather than simply read them, then this is a book for you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is just about the best book I have ever read. Contrary to what some of the reviewers said, I think the footnotes compliment the rest of the book wonderfully. So if you haven't read the book yet and are thinking of doing so, please do not skip the footnotes. It's well worth your time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is like a grown up Harry Potter! It tells a portion of England's history, but with the added twist of magic. The story and the storytelling is fabulous, but as other reviewers have mentioned, it is VERY long. Sometimes the \\"fake\\" footnotes take up pages in themselves.I listened to this book in my car and I think that worked out better than if I'd tried to read it. It takes awhile to get into the story, but once you do, you'll never put it down (or stop driving around the block, in my case)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"A wonderful read, part historical novel, part gothic fantasy, part society novel, Strange and Norrel proved an enaging read. Clarke has a delicious style with a voice that is both engaging and haunting. She creates a compelling and convincing world of faerie and magic, conveyed through a wealth of notes that gives the book a grounded and rich depth. While reading I recalled Eco's Foucault's Pendulum, but Clarke's style is lighter, more playful, yet just as eerily dark at times. I was also reminded of the now lost collection of stories, The Kingdoms of Elfin, by Sylvia Townsend Warner. I have not seen the world of Faerie so hauntingly evoked since I dipped into Warner's little gem of a book.I measure a book's impact by the emptiness left when I turn the last page...a page I keep revisiting and rereading...and I find myself glancing sidelong into mirrors, searching for distorted reflections of a world lost and so thoroughly inhabited over the past two weeks.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This wonderfully written story is a throwback to the times when people wanted a book to take forever to read. Before there was TV or radio, people read for entertainment-- to learn about the world, to become engrossed in a story, for distraction, etc. Susanna Clarke has absorbed that mindset and written a meandering, detailed, intriguing, well researched, and at times quite amusing story that is full of interesting characters who seem at home in their time and place. Although magic is real in this story, it is much closer to Dickens than to Tolkien. The omniscient narrator addresses the reader directly but never abruptly. For example, the narrator begins the introduction to Jonathan Strange with the account of his parents' marriage; it takes an entire chapter before we even see Jonathan Strange. If you have a problem with slow starts, I recommend the CD version, as the actor who reads the story does a great job of giving each character a distinct voice and the funny bits sound funnier with a British accent."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"GOD! Just because it has magicians in it don't expect it to be Harry Potter. It wasn't written under the intent to compete with Harry Potter and to put it in the same genre is ridiculous. Dicken's Oliver Twist and the comic strip Little Orphan Annie are both about orphans. Should we lump them in the same literary category?If you enjoy a well written, engaging novel that HAPPENS to be about English magician, then try this book. If you are looking for the next Harry Potter, try Eragon or some other mass-appeal novel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Susannah Clarke's sly, swirling, over-the-top romantic fantasy begins in Austen country and ends up somewhere east of Mordor.\\"Strange and Norrell\\" is the author's first novel, and it's remarkably self-assured. It gets progressively darker as the two duelling magic-makers of the title make statues talk, cultivate politicians and the Duke of Wellington himself, aid Britain in the war against Napoleon, attempt to save distressed damsels, encounter some problems with ravens, and match wits with a malicious fairy king.Ms. Clarke, apparently had a plan from which she seems not to have deviated from at all, and unlike so many authors on their maiden voyage, she keeps your attention focused on the plot, character, and action--not on authorial self-advertisements.The book is slyly witty, often scary, and never less than exuberant. Ms. Clarke might be the last romantic left in the room, but if she is, it doesn't appear she wants to turn out the lights anytime soon."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is a fun read with a whimsical plot. It reads like a 19th century novel with a magical twist. The characters are well drawn and compelling, and an air of mystery keeps the novel suspenseful. Unfortunately, the plot meanders a bit, but Clarke's brilliant writing keeps you intrigued. However, near the end the pace quickens and as in many novels as the mystery is solved the thrill of the search unravels leaving me not as engaged as I was through the rest of the novel. It seemed things were wrapped up too quickly and the solutions were unsatisfying after the build up. So read this novel. But read it for the world that Clarke weaves with flesh and blood characters in a dark 19th Century England, not for the fully realized plot line."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is the finest piece of fantasy that I have read excluding only the works of the great J.R.R. Tolkien. Susanna Clarke has done something extraordinary here that is bound to classify this text forever in the pantheon of fantasy literature. I actually found myself combing my volumes on British mythology and folklore in the attempt to discover what the origins of the \\"faerie\\" were, considering their role in this book. What I found was that Clarke had done her home work. In the modern day, we tend to think of faeries as little jovial creatures dressed in flower petals - their origins are far more sinister. This book was such a pleasure to read, and now we are guaranteed a sequel and a movie! Life is good. The book is dense - it even has foot notes, which must be read if it is to be understood.This is a book that leaves the reader longing for more Norrell, more Strange, and certainly more Raven King. They do not get much better than this!!!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Whoever suggested skimming the footnotes is a bowdlerizer. Most of the footnotes are marvelous stories that stand on their own. This is not Tolkien or Rowling. This sometimes very funny and sometimes very sad book, the world Susanna Clarke creates, is utterly original, a gorgeous and thrilling mix of magic and history. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I wish there were different categories for the overall rankings of books here, because I would give this book several fives. The author has created a world of magic that seems real and almost scholarly. It is set early in the 1800's in England and the characters are so believable and interwoven with real historical figures, that you almost believe you are reading actual history. I would give Susanna Clarke a five for creating this amazingly intricate and believable story we enjoy with dozens of little footnotes and sub-stories that make the overall story very believable and real. In fact the magic is so real you almost have to adjust your thinking after living in this world for a while, to realize it is just fiction.The magic and the story isn't like anything else I've read. I'd never compare it to \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"Harry Potter.\\" This world is more like our regular world but with subtle magic thrown in here and there. And as the story progresses, we are exposed to a greater hidden world of magic and the history of magic in England starts to take shape and we realize that there are amazing powers and worlds that can be tapped by our main characters. Now that these worlds have been opened, they need to be explored and we need to more and more information. Our taste buds are prepared now for the spicy, exciting stuff.It took me a couple of weeks to read the book and I'm a pretty fast and intense reader. There were times when I got tears in my eyes, times when the story dragged a little bit, but all and all, I think it is well worth the effort. That said, I understand that some people who are very plot driven and looking for a thrill every chapter, won't do well reading this book. There are many insightful and fun quips here and there that kept me amused and sometimes amazed. And don't think you can skip the footnotes. There are little themes and information in the notes that reveal important future events and possibilities.I do have to admit that I'm a little bothered when I read a book of this length, when the book doesn't quite get finished by the end. Anne Rice was particularly guilty of this. There are solutions to the most important questions, but there is a lot left hanging. I hope the next book doesn't take ten more years to write. I am looking forward to it and I'll certainly buy it.So, if you're looking for a good, long read (there are pictures here and there, so that helps) with amazing characters, a fun view of personality traits and the British sense of humor and wit, tackle this book. If you're more of a \\"Da Vinci Code\\" kind of reader, I'd say it may not be for you.Good job, Susanna. I'll be watching for the next installment and I hope it is titled, \\"The Raven King.\\" I'm like Jonathan. I need to know a lot more about him."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Others have likened the author's style to Dickens, which was the comparison that sprang to mind for me as well. Closing the back cover on certain Dickens novels is like saying goodbye to loved friends. Finding a cotemporary author who displays such love and respect for language and character, with such wit and charm was delightful. This is anglophile paradise. I tore through the book on a binge of pleasure.Odd, improbably named characters swirl through each others lives, their numbers swell, their threads lost,then, sudddenly reappear to turn the plot just so.It is not a perfect work, and portions found me anxious for a return to pacing of chapters past. By the end of the book, I felt perhaps the author was exhausted by the effort of her own brilliance. It is a negligable rest, probably only detectable by it's juxtiposition to the lightening bolts of language it follows. This unique subject and story, which is wholly unlike anything I have read, is written in so convincing a style, you'll question your reckoning of history.Furthermore, no format should allow footnote refrence to a back section ever again, after this book. The footnotes are copious and while one could read on past them (sometimes having to turn multiple pages to do so), they are a delight.I plan to read it anew, just to find if phrases like 'malevolent pedagogy' still force me to laugh aloud, and still reverberate in the mind as when first struck."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I loved this book. Even though it was huge (Over 1000 pages) it flew by. I had to keep telling myself to slow down time and time again. The way it was written was amazing, the mix of history and fiction, I kept getting confused and hoping somehow some of these things had really happened. I loved the idea of real magic resurfacing. The writing is beautiful and humorous, like a cross between Sense & Sensibility and Harry Potter. Also, I find most authors choke when it comes to the ending, but this book had suspense from the beginning to the very end. The only complaint I had was a few characters didn't get wrapped up in the ending. All in all a stellar read!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I'm about 350 pages into the book and I must say the story line is very interesting. I don't know much about 18th century England, or magic in England, but I like the way the author tells this story and how each character has a role to play. I'ts like a spider web and everything is connected to each other. I think the best way to describe it is clever writing in the Queen's English. For some reason I have a lot of difficulty reading books in the Queen's English, but this book seems like an easy read so far. When I saw it in the store I was curious as to why this book was 1000+ pages, but as some other people wrote, the story takes its time, but the good thing is that the chapters are short and this is a book you can put down and come back to i.e. digest a little at a time of you are not a power reader like me. It's a good commuter book and if you read carefully you will become engrossed with the characters and the charcoal sketches are very effective in putting a face with the characters on the pages. I would compare Ms. Clarke to Elizabeth George in story development and writing style. So if you have some time to kill and you like to concentrate on one good book at a time like me, you might want to get this one. If you like to take your time, this book is worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I loved this book. It's a little long and a bit too dry in places, but it is an overall very entertaining and fun read. If you enjoy dry humor and historic novels you will enjoy this novel. Don't let the size intimidate you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"First, what some might consider bad: this novel has a languid pace, is surprisingly quaint, and only kicks into high-gear toward the end.The good news is that the story is enthralling, and although it might not reach a lofty height, it's very much worth your time.The font size in the mass paperback is wholly inadequate, so I suggest that you avoid it all costs; obtain one of the other versions."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is wonderful! I didn't find it boring, even though it was extremely long. The characters and descriptions were excellent, definitely worth the read. I loved it! If you love long, descriptive books, then you should read this one. If you don't enjoy reading long books, then I wouldn't bother. But this book was intelligent, funny, and magical. I reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys spending time reading."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The first 150 pages of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell irritated me immensely. First of all, it was the second book within the last month that I have read which used faux academic footnotes for digressions and parentheticals. Second of all, the concept was so determinedly and adorably British that I felt like it was kind of British Disney theme-park. Finally, it was wordy as heck. The initial reading experience was like watching paint dry-- albeit bright and showy paint.Oh gosh, I thought. I am never going to make it through this book.But somehow, the book snuck up on me. Before I knew it, I was one third of the way through. I ignored my usual podcasts on the train and kept reading after I arrived at home. One day I found myself purposely not going into the office so I could just read for three more minutes.Why so catchy? I have no clue. In the end, it is simply immensely likable.Clarke delivers a heady and smooth mix of historical and speculative fiction. A book well worth reading. Use patience, and give it a little bit of time to work its magic. Suitable for both teenagers and adults, and recommended for anyone with a sweet tooth for smart speculative fiction."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is an excellent book. Its sense of humor is dry, its language is incredible, its world feels complete, and its characters are both fascinating and believable. In short, it's all the best of recent fantasy, and it now has a place of honor among my most-loved and most-reread books.Unfortunately, it's also all the worst of old fantasy. Think only a few steps removed from the level of the Silmarillion, but with jokes. Especially towards the beginning, the novel is slow, and focuses on a character who is harder to sympathize with than most. The fact that it kept my attention in spite of this is nothing short of amazing. That said, it may not keep yours, so if you have any doubts, check the book out from the library first.Basically: I loved it. You might, too, but find out before you buy it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I have to say, I didn't really get into this book until after pg. 100. In fact, I had read 30 pgs., put it down for a month, and only picked it up when I left for a week on a business. Goodness, I am happy I picked it up again.Like many have said, it's not the requisite page-turner like so many books seem to be these days. With that being said, I always come back to it - the next day, before bed, while commuting - with the same interest I left it. The story, the events have become so realized in my mind, that they seem to be entirely believeable works of non-fiction. So convincing is Clark in her masterful art of storytelling, that I truly love each page I read.I highly recemmend it to even the most impatient, distracted person. Just give it some time - you'll surely fall in love as I did."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"JS & Mr.N is an excellent book, you can tell immediately that the author took 10 years to finish it. The footnotes are an amazing plus. With that said, it is not a book for everyone. I know several people who have tried to get through it without success. Not that I'm saying they're not dedicated, but it does slow down a bit in the middle but the wait is well worth it.I hope there's a sequel!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"as evidenced by some of the reviews, but yay for the lucky group that do. I think if you don't get it, it's because you haven't given due time for the themes to unfold--and I know that is not an easy thing for a lot of people (including me sometimes).I will say that the first time I read this novel, it was a challenge in the beginning, because the first half of the novel is much more of a social satire that uses magic as its catalyst, with very little actual magic going on, not mention the rather hard-to-wrap-your-arms-around first magician, Mr. Norrell.But by the time I finished, every piece that was laid out over the course of the story fit, even the plot ends that were deliberately left hanging. It was absolutely tremendous, and listening to the audio book was just as rewarding, even more so in some ways. I really can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I do not know how long it has been since i enjoyed a book like this one.

Miss. Clarke does such a wonderfull job weaving a story colored with actual Historic figures and dates that at times you are in awe of what she has accomplished. Suffice to say I loved this book up until the last fifty or so pages. I will not expound further only this is a read worth taking a journey worth going on but if we are going to travel through england and europe in the early 1800s for 780 pages then why not finish the job and go the extra 220 pages and complete a novel worth completing.What would the Raven King have to say?"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is not worth the 800 page investment of time. The plot is developed agonizingly slowly and there are myriad unnecessary details about period, dress, and interior design. The last 150 pages are superbly done, and almost able to stand on their own. Only if you have great patience, should you attempt to read the entire book...."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Most fantasy strikes for the bad ripoffs of Tolkien, or other well-known (though not always great) authors.But Susanna Clarke dazzles in a subtle way in her debut novel, \\"Jonathan Clarke & Mr. Norrell,\\" a sprawling opus that took a decade to write. Think if Jane Austen had written fantasy about feuding magicians, and you'll have a pretty good idea of how this reads.It's the early 19th century, in England. The Napoleonic wars threaten England, but that's not the only struggle going on. Magic is all but dead in England; the so-called magicians don't actually want to handle it, but want to leave it to old books and stories. Once the English magicians were powerful and respected, but now they just write boring essays about magic. Except for Mr. Norrell, a cautious little Yorkshire man who taught himself how to do magic.However, things take a twist when he gives his help in the battle against Napolean -- a new magician enters the scene, the enthusiastic and charming Jonathan Strange. The two magicians begin to work together, but things begin to go awry when Mr. Norrell realizes that Jonathan is attracted to all magic -- including the more dangerous varieties. He's increasingly fascinated by the legend of the Raven King, a changeling child who ruled Faerie and Earth...Historical fantasies have rarely been as detailed and rich as this one -- usually either the \\"historic\\" or the \\"fantasy\\" is abused. Often the best authors can do is write alternate universe stories where America lost the Revolution, the Roman Empire never fell, and so on.But Susanna Clarke shatters that with her richly-realized look at 19th-century Britain, with unique magic and a slight mythologic twist. This is an England where, even though magic is stagnant, it's still something of rich power, awesome presence, and the creatures involved in it are completely otherworldly.Clarke keeps her writing solid, detailed and dignified, also footnoting extensively, with little wry winks and nudges to keep the book from being too serious. It does get tedious at times, and the finale gets a bit stretched out, but the positive far outweighs the negative. She has a flair for the historical parts of the book, keeping dates, battles, and political movement entwined in the plot.But she doesn't neglect the fantasy either; there's a mythic flavor in the story of the Raven King and the old magicians, reminiscent of old legends from ancient times. Her handling of magic is especially good -- less is more, and hints of past greatness make the magic all the more stunning.The title characters are the best of the book -- both are products of their times. Mr. Norrell is cautious, studious, ingenious and quiet, the sort of person you could imagine chatting with some classic author. Strange has more of the wild, society-be-damned wit that characterized some great artists of that time. And Norrell's faithful servant is just one of many solid supporting characters.If Jane Austen had written like Diana Wynne-Jones, the result would have been something like \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.\\" Well-written, enticing and thoroughly original, this is a keeper."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The story pulled me in like a tractor beam and it was almost impossible for me to stop reading this wonderfully written magical fantasy. Susanna Clarke makes the impossible seem plausible and even believable with her matter-of-fact style and impeccable attention to detail. For the magickally and metaphysically minded reader, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell should prove to be an exceptionally satisfying and delightful diversion into other mysterious worlds and fantasy. Some have called this Harry Potter for adults and I cannot entirely disagree, but this style of writing far exceeds the Potter series which was, after all, written with children in mind. For readers who enjoy faeries, good literature, magic and English historical literature I believe this will be a valued addition to their collections."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"As a lover of 18th and 19th century literature, I was very happy with this book. I read it as a prose experiment on the order of Possession, or some other such title. It is fantasy fiction in that it employs elements of the magical and surreal (it is about the relationship between two magicians and an enemy from the fairy kingdom). It is in part historical fiction utilizing fictitious characters along with historical characters in the manner of Sophia Lee. I read this book immediately on the heels of reading Camilla, by Frances Burney, and so I was struck at how well she captured the prose style of that same time period. Frances Burney would have been alive at the time in which the novel's events take place. She was even part of Napoleon's court for a time, and Napoleon is very involved in this story.I was impressed at how Clarke's prose in this book resembles Burney's, and I believe it was because they are both writers of comedies. With one exception, all of Burney's works were comedies, and Clarke's book is in fact a comedy written in period prose. However, Clarke's book is funnier because it caters to more modern sensibilities. It employs a more modern humor, though still written and packaged in the style of another age. As good as it is, Johnathan Strange & Mr. Norrell would never have been published during the times that it describes. I remember one passage in which the author comments on the poverty of the royal princes, who were obliged to support households full of illegitimate children. Such a sartorial comment would never have made it into print in early 19th century England.This book has been described as a sort of Harry Potter for adults, but I don't know about that. Certainly it shares some elements with the Harry Potter story. I think it is a very different story and the comparison with the Harry Potter books is a bit of a stretch. The novel just has a different quality and is really trying to achieve something else in terms of the prose and its play with mythic themes. While reading it I wondered what A.S. Byatt might say about it. You might remember the fuss that she made over the Potter books. Would she perceive this novel as being more \\"tasteful\\", or \\"highbrow\\"? I don't know.It is very much a historical novel, and among other things, it's good comedy. I didn't find the prose boring at all, nor even slow-paced. I found this book so engrossing that I finished it in 3 days, and this is an 800 page novel! Even if you don't like Harry Potter, you may still enjoy this book very much especially if you are a reader of classics and the so-called \\"serious\\" fiction."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is Clarke's first novel, and what a doozy it is. The novel is focused on the two title characters and their interactions in early 19th century England, and Clarke makes them wonderfully fleshed out and flawed characters, who we cheer for, want to yell at, and laugh with. The story is complex, and the fact that this is a fantasy novel should not deter anyone. It contains some great writing, reminiscent of Jane Austen, with a dark and pervasive sense of fear that the magic evokes. This isn't Harry Potter's magic, this is some dark and dangerous stuff, and this sets the book apart from most fantasy (for the record, I refuse to read most fantasy, and that which I have read is rather shoddily written and cliched).The only major flaw with the book is that it ends. While the end works, I would have preferred to spend more time with the characters and the world, which captures the early 19th century English attitude towards science and knowledge and portrays accurately how it would react to magic instead.The book isn't for everyone. Her style hearkens back to the 19th century, and again Jane Austen is a suitable comparison. Her comedic sense is also here, but above all her style dominates. While some will find this to be tedious and boring, many will enjoy it and the rather comic descriptions of English high society, and for those, this book is written. All we can hope for is that Clarke writes another book as good as Jonathan Strange."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell isn't a self-contained story. That's not to say that the ending is anything less than satisfying, for virtually all plot threads are neatly addressed, if not tied up. It's just that the level of education and exposure to literature necessary to understand and enjoy this book is much higher than the usual fantasy fare, or indeed, higher than for most literature written in the last fifty years.Have you ever finished a Dickens novel and wished the story could have gone on? Did you think that Victor Hugo had the right kind of pacing? Does Dumas seem a little terse? If you answered \\"no\\" to any of these questions, then you may not appreciate Strange and Norrell. The \\"faux academic\\" style that another reviewer cited is actually a very passable imitation of the writing style of the Victorian era. The pacing and vocabulary are likewise Victorian.And why not? The frame of the story, very subtly presented, is that the author of the novel is writing at some point in the future of the events described. In other words, it is an historical novel from another universe, one in which magic is a commonplace idea, if not a commonplace occurrence. The tone of the author is that the reader is expected to know much about the lives and history of famous magical figures, or at least to have learned their stories in grammar school. And at the same time, we are not expected to know anything of certain concepts more familiar to us, such as Native Americans or haggis. Susannah Clarke does this with a wink, while her persona of author in her own story writes blithely on.Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is truly Dickensian in scope, with characters introduced whose payoff occurs hundreds of pages later. This is a novel that rewards the attentive reader, and equally rewards a second reading. If you have the 35 hours to devote to it, I suggest the audiobook version, in which the characters are brought to life by Simon Prebble.If you have any doubts, check it out from the library first.

I can't believe the amount of information found in this book, and I really found the footnotes very helpful, and conveniently located at the bottom of the same page you're readingHere in this book, we see the struggle of practice vs. theory. One magician is innovative, willing to experiment and to spread his magical knowledge, while the other only wants to keep all knowledge to himself. One knows the dangers of conjuring Faeries and other worldly creatures, while the other seeks the help of the dangerous Faeries. (I won't say which one is which).I love when a writer includes famous colorful characters in his or her stories. Clarke includes Duke Wellington, Napoleon, and Lord Byron, the irresolute poet who befriends Strange in Venice. Cross reference to various magicians from the past, gives this book an unprecedented authenticity, considering is a fantasy story. The magic is described so subtlety, that it might appear that such things really happened, and will happen again, unlike Harry Potter, for example.Love Clarke's inventive, from the hilarious flying pineapples , the candles inside people's heads, to the magical fleet, the disappearing roads, all speak of a vivid imagination, and impressive talent as a story teller.Her view of a magical realm is so different from what one expects. No glittering halls, no magic wands, no wizards no rainbows not a single sunny day, or starry nights. All is gloom, sadness and melancholy. Long halls, abandoned gardens, mysterious mirrors, and empty parlors, and in the middle of it all, an enchanted servant and two enchanted ladies longing for their release.After reading this book, you won't look at a cloudy day the same way, and every time you hear the sound of a lonely bell, you will expect to see the gentleman with the thistle down hair wearing a bright green coat coming your way.5 stars"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"WARNING: If you haven't read many 19th-century authors, or if you have trouble with the writing style of a lot of classic literature, then this probably isn't the book for you. To me, the humor in this book was the best thing about it, but chances are you simply won't \\"get\\" the humor if you aren't into 19th-century prose. Everything, from the characters to the action to the landscapes, was described with such perfectly dry wit that I was in a constant state of delight, even through the darkest parts. I can understand how those who mostly read mainstream, contemporary literature might find this book boring. But, if you're someone who enjoys regency-style writing, all I can say is be prepared to be impressed, astonished, and entranced by this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I loved this. I tend to be a reader of modern-setting fantasy, and this worked for me in the same way that does by way of the various historical personages and detail that went into it--the research here is obvious. There's a detached, dry ironic humor running through it in the vein of Jane Austen (and the footnotes with the same put me in mind of Terry Pratchett), and the writing style also is well in line with novels of the time period it's placed in (early 1800's). It's spooky and believable in all the right places--the premise seems out there to begin with, but the attention to detail makes it quite believable. I'm rarely completely satisfied with the ending of a novel, especially a fat monster of a book like this one, but the end was perfect. And don't give up after the first couple hundred pages--the story kicks into a much higher gear after Strange appears on the scene, while the earlier parts are more introduction for characters who become much more important later in the story. While definitely a fantasy, it also holds lots of era-appropriate social parrying and lavish detail to what seems to us trivial things, which may be a turnoff to some. For me, it only enhanced the period feel. While a little slow in the beginning, the pacing is generally very even throughout, only speeding up a bit at the end; for me, it made the various characters and storylines much easier to keep track of.I can't say that I heard the \\"Harry Potter for adults\\" comparison before I read this; however, if that's what you're looking for, this is not it. personally, I fail to see the comparison, though I enjoy Harry Potter very much--this is just in a totally different ballpark. This is not necessarily an easy read, though it's one where you get out of it what you put into it. If you have horrible memories of being forced to read Victorian novels for school or by a parent, this is not for you. If books like The Moonstone, Pride & Prejudice, and A Study In Scarlet hold prized places on your shelves, by all means quit reading this review and go get this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It seems to me that the numerous reviews I've seen and heard comparing this book to the Potter series must have done so simply because the reviewers didn't know where else to pigeonhole the book. I've read and enjoyed all the Potter books, don't get me wrong. But I would sooner compare THIS book to a Jane Austen novel than a Potter-esque story. Yes, it's about magic... but the style, which some have found tedious, is far more formal. It is a quasi-\\"scholarly\\" book, which may obscure the story for some, but I really enjoyed the footnotes and the archaicisms -- though some have found them tedious too. It is more work than the average bestseller, in short -- but to my mind, well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This novel is absolutely, utterly transporting, and written by someone who clearly understands the power of tone. I really can't recommend it highly enough.It's important to understand that this is not a novel that attempts to be a \\"fantasy\\" story in the sense that modern readers have come to expect. It's definitely fantastic, and its wry, pseudo-scholarly tone has echoes of some of the best British fantasy of the early century (and, in the way that scions of the same man resemble each other, evokes shades of the Harry Potter novels without being anything like them.)The book is at once a parody and a celebration of a certain sort of literature, and is meant to be read by people for whom the act of reading almost awakens their sense of taste. If you are such a person, and if you have an affection for folklore and the contradictions of power, you might expect to find in this book a rich supply of paragraphs worth reading aloud to an empty room."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I wanted to mention, though I'm not sure how many people will get through 540 reviews to find mine, that if possible it is better to read the hardcover edition of this book. It is yes, a long book, and in my opinion wonderfully long, but having the smooth raven on the cover, as well as the rough edged pages to enjoy, made the book nice company.Odd comment? Maybe, but this is a fantastically odd book. I'm an Austen and Dickens fan like many of the other readers, and I feel that Susanna Clarke stands well with those authors. I'm only a bit sad that this is her first book. It will be a long summer waiting for the next to come out in October.-Stephanie"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"If I were unfortunate enough to be in a housefire tomorrow, I would grab precious family heirlooms and my copy of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. That's how much I love this book.As it has been stated many times before, this it a truly unique piece of work. Some weird mixture of Jane Austin's social comedy, alternate history, and Tolkien's natural magic and mythical grandeur produces something close to this novel. It has so many levels and themes it's impossible to summarize them all in one space; just take a look at the other reviews!A note of warning: This is not a book for very impatient readers who don't like anything but contemporary style. Ms. Clarke makes use of the language and even the archaic spelling of the Napoleonic Era, giving the impression that the book was written during that time. I find it delightful, certain readers will find it unbearable. If you do like it, the language is a rich treat in itself, so to me this is a \\"winter book\\", best savored in front of a fire on cold grey days. (though it's great anytime)I especially like how Ms. Clarke makes her characters so complex. The cast is huge and covers every personality and social standing, but we learn the background and motivation for each individual. Notice that even the 'good' and 'bad' characters are truly human: every one of them has personality flaws as well as good traits. Overall, very satisfying. Definately a book I plan to pass on like an heirloom."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I think this book is wonderfully written, with all of its clever asides, and that the author created quite a fascinating world. It is very long, however, and takes a great deal of patience to read, especially the first third of the book. Be warned that this is not a fast-moving book, though the action improves a bit once the two magicians meet each other.An interesting read if you have several days to devote to it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrel is not the DaVinci Code. And that is a good thing. In my opinion, The DaVinci Code represents everything that's wrong with modern literature: The honored author simply has no idea how to write a good book and is using cheap tricks to keep readers interested and, well, reading. In the davinci code every single chapter ends in a cliffhanger, a technique of which I grew tired after chapter three, and despised after finishing the book. But this is not supposed to be a bashing of respective work, it is supposed to praise Jonathan Strange, a work that managed to captivate me without the slightest hint of foul play.I admit, the novel has a slow start if you are used to the likes of the davinci code. The plot takes its time to unfold, but for crying out loud, it has all right to do so. There is no need to rush. Everybody who takes down a book from a shelf has the time to read and finish it - putting it down for a while doesn't mean that the plot will run away from you, it will still be there the next day. Once the plot does, however, unfold, it is captivating. I experienced everything with the characters while the story went on, I suffered with them, was shaken by some events and laughed out loud at other times.The author knows brilliantly how to make her readers feel smart - her use of footnotes (and later references to those) made me feel as if I actually learned something at one time and then later, when it was being referred to, employed that knowledge.There are few books that I have read that are so captivating that I watch in horror how the number of the pages left to read diminishes, to be honest, this is only the second book of that kind. I am 200 pages away from the end, and wish I was still in the beginning.I already find that the covertext gets the narrative wrong and am angered at that.This sort of intense experience of a novel is quite rare nowadays, and I highly recommend this piece of ingenuity to anyone who has a week or two to spare, and is willing to completely immerse into a world familiar to us, yet full of magic.by the way, the language employed by ms clarke is quite honestly one of the most beautiful that I have ever encountered. I am able to smell the smells, feel the cold, see the battlefields and experience the loneliness she is describing, as well as everything else. I applaud this beautiful work."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This vast first novel by former Cookbook editor Susanna Clarke starts a little slow but quickly picks up steam and by the third part has you strapped in and holding on for the wild ride. Yes, it does take a little patience and faith to stay with to the end, but in my opinion its worth the effort.Much of the novel is invented Magic history told mostly through the use of footnotes, citing a whole library of imagined texts. But the main focus is on the title characters and of course the subject of part 3, John Uskglass aka The Raven King. These characters are drawn deftly, but my favorites are among the minor players. Such figures as John Childermass, Norrell's dark and faithful servant; the bluish tinged Vinculus, a street magician; and the scheming, dubious gentleman Lascelles amass to create an almost Shakespearean cast in its breadth and support to the main story.I believe the author leaves the ending wide open for at least a Book 2 of this epic tale. One can only hope."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"After shifting through many reviews I came to this conclusion, you either love or hate this book. I am definitely in the former group. In fact, personally I wonder how any could not love this wonderful piece of fiction?My guess is that a large group of people misunderstand the intent of the author (and that don't find humor in the genre of satire). Ms.Clarke does not intend to deliver a fast-paced good vs. evil epic. Nothing could be further from the truth... instead she has given us a high comedy/satire on English life. Comedy with some magic is how the reader should approach the 1st page.And make no mistake, I found this to be the funniest book I have read in years - I actually laughed out loud! It reminds me of Mark Twain's, \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's court\\" both are psuedo-serious on the subject of British life (Different periods of course) but both are full of satire. I find these two books have much more in common than \\"Strange & Norrell\\" would have with \\"Harry Potter\\".Ultimately, I feel that this is the reason for the negative reviews. Satire is a close cousin to sarcasm and in both cases you either get it or you don't. Many people simply don't find this type of humor funny, therefore, they hate this book and find it unbearably boring.Personally, I can't remember a book written in the last 10 years that I have enjoyed more. Like some of the other reviewers I am reading it much slower than my typical pace... not because I find it \\"Hard\\" to read, but simply, I really didn't want it to end!My final opinion- If you liked Dickens, Austen, or even Mark Twain... you will LOVE, \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\". If you find reading these authors a form of personal torture...stay far, far away."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Most books, I think, suffer when wrapped in hyperbole from the press. Very, very few of them can live up. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, however, not only lives up, it surpasses anything wonderful written about it. There are simply no words to describe how glorious this book is. And, make no mistake, this is definitely not, \\"Harry Potter for grownups.\\" The magic is different, it's darker, and it's far more wintry, despite Clarke's occasional, and charming, flights of fancy.The tone of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell reminded me far more of Jane Austen and Charles Dickens (two of Clarke's favorite authors) than it did of J.K.Rowling. For one thing, there's nothing modern about this book. The tone and atmosphere are definitely nineteenth century. Even the spelling of many words is nineteenth century, e.g., \\"chuse\\" for \\"choose\\" and \\"shewed\\" for \\"showed.\\" Although many readers may find this annoying, I loved it and thought it added greatly to the charm and authenticity of the book.Clarke seamlessly weaves her own magical world into actual history. So seamlessly that there were times when I caught myself actually believing in Clarke's make believe world. The book is replete with footnotes, something I usually detest. However, Clarke's footnotes are delightful and only add to the verisimilitude of her story.Despite the fact that this book numbers nearly eight hundred pages of small type, it's not at all \\"wordy\\" and there is absolutely no \\"filler.\\" Don't, by any means, be intimidated by this book's length. It's so well constructed and so well paced, it's actually a faster read than many books only half its size.The ending, which can't be predicted, is bittersweet, heartbreaking, unforgettable and, best of all, inevitable. It also sets up a sequel, something I read Clarke is working on now. And, although much of the book enjoys a rather leisurely pace, Clarke picks up this pacing near the end, so that the reader, once he or she reaches the last two hundred pages or so, feels almost compelled to finish the book, no matter what he or she has to do or how late at night it is.Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is, quite simply, a \\"ripping good yarn,\\" masterfully crafted and flawlessly written by a woman who promises to be one of today's most imaginative storytellers. Don't miss it; to do so would only be denying yourself one of the greatest pleasures in the world of literature. Yes, it really is that good."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Okay, you have to have a marathon-attitude when you pick up this book--it's an 800 page whopper. However every single word, every single page is worth the time it takes to read it. It is the first book in a long time that had me fully engaged, was so good I felt no need to skim paragraphs, or skip pages.The writer is a genius with words. She brings you back to the era of Jane Austen, with all the civility and politeness of the time, and weaves in a story about magic and magicians as if it is as natural as the countryside. It is utterly wonderful, singsong prose, with a dance between two imperfect characters whom you cannot help liking regardless.If you are a big reader, you cannot miss this book; it doesn't matter if you care for straight fiction or fiction of the more fantastic kind--you'll enjoy it. What a breath of fresh air.Thank you Susanna Clarke."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I think it is very misleading to dub this book \\"The Harry Potter for adults.\\" In both books, great magic is done and the setting is England. I suppose that being written by a female author also adds some Harry-Potterishness to it but there the similarity stops. Far from being a page turner, this book is most appropriate for those who relish words; those who love rhythmic sounds and smooth, meandering sentence structures. You can't be in a hurry to finish it because skimming and skipping paragraphs will cause you to miss some great stuff. Off the top of my head, I can't think of a single other book that it is similar to so hats off too Susanna Clarke for writing such an original work.The characters were so well drawn, they felt like they would pop off the pages and step into your living room. (Indeed, maybe Strange would drop in via my mirror?) Norrell, the old-school and stuffy teacher, is contrasted so well with Strange that the dynamics of their relationships offers much insight into the teacher/pupil relationship. Perhaps my favorite thing of all is how completely and utterly realized this world of Susanna's is. She's built a whole alternate history for England complete with faeries and an inscrutable nameless king.A summary of the plot has already been done so I will not reiterate it here. Actually, I think that you get more out of the book if you know nothing of the plot beforehand. I do have one complaint. I felt like I knew these people so well that sometimes, I felt their actions didn't correspond to their characters. The mere fact that Norrell took Strange as a pupil still baffles me a bit, but it served the plot well. Overall, I think to be precise, I would actually give this book 4.51 stars."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The problem with so many reviews and advertising on this book is that they bring to mind Harry Potter and other fantasy-genre novels. But that will set a reader up for disappointment - this is not your usual fantasy book. It's a work of literature, and an enchanting one at that.Like many of the great classical novels, it can be a bit difficult to get into, but it's worthwhile to continue until you have become absorbed by Clarke's style of writing and the world in which she places you. She's really quite clever, and her sense of humor is witty and subtle. The characters (especially after the first 1/3 of the book, when the action picks up and many things are really starting to happen all over) are very interesting and each has their own individual personality. And they aren't static, which I find most realistic. All the many characters that appear throughout the book either grow or fail as human beings in a world both longing for and fearing the return of English magic and the aid of fairies.Clarke has so perfectly developed this England, both in complicated past and intricate present, with a number of minor storylines and character plots building up to who-knows-what-end... The resolutions are not cheap, nor easy. None of the characters are perfectly good or bad - they are themselves, with their own system of logic and reasoning that lends to their choices.The magic herein is not as flamboyant as in many novels in the fantasy genre. Magic is, after all, a skill that has been nearly forgotten and is only now being re-learned, with only two practicing magicians able to figure it out, using the old books of ages long gone, and occasionally some rash guesswork. But as they both develop their skills, the magic grows increasingly more complicated and impressive. This is a story not merely of magic... but of gentlemen, of resolution for England's mysterious magical past, of moral conflicts, of supernatural dangers and delights, and most especially, a new way of approaching a subject that in many similar genre books has become tired imitation."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I find it very odd that many of the previous reviewers said that they were unable to care about the characters in this book. I can't recall a book in which I cared about the characters _more_. They seemed like real people, and the footnotes (which I thought brilliant) simply made them seem more so. Not only did the characters seem real, but so did the world that Ms. Clarke created for them (or did she create the characters for the world, one wonders?). I am a voracious reader and have seldom, if ever, seen an imaginary world as fully realized as this--not even books with a modern, realistic setting are as convincing when it comes to perfectly rendered, but invisibly deployed details. This is the first book that I've read since I was a teenager that felt \\"right,\\" the first that I've wanted to hug when I finished it and the first that I ever had the (unfullfilled) urge to copy out onto my walls in tiny gold writing. I cannot deny that this book is not for everyone--a reader must like omniscient narrators, be sufficiently interested in details to explore (and enjoy!) the footnotes, and not be afraid of the rhythms of slightly formal speech and poetic description--but the rewards for those who _do_ read it are manifold. This book--with it's intricate setting, believable characters and gripping story--may become the standard by which I judge all following books that I read.An aside (or footnote, if you will): I believe that retail books are sold shrink-wrapped for one of two reasons. Either the book contains photographs or other pages that would be tempting to tear out, or (as in this case) the shrink-wrap serves to prevent the book from warping under its own weight if placed at the end of a row. I doubt that any bookseller, much as they might like to, would shrink-wrap something to obscure its lack of worth. :)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Advice to the aspiring writer - if you must write an 800-page novel, take care with the structure of your narrative. I made it 360 pages into Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell. Napoleon had been defeated, but there were still 400+ pages to go, and I had no inkling what the point of the rest of the book would be. They were looking into a magical cure for the Madness of King George, but I didn't know whether that would become a major theme, or just a digression. There was a seemingly malevolent fairy lurking in the background, who might have become a major threat to British society; but again, I couldn't tell for sure, and didn't care enough to keep reading.Further, I found the magic incredible -- that is, I didn't believe it. If Muhammad himself can't move a mountain, there's no way in Hades some English twit will be relocating Spanish mountain ranges without breaking a sweat.The point when I gave up was when I fell asleep toward the end of a chapter, and the tome hit the floor with a resounding thud and scared the cat. It was due back at the library, and I didn't choose to renew it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I'm not sure I can do this book justice. It is utterly unique, combining aspects of fantasy and period novels without truly belonging to either genre. The pacing and language are from another era--a slower, more eloquent one. I was completely captivated by Susanna Clarke's world from the first page to the last, and can't wait for her next book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I just stopped reading this book on page 721. That's right I stopped with only about 60 pages to go, after having read every footnote and every word up to that point. Why? I just couldn't spend another hour of my life on this book. I skipped to the end and read the last few pages and found that it didn't matter that I stopped reading because nothing is really resolved at the end anyway. I would seem to be the perfect audience for this book. I love 19th century British novels and their elevated language and leisurely pace and I love the fantasy works of Mervyn Peake and John Crowley that some readers find difficult. The primary problem for me with this novel is that the characters are not human beings, but children's cartoon characters. They have no adult passions or emotional complexities. This novel is too philosophically and emtionally simplistic for adults and too slow and convoluted for children. I don't understand what these people are who are giving it five star reviews are seeing in it. If you want to spend days and days of your life reading a really long adult fantasy novel, there are several I'd suggest instead: The Gormenghast Trilogy by Peake, Little, Big by Crowley, The Little Country by Charles DeLint, Wreaththu by Storm Constantine, Imajica by Clive Barker or Bellefleur by Joyce Carol Oates. All of these novels should appeal to anyone who would pick up Clarke's book and these are MUCH better. Go check out other people's reviews of these novels and then do yourself a big favor and buy one of them instead of this nicely packaged, but pointless and forgettable, tome."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I tried to like this book, I really did. I got 50% through it and still barely anything had happened. The story wasn't drawing me in and the characters were mainly unlikeable. The comparisons to Harry Potter are ludicrous except for the fact that it mentions magic. I got the subtle humor but it certainly never made me laugh or even smile.I appreciate that it's written in the style of the 19th century. I've read some of those books and in some cases you realize why people stopped writing books like that. It reminded me of another big thick book about 'Faerie' that I also gave up on. I think that was a classic novel but I can't remember the title and I wish that I could.Very disappointing"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This review is simply concerned with the kindle version, not the content. Some of the fun aspects of the book in print are the arcane and amusing faux footnotes. In the Kindle, the numbers should be a link to the footnote text, but they are not. One has to go to the table of contents, find the footnotes section, then search for that number. Come on, guys, this isn't rocket science."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I read this book about a month ago and have been meaning to get my thoughts out about it for a while. First of all, I really enjoyed reading it. It was great. Great characters, interesting setting, creative and original dialogue and the layout of the book (with footnotes containing many tidbits of information that contributed to the backstory) was innovative and engrossing. The book just overall had a good \\"feel\\" to it, and some nights I put the book down truly feeling \\"ah well, back to reality\\".I couldn't give it five stars though because it did feel that there was something lacking from it. And I think that \\"something\\" was, funnily enough, plot. The characters are brilliant, the setting, the description, the ideas, but the actual STORY seemed to lack something. I had trouble putting my finger on what it was. Some books just grab you and drag you along for the whole ride without letting go. I think of books like Stephen King's Desperation, Yann Martel's Life of Pi, Chuck Palahniuk's Lullaby, the settings and characters in these books are all stellar, but it's the story that keeps you up nights. That central compelling story was the element that was somewhat lacking in Strange and Norrell.It's as though the author (Susanna Martin) had twenty boxes of really cool ornaments, but a somewhat scraggly, undernourished christmas tree to hang them off.Nevertheless, I'd heartily recommend the book to anyone who wants a big juicy novel to lose themselves in at days end, and particularly those who enjoy science fiction/fantasy novels. If there is a sequal (no spoilers, but hard to imagine), I think this element would be improved upon and would make this book otherwise an instant classic."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I have one thing to say........get the audio version. I would never have gotten through the print. But, narrated by Simon Prebble, this was entertaining. I thought the characters were animated, well defined and there were more than a few times where I thought the situations were just plain funny (see Drawlite meeting Norrell, pushing himself into his house, telling everyone he already knew him, etc). The humour is perhaps, English for lack of a better word (I'm somehow reminded of that old sitcom, 'Are you being served?'The plot did not lack complexity and was well done, characters were rounded, believable and the story was not lacking in suspense and wait. There were a few times where it dragged a bit (geez this is a long story), but I never kept listening and always found it interesting. Got kind of dark near the end. I'd definitely go see the movie (which is being filmed now) and will probably buy a copy of the CD."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The promo copy describes 'Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell' as \\"Jane Austen meets J.R.R.

I've read some people took a long time to finish or quit reading after a while, but I couldn't put down this 800+ page book, and it never stalled for me. Some say it's like Harry Potter for grown-ups, and Ms. Clarke has created quite the History of English Magic for her readers to explore. And the many interesting characters: Mr. Segundus, Mr. Norrell, Childermass, Drawlight, Lascelles, Sir Walter and Lady Pole, Stephen Black, Vinculus, Jonathan and Arabella Strange, the Gentleman with the Thistle-down Hair&hellip;! Don't miss the footnotes for some foreshadowing and the numerous back and side stories. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"edge of seat thrill ridenot this onepatience will reward"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The first thing any first-time novelist needs to know about writing an 800-page novel is that it has to be written in such a way that the reader, when he's on page 750, still remembers - and cares about - what happened on page 50. Susanna Clarke hasn't quite achieved that. This is an interesting book, in some ways, but it's far too ambitious and falls flat in many places. This story could have been told more effectively in half the space.I'll admit that adult fantasy fiction is not my usual cup of tea, so the fact that I didn't find much to cheer about in this book shouldn't turn off diehard fans of the genre. Still, any book that wins the Book Sense award should have a mass appeal that transcends any one specific audience. The Book Sense award should go to a book that an independent bookseller would recommend, without reservation, to any customer looking for a good read. This isn't such a book.And what's the deal with all the footnotes? Sure, it was a cute gimmick the first couple of times. It provided an original way of providing insightful background on the story, and gave the novel a certain authoritative feel to it. But after, say, the first twenty pages it just grew tiresome. Few of the footnotes were actually integral to the story, so they became more of a distraction than anything. I'm not even sure why I read all of them - it's not like I read footnotes in non-fiction."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is clearly not for someone looking for a quick mindless read. Coming in at over 700 pages, it is a complex tale of english magic written in a way that doesn't insult the reader.The author doesn't embellish the spells the magicians use, but does allows the reader to fully grasp their effect. Although long, the book is not so full of characters and strange names (no pun indended) that you get lost. You get a good understanding of the nature of all of the characters without getting bogged down in the minutia.This was a good read and held my attention for the entire month it took me to read it. I look forward to more work from this author."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Few books make it onto my \\"read every couple of years/give to my children\\" list. This one didn't take long to jump onto that list.Other reviewers can tell you about the plot... though it is slow to develop, it is there, consistently throughout the book. The characters are a delight, and the story is rich with detail both historical and magical (sometimes melding the two).What I loved about this novel was the resemblence it bore to some of Tolkien's lesser known stories like Smith of Wootton Major & Farmer Giles of Ham... short, fairy-laden tales of otherworldy magic.Buy this book, start reading and give it a chance. Totally worth every minute spent reading."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I finished this huge story in just a few days. The characters were so unique, I wanted to spend time with them. I didn't know who to side with in the end, but I loved the swift slide from like to dislike, real to surreal, and life to death to life again. I loved the use of nature as a conduit to the magical realm of things, and I was consistently caught up in the smooth storytelling. The conclusion was open-ended, which sets it up for a hefty sequel. Clarke has an imagination that stays far afield of the usual and yet lends itself to believeable events that make the reader wonder, \\"How real is real?\\""},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"What more can I say? It is the most amazing reading experience I have had in YEARS. A masterful blend of all kinds of the most skilled voices: Austen, Dickens, Hawthorn -- and yet, completely unique and inventive.

Those who are bewildered or under-whelmed (or over-whelmed) need to find another time when they can leisurely read this book (which it deserves) and savor each individual word and episode to fully appreciate its magic!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"When I finished this novel, I was faced with the same challenge that many others faced upon completion. Did I like this book? Yes! 4 out of 5 stars! No! 1 out of 5! Either of these ratings I could identify and completely understand. I'll split the middle and call it 3 out of 5 stars, because even now, I'm not sure how to rate it.The Plot (with very minor spoilers):It is the early 1800's in England. The country is currently at war with Napoleon and France. There is an elite, invitation only society of non-practicing magicians in England. This society is made up of the male aristocrats of England who get a lot of pleasure out of calling themselves magicians. These magicians do not practice magic like the ariates did in the early 1000's, they study it from books.The ariates were the elite of England's magicians, and they came after the greatest English magician ever known, The Raven King. The Raven King was a child kidnapped by the fairie and raised in their land. The King was able to conquer and hold 3 different lands, which were Northern England, Fairie, and a kingdom on the far side of Hell. Don't be fooled when I mention Fairie and the land's inhabitants. Fairies were often summoned to serve the Raven King and many of the historical magicians used them as well. They are creatures that appear much like like humans, with the exception of their crazy eyebrows. Fairies are strong in magic and very low in morals (at least they are different than ours). Many revel in violence for sport and they can ruin a life with perfectly good intensions. The land itself is a strange creepy place. The Fairie roads can lead to Heaven or Hell or Earth, and they are filled with bleak rivers, gray skies, and dead forests. There are burrows where the Fairies live, old ruined castles under the ground where endless dances are held with only the music of sad pipes and violins. The courtyards are full of murdered soldiers in armor, impaled on spears, or hung from trees, and some of Fairie's most violent massacres of women and children are celebrated and reenacted on a nightly basis.Things change for England's society of magicians when an actual practicing English magician, Mr. Norrell, is discovered. Mr. Norrell receives an invitation to report to the society to prove himself. Mr. Norrell makes a deal with the society, and by performing an actual act of magic the society agrees to disband itself. Mr. Norrell has spent his life's work to become the only practicing magician in England and he would mostly like to keep it that way. He buys up every book in the country containing any spells or secrets. One of his greatest wishes is to be useful to England so he offers his assistance to the English government. Norrell is a boring, unpersonable sort, known for going on long lectures about English magic, and he does not have any connections in English society. There are a couple of questionable men who do, who are quick to associate themselves with him and take him to all the social affairs. This still doesn't get him anywhere so he is forced to perform a very noticeable magical act to get the government's attention. This goes against Norrells style and feelings of what English magic should be about, but he has become desperate. A member of England's government has just lost his beloved wife, and Norrell is able to bring her back from death, but at a terrible cost. Norrell used the assistance of a fairie to perform the magic, something which he publicly abhors. Finally he has the government's attention, and he is put to work helping to confuse Napoleon's fleet and armies.Not long after, another practicing magician is discovered, Jonathan Strange. Strange is a somewhat care-free sociable sort who discovers he can do some magic. Undecided and unsuccessful in a career, Strange decides to give magic a whirl. Strange seeks out Norrell and after much interaction Norrell agrees to take Strange on as a pupil. Norrell is very guarded with his knowledge and only shares what he wants with Strange. Norrell believes that magic should be strongly controlled. The ariates were reckless, and The Raven King was abominable. Strange, eager to learn as much as he can, is patient with Norrell, despite wanting more. England's need for help with the war grows and Strange is sent to Spain to serve under The Duke of Wellington. Several years pass and Strange earns great honor in the war against Napoleon, for his impromptu magical acts. Eventually he returns home to find that he has outgrown Norrell, that he can no longer serve as his pupil if he isn't still willing to share more knowledge. Strange believes that the teachings of the old magicians and The Raven King should be sought out and shared. The Fairie paths should be explored to learn more. All magical knowledge should be shared with England. Norrell believes in the complete opposite. The rift between them grows strong and meanwhile, the Fairie which was secretly summoned by Norrell to do his greatest act, is causing more and more deadly havoc in both their lives and the lives of many English men and women. Prophecies of the Raven King and the Unnamed Slave are appearing, and the boundaries between England and Fairie seem to be blurring....The characterization in this book is well done for the most part. The characters are convincingly flawed, but show some acts of courage and honor as well. Whether you identify with any of the 2 main characters is to your taste. The dialog is well done and seems very appropriate for the era. Most of the secondary English characters come off as arrogant and pompous, but have enough unique characteristics to distinguish themselves. There are a few very honorable characters as well that most will enjoy; I was particularly fond of Stephen's character.The writing style itself is unique, but well done. For me, it was very sluggish to get through. Imagine reading a long novel written by C.S. Lewis & Leo Tolstoy and you get what I mean. The magical portions were very descriptive like Lewis, except much darker. The main villain's dialog sounds like a character right out of Narnia, such as the White Witch, but again, much more violent. The magical darker portions were a nice contrast to the lighter writing of the interactions of English society. The parts focusing on society reminded me much of Tolstoy in terms of the length of the book, as well as the span of years the story took place.A unique, charming characteristic of the book was all its footnotes. The footnotes contained information on English history and the false history of the English magicians. This was also one of the most tedious aspects of the books. Often, I would stop in mid sentence and read a 2 page footnote. These often disrupted the story.To sum up a very long post, I liked this book, and I disliked this book. I enjoyed the magic in big doses. It was very descriptive and seemed to fit the time and mood well. I particularly enjoyed the curse that was put on Strange later in the novel, I thought it was brilliant. I enjoyed the dialog but in smaller doses. My biggest complaint for the book was that it was just too long. It seems like it could have been much shorter, containing the same events, without losing the story's appeal. It is a book over 700 pages and I swear, I still didn't know where the book was trying to go by page 600. It is a hard book to read if you don't have several uninterrupted hours. It was just tough to keep my interest, but good enough that I kept coming back. The book did come to a satisfying conclusion, and you have an understanding of what the struggle was about. There was some good tension near the end, and the last 150 pages or so I was able to breeze through. I'm hesitant to recommend it due to my difficulties with it, but I did think it was an excellent story, and a very unique read. Just be patient if you are going to try it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"From first appearances this book appears as a bit of a tome, and to be honest it doesn't disappoint in that respect. An avid fantasy reader, I have never been daunted by 900 pages of delicious escape. However, this book, as suggested in other customer reviews, is by no means predictable with regard to content. I found myself, if not trudging, then at least wading slowly through the first half. I started to become anxious that the book would be no more than an expository British gentleman's account of political and theoretical magic. Creating the atmosphere and setting the stage are well and good, but I personally feel that too much ink was spent on what a person such as myself (i.e. not British) might construe as classical British niceties (i.e. gown and furniture descriptions, tedious exaltation of manners and custom, etc.).The tale seemed to pick up dramatically somewhere about halfway. Tucked in here and there I also found some perfect jewels of witty British humour, most particularly in association with Mr. Strange's sojourn in Spain. More use of colour and texture appeared, and magical things not intended for the \\"greater glory of England\\" became center of focus. Character development also took an upturn as Ms. Clarke very skillfully starts to explore hero/anti-hero aspects of both main characters. That characters go so quickly from being parts of a book to actors (in a manner) which provoke reaction from the reader was a very pleasant surprise.I wish Ms. Clarke might have spent more time developing the faerie magic part of the book, particularly with regard to the prophecy around which the magical tale of the book is centered (perhaps less about the gentleman with the thistle-down hair, of whom we learn critical details only at the very very end). Everything was neatly assembled and explained in the end, but its lack of lead-in momentum gave me the feeling that the big picture suddenly appeared and then disappeared without an appropriate and well-deserved climax.But nit-picking aside I truly enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone with a desire to read something different. As another reviewer suggests, be patient with the first half and you'll get a special treat with the second half."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is in many ways more a piece of historical fiction than it is a 'Harry Potter' or 'Lord of the Rings' style fantasy. There is no wand waving. There are no lightning and fireball battles between wizards. There is no epic 'good versus evil' battle at the end. Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is a character driven story about 'jealousy, ambition, and loss. The magic is almost incidental.Ms. Clarke crafts an alternative version of England at the 'beginning of the 19th century - the twist being that magic has returned to England - that is so wonderfully immersive that you can nearly smell the damp earth and musty libraries.Ms. Clarke has structured the book as a sort of post-action record compiled for posterity. This structure gives Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell it's most remarkable feature - its footnotes. These glorious footnotes explain bits and pieces of magical history to help us, the reader, understand references made by Strange, Norrel, and others. Each one is a jewel of compressed storytelling, a tiny window into the wider magical world beyond the confines of this book.You get the feeling Ms. Clarke could write he own version of The Silmarillion, filling out a complete history of the world she's created.Though the book starts off slowly, the writing is rich enough and the characters intriguing enough to get the reader into the meat of this book. Once there, read slowly to savor the world Ms. Clarke created. The end of the book comes much quicker than one would expect from an 800-odd page novel.Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell masterfully mixes action, drama and comedy into a attention-consuming whole that left me with a wonderfully satisfied feeling."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"If you are a fantasy fan who also enjoys historical or period fiction, this may just be the perfect novel for you. It's an odd novel that blends the realities of English society at the time with fantastic elements in a masterful manner. It made me laugh like Austen while also providing the kind of ponderous yet tongue-in-cheek depictions of Dickens. It didn't keep me up at night--although I've heard that it has for others--and yet I actively looked forward to picking it up again the following evening.I think this novel, well written as it is, is largely a matter of personal taste--but well worth the \\"risk\\" compared to most others."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is precisely the book that might have come out of a response to Bronte's faulting of Austen (all shut up in drawing rooms and privet hedges, with no wild moor or tumbling becks in sight, to paraphrase only slightly).Wild, wild England bookending very British (quintessential age of Britain Britishness) characters and laughing at the magic men have held onto in it's pale weakness no man would accept in his tea.I never read this book before because all the descriptions started in the wrong place. They start with the MacGuffin or Maguffin--Napoleon--if only in reference to the period. Much more to the point is that this is almost to the Regency era, which frames a sense of magic that feels like that of DeLint's Little Country more than that of Harry Potter.And Strange is the \\"bright, rebellious pupil\\". No, that is the wrong start, too. Strange is already a man when he comes into this book (not the child \\"pupil\\" made me assume). While I was thinking he was of the make of Nathaniel in the Bartimaeus Trilogy, instead, he's merely a genius under a scholarly Casaubon type (yet not Casaubon, to my utter relief also, and yet the similarity to a character in one of my other favorite classics drew me to trust this book's voice). He is married by his second appearance, and he has a patience and kindness that I was not expecting. Certainly he's a bit careless, but his contrariness comes of being too bright among the dull. It's not a main feature.The length of this book is essential. It's not drawn out in any sense of the word. It's paced exactly its style and subject demand. I've enjoyed it every page and actually bewildered how fast the end comes.For someone as fond of Austen and Tolkien as I am, this book is like a return to a golden age.

Who could resist??!!It is indeed everything everyone else says about it - beautifully written, civilized, and long - but it is also VERY funny! Clarks takes her time with her setups, and delivers deliciously ironic bits of commentary. I don't believe I managed to get through any 3 consecutive pages without a good laugh.Her portrayal of the fussy, dry, timid, yet driven Mr. Norrel is absolutely hilarious. This old stick of a scholar is propelled by his conviction that he is responsible for the restoral of English Magic. And this drives him to perform acts of magic that seem totally dissonant with his character.And his two sycophants - Drawlight and Lascelles - are hilariously fruity and delicious! His interactions with these 2 tulips of fashion (Norrell is totally social inept, and is effortlessly manipulated by these shameless coattail riders) are endlessly amusing.Next to Mr. Norrell, Jonathan Strange is nearly a straight man. But his capability for single-mindedness (or absent-mindedness), and interaction with his constantly gentle and ironically affectionate wife brings lightness to him as well.Clarke's book is filled with well-realized and memorable characters, from the practical and impatient Lord Wellington and the gently mad King, to Sir Pole and his capable butler Stephen Black - all so well introduced into the story that the reader never feels that there are too many characters or sub-plots running, though there certainly are plenty!Despite its length, and the many footnotes, every scrap of it is readable and enjoyable. It is impossible to declare this book belongs to any particular genre. It has elements of the historical novel - and, to my mind, some of the best elements; the day-to-day concerns, furnishings of the houses, clothing and parties and conversations and surroundings of the times and places - elements of mystery, fantasy (of course), and comedy. Indeed, it \\"belongs\\" to no genre at all, which is in this case the highest of compliments."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I want to write SO MUCH about this book. It has history, magic, deep characters, style, involving plots, feuds - everything to keep most readers of any age extremely interested. Even the tiny-fonted and intimidating footnotes were entertaining!I would go into more detail and describe specific parts that I like about the book, but I don't want to spoil anything and it would be better for potential readers out there just to go ahead and read it! By page 800-something, I was wishing the book would go on for 800 more pages."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I long to write a long and rapturous review about this magnificent & wonderful book. But I won't.However, I will tell you that I was completely enamored with 'Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\". I fell under its spell, absorbed in a world of alternate history, comedy of manners and dark, shadowy magic. Comparisons to Harry Potter is misleading.I'm amazed that some readers here found it tedious and boring. To be sure, it's a very lengthy tome. But it's like a long awaited vacation to an exotic, faraway land, it goes by amazingly fast. Indeed, I felt a keen loss when I was done.I love JRR Tolkien, JK Rowling, and Jane Austen. However, I feel Susanna Clarke has topped them all."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I'm amazed by some of the negative reviews I've read so far. How anyone can say that this book has no plot is staggering. It's definitely not a formula kind of thing (Thank God). It's full of small details that some people may have found daunting but I think that's the book's great strength.Anyway, it's a wonderful book, one of the best I've ever read. Yes, it's long but I found myself wishing it had been much longer. Honestly, Susanna Clarke's imagination is one of the best ever. The book is incredibly rich, very complex, a bit baroque, very funny, very sad, kinda scary and so on. Think of all the things that make a story great and I'm sure the Susanna Clark put them into Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. It's a long book, after all.She deserves a place in the pantheon of great British Fantasists, if there is such a thing somewhere."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Based on the standard of 5 stars = classic, 4 stars = excellent, 3 stars = good, 2 stars = fair, and 1 star = poor, this book gets 2 stars.The period detail, description and world-building is quite excellent, but the novel is plagued by slow pacing, a meandering plot, and flat and unsympathetic characters.If you require deep character development and/or a gripping storyline this is probably not for you. In this book, the prose and the world building are the stars. For some, that will be enough. I wanted to care more than I did."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I had great hopes for this book, as it dealt with magic and the supernatural, but as I read this I kept hoping there was a point to everything. The book just kept on and on. I have been more engrossed with other books of similar length, with the wish that they would not end. Not with this book, I couldn't wait for the book to end, but it just never did. Even when I got to the end, I kept asking, what was the point?, Why did it take sooooo long to get to the end???? I would not recommend this book to anyone. I am a great sci-fi magic fan, but there are many more interesting books out there than this. Huge disappointment!!!! Her short stories, 'The Ladies of Grace Adieu' is better. Not sooooo long winded. A big disappointment for a lover of fantasy and sci-fi."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I read reviews on this book and couldn't wait for paperback so I bought the hardcover full price - mistake. I am AMAZED at how many people actually liked this book. It was full of promise, the premise was good and yes, it was creative. But it was so painful to get through from begining to end. The characters were flat and did not come alive for me at all. It lacked emotion and was detached and cold. I couldn't wait for it to end so that I could start something else."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is one of the finer fantasy novels to appear in recent decades. With a mature sense of humor and keen literary style, if avoids both the pomposity of contemporary high fantasy, and silliness of contemporary humourous fantasy. For the first time in many years, we have a truly beautiful fantasy novel to add to our bookshelves. Clarke adds comical and sometimes extensive footnotes that give a mock-scholarly feel as well as relieve tension (but you'll notice they appear less often near the climax). Her treatment of magic is subtle and tasteful, and her characters lifelike but interesting. Is it too long? No. If you think so, go buy yourself an attention span or a cheap Piers Anthony story and leave this serious, beautiful, and mysterious novel to the grown-ups."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I cannot rave enough about this book; certainly I have not been moved like this by a literary work in some time. Gorgeous from start to finish- sometimes whimsical, sometimes heartbreaking, always intelligent, fresh, and full of magic. Clarke's writing is impeccable and a pure joy to read. One always has the sense that she's subtly mocking her characters even as she allows us to love (or hate!) them. The story is breathtaking and moves along with exquisite pacing. Allow yourself to be lost in her world!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It's rare to find an 800+ page book that you are truly sad to see end. but this was that book for me. beautifully written and brought to life by Clarke, it has just about everything you could ask for in a book...drama, thrills, tension, humor, & that rare gift in a book these days...it makes you truly, deeply care about the characters. In fact, by the end of this novel, these people in Clarke's world were real to me, in a way i've never experienced before in a novel. I actually wished i could have stayed in their world longer, and am hopeful of the upcoming 'not-quite a sequel' Clarke has planned.I will refrain from tackling the plot, because it has been gone over so many times so far by other reviewers. But, i will say if you like completely losing yourself in a book, take the plunge and dive into the wonderful world of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is gonna take you a while. It's all about the revival of English magic while England is at war with Napoleon. Part fantasy, part 19th century Bronte-style romance, it's reminiscent of \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\" in that all living things in nature have a spirit and more to them than meets the eye, though you may not grow as attached to the main characters in this novel as in Tolkein's classic. The appeal of LOTR is the humble down-to-earth heroes from different backgrounds all fighting one giant evil force, while in \\"Strange & Norrell\\" it's two rich English gents fighting a small Frenchman. The book has also been described as \\"Harry Potter for adults\\" but you get the impression from \\"Strange & Norrell\\" that you have to be well-to-do to even begin learning magic, unlike \\"Harry Potter\\" where anyone who has a gift is welcome to study. The two magicians do struggle with a greater evil later on, but it takes a while - and I mean a while - to get to that. You'll appreciate the secondary characters a lot more including Anabelle Strange, Mr. Childermass, and the wandering magician Vinculus. \\"The Man With The Thistle-Down Hair\\" might remind one a lot of David Bowie's character in Jim Henson's \\"Labyrinth\\"; Bowie would be a great choice for the film adaptation.\\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" is definitely not a beach or airplane read as it's like toting around a phone book; it's around 800 pages. It's drawn out in areas, and there's even footnotes (yes, footnotes) that explain a lot of back-story, but stick it out and you'll be rewarded in the end. I found myself wanting to see how the story finishes, and yes, it's open for a sequel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"While the last 150 pages or so of this nearly 1000 page book are thrilling and rewarding, most of the rest of the book makes you feel like you are listening to your grandmother tell you a very long and boring story. By this I mean you will be plagued by a feeling of \\"hurry up already!!\\" and \\"I can't wait to finish this book,\\" neither one of which is a feeling that a good novel should inspire. But, if your pride will not let you put down a book that you find only slightly entertaining, you will be rewarded with a wonderfully thought-out and executed climax. The last 100 pages of this book will undoubtably be read in a single sitting, and as you close the book you will be satisfied.As for the characters and settings, I thought Susanna Clarke did a wonderful job of painting a vivid and lifelike (although somewhat gloomy) world that will transport you to the days of Old England, where gentlemen hold great but undeserved admiration themselves, and pure disdain for the common man. Clarke makes almost no attempt to explain the origins of English Magic, and her characters accept its presence with only mild surprise. The atmosphere of the book is somewhat disconnected, with very little in the way of deep emotion coming from any of the characters, even when you know they should be overpowered with feelings. This is part of the way Clarke is able to convey such a sense of surealty and, in my opinion, takes away from the books overall impact.It's a Strange world that Susanna Clarke presents, you'll enjoy it if you realize what you're getting in to."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Clark mixes fantasy, historical fiction and term paper together to create this simultaneously entertaining and annoying tome. While I don't regret having purchased the book, I found myself becoming distracted by Clark's gimmicks--writing in the style of the period the novel is set in (with archaic spelling) and the use of footnotes to provide background and tangential narrative. There are almost as many words in footnotes as there are in the body of the novel.Also, I think the book needed a tighter edit. There were sizeable stretches of the book dedicated to secondary plotlines and character develelopment that could have been presented in Clark's chosen style in much more compact form. In the end, I felt that Ms. Clark's publishers were far too indulgent of her wanderings."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Well, if you're expecting a Harry Potter knockoff, forget it. But if you want a page-turning, literate fantasy with beautifully worked out characters, a wonderfully convincing alternate England and a crackerjack plot, all written in the dry, ironic, witty \\"voice\\" of a latter-day Jane Austen, then be sure to buy this book. I absolutely loved it. I am really sorry it finally had to end."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norris resurrects the genre of Victorian romantic horror once dominated by books such as Frankenstein or the Picture of Dorian Grey. Clarke manages to create a world that is dark and moody where people cross the boundaries of British social strata and enter into the fantastic.The book is written with Jane Austin sensibilities annotated with scholarly anecdotes footnoted throughout. Magic becomes a philosophical exercise presented like the 19th century musing's on scientific discovery. Clarke's use of language completes the mood and adds a richness not often seen in modern literary works. Don't expect quick and hasty prose or MTV generation descriptions. This work is close to 800 extremely well crafted pages. Don't expect Harry Potter either."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"If you're considering reading this, DO! You're in for a treat."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Like all books with science fiction genres, this books's strength is in its characters and their interactions with both the real and the unreal.The characters who are the ultimate antitheses of each other provide a good rapport. Set in a historical period in which Britain was in constant peril, this book shows life in the trenches, in the country, and in the city. More then just describing the settings of each, the crucial element is the interaction between the people and the magical persons.I personally enjoyed the level of corruption which kept bubbling to the surface as almost everyone tries to take advantage.The only donside is the length. Meeting characters and establishing the basic premise could have been an entire book within itself. This one novel could have been a three part novel . My recommendation would only be to start reading this if you have an abundance of time and patience."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I was very excited about this book after reading a review about it in I believe Time magazine. While this book isn't going to go down in history as one of the greatest works ever, it is entertaining. It does take some patience; it's not a Harry Potter book. Looking back, was it worth the hours spent reading it? Definitely."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I enjoy fantasy a great deal but so much of it is Tolkien redux, in fact I'd almost forgotten that it was possible to make a fantasy any other way... until I read two books that reminded me how narrow and uninspired fantasy has become. The first was \\"American Gods\\" by Neil Gaiman and the second was \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\". It's hard to think of two more different books yet both are \\"fantasy\\" (anything with magic is fantasy in my book but these labels are always loose). There isn't much I can add that hasn't been said, I just wanted to throw in a very enthusiastic thumbs up. I highly recommend this, it's amazing to think this is her first novel.So, don't despair! there is unique and inspired fantasy novels to be found and this book is one of them."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"That's just how I would describe this book. It is not a book that you can pick up and read cover to cover in the space of a few hours. The most tangible obstacle is the sheer length of the novel, at over 800 pages. However, as anyone who's read the Song of Ice and Fire series can tell you, those seem much shorter than their 1000 pages let on. Not the case with this book, primarily because of the style it is written in. Clarke, in attempting to envelop the reader in the atmosphere of early nineteenth century England, uses the same style of prose that was popular at the time, but without the benefit of communicating in it on a daily basis. As a result, the novel reads like those of Vladimir Nabokov, who wrote beautifully in English but in the awkward sort of way that comes with it being a second language. This by no means detracts from the story, but it does mean that in order to comprehend what is being said one must be in a more wakeful state than is common at two in the morning.With that said, however, this is a marvelous piece of work. It is certainly the best combination of historical fiction and fantasy that I've ever read, to the point where it really fits in neither of those genres, nor any other genre for that matter. I would say it is Historical Fantasy, the only Historical Fantasy out there, and a Large Print version could probably take up a shelf of its own in the bookstore. It deserves no less. Clarke has managed to take the Napoleonic Wars and turn them into a mere backdrop for the all-important return of magic to England, which was under the control of a magical king for hundreds of years during the Middle Ages. But while she did do a good deal of shifting around of English history, she made the changes obvious and yet subtle enough so that any historian who read the book and did not enjoy it because of the historical inaccuracies would be forced to keep his/her mouth shut. Clarke also draws on magic, or illusions, that actually were performed during wartime, such as the movement of the Port of Alexandria, and the rubber armies of Eisenhower, to make the magic, the earlier magic at least, that much more plausible. And she tactfully refrains from going beyond those simple tricks until the reader is thoroughly engrossed in the story and doesn't really care what kind of magic the magicians do anymore, so long as it keeps the story going.The only complaint I have is that the female characters could probably have been a bit more fleshed out. Arabella, Lady Pole and Miss Greysteel, all fascinating characters, never really came into their own as I had expected them to. But perhaps Clarke is simply reserving them for the sequel (I think someone mentioned that) where they will likely play a larger role."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This was a terrific book. Don't be daunted by the size and the pace of the narrative. Clarke immerses you in the world of these two great magicians. It is a great novel and much fun to read. A little lengthy at times, but when one gets to the end, it becomes apparent why Clarke took so much time crafting the story. All loose threads come together at the end. A great read if you like historical fiction or fantasy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This novel absorbed me into a world I did not want to leave at all. It takes a team effort by every element of a novel to do this, story, characters, style, etc. Clarke's first novel hits on all accounts. Many of my friends, who are into fantasy literature as I am, were put off by the writing style. Truth be told, I had the same worries about the style as I have not truly delved into any classical English Literature, but \\"Strange\\" was not difficult for me at all. Clarke writes some very funny scenes and dialogue, and the characters all have their little quirks to keep things moving.The history of Clarke's magical England is very well developed to impress most \\"world building\\" aficionados. The footnotes are always interesting or funny or often times both. I don't really get the charge that none of the characters are likable. They are all deeply flawed, but I liked them all, even the despicable Lascelles, Drawlight, and the gentleman with the thistle down hair. Strange is probably the most sympathetic of them all (which I often think people confuse with \\"likeable\\" but oh well) Oh there are plenty of characters, as befits a novel of this size, but there aren't too many. I never came upon characters later on that I forgot about. The ending is quite good and worth the well over 700 page drive. I just hope we don't have to wait another decade for Clarke's next novel!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell (JS&MN;)isn't you're typical fantasy novel. It definitely isn't and 'adult' Harry Potter story. JS&MN; is a fantasy and yet not the typical fantasy tale. The story is set in the early 1800's in a time when there isn't any magic in England. The book provdies a lot of background into the rich magical past of this England and how two new magicians enter the scene and try to revive English magic. The magicians initially work and learn together, but eventually part ways. Unknown to the two magicians, there are forces working for and against them.The novel is divided into three 'books'. At times, the story diverges into other story lines that tend to slow the story. In the end most of the divergent story lines add depth to the novel, I think that some of it could have been edited to keep the pace of the story.Having said that, I found the book to be good. I was very pleased to have stuck with the story and would suggest other readers not to give up too soon. While I thought the first 'book' and a half were a bit tiresome, the later half of the book was very good with a great ending."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Most of the reviews you will read either copy the same theme -- \\"it is like Austen! Enjoyable, if digressive\\" -- or attempt to launch themselves into the sort of bombastic critical arc that could sit comfortably within the pages of an eighth grade English fiction mag. On the larger web, I've even encountered a comment that expressed disappointment over the dearth of \\"feminists\\" in the novel. I am not here to dismantle such notions myself. I think it is enough to point out that this novel is itself an hilarious satire of modern day critical culture, and as such, is critic proof. The magicians that Clarke describes have become so preoccupied with matters of form and style that they are unable to recognize (or perform) actual magic. They are thus easy prey for someone (Mr. Norrell) who not only co-opts their pretensions (he is much better read), but who is also a skillful practicing magician (read -- writer). The irony lies in the fact that Mr. Norrell is only an improved version of his critics; he does not believe in magic as such. The story's real and allegorical conflict is represented in the person of Jonathan Strange. Mr. Strange is more than a practicing magician; he is an artist. Yet he is an artist who has matured under the tutelage of Mr. Norrell . How, the book seems to ask, can art escape hidebound institutions and persons? The narrative's answer is mirrored in the structure of the book itself, which craftily appropriates academic conventions (lengthy footnotes, pseudo-historical theories, etc.) and then transcends them through sheer creativity and willfulness. This book is far more Twain than Austen. If you are at all interested in reading good satire or disappointed with the modern \\"art\\" novel, I would encourage you to purchase it forthwith. -Travis"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Some decades ago I minored in Literature because I could indulge my love of reading and actually earn credit for it. I quickly discovered that \\"the critics\\" and I did not agree on what constituted a good read. They fancied literature--the art of writing--while I like a riveting, moving story. In other words, Jane Austen vs Tolkien.So I should have known better when the major critics gushed all over this book. I confess, they suckered me with descriptions like \\"dark mythology,\\" \\"thoroughly enchanting,\\" \\"absolutely compelling,\\" \\"practical and magical,\\" and \\"rivals Tolkien.\\"This book is not absolutely compelling, and it does not rival Tolkien. It is a labor to read, which even many of its 5-star reviewers concur with. The Christian Science Monitor's description of it is most accurate: \\"...(a) historical novel, told with a dry wit that will appeal to fans of Jane Austen.\\" (The part about Jane Austen should have warned me!)So, is this a bad novel? Absolutely not. If your taste runs to Austen, Dickens, and the Bronte sisters, you will be delighted with this book--it is excellent literature. If you prefer the action, pace, and plots of today's major fantasy authors, you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It is hard to find the right words to briefly describe what this book is and who could or could not enjoy it.Regarding the storyline and main content of the book, it is a truly original piece of work. Clarke was able to blend historical facts with the notion that magic is so real and possible that magicians are considered \\"professionals\\". In Clarke's universe, magic does not bring surprises; actually it is mundane. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not, and sometimes it works half-way and brings unexpected results. In Clarke's universe, magic is practical: it can be used in wars (to scare, confuse or create obstacles for the opponents), it can be used to improve weather conditions, and so forth. The fantasy aspect of this book is so cleverly built that it does not feel like fantasy. (I personally am not too much into fantasy - but this book made it all so believable that I never got to question anything. Everything was natural)In case you do not know yet, the book (paperback version) has 846 pages. It's a looong book. And Clarke, well, she is not Clancy (or what Clancy used to be). Which is not to say that the book is not exciting. It is. But it takes a while to get its rhythm. Clarke did a meticulous job and even took the care of putting hundreds of footnotes that allude to historical facts in this alternate history/universe that she created. She also wrote the book in what seems to me as nineteenth century english (and it's not only her vocabulary but her prose that reminds us of those times). These facts, plus her own style, in which she slowly builds the story, make the first 100 or 150 pages a little bit tedious. However, the book later accelerates its pace.There are some comparisons to Harry Potter. They're not quite correct. As I said, magic here has a different tone. And Clarke's writing style is so different from Rowling's that I never felt while reading it that it was similar.Its hard to say who could enjoy or not this work. I will put it like this: if you are a patient reader (can surf the first couple of hundred pages) and you enjoy thrillers, you will probably love this book (as many others have). You will need, however, turn aside any pre-conceptions you may have about \\"magic books\\" or \\"fantasy books\\", for this book looks like them but it's not exactly like them. If you enjoyed Dickens, your chances of enjoying it are higher.I will finish by saying my 5 star rating is an understatement. This is one of the most delicious books I've ever read. It's been a long since I read something as creative, original, funny, thrilling, or well-written book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The year is 1806. The British are fighting Napoleon's French army. And magic is long gone from England. The only society of magicians in York is purely theoretical and never so much as contemplated performing any magic. Then the society stumbles upon the fussy, bookish, reclusive Gilbert Norrell, who proves to them he is the only practicing magician left in England when he causes all the statues in the York Cathedral to burst into song.Propelled to fame by what Norrell considers rather modest magic, he is soon called upon to aid the British government against the French and to resurrect the deceased bride of a cabinet minister -- an act which prompts the appearance of a strange gentleman from the land of Faery who begins laying a plot for the downfall of English magic.Norrell is soon displaced from his position of notoriety by the arrival of Jonathan Strange, a young and eager upstart with a gift for practical magic. Strange and his young wife, Arabella, are beautiful, intelligent, and quickly popular in York society. Norrell takes Strange on as a pupil, hoping to control Strange's access to magical knowledge.However, the day comes when young Mr. Strange is ready to branch out as an independent magician, leading to a rivalry between Strange and Norrell that increases along with the threat from the land of Faery. Finally, when tragedy befalls Jonathan, he and Mr. Norrell must learn to set aside their differences and work together to save Britain.This book was a real first for me. It's the first time I've seen a novel with such lovely prose and delightful wit that was this badly in need of an editor! I could appreciate the idea of a satirical history of Britain, but an otherwise fun tale is bogged down in footnotes that go on for pages and a tedious amount of unnecessary detail."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book comes recommended from a wide variety of sources, including the infamous, \\"Everybody seems to like it, but I just couldn't get into it.\\" (Because I'm a difficult person, those kinds of anti-recommendations are sometimes the most effective; it's as though I have to prove that I can get it. That's why I gave Twilight a try. Couldn't get into it.\\") It's a lengthy tome, to be sure, and full of the all the period nuances one could hope for, meaning loads and loads of people sitting around talking and expressing polite disdain and doing nothing. But it's also probably one of the most original (if retrospectively obvious - you have to love that) and tangible fantasy/alternate history books I've ever read. \\"Tangible\\" probably isn't the right word, but there's real, worldly substance in a Jane Austen novel, and this story has the same kind of flesh one can sink their teeth into. (Oh, go on with you, people who will argue that Jane Austen portrays a completely unrealistic, white-washed British society that sweeps aside all of the injustices and violence and cruelty inherent in the period. Just give me a little slack.)Mr. Norrell and Mr. Strange are magicians, and perhaps more importantly, English magicians (what other kind of magic is there?) reviving magic after a very long drought in which magic has become largely theoretical. The renaissance of magic starts rather slowly, as one might expect (in fact, it starts even slower than one might expect, since the first of the new breed of practical magicians is the jealous sort), but picks up steam until it is barreling toward a conflict of monumental scale, and the book is essentially the same way.What works: If you give it enough time, almost everything works. This book is the \\"but SHE did it\\" object of fingerpointing from many future fledgling authors, I'd expect. Start with a bang, in media res, as everyone says you must? Not so much here. Must every sentence characterize or lend to the plot? No - there are many wandering divergences that amount to painting individual leaves on the trees in the background of a painting. One of the first major characters we recommend doesn't seem to have a stated desire (Mr. Secundus, for those following along in the book), and yet he's a perfectly acceptable blank slate character to do the things that need to be done to move the story along where it needs to go. He's accommodating that way. The magic that is done is unexpected and momentous, much more fairy tale than dungeons and dragons. There is no system. The characters have all of the complexity one would expect of a person in a good novel - that is to say, their unrealistically focused nature is applied to the plot in thorough, surprising ways. (I suppose that is rather vague, but I'd hate to spoil the plot.) Needless to say, there are fairies and enchantments and towns cast in Perpetual Darkness, when they aren't being relocated here and there on the map to frustrate Napoleon.What doesn't: It's dreadfully, despairingly long. When one is just beginning and the boulder of the novel is barely shifting, just beginning to roll, it's easy to see that there's still 98% of the novel to go and wonder if anything is ever going to happen. When one decides to go another 10 or 15 pages or so and then sees that they're STILL at 98% and STILL nothing has happened, there might be a bit of teeth-gnashing and hair-pulling, if one were the ashes and sackcloth type. But the boulder does roll, and it does pick up momentum, and soon enough it is crashing along at a wonderful rate and one just can't put it down, even when there are still thirty chapters to go. Also, as delightful as it is that there is no \\"magic system\\", magic still does seem extremely vague for the first two-thirds of the book.The Takeaway: If you read this, be willing to devote some time to it. Not just a weekend, but a month. Have another book to read at the same time, so you can alternate until Norrell and Strange begin to pick up steam. (Really, until Norrell begins to pick up steam. Strange is all steam from just about as soon as he appears.)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is a great book.

Author Susanna Clarke has perfected a narrative voice that is thoroughly 19th century yet has a modern dry sense of humor. Likewise, her use of copious footnotes to give the reader background on magical history (making the book feel more like a historical novel than a work of fiction) are initially charming. After several hundred pages, however, things start to drag. The essential plot line concerns Mr. Norrell, a fearful, secretive magician who wants to return magic to England but be its only magician. He makes his name by restoring the beautiful young bride of Sir Walter Poole to life. However, no one knows that he has done so by enlisting the assistance of a fairy, known as the gentleman with thistle down hair or just \\"the gentleman,\\" who takes his payment for aiding Norrel by enchanting the Lady Poole and essentially keeping her a slave in the balls he throws every night in Faerie land.Enter Jonathan Strange, a young man who, rather than choosing magic, has had magic thrust upon. He becomes Norrell's pupil and, as is only fitting, soon surpasses his master. There are a number of intertwining story lines and characters, but the main thrust is the the rivalry between the two magicians and the increasingly malicious doings of the gentleman with thistle down hair. I found that the pace picked up in the last two hundred or so pages, when the plot becomes driven by higher stakes. Clarke and her editor should have stepped back and done some judicious cutting of the text. They could have done so without doing damage to the narrative voice or the plot, and it would have prevented more than one reader from wanting the throw the book across the room on occasion.Clarke is a fabulous writer just, apparently, not so fabulous a re-writer/editor. This is a book that definitely requires some patience. The pay-off was not entirely satisfying to this reader, hence four stars instead of five."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"While telling the tale of two magicians with differing and conflicting personalities, their supporters and detractors, Susanna Clark weaves a story of admiration, animosity and ultimately, friendship. Stylistically reminiscent of early 18th century literature, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell weaves the History of English Magic (lots of incredible footnotes) with magical acts that will leave you surprised, dismayed and more than once, holding your breath."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Unlike most fantasy stories that create a separate magical universe, this story uses the real world--England in the early 19th century--as its setting. The \\"history\\" of English magic and the real history of England are weaved together so constantly and seamlessly that the reader begins to think that magic is real and an actual part of England's history. This is Clarke's triumph, made even more delightful through a graceful writing style.Unfortunately, the story itself is tedious and ultimately disappointing. Clarke narrates one promising episode after another, but too often these disparate scenes are neither elaborated nor brought together. The reader is left wondering why entire chapters are even in the book. Perhaps Clarke is intending to undermine any notion of providence (the accidents of life coming together to create a deeper meaning), or perhaps Clarke doesn't know how to pull together the various threads of her story.The ending is particularly unsatisfying. The images become so bizarre that the seamless garment of magic and history is torn. The ending is neither comedy nor tragedy, but an unresolved dilemma begging for a sequel. But who wants to read a sequel to a book that was too long to begin with?"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Very well written book... but awfully long. The 200 pages in the middle could be lost - without any damage to the quality of the book.It took me a while, but I enjoyed my reading. I just had to realize that this entire publishing buzz about \\"Harry Potter for adults\\" is a buzz - and no more than that. This is not a page turner, and never supposed to be. For me, this is something that Dickens would have written, if he had been inclined to write a fantasy book.(Not that I ever had patience for Dickens :-)So, enjoy the book - if you have enough patience, sense of humor and love for both historical fiction and fantasy. Well, it will also help if you have something action-packed on your bookshelf, for the times, when you actually have to put the book down and get some break from its density and complexity."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Not my typical read - I ventured forth with an open mind because I like to vary my reading. I admit, it was a struggle at first to get into the writing style - very different from the usual \\"novels\\" America reads. However, I kept plodding along. Turns out it is an enjoyable read if you're willing to just enjoy it. The \\"footnotes\\" are a big surprise. As you're reading the first few chapters, you're saying to yourself - why the footnotes? But, they end up filling in gaps that aren't explained in the story itself (interesting). All in all, once I was into it, I kept going back - just had to see how it ended. It was like eating a box of chocolates - some you really like, some you just eat because they're in your mouth and so you might as well chew!If you want to a read that is really \\"out of the ordinary,\\" this is it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Every reviewer who adore this book as much as I ....have said it all for me. You either love this book or hate it. I am in love with this book. I normally read 18th and 19th literature and I adore Gothic Lit (from 1760-1825) and this book is like a resurrection of a long dead writing style.Clarke knows her writing. It's another world, another time....yet timeless. It is NOT Harry Potter...not even close. It's like comparing junk to priceless treasure and whoever first compared the 2 should have their library card taken away! If you like the typical modern novel, with hack writing...where it practically spells it all out for you...this isn't for you. This isn't modern instant gratification reading....this is art."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"An enjoyable book. It was quite fun to read, but it was also quite HUGE. Ok, it was kind of boring, and you wait until the end of the book to hopefully get to all the fun. This book had an interesting take on fantasy though (it made everything more realistic and more relatable). I enjoyed it, but it was definetly not a classic. I would also not recommend it to my friends (unless they were crazy about fantasy)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"If you are put off by the prospect of reading a few chapters a day, and finishing a book in about a month, then you might want to forgo the pleasures of this well written, intriguing, and utterly believable book regarding the tradition of English magic. There is no doubt at to why Clarke took ten years to complete this story. The history she creates regarding the historical figure of the Raven King is astonishing. I can only imagine the pain and difficulty of creating a 'well known' historical character who is so controversial without being a charicature, that it inspires this fictional England to divide into two sects regardings this man. The characterization of the Raven King is central to the readability of the book. Without him, the world Clarke creates would be hollow.I also deeply appreciate the push and pull portrayed between jealous academics and the control of knowledge of magic in England. Those who live in the academic world can truly identify the debate and the utter pettiness of which Norrel and Strange engage. On occasion, Norrell appears to the reader as a bit obtuse, but this seems like a delibrate decision to highlight his absolute and ironic certainty that magic is a gentleman's calling, that the public need only be awed by it's results, and that the upper classes are the most trustworthy in all aspects of life.All of this sounds ponderous, I know, but the story is handled quite whimsically, especially when you read the engaging footnotes. I laughed hard on more than one occasion.I am an avid reader and can generally get through a large book in a couple of weeks. Not so with this book, but don't let it put you off. The characterization, the tug of war between theoretical and practical magic, and the meticulous creation of 19th century England is well worth your time and effort."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Most of the 1 or 2 star reviews of this book I have read here say something like \\"I only got through the first 200 pages before I quit\\" somewhere in the review. I grant you that this book is not a good read for someone with no patience. It contains long breaks between the dramatic and suspenceful parts, but it is in these breaks in which the book stands apart from many others in the fantasy genre. It is in these breaks where much time and care is spent bringing the characters to life. Not only do you get to know the two title characters intimately, but you also grow to know and love many of the side characters. I admit there were times when I started to get bored and began to wonder if Mrs. Clark forgot about the plot entirely, but it seemed as though just at these times she gave me just enough of a taste of what was to come to keep me interested. Many of the seemingly disjointed and random subplots begin to weave themselves together brilliantly towards the end. All in all I thought this was one of the most unique and refreshing books I have read in a long time and I recommend it to anyone who is willing to stick with a good book even if it is not filled with fighting and action from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Despite the positive reviews here, I found this book drudgerous. After reading patiently through more than 2/3 of the book and waiting for a plot complication, point, or reasonable struggle to emerge, I made the decision to stop reading the book.There are too many chapters in this book filled with contrived, and poor, period dialogue and nothing else, no plot struggle, no complication, only scene, characters, and dialogue - no contribution or struggle. I felt like the chapters had as much substance as an episode in a 20 year long running soap opera. There was as much substance here as ash after a forest fire. I would not necessarily discount the author though since modern fiction is nearly as much in the editing as in the writing.I am a patient reader when the work demands it. This work didn't. It was frustrating, boring, sophomoric, and poorly edited."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I had read somewhere that Strange and Norrell was an adult 'Harry Potter' and was given high marks. An adult Harry Potter? Wow! Even better! I was fooled. I found S&N slow and plodding with but a couple of imaginative scenes that tended to pull - no, drag - me along. This is in comparison to the Harry Potter of which I read the first three in the series. Harry Potter I found totally absorbing and fun. (I read fantasy and SF for fun and don't like the genre to beat around the bush. It either grabs me or I chuck it aside.) I decided after 200 pages to chuck Strange and Norrell aside giving my copy to my library."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Not surprisingly people are making comparisons between this novel and Tolkien or J. K. Rowling, yet it's a wonderfully original story about these two guys re-discovering the forgotten art of magic. But tampering with such powers can be perilous and open up a whole new world leading to danger, as our two good magicians find out. I rarely read fantasy books, but I couldn't help but be enchanted by this quick-paced, intriguing tale of epical and classical (and magical) proportions."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"With such an intriguing topic and an obvious readers' market for this type of work, it's an embarrassment this book came out to be so weak. The writing is immature [\\"And so they rose from their seats in the icy drawing-room (where this conversation had taken place) and went up to...\\"]. Obviously.... the discussion just took place so it's safe to assume the \\"icy drawing-room\\" is where is all happened... it's border line insulting... The style feels unnatural, often tedious, struggling with redundant, endless paragraphs, and the tiresome use of old English makes the experience a painful deciphering job. The flow is constantly being interrupted by lengthy and irrelevant footnotes (in some pages 80% of content are footnotes). The \\"footnote\\" concept is in itself interesting but seems to be misused in many instances sounding like the author just had an after thought or is unable to fold the information into the current story line. This is neither a fantasy novel, nor an historic one. Patience I'm afraid is not enough to enjoy this book. A thorough editing job would be needed to make this a digestible book. A missed opportunity."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"&#65279;Let's start with what this book is not:1. It's not Jane Austen: Jane may have used archaic language, but she is neither boring nor long-winded. If this was a genuine imitation of Austen, it would be one quarter of the length. Austen studied economy. Clarke does not. And Clarke, though she tries, also can't manage Austen's wit; she imitates it without having it.2. It's not \`Harry Potter for Adults': shrewd marketing ploy, but there is no resemblance other than the inclusion of magic. Rowling isn't much of a technician, but she is an excellent storyteller, with a casual, throw-away wit, which makes her work the exact opposite of this book. \\"JS & MN\\" is so calculated it's practically a literary computer.3. It's not Charles Dickens: Charley is long-winded, but at least his characters have life. And he was a lot later.4. It's not a Victorian novel. Victoria's reign started in 1837, and this book is set about thirty years or so earlier. So it's supposed to be Georgian pastiche, but it never comes alive, as some historical novels do. I have never understood the point of trying to use an archaic writing style if the culture and ethos that produced it is long gone. I hated Charles Palliser's \\"The Quincunx\\" to which this book bears an unfortunate resemblance; it was a similar exercise in stylistic futility. But if you're going to do it, get your idiom right. I'm sure Clarke thought using what she deemed to be the style of the book's setting was clever, but that's all it is. It's a cake-walk: a needlessly elaborate dance, the point of which is to show off, rather than make an aestetic point. The style always feels forced and fights the content the whole way, eventually winning a Pyrrhic victory.5. It's not interesting: When you read your first dull resurrection, you know you're in trouble. I had to flog myself to read farther: life's way, way too short. And I've read and enjoyed some very dry books in my time. The only remaining mystery is all those glowing reviews. This isn't Austen, or Rowling, or Dickens, or even Thackeray: it's Mrs. Humphrey Ward. (A once very popular, and now completely forgotten 18th century novelist.) To adapt one of the book's own bad jokes: \\"'Tis a Pity She's a Bore.\\""},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Holy moley this was a boring book. I gave up about reading about one-fifth of the way thru the book. I could just tell the author was taking unnecessary tangents and providing additional detail for the sole purpose of reaching a certain page limit - she seems to think that bigger is better. \\"If the readers have to suffer to finish the book, they will like it more.\\"I've given up on very few books in my life - I was happy to give this one up. Given our short existence, spend your time with a better book!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Grisham freely admits in the preface to \\"A Time to Kill\\" that it is his first book and is a little long winded and slow at times. This one needs a similar disclaimer.I get the sense that Clarke could tell a good story. This book in fact actually contains a good story, it just gets lost in and amongst the 782 pages.Some general comments:Someone complained this book had no magic. I think they meant no \\"lightning bolt, wizards battling\\" type magic. Actually, it has lots of magic, and that is it's biggest problem - it is \\"god-like mountain moving\\" type magic. For magic having been gone from England, it sure came back in a big way.The charcoal illustrations in the book are quite pleasing and fitting in style to the book/story.The idea that a fue words written in quasi-old english style brings a feeling of periud writing to the book is lostt on me. I could shew (actual word used throughout the book) you examples, but you'd probably quit reading my revuew. As you can tell fromme this paragraph it can be pretty annoiying.I'm torn on the footnotes. There are a lot of lengthy footnotes throughout. Though they really don't advance the story, they do add to the historical novel feel of the book.Funniest review here in Amazon: the person who claimed they sell it in shrinkwrap because no one would buy it if they scanned a few pages in the store - based on the writing style and footnotes it is hard to argue with that logic.In reading reviews on this book here on Amazon, I am struck with the idea that Mr. Norrell has placed a spell on the review section also. Amazingly, the percentage of people who find the 1 and 2 star reviews useful is very low, yet even the most information-less 4 or 5 star review is found to be very useful.Well, if you've read my rambling diatribe to this point, perhaps this book if for you. As for me, I only finished it because I was mildly interested in how it ended (thus 2 stars instead of 1) and the fact I took it out of shrink wrap and started it before my wife - for all the grief that caused I sure as heck wasn't going to not read the whole thing."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I'm not sure what the detractors of this book were expecting, but Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell has everything a good book should have: likeable but flawed characters, deftly written dialogue, romance, adventure and humor. The writing style may be difficult for people expecting another DaVinci Code or Lovely Bones, but for readers of fantasy or literary fiction, Clarke's debut is wonderfully taut, playfully serious, and, above all, engrossingly plotted. It will most likely appeal to fans of Alan Moore's work (Susanna Clarke cites him as an influence) and fans of Neil Gaiman. It will also appeal to those with an interest in English literature in general, Charles Dickens and Jane Austen in particular. Those who prefer mainstream American fiction like Nora Roberts, James Patterson, Janet Evanovich, etc. will have a harder time reading Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, as Clarke's book lacks the lean, film-derived plotting and cardboard characterization of the latter works. Above all, this is a literary work, a story to be chewed slowly and digested rather than binged upon."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"As a book, I loved it. I didn't think it needed too much patience to get in to and I enjoyed it from start to finish. However, I was disappointed that the kindle edition was riddled with errors: lots of missing spaces between words, words that were inappropriately hyphenated (and inconsistently), missing letters at the beginning or end of words and some formatting errors. These are things that would never be tolerated in a print edition and I don't see why they are tolerated in an electronic version, especially considering that the kindle version doesn't cost much less than a paperback.I recommend the book as a read, but do think that the publisher needs to made a better e-book; the amount of errors in this one was pretty disgraceful."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Hyped as the adult version of Harry Potter (probably down to the fact that both are published by Bloomsbury), I was curious to read this book to see if the hype was deserved. I'm happy to report that I found it to be one of the most enjoyable books I've read for years.An adult J K Rowling novel is, to my mind, a description that does the book few favours; I would describe it as a Jane Austen with magic. The style of such writers as Austen and Thackeray is captured so perfectly that it is hard to believe that this is not a 19th century book, but one from the 21st century. Using this device makes the reader feel that this story has been part of our British literary heritage and, as such, seems to turn it into an instant classic. Clarke creates a world that is entirely believable. Weaving the plot around historical figures (Wellington, Byron, Mad King George) added a sense of reality to the magic.The story revolves primarily around Gilbert Norrell and his gifted pupil, Jonathan Strange. They are both multi-faceted complex characters, and, in many respects, I was constantly wondering which of them was the so-called bad magician, and which the good - as with real characters, they are neither entirely black nor white! Apart from the two main protagonists, the story is packed with wonderful characters, my favourtie being Stephen Black (Lord and Lady Pole's Butler), who is befriended by a strange faerie gentleman anxious to grant his every wish.The scale is immense and the pacing somewhat measured - but I enjoyed it all the more for this, as it felt like a book I wanted to savour rather gobble. I didn't want it to end. My only criticism is that it's just too big and heavy to read in bed!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"For the first several chapters, I just loved this book.... Interesting characters, charmingly old-fashioned style of writing, so fitting with the historical atmosphere of the novel. Then, about a third of the way through (right about at the first LONG footnote, yes, you heard me right, there are footnotes, and then there are the LONG footnotes), it started to drag a bit, maybe annoy me just slightly. Then, several chapters later, it was gratingly unpleasant to read. But, I'll admit, I wanted to know how things would turn out, so I finished it. It was painful; I wish I could have those days of my life back."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Boy, the publisher did neither the author nor the readers any favors with the way they marketed this book. Just save yourself some time and money and...DON'T buy this book if:- you get irritated when a book doesn't give you an unflawed hero to root for, or when it doesn't have an unconditionally happy ending- you hate it when an author frequently switches between story arcs- you don't want to spend much time getting to know characters...you'd rather have the plot move quickly- the main type of fiction you read contains lots of action and is written in the usual American English found in most of today's thrillers and mysteries- you're under eighteen, or your biggest fantasy involves suddenly finding out that you have magical powers (Harry Potter).- the only type of fantasy novel you like is the kind where good/beautiful/perfectly honorable people overcome impossible odds to defeat bad/ugly/insane people (Lord of the Rings)DO buy this book if:- in-depth character development is as important to you as the story itself- you understand and revel in well-done, old-style English prose- you enjoy subtle humor- you prefer thought-provoking, multi-layered stories to \\"quick hit\\" escapism- you like a little history mixed in with your fictionLook, I like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, too, when I'm in the mood for sheer escapism. But to me, it's kind of like eating fast food vs. dining on a gourmet meal. I may be forced to settle for fast food most of the time, but I'll take the gourmet meal whenever I can get it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"At 782 pages, there's a definite level of commitment here. Once you start a book this size, you should understand that you'll be reading it for a WHILE. Nobody should expect this will be a \\"quick read.\\" The chapters average about 12 pages each, which is a nice bite-size chunk; handy for reading in stages. I finished it in 10 days, one of which was my day off from work so I spent the entire afternoon devouring the last 200 pages in one long rush. Yeah, the action picks up around page 500 or so, and suddenly this lazy, plodding brick of a book you've been strolling through, admiring the sites and stopping occasionally for lunch, becomes an intense page-turner which absolutley DEMANDS that you find out what happens next. The action escalates to a crazy, hectic climax. But it takes a really long time to do so.Other reviewers have lamented how boring this book is, and yes, I'll have to admit there's not a lot going on in the first 1 or 2 HUNDRED pages. Ms Clarke takes her time establishing setting and characters. I was prepared for this. I have been reading the dullest nonfiction for the past 2 months, so it was a treat for me to read something that has characters and a plot. This story COULD have been told in 400 pages, but the author has stretched it out with her languid, meandering storytelling style. If you're not patient - if you're addicted to adrenaline and demand constant action, stay away from this book; go watch TV instead. I don't understand why these people bought an 800 page book in the first place... Expecting to be captivated in the first 10 pages? Come on.Anyway, Ms Clarke's narrative style could best be described as \\"whimsical.\\" It borders on \\"cutesy\\" at times, and occasionally I felt like I was reading a children's book. At one point early on, the narrative voice breaks character and addresses the reader directly, stepping out of the story and referring to itself as \\"I.\\" This is all the more disconcerting because it only happens once - which makes it seem like a mistake. But the whimsy gradually melts away, and by page 400 the narrator has become invisible. You've forgotten that she is there and you're just following the story. It looks like Ms Clarke may have written this book in chronological order, so the first chapters, where the writing is weakest, are the first ones she wrote, and as the novel progresses she actually becomes a better writer (as I understand it, this book was more than 10 years in the making.) She is in much fuller posession of her powers by the time she reaches the end. It's just that the reader has to slog along with her while she learns to master her craft.The archaic spelling of some words seemed unnecessarily cute. (\\"Scissars\\" and \\"chuze\\" spring to mind. There were others.) These words annoyed me every time I saw one.So much time has been taken developing the characters that you begin to feel that you know them. You will identify with them. (I realize, somewhat shamefully, that I am more like Norrell than Strange.) By the end, you will care a great deal what happens to them. But unfortunately the end, the _very end_ of the book, was a disappointing fizzle. It was sappy. The final impression I was left with upon closing the book was not a good one. Probably could've done without the last chapter; the story was already over by then anyway.Everybody has mentioned the footnotes scattered throughout the story. They were quaint, usually funny, entertaining, and utterly pointless. I liked them, but they weren't necessary and they made the book longer.So, to sum up: you need to have some reading stamina to get you through the first half because the story doesn't get really interesting (by Hollywood standards) til then. The story itself feels like it should be only about half the size of the book, which tells me there was a lot of fat in it, bulking it up to 800-page proportions (but fat makes things taste good, right?) Though I was entertained and occasionally amazed by this novel, I still can't say that it was GREAT. 3 stars. Recommended if you have a lot of time to kill."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Before deciding whether to purchase and read this book, I scanned several reviews on Amazon. I didn't find any that accurately predicted my ultimate response to the book, and after talking to a few others who shared my experience, I thought I'd add my voice to the multitude here.I'm only giving this book four stars, even though I ended up absolutely loving it. Why? Because it has a serious flaw: the first 200+ pages are excruciatingly dull. However, about a third of the way into the book, I began to get intrigued by the characters and unfolding events, and stopped questioning whether I really wanted to keep reading. By two thirds into the book, I was absolutely hooked, as in can't put it down, excuse myself from social obligations to devour another chapter hooked.A few things to know about the novel if you are struggling through the tedious beginning:If you find yourself wondering why anybody would write a book about a protagonist who is so pedantic, dull, and mean-spirited as Mr. Norrell, you have a point -- and he's not the protagonist. Unfortunately, the first third of the book is mostly devoted to him.If you find yourself wondering why you should care about the seemingly random and unrelated events and persons parading through the opening chapters, know that every situation and character ultimately plays an important and gripping part in the story. In fact, some of the most important of these are presented without any clues from the author that they play any role of significance whatsoever.If you find yourself annoyed and distracted by the endless footnotes that break up the narrative flow, well, yes, they are annoying and distracting and break up the narrative flow. For the most part they are not critical to the story, and can be skipped or at least quickly skimmed.If you are half way through the book or, heaven forbid, two thirds of the way through, and you are still wondering when it is going to get interesting, save your precious time. This book is probably not for you!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is a fictional tale about magic and the magicians who practice it. Most stories of this nature tend to culminate in battles of good versus evil, but not this: what we encounter here is a conflict of style.Mr. Norrell is an old school magician in every way- tradition and moderation are the hallmarks of his life. (This is not a man who embraces change.)Jonathan Strange is a young upstart who challenges Norrell's approach to magical theory. Books are fine (if Norrell would ever let him get his hands on some), but practice and pushing the envelope are much more to Strange's taste.The crux of the story begins with good intentions: Mr. Norrell wants to restore the magic that has been lost in nineteenth-century England, but only on his terms. As long as he is in control of every thing magical, all will be well. However, one desperate night in an attempt to prove himself, Norrell makes a very poor choice with far-reaching consequences. From then on the course of English magic is forever changed.Basically, the reader plays audience to a struggle of egos: Who is right? If you're not with me, you're against me...that sort of thing. While there is no problem with this intrinsically, it goes on and on for seven hundred (700) plus pages. If a story actually requires that much space to tell, fine, but this one didn't. Part of the problem came from the overuse of footnotes. It's fiction! Several chapters worth of footnotes shouldn't be required in fiction- what, will there be a quiz?Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell spanned about ten years. The problem was that I felt like I was there with the characters, every step of the way, for ten years. For me, that's not a plus. A reader should want to actively pursue a story to its conclusion, not be dragged on by the hair hoping to eventually see daylight.All in all, the idea was good and the ending worked, but the lack of editing took away its appeal. If the author felt that all of those details were truly necessary I wish she would have broken up the story into two books, leaving me to want more rather than yearn for less."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Incredible book. I'm still laughing at the fussy, cautious, and paranoid Mr. Norrell. I'm still horrified, yet somehow darkly amused, by the Fairy King's careless, clueless destruction of human life. I'm still cheering for Jonathan Strange, who pursues magic at great risk to himself, because nothing important can be achieved without risk. Here's a magician who thinks the world doesn't need a nanny...how's that for a refreshing view in today's over-regulated world? And I'm still chuckling over the idea of Napoleon frantically trying to find a few wizards of his own...by force, if need be. Great, great book.

Once I had it in my possession, though, I had to force myself to wade through it. It's not that the book is bad . . .I'm sure that the writing is technically excellent. However, it is very slow-paced, and didn't get interesting until almost 200 pages into the story. If the editor had been a little more proactive (cutting some unnecessary passages) this would have been a better book. The story is nice, but it gets lost in the prose."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I badly wanted to love this book. I had read some of the reviews, and came to this missive with high expectations and a great deal of anticipation. The premise of the book is wonderful - magic always has been and always will be a part of English history, but for the moment (early 1800's), magic has retreated into other worlds, until Mr. Norrel and Jonathan Strange arrive on the scene. So far so good. When they do arrive on the scene, no one is the last bit surprised by the resurgence of magic. People know it always existed and are not the least bit surprised when stone statues in York start to talk, or geography is re-arranged in Spain to help Wellington and his troops. Nor are people the least bit scared of the magic. Magic, once found, is a natural tool in day to day lives. Again, so far so good.Susanna Clarke creates a wonderful structure for her novel. She skillfully weaves history and historical figures into a novel of fantasy, and very much makes you believe that magic certainly could be part of history ... or at the very least, could have been very useful back then, or even right now. She masterfully creates parallel worlds in the novel - the world as we know it in front of the mirror, and the magical worlds she creates behind the mirror. Using a mirror as the doorway between two worlds in nothing new, but the land of Faerie and the characters she creates are somewhat unique - since many of them are characters that started in our day-to-day world, but through enchantment, ended up locked on the other side. So one more time, so far so good.Then why only three stars (one for structure; one for imaginative plot; one because its Christmas and I am feeling generous)? Because there is simply nothing magical about the language. This books plods along at an almost tiresome pace. There is nothing about Ms. Clark's use of language that even hints at magic. This is the type of book where words and phrases should jump off the page - they should delight the reader, entice the reader; the story should literally fly (it is about magic, after all). Instead the quality of the prose is pedestrian. The pace is absolutely laconic. I wanted this story to literally take flight and transport me into the Faerie worlds, and instead, I felt like I was always an outsider looking in. I never felt as if I was \\"in\\" the book, but rather, was just reading the book. Had only Ms. Clarke teamed up with J.K.Rowling (who knows how to pace a book and use words), this might have been the book I had hoped it to be. This is not an adult Harry Potter - the plot and structure is completely different - but the way J.K.Rowling creates her books through language and pace would have been a good model for Ms. Clarke.Take, for example, the title characters. Have there ever been in the history of literature two more pedantic magicians than Norrell and Strange? While the book does not create a world where magicians look or dress any different than anyone else, these two magicians are not the least bit attractive. In a book this size, one needs to feel some sort of empathy with the characters - or at least strong associations, positive or negative - and I felt nothing for these two. Their rise, fall, demise, and confusion were just not the least bit interesting. And while the book certainly sets up volume two - they remain locked in perpetual darkness right to the end - I anticipate the next book about as much as I look forward to next recipe laden formula mystery ( I hate serial mysteries starring cats and chefs!).This is not a short book, and burdened with pedantic language and laborious pacing, its hard for me to believe that most readers will ever actually finish it. Nonetheless, it is a first novel, and one can always hope that perhaps the gentleman with thistle-down hair will become so incensed with the magic-less telling of his story, that he will cast a spell of enchantment upon Ms. Clarke and her use of language will become enchanted as well. I will admit, that if the next book continues with the history of the Raven King - John Uskglass - I will buy it for that. The Raven King was, for me. the most interesting character in the book, and I would love to see Ms. Clarke develop her next novel into a history of the Raven King - perhaps dispensing with the two work-a-day magicians, Gilbert Norrell and Jonathan Strange."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Boy, is this book overhyped.

I don't like it. Is it a bad book? Maybe. Is it too long? Maybe. All I know is I don't like it.I slogged through 500 pages and just couldn't bring myself to read anymore. I wanted to read an interesting story, and I just could not remain INTERESTED. Maybe it wasn't meant to be read as a story. Maybe it was meant to be viewed as a work of art with it's Dickens-like prose. Maybe.Whatever interest I had upon picking up the book had disappeared after 100 pages or so.

You're in the know if you own it, hopelessly behind the times if you don't. Ian McEwan's \\"Atonement\\" comes to mind. Of course, most of the people who prominently display it on their coffee tables never read it, but that's not the point.Wow. Wow. Let me first say that anyone who compares this book to the Harry Potter series or The Lord of the Rings should not be allowed to read ever again. This book is so, so bad I need to dust off my thesaurus to properly describe it.The author hasn't the faintest clue about plotting. Reading this is like slogging through waist-deep mud for three days straight. It just goes on and on and never gets anywhere. It doesn't really end, it just sort of tires out, with nary a climax in sight.But the author apparently finds herself frightfully clever. The one character is never named but rather only identified as \\"the gentleman with the thistledown hair.\\" This affectation is annoyting from the start but after about, oh, 1000 repetitions of this phrase I wanted to start blacking it out.As for the magic, suspension of disbelief doesn't help here. There's no internal logic as to what can be done, by whom, or under what conditions.And the characters ... Mr. Norrell is insufferably pompous and Strange, who should hold some interest, being a magician and all, is as fascinating as oatmeal. It's like being locked in a phone booth for a week with your two least favorite people.This book does have some value. It makes a great doorstop."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It has been quite a few years since I have read this book, but I remember enjoying it very much. I'm only writing this review because it is the only way I can find to give a star rating to the book. This star rating affects what books are suggested to me. These suggestions affect which books I purchase from Amazon. I think it is pretty silly of them to try to force you to write a review. I guess I will start using the bookyap website more often since I don't feel like writing this same tale over again for every book I enjoy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"While I found Clarke's writing to be imaginative and charming in places, I found the book to be slow, very slow. New characters and plot devices are introduced with every chapter, creating confusion and muddle. I fell asleep reading it for nearly three straight months. Perhaps that's why I felt it to be slow and confusing, but for the very reasons that others enjoyed it, I found it a battle to read. I hoped for a brilliant ending, but it felt like Clarke got tired of it and just wrapped it up. Somehow."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I liked Jonathan Strange: I appreciated Susanna Clarke's twist on the standard magician story and found the book's central characters very compelling. But readers beware: the book is frequently boring. For quicker-paced sci-fi summer reading, I would recommend John Twelve Hawks' brand new The Traveler. Unlike Jonathan Strange, The Traveler never plods: it moves like a speeding bullet from start to finish. Plus, it's every drop as erudite as Jonathan Strange: it delivers a blistering critique of the post-9/11 surveillance state. For a summer read with smarts and action, The Traveler is your best option."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"There are plenty of reviews in which you can get the plot of the novel, or explanations of what the story contains...so i will not go into that here.What I can add is that this book was an absolute pleasure to read from the beginning to the end. Typically in books nearing 800 pages, there will be some moments of tedium, or points at which one just wishes the story to move along and finally get to the point...but this novel was completely lacking in those. The story never seems to move beyond a deliberate pace, however that pace is absolutely perfect for the story. At no point did i ever feel the story was rushed, or filler material thrown in to flesh out some minor point. One gets the impression that this being her first novel, Clarke was able to write it exactly as she wished, under her own contraints and not those of an editor with a deadline to meet. The end of the novel is written exactly the same as the beginning...even though one knows we are moving to the end, it is not done in a blind rush to just finish the story and get it printed. The story is ended in as detailed and intricate manner as the remainder of the book. Few books are written as such these days, and fewer still that can maintain energy and interest over 800 pages.I would highly reccommend this novel to anyone. It will suck you in immediately...but be warned, it will take awhile to read, and you will not want to do much else besides read it..."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is a great book but a slow one. Very tedious at times because it is written like a lecture or a scientific paper. It is written like a typical book of the early 19th Century with all the English snobbery, arrogance, and pompostity you's expect. All this makes it authentic and questioning if this book about magic and magicians coulld be real but it also very a drag for those that are not big fans of this type of druggery. Finally the book is so filled with fictional footnotes that it slows the pace of the book even further to the point that most fans of fantasy will be turned off by this book or give up on it.Having said that, the story is awesome and it breaks new ground in not only the fantasy genre but also that of historical fiction. If you can push yourself through it, or better yet listen to it on audio like I did, you will be glad you did."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"... and I read a lot. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is an eccentric book. It takes a lot of time and patience; but in the end it is worth all the effort. This book is rather an odd one to classify- its like nothing else I've ever read. It puts me in mind of a combination of Edmund Spenser's The Fairie Queene and Dickens's Pickwick Papers. I would argue that this book is nothing like Harry Potter- the magic in the Harry Potter series in darker and more sinister, though the magic performed in Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell turns out not to be all that it appears. Don't be intimidated by the length of the book- nearly 800 pages- this is a good, satidfying read which will have you hooked. The action centers around two magicians: Mr. Norrell and Mr. Strange, the former of which is determined to get rid of all the magicians in England aside from himself- and successfully wipes out all of the magicians of the city of York. He them goes to London, where he tries to bring the spirit of magic back into England. I found it interesting that Clarke combines religion and magic in an interesting way- Mr. Norrell performs a spectacular act of magic in York Cathedral. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is filled with all kinds of magical lore and magical history. Primary in the events of English magic is the reign of the Raven King, aka John Uskglass, whose reign lasted for 300 years. There are the Other Lands, which include Faerie, Northern England, and the Other Side of Hell.Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell takes place between the years of 1808 and 1817, covering the events that took place in the wars against Napoleon and his French armies. Susanna Clarke tries to make light of a period of English history which was particularly troubling for the English. Throughout the course of the book Strange and Norrell perform acts of magic which include, but are certainly not limited to: creating roads which disapear again; moving rivers and other geographical features (ie moving Brussels to America); creating illusions to confuse the French; walking through mirrors; and looking into a bowl of water to determine what other people are doing. The book is filled with all kinds of fantastic similes- for example, \\"House, like people, are apt to become rather eccentric if left too much on their own; this house was the architectural equivalent of an old gentleman in a worn dressing-gown and slippers, who got up and went to bed at odd times of day, and who kept up a continual conversation with friends no one else could see\\" (452).There are some other characters which are worth paying attention to: Sir Walter Pole, a minister in Parliament; his wife, Lady Pole, who is brought back from the dead thanks to Mr. Norrell; Pole's butler, Stephen Black; Strange's wife, Arabella; a street performer named Vinculus; and the mysterious man with the thistle-down hair.Strange publishes an article in the Edinburg Review which challenges the views of his former tutor, Mr. Norrell; he later publishes a book called The History and Practice of English Magic, which outlines the subject from its beginnings to the present. Of course, there is a lot missing, as Mr. Norrell won't allow Mr. Strange to view the 4000 + books in his library at Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire. The article and the book cause a divide in the relationship between the two magicians. It is at this point in the book that it becomes clear that the magic performed in this book is a lot more serious than we'd previously thought. In Fairie, there is a place called Lost-hope, where Stephen Black, Lady Pole, and later Arabella Strange spend all their time. The place is symbolic of the fates of all three of these characters.As Susanna Clarke mentions, \\"magic is the noblest profession in the world\\" (456). It may just be true, in the case of this book. I've said before that, although Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a long, often complicated book, it is not without its mysteries. It is precisely because of this that this book is worth reading."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Headline in a local newspaper: Jane Austen is Alive and Well, and Writing Fantasy.Yup, that's right, folks. Jane Austen died and came back as a fantasy writer. In her new avatar, she calls herself Susanna Clarke, lives in Cambridge, and has authored a fat historical fantasy novel set in the year 1860. The book, which she now calls her \\"debut\\", began attracting media attention long before publication and on release it's been universally lauded. Unlike her previous avatar, the 21st century Ms Clarke (nee Austen) seems to be enjoying the attention showered upon her, and far from publishing her first book under a pseudonym, has been a central performer at her own media circus.The book itself has been called, by a media ever eager to summarize even 800-page hardcover tomes into a snappy catchphrase, \\"Harry Potter for adults.\\" It's also been praised by perhaps the best living author of British fantasy novels (though he's now moved to the USA), Neil Gaiman, \\"Unquestionably the finest English novel of the fantastic written in the past seventy years.\\"It helps that it's published by Bloomsbury, the very people who bought and believed in the maiden effort of a certain Joanna Rowling not many years past, and who were then stamped with the label of the \\"world's biggest fantasy publisher\\" on the strength of that Hogwartian breakthrough. At first appearance, this book would seem to have everything to recommend it: a great publisher, a promising new author (who spent an alleged ten years on the book), a beautifully-produced book design (the white covers were restricted to only the first 40,000 copies, so if you got one, you probably know already that it's a collector's item), and a book that seems perfect in every respect.So you really want to like this book. Love it, in fact. Especially if fat fantasy tomes are your buzz-biz. And discovering a great new author gives you the kind of kick that coke users must get when they take their first 'hit' of the day (and I'm talking about the soft drink addiction as well as the other kind!). So you settle into a cosy sofa, or your favourite ergonomically-designed seating, and crack the spine.And that's where the castle in the air falls to smoky shards. Crumbles into vapour. Vanishes with the suddenness of yet another overhyped media celebrity after her 15 nanoseconds of frame.Here's the story behind the headlines. JS & Mr N is a boring, dreary and unimaginative novel of manners, not magic. Unimaginative? Yes. Believe it or not, there's less imagination and originality displayed in these almost-800 large pages than in ten pages of a Harry Potter novel-and I'm not even a Harry Potter fanatic (just an ardent admirer)!The story is easily enough summed up: In an England where magic is studied but no longer practised, two practising magicians appear, aid their country in the war against Napolean, and generally change society forever. It's an interesting enough premise and one that you expect something dazzling of, perhaps even a clever fantasy take on War and Peace or Dickens with dragons. Anything but the dull and plodding monstrosity that it actually turns out to be.The novel is written in an impeccably manicured faux-Victorian prose straight out of the pages of an Austen novel of manners. And that's exactly what it is: a novel of manners, not magic. The characters parade about much like characters in an Austen novel, with great emphasis on how a person dresses, speaks and which parties he or she attends (or doesn't) but without the genial, deceptively-incisive Austen insight into hearts and minds that makes her simplicity so profound even today.There's a super-abundance of stiff, English-backed male characters who disembark from horse-carriages and tug on bellpulls to call for their valets, with the usual disregard for well-drawn women characters (extremely odd in a novel written by a 21st-century woman author) and even the obligatory repetition of numerous stereotypes and social slurs of the period, all, presumably, to convey historical accuracy.This is perhaps the one thing that Clarke does get right: accuracy. She recreates the English novel of the period with pitch-perfect detail. This is the novel's greatest strength-and failing. If you love utterly \\"English\\" novels, then you'll be in heaven. If you haven't read much literature since 1860, the period in the which the novel begins, then you've got a great treat in store.But if you've managed to imbibe something of world literature after the death of Napoleon, then you'll be left scratching your head and wondering at the lack of psychological insight, the completely bereft inner lives of the characters, the tepid and hesitant story that develops-lacking the subtle but certain iron-fist-in-velvet-glove surety of an Austen, the character depth and symbolic beauty of a James, and quite definitely the raucous emotional drama of a Dickens.On the fantasy front, the book falls woefully short in every respect. The footnotes, virtually a novel within a novel, are cleverly done but have been done before far more effectively-check out Mark Danielswki's brilliant dark literary fantasy House of Leaves. The attempt to combine realistic English settings with imaginative elements has been done far more effectively by writers like Tim Powers, Graham Joyce, Christopher Priest, and even Gaiman himself.The fantasy elements, while nicely done, are ultimately quite ordinary and lacking ambition. The historical period, while brilliantly recreated, stands like a beautiful set upon which no truly worthy drama is played out. Unlike, say, last year's well-deserved Booker winner, Alan Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty published around the same time, this novel doesn't even aspire to re-visit a period of history in order to better illuminate some new aspect of the human condition. In fact, to pursue the unlikely comparison, Line of Beauty is a far more entertaining and rewarding book.On the plus side, Clarke's wit is brilliant, and she writes marvelously elegant prose. Who was it who said \\"the British write the best boring books\\"? Well, they also write some of the best books, period, but this is not one of them! JS & Mr N is immensely readable and not entirely without its charms. If beautiful writing, wit, and a perfectly achieved mimicry of the 19th century novel of manners were all this novel claimed to be, you could even forgive it its hype. A great novel of the fantastic, it certainly isn't."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I couldn't help but give up on this book. After so much fanfare, I bought this monstrosity and invested several hours of reading, but simply did not have the stamina to endure it. The bits of promise helped sustain my interest for a while, but the mundanities of the content soon surfaced, forcing me to ultimately give up about 250 pages in. There are only so many tangents one can go off on. Footnotes can be very interesting, as witnessed in \\"House Of Leaves\\", but they prove, in the end, to be tiresome and meandering, and rarely contribute to the overall story. There HAD to be another way to give the illusion of a completely imagined world. I couldn't even finish it.One would be better off reading Dickens.

I read about seventy pages through and the book failed to contain my interest. Although, I will give Clarke credit, for her writing style is very enjoyable and her characters are very believable, but still, the book needed a an editor very heavily.

My eyes were starting to glaze and I was quite ready to put it down and put off continuing reading it for a year. I gave it another 200 pages and was surprised. The writing \\"grew on me.\\" I started noticing the humor behind the story and started enjoying the witty little subplots the writer introduced.I don't want to spoil anything but this is not a sharply contrasted environment that many fellow theoretical \\"magicians\\" have been expecting and you really have to \\"R-E-A-D\\" to appreciate all the work that has been invested by the writer.

This is the author's first novel, and she spent ten years on it. It seems that when she got bogged down in the plot or ran out of inspiration, she would write \\"footnotes\\" of other or older story ideas that have little or no relevance to her story, but which take up about forty percent of the novel. As other reviewers have noted, we join the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo, do Venice with Lord Byron, and keep returning to an ongoing underground fairy ball that has been in progress for thousands of years.The characters are vaguely similar, but none of them aspire to a higher good, or to a goal more noble than personal gain and knocking out the competition. There is a lot of petty bickering of the \\"my spell's better than your spell\\" variety, and more arguing over the history of magic than actual use of magic for a real purpose.I fell for the hype, and wanted nothing more than for that blurb to be true, but I would really like the time back that I spent reading this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The title is enough to give me a fair share of 'review unhelpful' votes.

But I say to the people who argue, with an air superiority, that He wants action - that action is character.There is no character development in this piece. The storylines of the characters just when they become engaging or, at least, tantalizing are dropped for too long and by the time they're picked up again, you're too frustrated to care.Stylistically, tone-wise, I give the author credit for carefully choosing and sifting out how to present the magic so that it feels real and firmly established in her world, but... that's too small an aspect to make up for such a turgid read.If anything, books that are written well move, and reveal, and develop, and engage - all of which is action."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Clarke obviously put a lot of effort into this book. However, I think it was at least in part misdirected.I think the book is overly long and attempts to be too biographical in scope. It tells a long series of the adventures of Jonathan Strange which traverses both continents and realities. It's too rambling and unfocused to be a really good read.While attempting to include too long a stretch of time and too many events, the book fails to flesh out the events to a satisfying degree.If Clarke had opted for concentrating the conflicts of the story into a shorter time frame and fewer events, and really developing the plot and narrative around those elements, this could have been a great book.I really look forward to something else from this author, but I won't buy another 1000 page behemoth.

You are warned! I will soon be donating my copy, check one out before you click on buy!!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"As a work of fantasy, Susanna Clarke's novel has a lot to recommend it. Clarke has invented an entirely new (and reasonably self-consistent) magical framework and embedded it in a (highly believable) faux history of Britain. The plot is pleasant, and the story skips along without a hint of self-consciousness.But for all its originality, Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norell does not belong in the first rank of Fantasy (i.e. alongside TolkienJ.R.R. Tolkien Boxed Set (The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings)or McDonaldAt the Back of the North Wind (Barbour Christian Classics)). The story is strong on setting and has a solid plot, but it lacks characterization. The transparency of the two magician protagonists is hardly justified by the conceit that they embody an ancient spell of the Raven King. I was disappointed that the women are treated as passive plot devices - by rights they should have dominated the plot. The two bad guys seem merely ridiculous until just before they are killed. The most lively characters (Childermass, the butler, and the Man with the Thistle-down Hair) receive far too little air-time.I'd like to read another novel by Ms. Clarke - one where she transfers a bit of her inventiveness to the characters."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"\\"Jonathon Strange & Mr Norrell\\" is set during the early 1800s in England, as the Napoleonic Wars are raging and England appears to be losing its battle. Mr Norrell, a serious-minded and stubbornly uncharismatic character, appears on the scene claiming to be a magician who will restore the glory of English magic. Through several key acts Norrell proves that he is no joke and becomes the toast of London society, complete with two hangers-on named Drawlight and Lascelles -- who are more than worthy of an episode of \\"Entourage\\". The arrogant young Jonathon Strange steals some of Norrell's thunder by coming out as another magician, albeit one in need of guidance and teaching. He becomes Norrell's pupil and soon begins to live up to his enormous potential. But after Strange returns from serving as Lord Wellington's personal magician in Spain to help fight off Napoleon the two magicians begin to clash over their ideals for English magic and the course it should take. Norrell wants to censor its history and to prevent people from practicing the art because he does not believe their \\"inferior\\" intellects are up to the task. Strange wants to learn about the history that Norrell has hidden from him and to see magic proliferate and thrive as it once did. The two magicians clash and part ways to bitterly pursue their ideas and to trash the other in the public eye. Ironically, this parting of ways is not the big conflict in Clarke's novel, as the dustjacket would have you believe. There's a subplot involving a mean-spirited fairy with thistle-down hair that takes some nasty twists and turns until it overtakes the plot completely.Clarke's writing is exceptionally good, taking on a fantastic subject with cleverness and a sharp, biting wit. Her debut novel is extraordinarily ambitious and Clarke is, for the most part, up to the task. She's just a little TOO ambitious in the end. The story she has set up requires a great degree of forethought and planning (Clarke even invents a clever history for English magic that appears in footnotes scattered throughout the book), but in the end she stirs in a few too many ingredients. For example: having set the novel during the Napoleonic Wars it makes sense for Clarke to have her magicians rub elbows with Lord Wellington, and Strange's adventures with Wellington's army in Spain are fascinatingly creative. But when she contrives to have Lord Byron show up and butt heads with Jonathon Strange in Italy one cannot help but feel that he has only appeared to suit Clarke's interest in including a famous writer of the time in her story. About fifty pages could have been shaved off right there had Lord Byron's role been reduced to a cameo instead of the deviation that it becomes. With all of the time that Clarke devotes to every little detail of her story it is surprising that she glosses over the subject of religion vs. magic almost completely. She makes mention of it passingly three or four times in almost 800 pages, but never explains how the two effect each other exactly. There is mention that a letter stuffed into a bible is protected from magic, and that when England converted away from Catholicism it changed the way spells are cast -- but there is no explanation of what the relevance of this is! Perhaps I'm being picky (it wouldn't be the first time), but I thought it would have been very interesting to explore that dimension further, especially when one considers that Clarke gave so much thought to every other detail. It is also unfortunate that Clarke's characters are so uniformly unappealing in the end. She never pretends to make Norrell likable -- indeed, it is a major plot point that he can be a crashing bore at times and is a self-righteous prig at others -- but it is disappointing that his counterpart, Jonathon Strange, becomes so self-involved and irritating by the novel's halfway point. Add the surly gentleman with the thistle-down hair to the mix and it becomes impossible to tell who you should be rooting for in the end. The ending of Clarke's saga as a whole was a little disappointing to me after such a long set-up (possible spoilers ahead). Two of the characters are done away with in a random fashion that doesn't fit Clarke's otherwise meticulous planning -- as if she had to get them out of the way before she could get to the big finale and didn't quite care if their exits made sense or not. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell are surprisingly -- and disappointingly -- inconsequential in the final showdown, and the resolution feels like we are being cheesily set up for a sequel. I suppose a sequel wouldn't be such a bad thing, but let's hope that Ms. Clarke's editors are a little more stern next time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is about magic and magicians, but Harry Potter it ain't! It is much more dark and Victorian. Those who enjoy reading writers such as Dickens with the long, tedious, wordy manner of description will find this book fascinating. Those who prefer to get down to the action will not.I won't say that the book is without merit. I didn't hate it but I have a hard time saying I enjoyed it. I kept following the convoluted path expecting it to get better, more interesting, it never did. But once you've been a ways down the path you feel bound to finish it.Light summer reading it definitely is not but if you have a lot of patience and persistence and you have a thing about dark magical intricacies you might enjoy it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I bought this book because of my love of fantasy, especially of the Mieville and Gaimen vein, but enjoyed it not so much for its fantasy and magic, but as a well written comedy of manners, done in a distinctive and consistent style that might suggest descriptors such as Victorian or Jane Ayre.Indeed the magic is not done well. It is unruly and lacks a the consistency of a Scott Card or George Martin novel, and hence perhaps the comparisons to the Harry Potter books where magic also varies from vast and easy to small and tricky with little internal logic, but there I think the comparison should end. The magicians, on the other hand, are well formed and enjoyable despite, and becuase of, all their conceits and faults. The opposing malevolence is also well crafted, subtle yet wild and dangerously amoral.The \\"comedy\\" is of the driest type, matching the period of the writing style. So droll that I'd imagine many readers would say \\"what comedy\\", and find this a tedious journey towards resolving a thin and un-original plot. The pace does pick up in the latter half of the book, and yet moreso towards the end, but this is a novel to be savoured and those wanting a stirring story will probably be left wanting."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I have tried, twice, to get through this book. I really wanted to enjoy it. I know there are people who defend this book with a strange sort of vehemence, and usually I am the first to say that everyone has a right to an opinion. But Great Zombie Jesus this book is more a chore than a pleasure! Subjectiveness be damned, I cannot for the life of me understand how anyone got through this overwritten, overwrought, meandering mess of a...something...I hate to say \\"novel\\". Honestly, it reads more like a university student's lame attempt at great Victorian-style prose.Sigh.Normally, I wouldn't bother to review a book I hadn't finished, but thought that, for someone reading through these reviews before purchasing the book, I will gladly mail you my copy. Hell, I will even pay the postage if it means getting rid of it. I tried putting it out with my recyclables, but they said they don't take human waste material."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Rarely do you see a book with so many five star reviews. I normally would never review a book I did not finish, but I have to say something about how disappointed I was with this novel after hearing all the hype. I found it to be extremely dry and slow and gave up after a couple hundred pages. Many people obviously loved this book, and there are some very witty lines and clever descriptions, but there are too many great books out there for me to invest time slogging through page after arid page in search of a literary oasis. Don't be surprised if you find this book to be seriously overrated - you aren't alone!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I've read many thousands of books, and many more dense and detailed that this one. That people who like the novel seem to deride people who don't as being unintelligent or not having an attention span makes my blood boil.After 200 or so pages of this book, I just felt irritated beyond belief, and I could just imagine the author at her PC or typewriter with a smug look on her face thinking how great she is. I get that at times with Pratchett too. The footnotes that increased throughout the book added nothing and just took you out of what little story there was. How I finished it 'll never know, but I have to say it's the one book I really wish I'd not botehred with as it's just empty. Of everything. That's just my opinion.... If you feel otherwise that's fine.... I just don't happen to like prose for prose's sake. To me that's just self-indulgence.If I could have given this book minus stars I would have. I didn't just not enjoy it. I hated it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is a well written novel but somehow the characters lack charisma. I felt absolutely no empathy for anyone in the book. The story loses steam in the middle and goes downhill after that. I would give this a miss and try Fingersmith by Sarah Walters instead or the classic Woman in White which is a thousand times better!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book was a real disappointment. Such plot as there was moved, if at all, with extraordinary sloth. I could not bring myself to care about any of the characters. It was a death march in which the author painted impossibly broad and self-indulgent tapestries of backstory and side details while ignoring any semblance of story momentum.I can't believe that I actually finished it. It was probbably the incredulity I felt at having wasted so much time up to the point at which I had by the read that kept me going. \\"There has to be some redeeming material up ahead! I can't really have wasted this much time!\\" No such luck.I wish I had back the time I spent reading this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"After all the glowing reviews this summer, I was really looking forward to devouring this book. After 250 pages (with 500+ to go), I put it down. Maybe it's me--I'm just not into fantasy writing much. I adore \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and have read it several times, and I've enjoyed the Harry Potter books, but...Calling this book \\"Harry Potter for adults\\" may be too correct: like Potter, it's English and it's about wizards, and it's long and lots of things happen, but like Potter, its author is more a story teller than a writer, and the best story (which HP and JS are not) still needs writing to keep it going. And editing. There's no reason this thing has to be this long. For a while I enjoyed Clarke's ability to mirror Jane Austen archetypes and syntax, but that's not enough. She introduces a zillion characters, then drops their stories for fifty pages or more, expecting you to remember who they are, but since they were never that well delineated to begin with, it's hard to remember who they are and what their stories are. About the best I can say is that the first third of the book is pleasant, but it's never compelling, and you gotta love fantasy for fantasy's sake, and length for length's sake."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I listened to a review of this book on radio 5 live (UK radio). All the reviewers were very exited and enthusiastic about this. One even went so far as to compare it to Tolkein. However, I found the story to be slow and plodding, the storyline boreing, even the narrative I thought was far too elaborate, and there were the continuos distractions of the appendices, these would have been better at the end of the book. I hope this wont put of too many readers because for what it is its OK but, Feist,Eddings,and of course JRR do it far better and more eloquentlyjohnwi19"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"1st of November 2005The reason I decided to read this book was because I liked the look of the dustwrapper when I saw it the other day in my local public library. I'd never heard of it before, even though I live in York and have had a few drinks in The Olde Starre Inn over the years. Then (today) I dropped in on a friend and he had a copy, and I learnt that it is an International Bestseller, soon to be made into a film by the 'Lord of the Rings' people. And then I find that the web is full of it. Funnily enough there really is a York Society of Magicians (of the Magic Circle kind). And Uri Geller keeps visiting. And this evening I have read about 20 of the reviews here (and intend to read them all eventually) most of which seem to be criticising the book for what it's not. My current thoughts about it: definitely good for the York Tourist Industry (eventually); A Great Bit of Myth-Making; Not So Much a Novel, More a Powerful Spell; where's the sequel?Well worth borrowing from the library."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I was wondering at its almost 800 pages, but the author kept things moving with new and, dare I say it, magical, characters and happenings. It is like reading a Dickens novel and that is part of its graciousness. The two magicians, Mr. Norrell & Jonathan Strange, are as disparate as they can be in their thoughts about how magic should be handled, but their lives are intertwined and they must face their future together.How they each use their magical abilities and how it affects the many people that find themselves in their sphere makes for fascinating reading.The author has a great imagination, with well drawn characters, especially the deliciously evil fairy. I anxiously await Ms. Clarke's next novel, but, please, Ms. Clarke, skip the footnotes - they were the only thing that detracted from the story & weren't really necessary."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I got through 200 pages before giving this book away to someone who actually cares about magic, which apparently I do not. I would probably enjoy a book written by this author on some other subject, as I cannot fault the writing at all."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this \\"Harry Potter for adults\\" but 200 pages in I realized I was still looking for a plot. The most magical thing that happened were potential story lines that would disappear or which took the reader on rides to nowhere special at all. I wanted to give this \\"story\\" more of a chance because of all the good reviews it has gotten, but I didn't care about a single one of the characters. This story reminded me of what it might be like to visit a retirement home to visit with seniors - except instead of hearing interesting stories of times past which revealed universal truths about the human experience, they just droned on and on about disjointed half-memories. Obviously this book was a labor of love, but it's also a labor to read. Honestly, this was such a painful experience that I could feel myself get a little older with every flip of the page."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It took me forever to get thru this book. 781 pages of sheer tedium. But stubborn as I am I just kept plugging away hoping it would get better. I found it to be just as dull at the end as it was in the beginning. I must have missed something as I do not understand why and how it is on the best seller lists and for so long too. This book was so arduous to read and I was happy when I finally got to the last page."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is not a book that grabs your attention right away. The story starts with Mr. Norrell whom is neither an interesting character nor a likable one. Jonathan Strange is only moderately likable. Strange is introduced much later in the book.The plot is slow to develop and does not really begin till maybe the last 3/4 of the book.The strength of the book lies in Susana Clarke's development of this world. The many small side stories help creates an interesting world but at the same time it slows down the story."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Like the title of my review illustrating that the Beatles found some parts of their life story hard and long, the reading of this delicious novel is both hard and long too. I could read no more than 30/50 pages at any one sitting. The plot is Dickensian, the descriptions of events are long and wordy (though never difficult) and the action is developed among several main characters, making the read laborious.Well, it was worth it. The writing is terrific...often poetic and surprising in its mood changes. The writing is what kept me going.The two magicians, Strange and Norell live in early 19th century England where magicians have been banished for over 400 years. Their value has been diminished (due to the Age of Reason?), Prime Ministers, lesser ministers as well as the King himself seemed to have no use for magicians, and sure enough the country has done well enough without them. Along comes Napoleon and England's leaders are flustered....they don't know what to do about him and are losing their power year after year.Strange and Norell come to the rescue ( really Strange who is the social darling of the age and is a student of the anti-social Norell) and sure enough Wellington is able to defeat Napoleon.All of the social classes (snobby gentry, foolish ministers, and everyday people) are made fun of and are satirized very cleverly by Susanna Clarke, in her first novel.What made me leave the last star off my review was the ending, which fell flat. The main theme of the author was whether we humans are able to use magic (our imagination really) successfully in our lives or not. Was Clarke unable to come up with a more fulfilled finale to the battle of whether magic is good or evil....or did she want to leave the question open? Either way she left us uninspired at the end."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I loved this amusing combination of magic, history, and good writing. Though at times a little dry, any who enjoy a fun historical should pick this gem up!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Boy this is a long book, and not exactly a page-turner. But I enjoyed it and plowed through it pretty rapidly. The two main characters are realistically drawn and yet somewhat underdeveloped. Norrell is a smallminded grump, Strange an absentminded gentleman. The magic is portrayed as an odd mixture of wonder, tedium, and ineffectiveness. It all works in terms of the plot and the story's internal logic, though. There are some really beautiful bits, and it is surely an impressive, even beautiful achievement. The main villain--the \\"gentleman with the thistle-down hair\\"--makes an indelible and oddly sympathetic impression. For a work with such massive heft I am not sure that the ultimate effect or weight is all that great, though. I see it as more of a brilliantly executed tour de force that is ultimately somewhat insubstantial--sort of like a literary version of the movie Forrest Gump. That comparison doesn't quite do justice to this book, but nevertheless kind of expresses my feelings upon putting it down after nearly a week and 780 enjoyable yet mildly baffling pages."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I got this book for Christmas and, although it was hard for me to get going, I am very glad I stuck it out. It is, by far, one of the better books I've read in a while. The language suits the book perfectly (I felt as if I really were in the era of Strange and Norrell). As with all good books I was sad to finish it because I wanted it to go on and on."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It is the very early 1800s, and the esteemed golden age of magic has declined to the point where it has become a theoretical and scholarly discipline among gentlemen rather than a practical one. King George III has become a raving lunatic. England is at war with France and could use some magic to defeat it. Along comes the colorless recluse Gilbert Norrell, who seems to be the only practicing magician left in England. Perhaps this is because he hoards all the books of magic that are known to exist. He is called upon by the York Society of magicians to demonstrate his abilities, which he only agrees to do on the condition that they all stop studying magic. As the only remaining magician free to practice the craft, he is now in great demand by the government, who uses his talents to help win the war against Napoleon.However, it is lonely being the sole magician in England, so Mr. Norrell takes on the young apprentice Jonathan Strange. Norrell is conservative where Strange is progressive. Norrell reviles the legendary Raven King, a powerful magician raised by faeries during the glory days of magic, but Strange believes the Raven King's magic should be studied and appreciated. With such conflicting opinions on the practice of magic, it is inevitable that a confrontation will ensue between the two magicians.This book is brilliant in its treatment of magic as a rule-based gentlemanly art, studied by scholars and accepted in the highest social circles. As the story progresses, there is a gradual shift from this civilized magic of parlor tricks and war tactics to the far more ancient and untamed magic practiced by faeries. Before long, a pervasive dark magic overlays reality and is reflected in every mirror and rain puddle. Clarke is able to portray both flavors of magic with masterful skill, and she blends them into a mood-setting whole that is unusual and innovative.There is such a seamless blend of history and magical fantasy that it is hard to tell where real English history leaves off and an imaginary history of magic takes over. Strange and Norrell carry on their business alongside the Duke of Wellington and poet Lord Byron. Clarke tells the story with wit and polish. She sets a realistic tone with meticulous detail on societal structure and mannerisms of Jane Austen's time. Her use of quaint phrasing and such spelling as \\"chuse\\" for \\"choose\\" and \\"shew\\" for \\"show\\", as well as use of fictitious footnotes on folklore and the history of magic, add to the realism. Yes, this is a long novel. But that effectively pulls the reader into a world where Parliament and magic, history and enchantment, and gentlemen and faeries work side-by-side. The book is so full of well-articulated imagery and magical surprises that the story line speeds along. Forget comparisons of this novel to Harry Potter. I recommend it as a refreshingly unique read.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Oh how I wanted to dislike this tome. Oh, how I wanted the hype to be excessive, the unfair advantages avenged, the assistances from well-knowns to be misplaced. Alas, it was good - very good - extremely good. So much so, that by the end I wanted more."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"If you heard what I heard before reading this book, you would think this was going to be a \\"grown up\\" Harry Potter book. However, it was a big disappointment. I have also read the first 5 Harry Potter books and would certainly recommend them over this one.The best part of this book is in the beginning where Mr. Norrell raises a lady from the dead and makes a deal with the \\"Thistle Down Hair\\" character. There are three characters in the book that are taken away by the Thistle Down Hair character - They are enchanted. One of these three just happens to be the wife of Jonathan Strange, who has supposedly died.Jonathan Strange becomes the pupil of Mr. Norrell but Mr. Norrell does not tell Jonathan about the Thislte Down Hair character. Jonathan and Mr. Norrell have a falling out and Jonathan goes off on his own. He then figures a way to summon and see the Thislte Down Hair character - to enter into his world. While he does this, he see his wife, the butler, and the lady Mr. Norrell raised from the dead in the beginning of the book. As a result of being able to get into the enchanted world, Jonathan in basically surrounded by a black funnel that follows him anyplace he goes. This was placed upon him by the Thistle Down Hair character.The end of the book is disappointing because Jonathan is still stuck in the black funnel and is not able to be with his wife, who he does manage to rescue.This book is too long for the lack of action. It was somewhat of a chore to get through. If you are not into the book by page 400 or so, don't bother going on to the end.I was expecting something better and was disappointed in the end."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Great, highly original alternate history/fantasy novel that ranks at or above Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast, Christopher Priest's The Prestige, and Philip Pullman's Golden Compass series (all of which I also highly recommend). The older style of writing may put some off (though it is much more readable than Peake), but I thought it lent the book a tremendous sense of atmosphere and even mystery (who is the speaker/author?).My only complaint is that the book is so heavy that it gave me a neck spasm from holding it so long, but even that is an endorsement: I enjoyed the writing so much that I didn't skim and read slowly, despite the pain!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"As a three-books-a-week reader, I looked forward to Clarke's opus. Great disappointment! The novel seems to have been written for major book reviewers of the world instead of readers.The characters are one-dimensional -- even Jonathan doesn't come to life -- the insider jokes are tiring, and the plot's twists and turns are too obviously manipulated.All in all -- thumbs down."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"...on Harry Potter, this would be the book.

Here you'll find a world that will place an enchantment on you, and never leave you the same. Think of Austen wielding magic in her fiction, only with a flavoured taste of Gaiman's dry humor, combined these and magnify it times...for me, this is what Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell was.A never to be forgotten classic."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book came highly recommended. I was told it was an adult version of Harry Potter and was interested. After all, I read the first Harry Potter to my sons when they were younger and both liked the series. However, one should define what is meant by \\"adult\\". If it means using mind-numbing descriptions in the most flowery language possible with arcane spelling (I know it's suppose to be \\"authentic\\") then this is an \\"adult\\" tale.Any decent editor would have snipped a good third of the book away as excess verbiage - writing for the sake of accumulating letters. The story - as other reviewers have pointed out - moves at the pace of a crippled snail; the mind wanders as the brain fights to wade through still more dreary descriptions that seem so unimportant. Once again, the idea was excellent - magicians arising in England, the interplay between government and magic, the late introduction of the titled \\"Mr. Strange\\", his fascination with magicians of old. I am not the only one I've talked to who thought the tale overly long, underplotted, the characters too numerous and shallow. The magic is, how to say it, underwhelming.Mr. Norrell is, without a doubt, one of the most boring - and forgettable - characters in modern literature. He seems to be a caricature rather than a character. The work, which requires much concentration getting starting, is written in the \\"Old Style\\", that is odd lettering, idiom, manner, names, places. It reminds one of one of those incredibly boring plays about Ladies and Lords (no lower clases are present) of pre-Victorian England whose action alternates between drawing rooms, friendly pubs and darkened corridors. The cover is impressive as are the blurb, recommendations and author's bio. I only wish the story had been half as good."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It's okay not to like this book. It's okay to be disappointed or bored by it, because it's just not everyone's cup of tea. And it's okay not to like the language or the slow pace...I found the book a little slow going, myself. What's not okay, to me, is when someone gives a book a one-star review having read only twenty pages and then whines that it wasn't Harry Potter. Of course, the person who called this book a \\"colossal bore\\" has written 1200 reviews about oldies music, so I suppose that gives him a unique qualification to judge, simply by virtue of being the very personification of the concept \\"colossal bore.\\" But it doesn't excuse denying the book any merit at all or calling it the \\"flop of the century,\\" just because it was too difficult a read for him. The bottom line is that this book is an example of phenomenally talented writing. Clarke's evocative prose got me through an entire book whose story I found only marginally interesting, and for that accomplishment alone, I give this book three stars."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Think before you invest your time in this one.This book has moments of undeniable charm, clever ideas, and wonderful use of language. There were many times where I found myself truly immersed in a parallel world where English magic and English manners coexisted. Unfortunately, these moments were all too often mere islands in a sea of prose. Now, I don't consider lack of action to be a fatal flaw. However, with so little plot, character became critical, and here is where the book finally failed for me. While the characters are indeed carefully and fully drawn, I found them unsympathetic. I found myself over halfway through (essentially having finished a novel's-worth of fiction) with little actual attachment to any of the book's main or even peripheral characters.Potential readers should ask themselves if they are ready for a book where the critics who PRAISE it write as follows:(all quotes from 5-star reviews)\\"as you might imagine there isn't a lot of magic going on, at least not for the first few hundred pages\\"\\"Longer than it seems according to the page count\\"\\"leisurely is probably too fast-paced a description\\"\\"If it doesn't draw you along, keep trying. If it still doesn't, try skimming footnotes, skimming pages, dipping in now and then to keep up on plot and catch one of those well-crafted lines\\"If those sound like descriptions of books you like, you will be in heaven here.

I even learned a few new words in this story.

It's a much richer exploration of magic than Harry Potter, weaving in the English social dynamics of Jane Austen and the irony and atmosphere of Dickens. That being said, like Austen and Dickens it does require an enormous investment of TIME to read this nearly 900 page doorstop of a novel. Unlike another recent doorstopper novel of 19th century England, \\"The Crimson Petal and the White,\\" Ms. Clarke's novel does not let you down at the end. My only minor quibble is that the novel could have used a bit more slashing by a judicious editor's pen, but it's a very minor quibble indeed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Wow...look at the size of this book! I love fat books so it wasn't really intimidating, but I did not know what to expect. At first it took some time getting used to the archaic style of writing Susanna Clarke favors, but it quickly became clear that it was necessary to establish the somewhat dark and mysterious atmosphere rampant throughout the novel. It certainly is an intense book, but utterly enjoyable. At first the footnotes were a little disconcerting, but quickly became a part of the story. After a while I began to look forward to the footnotes, as they seemed to be \\"proof\\" that there really was a history of magic! Interesting also the illustrations sprinkled throughout the book, something that is rarely found these days.All in all, an utterly engrossing work of fiction!

If I had, I would have thought it was clever, moderately interesting, but way too slow and meandering, with unappealing characters. But by page 600, I was staying up too late and being late for work, always wanting to read a little bit more. And the ending actually made me cry, that's how much I cared about the characters.

Must have been a slow year for quality books.JS&MN; has been touted as the adult version of Harry Potter and with mass market paperbacks I see people snatching it up everywhere from bookstores to wholesale warehouses. Somehow I doubt they'll be impressed or even complete this massive tome.Now, don't get me wrong. The entire story of JS&MN; is incredibly original with some inspired moments. It would make for an exciting 250 page book. However the actual book is 846 pages! Clearly that's about 500 pages too many. Beyond that several other points should place JS&MN; mired in the \\"decent\\" category instead of the \\"Stellar\\" category that so many people wish to place it into. These would include:1 - Both lead characters are NOT people that you can root for. One is a selfish bookworm who wants things his way. The other is a selfish man who thinks everyone else is below him (and if they're not) then he labels them as pompous. Most books would require at least 1 protagonist that the reader can bond with.2 - The use of magic is not clearly imagined. In the Harry Potter books we have spells and wands. Here we have thousands of books on magic (with few actual wizards) and when some form of magic is conducted it's a very gray area...almost as if the author wasn't 100% sure how she wanted this world of magic to be presented.3 - There's a good villain. However, he may be too good for the \\"heroes\\" of this book. It takes over 600 pages for the heroes to even suspect that something may be amiss. Ouch! Now I don't want to root for JS&MN; because they're also too stupid to spot magic that is enchanting the people around them.4 - Footnotes. Sometimes footnotes and research can add alot to a story (see the phenomenal HOUSE OF LEAVES) and other times they just get in the way. JS&MN; has footnotes that drag the already wordy text to an almost complete halt. I've read other reviews that praise the last 200 pages...you know why...the footnotes disappear completely near the end of the book.I did read JS&MN...completely.; It was quite a chore. The reason it gets 2-stars is because I am an avid reader and I rarely say that reading a book is a \\"chore\\"."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It might be worth the money if you really need something to start a fire with.

The last third of the book is fairly good, but still not as good as all the gushing seems to indicate. It is a rock solidly mediocre book. The whole section about the war with France is dull. Clarke's writing style is fine, and maybe that is what captures some people's imaginations. If you want extraordinary fantasy, read China Mieville or Philip Pullman"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book about magicians and the reemergence of magic, is really more about England's uppercrust society, and class structure in early 18th century England. Gentleman and ladies know their place, as, of course, do all servants. Leisure and prejudice are fully in force, and we get a _very_ full reading of how things might have been back in cheery ol' England. In fact, the book might be most impressive in how closely it meets expectations about how a gentleman's novel might have been written back in those days.But then again, that's precisely the problem! This is the 21st century, and we now have more immediate needs from a novel, i.e., that it have something happen more than once every 50 pages or so. And that the characters have more emotion than the stereotype of the 18th century British upper class. Too much is dry and detailed and dull. The key is that this novel is just way too long; half the 800 pages would have fit the story much better (and would have been so easy to achieve, with so much material present that could have easily been removed; Clarke goes off on tangents on nearly every page).Strange and Norrel is a melancholy, grey and somber read about how the history of the British Isles might have been written if magic was real. Occasionally we find some real humor (I laughed out loud about 4 times, so once every 200 pages or so), in a classic 18th century English sense. The book keeps seeming like it will get somewhere, and the prose is both easy to read and detailed. If you like long, slow reads, about characters having a weird mix of historical accuracy and fantasy (but devoid of serious emotion) perhaps this book's for you. Keep in mind that the book is historical fantasy, not historical fiction. For me, in this context (ok, in any context), it was just way too long...."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book started out in a promising manner with an interesting story line as magic comes back to England, a young woman is brought back from the dead, people flit back and forth between the world of magic and reality. From there, however, the book degenerates into a long, drawn-out description of war between England and France using magic to do battle. The story becomes tedious and boring. While attempting to follow the plot through never-ending detail, eventually, I gave up and stopped reading about midway though. It was no Harry Potter!!! (But great if you have insomnia and are looking for something to put you to sleep.)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I picked up this book because it won the Hugo award, but it was boring, boring, boring!I gave up after chapter seven, the story goes nowhere very fast.The only thing that I found interesting about this book was that is actually sounded as if it had been written in 1808. It reminded me of The House of Mirth.Update - I thought that I would give this book a little more time to grow on me. I am now at Chapter 31, and it is still as boring as ever, if not more so! The Harry Potter of adults my eye.Another update - after investing so much time in this book I thought that I might as well finish it. It ends as it begins, meandering along a road of pretty prose with no real end in sight.Apparently we are being set up for a sequel.If you like Dickens, read Dickens, and if you like Melville, read Melville, but don't call this a classic just because of the lovely way it is written."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"After all the 'hype' of this successful 'first novel' in England, I couldn't wait to get it. Ms. Clarke took ten years to research the early history of England and the magic they used, uses a lot of detail and long footnotes. It just had to be good -- too good to put down, right?I found it to be along the lines of Harry Potter only for adults. This involved \\"masterpiece\\" is about two magicians in 1806 seeking the wisdom and abilities of the Raven King, purportedly taken by fairies as a child and grew up to become King of England & Fairie in the twelfth century. He was considered to be the forebearer of English magic.Too good to be true, I soon learned as I tried to plow through all the non-magic inessential mismash to find the truly magical. First, two non-practicing magicians seek out one whose reputation had become known, a Mr. Gilbert Norrell, at Hurtfew Abbey, 14 miles from York, where a band of old gentlemen met only to discuss (but not practice) magic.Mr. Norell has an extensive library filled with the ancient magic manuals, but his discussion group of elderly men are only interested in reading and talking about magic, that is, until young Jonathan Strange arrives on Norvell's doorstep. Because of his enthusiasm at the sight of all the out-of-print writings of scholars of long ago, Jonathan persuades Mr. Norrell to teach him the old practices; as a consequence, they became involved in the wars, using supernatural skills summoning ghost ships and such.She tells good stories unknown to Americans, but from English lore. In Camelot, we discovered Merlin as Arthur re-lived his strange childhood through memories of the magic. In eleven years (1806-1817), much confusion and misconceptions occur between these partners in crime, as illustrated at intervals throughout the long, wordy history of English wars and fairy intervention. I counted twenty-four shadowly sketches, few and far between which added a slight diversion, but nothing else.It took Rowling five volumes and movies to get Harry Potter to his potential. Ms. Clarke spent ten years and only one very wordy volume to show the potential of Jonathan Strange with Mr. Norrell's direction to learn what he could do.This has been accepted as a 'piece of wonder' in Britain, but I really doubt its popularity in the States. Only to the faithful who read all five Potter novels would some of this make sense. Had she divided this tome into five books to let the gory parts subside in between, it might be palpable. The difference is that Harry Potter was supposedly written for children but even educated adults could enjoy the simplicity, this book of adult magic makes our Civil War seem like child's play.It was just not my \\"cup of tea.\\""},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It's hard to fathom why so many of you love this book, to say nothing of the inference that A.S. Byatt would appreciate it. I gave up around page 200, as this was too simple a work, and too tiresome for further perusal. Having just finished a couple of really well written novels, I can also say that there was nothing special about the author's prose whatever...Who is reviewing this work-fans of Harry Potter? Finally, if you want to read an intelligent, throw-back kind of novel with real drama, well drawn characters and a truly epic feel, pick up Palliser's \\"The Quincunx\\". Light satire and pale imitations of Jane Austen do not a classic make."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I read quite a bit. I'm always looking for an original idea or clever twist in the pursuit of entertaining fiction. I tried this book based on a few reviews I read. I also thought the premise held promise and (shame on me) what a nice cover.Of course, this book had no original ideas or clever twists. The prose is long winded. The author uses either archaic spellings of English words or just makes them up as she sees fit. This makes the read that much more difficult with little or no value to the reader. For instance, connexion is used instead of connection. The author make copious use of footnotes. Often running for pages at a time. I couldn't decide if she was trying to mimic a style akin to corporate reporting or a highly technical research paper no one will ever read. So here's my summary:Boring storyOverly complex sentence structure to confuse the reader.Bizarre use of footnotesNo emotional attachment to any of her characters.Stay away. I'd like my money back."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book has a great premise and, perhaps, great promise. Unfortunately, it fails to develop the former and never delivers on the latter. There is action and there is character development, but the action is so slow and so wrapped in seemingly endless descriptive passages that the characters seem to be frozen figures from a video game with processor lag. I read the whole thing hoping for a change of pace (I was stuck on an airplane), but by the end of the third chapter I just did not care what happened to these muddle-headed muggles with their pseudo-Victorian sensibilities and their utter lack of any spark. I left the book on the plane."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"ive read dozens of reviews for this book. the great reviews are the reason i bought the book in the first place. they are all FALSE! this book is BORING. i dont see ANY reason to compare this book to the harry potter series. other than the fact that they were written by brittish woman, they're not even in the same category. ive read more fantasy novels than i could possibly count, and this was the worst by far. the greatest magic the magicians in this book perform are spells to \\"make it rain\\" or \\"make the statues talk\\". if your looking for a good fantasy novel, try R.A. Salvatore or Weis & Hickman. this just isnt worth the time. i honestly would'nt have anything to say to the public about this book if it werent for all the reviews i read about what an AMAZING book this is. the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because i actually read the book from start to finish. for some reason, i just wanted to know how it ended. i normally read about 2 books a week...this one took me over a month to finish. its just so boring, i couldnt read more than a few pages at a time or i would just fall asleep in my chair. if you want real fantasy, try something else. please."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I'm at page 300, and I struggled to get there. I will put it down for a bit before resuming. The problem is that one of our main characters, Mr. Norrell, is a dud! I don't care the least about him. And the prose, while good, is rambling. This book was in severe need of some editing. On these pages, I've seem some readers compare it to Jane Austen. Don't compare this style to that of Jane Austen. Jane Austen is witty, and her characters have depth and life. The characters in Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell are mostly flat.With that said, there are some subplots that intrigue me; however, it takes so long to resume those stories that I get bored until she picks up the interesting twists again. All in all, I see a lackluster main character, and a style that kills a potentially interesting story in mundane details."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The story is interesting once you dig it out from under mountains of extraneous words. This book needs an editor who can cut out 500 pages. If this is what wins hugo awards these days, I'll stay away from award winning books. Give me Jim Butcher any day."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"After reading so many sparkling reviews on this book, I just had to go out and see what all the hype was about. This is certainly a decent book, and it has great idea behind it, but... This book is one of the most unnecessarily long books I've ever read--next to my failed attempt to finish Lord of the Rings.Set during the Napoleonic Wars of the early nineteenth century, Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell describes how the English might have fought with the use of magic. This book can be catagorized as historical fiction fantasy, but that doesn't quite cut it. Contemporary as this book is, it's written is the over-the-top, and often wordy style of the nineteenth century (think the Scarlet Letter and Wuthering Heights). If you're not into run-on sentence after run-on sentence, (not to mention EXTENSIVE footnotes on the history of Clarke's alternate nineteenth century), you might not like this book.As for length, this book tops 800 pages and is divided into three sections: Mr Norrell, Jonathan Strange, and John Uskglass. The story, however, really doesn't pick up until John Uskglass--which is, in my opinion, where the book should have started. Susanna Clarke said that the novel took her about ten years to finish and, after slogging my way through it, I believe her!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I think it's pretty obvious from other reviews this is a love/hate book. There are things about it that will either charm you or make you want to throw it against the wall. First, of course, is the Regency speake, which I think easily snows a lot of people, and for those folks transforms what would otherwise be a mediocre fantasy doorstop into an instant classic. The extra-e'd language and a sense of class distinctions are really the only things this book has in common with Austen, in spite of the many comparisons between the two. People forget that she was writing in her contemporary langage, so it's natural and flows in her novels, rather than being twee and forced as it often is here. (People also forget that Jane is laugh-out-loud funny, which this book ain't--yes, I understand it's dry wit, but this is the Sahara.)Second are the footnotes--either this will strike you as clever, and creating a multi-faceted universe, or as too clever for it's own good and an overly-precious desperately attention-seeking device. As someone who has to read a lot of legal and scholarly papers, the novelty factor for me was zero and the annoyance factor was through the roof.I also think the folks that credit her for creating fully realized characters might have had a different edition of this book. Some of the characters do get nearly ridiculous amounts of backstory, but the major female characters are basically long-suffering, lovely ciphers waiting to be saved, and Stephen Black is easy-goingly tolerant and protective of a society that enslaves his family (and only treats him a little better) to a degree that borders on \\"Gone With the Wind\\" absurdity.That's not a total criticism, since I think her heart's in the right place--she's Trying To Make A Point in some way with treating those characters in that way, even if I'm not entirely sure what that point is. While she's English 1A obvious about the fact she's going somewhere, she's also really obtuse about where exactly she's going. One one level it's refreshing to credit the reader with the ability to think, but it's not handled in a truly satisfactory way.Neverthless, the book isn't a total wash--it's really more like 2.5 stars, but Amazon doesn't have half-steps. When Lady C-- is not Trying Too Harde to force the olde language, she's capable of luminously beautiful writing. There's definitely potential lurking--if she can find an editor that isn't an overindulgent old buddy I'd be willing to give her next effort a try."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It was interesting reading the reviews for this book to discover the divergence of opinion. I personally loved this book! It captured my interest from beginning to end. I thought it was an engaging story which captured the human condition with well developed characters, and well-researched historical references woven in. I do agree that the footnotes become tedious, and are not always relevant to the story line; however they are not intended to be. As supplemental information, they did a good job of drawing me into the illusion of an alternative history.You don't have to be a fan of the mystical to enjoy this book, just a fan of a good story.To be fair, this is a long - and large - book - definitely not for the plane."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"A previous review stated that it takes some patience to read Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. I have to agree with that individual. The book starts off rather slow. The author takes her time before she gets into the real thick of things in the plot. She wants the reader to be comfortable with the alternate version of England that she has created in her fictional world. But after one is comfortable with the world, things really start to get interesting. Byt the end of the novel I was practically eating up the chapters. I definitely recommend this novel!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Reading JS/MN is an investment, and one that pays you back fivefold. It's a carefully paced book, not your typical page-turner. Each scene is beautifully crafted and her prose is a delight, but what I love best about this book is how what seems silly and comic becomes slowly more deep and complex. Both Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell are changed by their adventures in ways that will feel real, even in a fanciful landscape. And Clarke is absolutely brilliant at showing you what's coming in ways you don't understand until it arrives.I have one complaint: the book is too short. Yes, I know that those who don't like it say it's too long and slow, but once you're in it, you won't want it to end. Like Moby Dick, the slow build is one that refuses to let you go. If you're an adult who liked Harry Potter, you will want to kiss Susanna Clarke's feet for capturing the magic in an even more mature form. If (like me) you wanted to like Harry Potter but found it too emotionally flat, you'll be even happier."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a wonderfully crafted novel. Clarke creates a magical history in England and deliciously, perfectly carries out its every aspect. The writing style is smooth, the characters are highly enjoyable, the illustrations are smartly placed.Most enjoyable for me was the way Clarke tied accurate, to the dot, history with these magical characters and occurrences. She brilliantly intertwines Strange and Norrell into the early 1800s, and makes it flawless. As for the excessive use of footnotes - I found them very entertaining and enjoyable to read . . . What a great idea, and it works well.The book only ends too soon, and somewhat abruptly. Overall, excellent read - well worth the almost-800 pages, most definitely."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"That's the easiest way to describe this massive tome by first-time novelist Susanna Clarke. And it is massive, coming in at just under 800 pages.The plot is far too complex to go into here, and it has been done by other reviewers before me. But this novel has all the ingredients of a Dickens story - a noble hero (although I will admit that Clarke's definition of \\"noble\\" is somewhat at odds with Mr Dickens'), a damsel of pure heart in thrall to a man of evil (here there are actually two such ladies, and owing to the subject matter the evil does not reside in a man), and interesting supporting characters whose names describe their personalities to a T.Reviews that I have read of this book, by both professional reviewers and others, have described this book as an adult \\"Harry Potter\\". It is nothing of the kind. In fact, although the general subject of both this book and JK Rowling's series are the same, to compare these two is to compare apples and oranges.That is not to say, however, that \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell\\" is a bad book. Far from it, but you should be prepared to read it from a completely different viewpoint than you would a \\"Harry Potter\\" novel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Patience is a virtue and it pays off in the end with this novel. Much like the charachter Drawlight I was getting rather anxious about whether Mr. Norrell would ever perform magic or if this book would just be an unending ciruit of overly hyped parties with the uppercrust of 1810 in attendance. Around page 200 events unfolded that proved this book worth the effort. And the story actually became a \\"stay up late to see what is going to happen next\\" during the last 200 pages. Mr. Norrel is boring, overly cautious, and reclusive- not your normal hero. Jonathan Strange is daring, charasmatic, and sometimes oblivious to events around him. You respect what both men bring to the rebirth of English magic in the end. A sequel would be embraced- perhaps \\"Strange and Norrell escape from the unending darkness\\"? Or \\"The Fall of the Nameless slave\\" or \\"Vinculus: the New Book\\"...."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Clarke has written an incredible story that combines fantasy fiction with what feels like 19th century literature. Fans of either genre should very much enjoy this book.One of the best things about \\"Strange\\" is that the author took her time in unraveling the tale for her readers. Sure, the basic story could have been covered in 250 pages, and many authors would have chosen to do so. But at best, that could have only produced a book that was good. Readers of such an abbreviated version would not have realized it, but they would have been short-changed. Instead, Clarke wanted to emerse readers in 19th century life and magic. She included rich details that give the reader a flavor for both the time period and the individuality of each character. The reader has time to savor the book and really become engrossed in it. That is what turned an interesting idea into an astounding achievement."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"There is such a seamless blend of history and magical fantasy that it is hard to tell where real English history leaves off and an imaginary history of magic takes over. Strange and Norrell carry on their business alongside the Duke of Wellington and poet Lord Byron. Clarke tells the story with wit and polish. She sets a realistic tone with meticulous detail on societal structure and mannerisms of Jane Austen's time. Her use of quaint phrasing and such spelling as &quot;chuse&quot; for &quot;choose&quot; and &quot;shew&quot; for &quot;show&quot;, as well as use of fictitious footnotes on folklore and the history of magic, add to the realism. Yes, this is a long novel. But that effectively pulls the reader into a world where Parliament and magic, history and enchantment, and gentlemen and faeries work side-by-side. The book is so full of well-articulated imagery and magical surprises that the story line speeds along. Forget comparisons of this novel to Harry Potter. I recommend it as a refreshingly unique read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I bought this book based on some of the early reviews and I am having a hard time getting through it. It is slow, with not very much life to it. It is fantasy, but it is not very 'fantastic'. It might be a little too historically accurate for my, bogging down in the details instead of concentrating on plot-worthy events. The footnotes are fairly numerous and distracting. I am not sure if I will finish the book, similar to several other reviewers here."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The first time, I managed about 200 pages before giving up. For me, the footnotes were the best part -- the people and events described in the footnotes were more interesting than the story.I didn't care about any of the characters. I didn't particularly like or dislike any of them, and I wouldn't have cared to meet them. I can imagine that they lived and the events happened, but it was like there was a curtain between us. I was never pulled into the story, and had no trouble putting the book down.As a historical, the writing was competent and often witty. As fantasy, particularly today's fantasy, the plot lacked mystery, intrigue, and tension.This is the first time I've reviewed a book that I didn't finish, and I feel a bit guilty about that, but the book has been getting a lot of hype, and readers should be aware that the book isn't universally appreciated.***Edited to add that I did finish the book. Sometimes an attitude adjustment is all that's needed. With this book, it helped when I decided to abandon what I wanted and go with what Clarke wrote."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I can easily recommend this book to a wide variety of readers. It will be slow going for some and the extensive use of footnotes can throw some people off.Reading this on the Kindle was a breeze with the ability to simply click back and forth to and from the footnotes. The new software update (as of the date of this review) also understands that footnotes do not count as &#34;furthest page read&#34; which also helps when reading across multiple devices.Overall the tone of the story is very consistent and once you get into the swing of the story it is hard to put down. It is a story for everyone because it is much more about the personal relationships than any individual plot device.I do particularly love the ending of the book. The various story arcs all ties together characters all get wrapped up in a logical and thoughtful way.The last lines feel as good as &#34;Well, I am back&#34; from Samwise.&#34;...how shall I think of you?&#34; He considered a moment and then laughed. &#34;Think of me with my nose in a book!&#34;"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I can't understand why this book has sold so many copies. The idea that one guy (Mr. Norrell) would grab all the knowledge of magic in the world except for Johnathan Small strikes me as stupid. There are no characters in this story that I liked.

It's being quite strange of me to read that slowly, but I wanted to savour every page of this book.

The reviewers who complain of nothing happening are truly missing the point. The writing is magical, the humor is subtle and witty, the characters developed and complex. It completely rid me of the bad taste that \\"The Magicians\\" (a horrid, lazy book) left in my mouth, to compare it to another \\"grown up\\" magician book. It does start slow, but it builds speed gradually until I found I didn't want to stop reading. I only wish there were more Susanna Clarke books for me to instantly turn to and read. I have downloaded her book of stories, so I guess that will have to be enough for now."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Rich in detail, and refreshingly different. Clarke clearly spent a lot of time researching and put a lot of thought into blending her alternative universe with the known history. A must-read for anyone who enjoys deep characters and well thought out plots."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I bought this book as a gift for a friend after having read it myself. It is a fun story. My friend is an avid reader of multiple genres and she loved it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The first part of the book took a long time to get me involved, but because it had been recommended by someone I respect, I stuck with it. Once the plot got interesting, the characters began to be increasingly frustrating, to the point that I almost stopped reading. Again, I stuck with it-this time, not only because of my friend's recommendation, but because the plot had captured me enough that I really had to find out what was going to happen. The last 100 pages were extremely satisfying, and made clear the author's reasons for the seemingly incomprehensible and inconsistent behavior of the characters. It was intriguing, sad, strange and finally made sense."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"There was a distinct point where I began to love this novel. I couldn't say exactly where in the 1024-page count it was, but I think it was when I realized that the history of English magical legend and mythology was entirely fabricated by author Susanna Clarke. That history is so rich and hints so well at further richness that I almost couldn't be convinced that it was an invention of Clarke. This version of England is almost as detailed as Tolkien's Middle Earth, without being bogged down in a faux-recapitulation of that history. The elements of Clarke's world's history are revealed only as becomes necessary to the plot.And the plot -- what a plot it is. For a while it revolves around a small group of seemingly insignificant people, and even the events around them appear largely unimportant. The backdrop of the Napoleanic Wars distracts the reader from the slow burn that's happening right in front of his nose. Something terrible is happening in the land of Faerie, and its effects are beginning to leak into Victorian England.My only real complaint is the low quality of the illustrations. They are suitably gothic, but feel like studies for more complete drawings. An inked finish would have been more appropriate."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is easily one of my all time favorites. The writing is superb. It is unlike any book I have read. Such a pleasure."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"... the other nearly 500 reviewers that have praised this book. This is one of those books that I came upon randomly as an audiobook and rented from New Haven's one & only \\"Best Video\\" for a long road trip. I'd never heard of it, the title didn't tell me anything... but something about the cover image caught my imagination. And boy was it a good gamble into the unknown... Clarke's flight of fancy just took me away to a different world unlike any I'd ever encountered. The \\"man with thistledown hair\\" was such a marvelous creation and the Raven King an equally marvelous enigma. A true experience that is hard to pin into a category or genre. I loved it but I can see where this is a book for a somewhat old- fashioned reader and perhaps not for the fast-track world of today. Then again given the number of positive reviews I've seen maybe there are more of us than I thought.I keep looking to see if Clarke has written other books but I guess something like this will take years and years (not comparing in any way but didn't it take Ayn Rand 17 years or so to get Atlas Shrugged?) to conceive of and then to write. And there is something to be said for getting it right in one and turning to other projects."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"As a professed Anglophile, I loved the use of the old language in this book which at times can be a daunting read but keeps your attention with twist right when you think you've read as much as you can. It would make a great movie, although it maybe 3 hours long. I would suggest this boo to any one who likes there fantasy in a practical setting and has the attention span long enough to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The powers of the author are impressive, but the forced dedication to the particulars after 10 years of writing this book show some scatter and the dryness of time.The book is a fantastical fictional history of 2 Magicians that try to return England to a time of Magic and focuses on the very slow schism between the scholarly dedication of one overly philosophical and rational(-izing) yet emotional gentleman versus the cool man of actions that also happens to be manic-depressive, both foiled by an ALMOST all powerful fairy king and his friend, the un-classed and named, yet un-named Servant Stephen Black.If the above seems a bit long, a bit dry, and a bit over-wrought, it is only because it, in it's poor way, is my attempt to sum up the book both in essence and style.This opus, (as it is indeed a bit of a work to try and progress through it), has quite the base of beauty of language and character development, but after ten long years of of writing, of, what I assume, editing, and re-editing, make the work a bit too scholarly and pedantic. I found myself grasping at ravens feathers of pretty prose and trifles of dark humor to lighten the load but, in the end, it was just too heavy and discordant.For example, while some might applaud the wisdom of naming another character in another book \\"Angel Claire\\" and claim superior character knowledge from the naming, I find names like \\"Stephen Black\\" (which translates to \\"Crowned Black Man\\") and Mr. Strange seem incongruous and simple in a work that toils to build full characters.*I finished it, I found some measure of enjoyment in it, but I can't honestly recommend it to somebody unless I know they are patient of mind and open to a more plodding and fanciful structure.Finally, to dispel some misconceptions, this book is NOT-Harry Potter-ish (just because it is about magic)-Tolkien-esque (just because it describes the scenery with attention)-a simple battle of good and evil (nor, really, a book of good an evil)-(nor really, a simple book)*There are many of asterisks in this book, which serve as imaginative foot notes. Some of these are of interest but many just comment on items which somebody that was a scholar of the History of English Magic might like to use to further their studies. Since this book is indeed an imaginative History a majority of these footnotes soon become tiresome and provide nothing of interest to the plot of the book and sometimes provide some interest de rerum naturi."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The first two volumes can be rather slow in parts, but things really pick up and become quite engaging by the third, though perhaps almost too much of a rush to a conclusion as one nears the final chapters (but definitely not as obvious as one would see in the typical Hollywood blockbuster which crams endless car chases, explosions, and plot twists until the very end). The delta between \\"real\\" and alternative historical timelines is just the right amount, as is what's revealed (and not) about the Raven King. The degree to which one's feelings change about the various characters over the course of the interwoven stories is a good indication of how they're both multi-dimensional and believable. Definitely to be considered part of the fantasy genre canon."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is a wonderfully written, fascinating book, it deserves all the accolades it has recieved. It is a long, somewhat slow and involved read. . .this is a book to pay attention too, not to skim. . .and it made a nice change from more action based fare.However, I just don't understand what modern writers have against a happy ending, somehow people think that in order for a book to be \\"literature\\" -- instead of \\"just a book\\" -- it must be depressing. If I wanted to be depressed I'd read a newspaper.I do not intend this review to stop people from reading this book, I don't regret buying or reading it, but I do wish I'd had a warning about the place it would end up."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is probably the best book I've read in a long time. However, with all the comparisons to Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings floating around, I was reminded more of a completely different book as I read Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell... The Count of Monte Cristo stood out to me more than any other novel. The details of 19th-century high-society were vivid and engaging.Although this is a book concerning magic, this is a book ABOUT people. The quote at the beginning of Jonathan Strange's segment speaks worlds: \\"A magician might [kill a man with magic], but a gentleman never could.\\" This book is more about the relationships between the various characters, as all books SHOULD be.In all honesty, the book is rather slow up until the introduction of Jonathan Strange. That is a fairly unavoidable consequence of having a central character (Mr. Norrell) being a pretty boring person. The segments featuring The Man with the Thistle-Down Hair provide some relief, but in all honesty I was pretty eagerly waiting for the book to \\"pick up\\". I was not disappointed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book was a delight. I admit, it was a little heavy going. The thickness of the book itself was imposing, and on opening it, I found that the language was rather more ancient than I thought it might be. However, once you get past the 19th century novel model, it's a wonderful book. The stray into the land of fairy was vivid in both colour and detail. The explanations of things like the despair and melancholy were overpowering and you really end up buying into the world that Clarke creates.I loved it so much, I even named one of my own characters (Mrs Etherington-Strange) after Jonathan Strange. I adore the fact that magic starts off as just a boring activity for boring people and becomes something much darker and more practical.I have since bought the audio book and listened to all 34 (or more... I'm not certain) hours of it numerous times. It was a wonderful companion while in hospital and I treasure my copy.Why then did I mark it down to four stars? I simply didn't like the ending. I thought it was a little too hanging. I personally prefer stories with an ending, and I wasn't convinced that the ending was suitable for my own personal tastes."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I really enjoyed this book when it came out. I just saw that the kindle version is on sale for next to nothing. It's worth way more than that, so if you are hesitating, you can stop. Buy it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Things I liked about this book: period writing style, fresh plot (no tired epic journey or world-saving shenanigans here!), relative internal consistency, the feeling of the magic (mysterious, otherworldly, not fully understood)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The size of this book is overwhelming when you first look at it as a physical copy. Four page footnotes, a few black and white illustrations, small font, and an incredible number of pages. However, I gave this book five stars for a reason. If you're looking for a light read, it might not be what you need, but light-hearted is a better word. This is a fantasy novel of a different kind. It is not for children, but it is not too stale for any age as long as they can sit down to read it. The characters are amusing and likable (or easy to dislike, if that is what they are intended for), and the humor is subtle, ironic and witty. I don't bring myself to read on a non-stop basis, and I certainly don't read books of this volume, but I was intrigued in the first chapters, so I pressed on. It was worth it. The first few chapters are a bit slow, I suppose, but the writing style carries you through.Also, I suggest you read the footnotes. Everything is better if you read the footnotes."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is definitely one of my new favorites. It is set in England in the 1800s, but in an England where magic has been prevalent throughout its history, but at present dormant. Enter Gilbert Norrell-a very learned magician who learned his craft from buying up all the available books on magic in the land. He is very content to be the world's only practicing magician. But then Jonathan Strange appears. He is drawn to magic, and then to Mr. Norrell who has become the epicenter of English magic. The two are quite a pair of opposites, but their shared love of learning and magic unite them. They begin to aid England in the Napoleonic wars with their skills and are perceived as England's heroes. But a rather foolish pact That Mr. Norrell made with a Fairy will come back to bite both of them. Despite their differences they will need each other to fix things and fulfill a prophecy to bring English magic back to its former strength.What a great book. Even though it is over 800 pages it was engaging from start to finish. Some parts read like a book right out of Jane Austen's era, but with a twist of magic thrown in for spice. The footnotes that explain references to ancient magical history are also very engaging. This is a wonderful and unique undertaking, and I count Clarke among some of my favorite novelists. I look forward to reading more from this wonderful author.About the Author:Susanna Clarke is a British author. Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is her debut novel, which is a Hugo Award-winning alternate history. Clarke began Jonathan Strange in 1993 and worked on it during her spare time while editing cookbooks for Simon and Schuster. For the next decade, she published short stories from the Strange universe, but it was not until 2003 that Bloomsbury bought her manuscript and began work on its publication. The novel became a bestseller. Two years later, she published a collection of her short stories, The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories (2006). Both Clarke's novel and her short stories are set in a magical England and written in a pastiche of the styles of nineteenth-century writers such as Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. While Strange focuses on the relationship of two men, Jonathan Strange and Gilbert Norrell, the stories in Ladies focus on the power women gain through magic.If you find this interesting, also check out: Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley and A Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin. Both are excellent novels that really paint the entire history of the magical world around the story."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The story follows two English magicians as they try to restore magic to England during the Napoleonic Wars. It is an alternate history about how Mr. Norrell and his pupil begin practice magic for the government after it's long absence in their country. The two magicians have very different ideas about what types of magic should be practiced and eventually part ways. Mr. Norrell prefers to read the books he hordes and perform menial acts of magic while Strange explores darker magic to the detriment of his family and friends. Because this book is an alternate history, it is probably not for anyone who finds history to be very dull. It is also a book that requires a lot more time than most. I am a pretty quick reader but this book took a lot of time for me due to the extensive footnotes. Some of the notes are several pages long, which means a lot of time is spent flipping back and forth through pages. This was an excellent book for fans of fantasy and history."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr.Norrell is probably like the studyof magic itself. It can be a painstaking, tedious endeavorthat demands time, effort and commitment, but its rewards canbe marvelous. I agree that not everyone will enjoy this book.Parts of it can be slow, studious, almost fussy, and likeMr. Norrell himself, much taken with detail and appearancesand manners. Today's readers often don't have the patienceor desire to sit and plow through hundreds of pages ofmeticulous detail and character and scene development.I loved the book immensely. I loved its finely tuned characters,its dry, restrained humor, with just the right amount of gossipychattiness. I loved its ornate, gothic descriptions and footnotes,the intricasies of the story. Yes, there were times when it allseemed to veer off into subplots, and I wasn't sure where theauthor was taking it, but the charm of her writing kept mestrolling pleasurably through the pages and chapters.It all comes together in a precipitous, dizzying climax, swoopingdown and taking its characters to places they never imagined orintended, surprising them all as well as the reader. Suddenly magicis alive, and no one is in control but magic itself.I commend Ms. Clarke for her prodigious imagination, dry humor,flawless detail, and loving attention to character."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"A wonderful book, written in the style of Jane Austen, and that era of English literature. Wry and surprising, and complex..........the characters are many and fantastic, the story is entrancing. It concerns the return of magic to the English people........it is worthy of being compared to Neil Gaiman. I can think of no higher praise."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is wonderfully imaginative, unusual and beautifully crafted. It's a little classic 19th century novel and a lot of fantasy rolled into one. The way Ms. Clarke describes her alternate, magical 19th century England is highly entertaining. The writing is well-balanced, both suspenseful and lighthearted. Jonathan Strange is a very compelling character, and Mr. Norrell fascinating in his own, cranky way, as well. The tension between the two title characters builds the drama as the story continues to a thrilling conclusion."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I absolutely loved this book. The only way I could \\"read\\" it was during my commute.It is not for everyone, (see comments by D. Miller), who clearly knows nothing about English literature - this is for people who enjoy reading without rushing to the end. Clarke is a masterful genius with her descriptions, satire, the alternate history is hilarious. It all flows for Clarke with subtlety, the characters are lively, the British are portrayed with so much humor, as are the French. It is a fine piece of literature, and it you can't appreciate the richness of the language, you need to go back to reading Harlequin novel (talking to you, D. Miller).Highly recommended for true literature buffs."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is one of those novels you find once in a lifetime. It is completely different from anything you might have read about magicians before. Don't expect magical battles or a lot of action though. What is different here is the psychology of the magicians and the way in which some history is retold. A quick description could be: \\"kind of Harry Potter for adults who love Jane Austin and 19th Century novels\\". I highly recommend it for anyone who loves a blend of fantasy and historical fiction."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":".. between two 19th Century magicians.As others have commented .. this is not a typical fantasy novel. It has a 19th century (Dickensy) feel to the writing style. It reads like a series of short stories strung together by an underlying relationship between Norrell and his pupil, Strange.Unlike your typical fantasy novel, there is little roller-coaster ride here. The stories hold your interest well, but there are few places where I felt the need to continue reading, because I could not put the book down. The main characters are well drawn. The situations well described. Unusual terms are explained with planty of footnotes throughout. Some of the footnotes themselves are almost complete stories. Reading the longer footnotes is effectively reading a story, within a story, within a story.I'm not going to describe the storyline/plot, you can find that elsewhere.Why only 4*s?- some of the magic that is described, particularly during Strange's adventures in the Napoleonic wars, is just too far-fetched. With their powers, Strange and Norrell could have defeated the French purely between themselves.- I never figured out who the man with the thistle-down hair was. I understand he was the current faerie king, but got no historical background to the character (unless he was John Uskglass, and I missed it)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"One of the best novels I've read in the past ten years. Funny, chilling, astonishingly original and inventive, beautifully written."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I checked out this book from the library several times, and I could never finish it in the 2-week rental period, so I figured buying it at the low price offered here would be cheaper and easier than paying all the late fees I would incur if I continued to borrow it. I'm still only part way through it, but I've enjoyed owning it, reading it, highlighting in it, and I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I purchased this book at the beginning of January, and while considerably lengthy, I could have ripped through it in a few days. Yes, it is that good. But as a previous reviewer said, this was written to be savored. I've intentionally dragged the reading of this book out over the course of a couple months in order to enjoy it for as long as possible. I frequently found myself re-reading sentences and paragraphs to savor the words Clarke selects.Describing this novel as a Harry Potter for adults does a disservice to Clarke's novel. The Harry Potter books are wonderful, but in a different way. In brief, while the Harry Potter books are ABOUT magic, Susanna Clarke's novel INCLUDES magic. But that is only the tip of the iceberg; there is so much more in her book.Reading this book felt like I was discovering a treasure. Each chapter, each paragraph, each word is meant to be treasured.To those negative reviewers; learn to appreciate good writing. I can't help but feel that the people who gave this book one star are the same ones who love James Patterson."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The novel was given to me as a Christmas gift and I could not put it down. Although the book seems daunting at first glance, it was a relatively fast read. Unexpected turns and twists kept me wanting more and I was disappointed when I finally finished the novel. This book is not for the novice reader who gets easily put off by the amount of pages. Close attention to detail and a wonderful gift for the avid reader."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Precious few books can take you for a ride like this one. Make no mistake, this work is well over one thousand pages--considering the myriad tiny footnotes that add so much to the depth of the narrative. It was an enjoyable read from start to finish; that is certainly the highest compliment that I can give.The book defies categorization. It is neither a history nor a fantasy, not a mystery nor any of the myriad categories that books are thrown into these days. The elegance of the book is apparent from its perfectly accurate title. This is indeed, a novel. A long narrative with a plot unfolded by the thoughts and actions of its characters. I found the characters to be fascinating--Norell with his endless collection of books, Strange with his innate confidence in his own abilities and Childermass somewhere in the middle. It is the story of two approaches to the restoration of a body of knowledge--Norell relies on books and is hesitant to try new things while Strange is anxious to use his own nascent talents without regard for written warnings. The twist is, of course, that the seemingly more cautious Norell is indeed the more reckless of the characters.More could be said about the story but to know too much about the book before reading it would detract from the pleasure of discovery that this book provides. It is so very, very rare to encounter so original a work. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Wow what a crazy, amazing and intreguing book. I can see how people might be put off by this book. It can be slow in parts (though it does pick up) and it's not a crazy page turner you have to finish now type book. But on the other hand I agree with the critics (which are quoted on the back of the book) that \\"it's an instant classic\\"- Kirkus review; and that \\"many books are to beread, some are to be studied and a few are meant to be lived in for weeks. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Noreell is one of the last kind.\\"- Washington Post. The book is extremely well written and I think should be added to English Literature classes.It is definitely unlike anything else I've ever read, the plot is fantastic and original, the chracters are amusing and the footnotes are a blast. I'm also very glad they didn't americanize the spelling of certain words. A++ One of my favorite books ever. You MUST read this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is a great book, a worthy follow-on for those burned out on Harry Potter-style magic. Set in 1800s England, Clarke employees the usage and spelling of the period (shew instead of show, sopha instead of sofa), but the bad Kindle translation just about ruins this fine read, making some lines of text so confusing it is impossible to untangle the intentional spelling from the hamfisted data entry.Buy the book, but avoid the Kindle ed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Susanna Clarke's debut novel is epic in scope, meticulous in its attention to detail and also maddeningly long. Set in an alternative Regency England where magic, not science, is the dominant paradigm, this is a story of friendship, power and bitter rivalry. The fictitious tale of Strange and Norrell is cleverly interwoven with actual events and visited by a number of historical personages, which serves to make it all the more convincing. I particularly liked the quasi-Arthurian mythos of the Raven King. Despite its length and the all but glacial speed of the plot, I'm glad I picked this up."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Susanna Clarke is the type of writer who chooses to write an essay when only one word answer was asked of her, I applaude her for the rich and deep history that she created for the characters in this novel, but it was too much.When trying to read this book i constantly found myself re-reading the same passages over and over again. The book would move from slow and dragging, to vastly entertaining. I wanted to finish reading this book, but in the end the only was i could was by listening to the the audio commentary.Many times with a novel i find myself dissapointed when reaching the end, wanting the story to continue. However with the novel i was dissapointed with how Ms. Clark managed to take such an interesting story and characters and then proceed to kill me with boredom.I appreciated the work and time that Ms. Clarke took in creating the characters with footnotes refering to fictional works of magic, but if you really must insist on reading this book, i suggest you save yourself the heartache and get the audiobook."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I finished reading Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell two nights ago. I will admit that the first hundred or so pages seemed so boring that I put the book aside for about two weeks thinking, ugh, how disappointing. But when I picked it up again, I found there were many nights when I read in bed till the wee hours of the morning, I found this story so engaging. The characters are so well rounded out, the different chains of the story connect so well, it is a wonderful read. When I came to the final few chapters, I honestly cried, these characters had gone through so much! And the conclusion truly wrapped up the story, there was nothing left hanging. I have read all the availale Harry Potter books and Lemony Snicket stories, and I felt considerably disappointed that those stories had a lot of \\"filler\\" that didn't improve the tales. Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is a truly adult read, and I recommend it to everybody!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book reminds me more of the longer Tolstoy novels than anything eles in its scope, emphasis on character development, subtle engaging plot over mindless action plot, and the beauty of the language. However, like Tolstoy, I think that you either love or hate it depending on your personal reading interests/style. I loved it - hence the rating. This book is NOT for people who prefer THRILLERS however."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Others in this forum have described the content of this wonderful novel, so instead, I'll just give my gushing reaction to what I read. I LOVED this book! I consumed all 800 pages in less than a week between work and sleeping; devouring it with the same singular passion Strange shows when studying magic. And when I finished it a few days ago, I was sad! I felt as though I'd left dear friends behind with no idea when I might see them again -- if ever. For a moment I toyed with re-reading the book ;-) Oh, I envy anyone who has not yet read it. It's one of those experiences that restore your faith in not only good storytelling, but the use of the English language. Susanna Clarke has created a thoroughly realized world (an alternate reality to ours) which, like Tolkien, has its own history, conventions, and legends, and not far into the book, you genuinely start to wonder: \\"Was there really a Raven King in England?\\" When I was a kid, I read voraciously. My favorite books were tales of historical reality tinged with fantasy like Narnia and Lord of the Rings, as well as the collected folk and fairy tales and legends of other countries. The closest I've come to finding similar books as an adult have been the Potter and Pullman novels. But this book outshines them both. This novel rewards the reader with not only a top notch story that grabs and holds your attention from start to finish, and vivid characters, each one; down to the smallest role fully realized -- but some of the best writing I've seen in ages. Harry Potter is a good yarn, but few would describe Rowling's writing as \\"literary.\\" Clarke's is. So much so, in fact, that when one takes a break from the novel, one may find one's thoughts and speech flowing in the book's narrative style. Now let me add my $.02 about the footnotes. I can see where they might annoy some readers or seem a bit twee. I found them charming. Not only for what they added to the story - and the way in which they added it - but because many of them are wonderful TOTALLY FAKE legends in their own right. And they're so well realized that, again, you wonder if those tales are really knocking around Great Britian somewhere. Does the book require patience? I suppose. Today's attention spans being what they are, many may not find a novel like this to their taste. But if you loved Dickens and Austin and their ilk, and you enjoy a hint of fantasy in your world, I guarantee you will love this book. I borrowed my copy from the library, but I want to own it and intend to buy it as soon as I finish this note. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book has a very plodding pace, especially the first 250 pages. I put it down several times before forcing myself to read that far. It gets much better 1/4 of the way through. I could appreciate the very dry humor, and laughed out loud several times, but it's definitely not a page-turner. I read a lot of it aloud to my family on a road trip, and actually enjoyed it a great deal more. There is so much hidden humor which is easy to scan over when reading silently. I loved the footnotes--very satirical of actual scholarly writing."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I originally spotted this book while at a bookstore with my daughter. With almost 800 pages, a font size I found to be smaller then the norm, and subject matter that didn't seem as flashy as other books, I decided to take a shot and started reading it. I was very pleasantly surprised by the flow and interest this novel created. This book is not a &quot;quick read&quot; or a &quot;sprint&quot;... this is a &quot;marathon.&quot; I thoroughly enjoyed my time spent in England over the 10 years from 1806-7 to 1817 and I am now becoming a fan of historical thanks to Susanna Clarke. The end does indeed justify the means in this story and although there may be some slow convoluted it gradually makes sense as the pages progress. I highly recommend this to people who don't mind investing the time in a book and are already a fan or have interest in trying some historical fiction mixed with a bit of magic. Note - Don't expect Harry Potterish plot and action."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is a bit intimidating at first sight, but it is well worth it. From page one, I was captivated by the modern day use of old English by the author. She gives the reader the feeling of being in a Dickens novel, but adds the magic and excitement of Rowling. The book is filled with dark humor and keeps you turning pages as fast as you can. I loved it and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Ms. Clarke should be proud.The author refuses to be hurried. It takes some committment, getting into the novel. It took me about fifty pages. By then, I was in for the ride, and no turning back.Clarke paints a grand picture of early nineteenth century England. Besides being an unusual and original fantasy work, it is an historical novel of the first order.Some complaints -- I found myself losing track of people every so often, particularly once I was half way through. This is to be expected -- by page 400, other authors are winding down. Ms. Clarke was just gearing up.Second, sometimes the transition from Norrell and Strange to Stephen Black and the silver-haired gentleman seemed unnecessary. It was as though Ms. Clarke wished them not to be forgotten.But it was delightful reading, all in all. There was depth and complexity, much more than one usually expects from a new novelist.I give it four stars because she has to go higher with her next work. Highly recommended. I read a library copy, but will be purchasing my own for my collection -- eBay, here I come for a signed copy?"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book was great. I admit that it started off a bit slow and I almost stopped reading it because I thought it quite boring. It starts off by giving you alot of background information and stuff you need to know to understand the book. Some people are disappointed because they arent immediately immersed in a world filled with magic. In all actuality the book starts off saying all magic is gone from England. But after you get started reading and you are introduced to Mr. Norrel and his first feat of magic things get a lot more interesting. You cant compare this book to Harry Potter....you could call it Harry Potter for adults, but you cant say it was a bad book because it was nothing like Harry Potter. Harry Potter puts you in a place that doesnt exist though there is reference to the outside world. This book blends magic into history in a way that almost makes you want to believe thats really the way it happened. In my mind this book is a lot more realistic than Harry Potter and makes you think. Its a kind of fantasy book that gives you a break from the normal magic filled totally unrealistic fantasy. Its really hard to explain whats so intriguing in this book....but if you read it and dont try to compare every little thing in it to a different book that you think was \\"better\\" you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"700+ pages, and I couldn't put it down. The book was so unwieldy that I actually thought about buying a recliner just so I could read it in comfort! In the end, I sat in my home office chair and propped my feet on top of the computer, and that seemed to do for a while.If you love Jane Austen novels or even films based on Jane Austen's works (e.g., Sense & Sensibility, Emma) and you love fantasy novels, you will probably love this book. Virtually the only resemblance to Harry Potter is that it's based in England and it describes magicians. It's a dark comedy of manners set in the early 1800s. It made me laugh out loud a number of times, often with surprise, because the humor is dry and subtle and it tends to pop out in unexpected places. Susanna Clarke also populates the book with famous historical figures such as Napoleon, Lord Byron, and Duke Wellington. The world she creates is captivating and even after 700 pages, I didn't want to leave it.A brilliant accomplishment. If there's any justice in the world, it will become a literature classic in time, and not just within the fantasy genre. I hope she writes more books..."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This has been hyped so hard and so long by so many that I was looking forward to reading this book and was happy to get the Kindle edition on sale. I love historical fiction set in this period and enjoy works written at this time. Alternate history with magic works are a favorite of mine and I've read others set in this time period and enjoyed them greatly.One of the reviewers here says that if you find the jokes funny in the first chapter you will enjoy this. I did not find that to be true. There are some genuinely funny lines but they aren't enough to save this.The thing is, those other books had characters that I liked, or at least were amused by, and enjoyed getting to know. I'm up to chapter 13 (which is 13% in) and most of the characters are variously unpleasant, petty, strident, shallow, ignorant, arrogant, greedy, and pedantic. There have only been two characters that I felt any spark of interest in and they appear relatively briefly and haven't been seen in a long time at this point. I haven't even \\"met\\" the other main character, Jonathan Strange, yet and I've kept plodding on for the last couple of chapters waiting for him to appear and hoping that his appearance would change the tone of the book but I can't take it anymore.The pacing is glacial. I don't mind a slow meandering plot if I'm meandering along with people I care about but I'm finding it a challenge just to suspend disbelief enough to believe that they are people and not marionettes that the author is forcing to dance for her own amusement. Which, of course it's true that all fictional characters ARE an author's puppets but I really do prefer that the strings not be so very visible.I stalled out nearly two weeks ago and every time I try to start back up I get maybe another few paragraphs in before having to fight the urge to throw down the book, which with a Kindle is no longer an option. I will do the electronic version though and delete it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I relish books with alternative history themes, settings in the 19th century, and touches of magic. This book contains all of those, yet I did not enjoy it at all. I found it ponderous and dull and the characters thoroughly unengaging. I was quite disappointed in it, and I don't believe I will read any of this author's work again."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Susanna Clarke's first novel is an instant classic in the prodigious historical fantasy genre. While reading this novel, I thought I had missed my history lesson on early 19th century England. I didn't know that the British Army used magicians to defeat Napoleon at Waterloo. Did you? This wonderful book documents the return of British magic from 1806 through 1817. Like magic, the book at 782 pages actually seemed much shorter than it was.I was reminded of Charles Dickens while reading this book. The first reason is the use of archaic spelling, such as \\" surprize \\" for surprise, \\" shew \\" for show, and \\" chuse \\" for choose. The second reason is the evocative character names, such as Mr. Honeyfoot, Lord Sidmouth, Mr. Segundus, and Miss Wintertowne. The third reason is the constant return of theoretical magician Vinculus to the story when I thought the author was finished with him. That reminded me of Orlick from Dickens's Great Expectations.I enjoyed Clarke's use of hundreds of footnotes which gave the story the air of a real history. The pell-mell manner that some authors use footnotes is avoided using crisp and verified direction. The only downside was that their small type often made my eyes strain and water.The story itself begins with Mr. Norrell, England's self-proclaimed and only practical magician, deciding to bring magic back to England. This makes the theoretical magicians, who believe that actual magic died out years ago, resign, except for Mr. Segundus and the rogue Vinculus. Mr. Norrell moves to London with his servant, John Childermass ( see what I mean about the names ). From there, Mr. Norrell becomes popular with the Lords and Gentlemen of London. The wife of one of his benefactors, Sir Walter Pole, dies unexpectedly, and Sir Walter asks Mr. Norrell to resurrect her. To assist him, Mr. Norrell conjures up a fairy- the pernicious gentleman with thistle-down hair in the bright green jacket. They succeed; but, the evil fairy refuses to go back to Faerie land and puts an enchantment on Mrs. Pole and Sir Walter's servant, Stephen Black.Eventually, Mr. Norrell takes on a pupil, Jonathan Strange, but holds back information from his vast library, not wanting his pupil to better him. Mr. Strange becomes very successful and helps the war effort against France with his powerful magic. He comes back from the war a hero, which leads to a nasty break-up with Mr. Norrell. The gentleman with the thistle-down hair then enchants Mrs. Strange, and Jonathan Strange now thinks she is dead.Not wanting to divulge the ending. I'll stop here. The last two hundred or so pages are full of magical conflicts between Mr. Norrell, Strange, the enchantees ( I made that word up ), and the odious gentleman with the thistle-down hair. Wow, what a book. This is the best novel that I have read this year. There is no follow up yet, but one is in the works."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"As a graduate student, I found the patient rhythm of this book very relaxing. I figured I'd try to finish it before completing the degree (so I was in no hurry). After finishing it, I found myself flipping the book open to random sections spending a delightful hour reading. Happy the author that can make such stories! Ms Clarke seems to have a never-ending well of stories, proven by the lengthy footnotes that end up being marvelous stories of themselves. Though I am now quite familiar with the book, I continue to be amazed whenever I spend some time with it. An incredible work of art.This book is in a class of its own. Not only worth the read, but quite worth a second and third reading."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell ( S&N; from here out), has been described as a fantasy novel, an alternative history novel, and a historical novel. I'm not too concerned about that, though, since this 2005 Hugo Award winner falls into the most important category of novels: good novels.Set in early 19th century England, S&N; opens in 1806, and carries the characters through the Napoleonic Wars and into 1816. The book assumes a history of magic in England that had died out centuries before the story begins, and the title characters (first Norrell and then Strange) become the first practicing magicians in centuries. The story follows their attempts to restore English magic (and figuring out what that even means in practice).The story begins slowly, admittedly, as the reader is introduced to a large cast of memorable characters, with the title duo joined by African-British butler Stephen Black, Norrell's servant John Childermass, the ever-afflicted Lady Pole, gentlemen about town Henry Lascelles and Christopher Drawlight, and the mysterious fairy, the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair all being developed as well-rounded, believable, deep (if not all of them likeable) characters. Historical figures make appearances as well, most predominately and most enjoyably Duke Wellington and Lord Byron.In addition to the large cast, S&N; is peppered with footnotes that expound upon the history of magic in England, discussing magicians and magic of long ago, and adding layer upon layer upon the history of the real England. Looming over all of this history is the enigmatic Raven King, a magician who ruled northern England for centuries before disappearing and is credited with the creation of English magic.As the novel progresses, the characters and the histories are drawn tighter and tighter together, and the pace of the novel picks up as the different pieces all fall into place. It may seem like a lot of characters and a lot of background, but almost all of it ends ups tying into the many and satisfying payoffs at the conclusion of the novel.Besides the setting, plot, and characters, what really sets S&N; apart is the language. Clarke's writing is full of fantastic turns of phrases and a subtle poetic quality, combined with a dry and occasionally sarcastic humor. Having recently re-read Charles Dickens' Great Expectations and Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, along with previously enjoying British novels of 19th century such as Frankenstein and Dracula, the prose manages to capture much of the feel of the time, and really makes the reader believe that this book could have been published in 1820, instead of 2004.I listened to S&N; on audio book, and Simon Prebble's reading was very strong. He carries off the old fashioned language as if it were the simplest thing in the world, and his voices for each character fit them perfectly.If you have the patience to allow the story to build, and enjoy deeply layed narrative and great use of the English language, I highly recommend Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell. I'll leave you with two of my favorite examples of the language and themes in the novel.- \\"'Can a magician kill a man by magic?' Lord Wellington asked Strange. Strange frowned. He seemed to dislike the question. 'I suppose a magician might,' he admitted, 'but a gentleman never could.'\\"- \\"Poor Stephen was assailed by miracles.\\""},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is not a book to blaze through, but meander along with -- consider it a glass of a fine red wine, deep with tannins, consumed in slow, savoring sips rather than a shot of jack, tossed heedlessly back. A friend considers it a \\"winter read,\\" with the ideal setting being an enveloping couch alongside a crackling fire. I made the mistake of reading this in the summer. After the excited reviews of my friends (\\"you must read it!\\", \\"such great writing!\\"), I was eager to become enveloped into the story -- I was expecting a page-turner, something riveting and catching my excitement. I was looking for a book I would talk about for months to come. This is not one of these books.\\"Jonathan Strange..\\" is a slow-paced tome akin to that of \\"of Human Bondage\\" and \\"War and Peace\\" in both size and excitement. The storyline plods along (barely) and it was not until page 700 that I found myself actually excited to continue reading (or perhaps I was just unwilling to have wasted 700 pages of reading and was optimistic of a delightful ending). At page 300, I began polling friends to see if the book was worth continuing.The highlight of \\"Jonathan Strange\\" is the writing. I compare it to Oscar Wilde in society wit, as well as description (although Clarke, thankfully, does not suffer her readers with 100-word descriptions of objects or weather), and Jane Austin. The characters engage in witty repartee that is a delight to read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Clarke, the author, and Rosenberg, the illustrator, have between them created a world of many more layers than those to which readers are usually treated in the last few decades. As has been pointed out by others, the depth and richness of detail keep the book from being a casual read, but it amply repays the reader who enjoys fantasy with a historical flavor. In a way, it's like Jane Austen and Patrick O'Brian in a clever \\"what if\\" mode."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Hard to describe the weirdness and poetic magic of this book. It seems very long and tedious. Many little details and characters are developed slowly. However, the magic is funny, mysterious and very poetic. The magic and magicians are more subtle than many other such books. Some of the magic is large in scale and even funny, but I really loved how spell casting was related to the power of the earth or the water or the trees. I also liked how the plot lines eventually converge and you get a sense that it was all pre-determined.The bad guy is very strange, very crazy, and also sorta funny. The revenge scene, where the bad guy finally gets it, its simply amazing. I got the sense that many things, seemingly by chance, came together in one incredible moment of power and destiny. I had to re-read those pages a few times it was so beautiful. Not many people have the ability to write like that.The book is a combination of Tolkien, Alice in Wonderland, Charles Dickens, and maybe a little bit of Harry Potter.Toss in some revisionist history as well. :DRead it slowly, a little at a time. This is not candy, its a 5 course meal.-Randy"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"One of the great things about this book is how deliberate it paces itself. The first few hundred pages are doled out with a Jane Austen slowness where Mr. Norrell is the one practical magician in a nation full of theoretical magicians who are forced into retirement by his tricks. Without much rush, the book depicts his life in London as he is trying to create a place for new magicians. Full of footnotes and hints of a deeper and darker picture, this is a book that establishes its strength well before the fairies show up to start wrecking everything.Plenty of reviewers have praised this book before me, but I must say that what I loved most about this book is how it depicts fairies as genuinely scary beings, not because they are evil; only because they have a very complex moral system that does not agree with the humanity around them - so forcing people to come to an enchanted castle to dance is not considered kidnapping so much as a favor.WHen the book picks up in the last 300 pages, you will find yourself reading it without pause in hopes that you finish it soon.This is a great book that should be on everyone's favorite fantasy list."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Considering it took me nearly four months to finish this expansive novel, it would be hard not to review it. It's not that I'm a slow reader. It is rather that this book covers so many characters' lives over nearly ten years worth of time, that I was constantly putting this book down and forgetting about it. That being said, this is one of the best novels I've read in a very long time. It certainly holds a place in my top-ten favorite fantasy novels.Clarke's success at creating a believable fantasy world is admirable, and it is probably the reason for the expansive nature of the book. After reading it, I can certainly see how much of the excess could have been cut to make a quirky, fun fantasy novel; however, if that were so, I do not think I would have adored this book as much as I did. Clarke's prose attempts to force the reader to believe the story is true. She weaves in actually historic events and characters amid her product of fiction.The main storyline centers around the title characters. Gilbert Norrell is a scholarly magician attempting to bring English magic back to the world. In doing so, he attempts to help the English army fight against the French. Norrell is crafted to be a dull character, who is counterbalanced by the young, handsome, and altogether enthusiastic Jonathan Strange, who eventually becomes Norrell's pupil. Their views on English magic differ in many ways, but they mainly disagree on the use of Fairie magic. Norrell finds it dangerous and unethical in modern society--a viewpoint solidified by Norrell's own summoning of a Fairie to save a knight's wife from death. This act eventually becomes the main conflict of the novel, as the Fairie begins to run amok unbeknown to the protagonists, until his antics begin to cause major problems in the life of Jonathan Strange, causing Strange to resort to a mad form of magic in order to save the lives of several loved ones.Although I loved reading this book, and have kept my synopsis purposely vague so as not to spoil anything, there are several qualms I have with it. My main problem, and probably the same problem others have, is that Clarke attempts to show realism by incorporating footnote upon footnote about everything from the history of English magic to fables used to teach magical concepts. There are several chapters that are short in content, but extensive in footnote information. Several footnotes even take up a few pages of space. Even though these notes do succeed in lending an air of authority, there is an incongruity presented since the book is, in fact, fiction. This style might hold up if Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell read like a non-fiction text, but aside from the footnotes, it does not. Also, I found quite a few footnotes to be completely useless in furthering the story. For example, the fairy Norrell summons to aid him enchants several people, and prevents them from telling others of their torment. Whenever they attempt to cry out for help, they instead rattle off a non-nonsensical story, which is usually (tediously) told in full in footnote form. I found myself reading through these stories as fast as possible so as not to distract me from the text. The first story was humorous, but after that I was bored, especially when one came up near the climax of the story.My other qualm is the fact that the ending of the novel is an open-ended one. It almost seems as if Clarke was leaving room for a sequel. While I enjoyed the ending, and would welcome a sequel, it also went against the realism Clarke attempts to create. Throughout the entirety of the novel, she presents the story to us in a manner that makes the reader believe the story is fully documented in the annals of magical literature; however, when we arrive at the ending, we find there is more of the story to tell, which is slightly unnerving considering the devotion one must have to finishing this tome. Because of this, if I were to read the novel again, I would probably skip most, if not all of the footnotes (though some are critical to understanding future events in the novel, so I wouldn't recommend it to first-time readers)Despite its faults, Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is enormously impressive considering it is the first novel of Susanna Clarke. Since reading this, she has convinced me to read anything else she publishes concerning the magic history of England. I highly recommend it to seasoned fantasy veterans, and those with only a slight interest. I tend to think of myself as a part of the latter group, and I still adored this story."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"First, a word of caution-- this book will eat days of your life. You'll never get those days back, but you'll be hard-pressed to find days more enjoyed with a book. You'll read the 800-900 some odd pages and at the end you'll look about you on the bed or the chair and hope that a sequel has somehow fallen out and awaits your eager attention. I won't go into plot summary or the like, but I will say that all of these characters will become real to you and you will devour every little footnote for the added dimension they bring to the book and the history they flesh out.I hope you'll pick this up, and if you hate it, well, chances are I hate books you love."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"First things first: this is a daunting book. It's long and wordy and loaded with footnotes. But once I managed to screw up my courage and really dive into it, I wasn't even a little bit disappointed.Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell takes place in England in the early 19th century. We see familiar historical figures (Lord Wellington figures prominently, as do Lord Byron and King George III), but we learn little by little that the history of this England is quite unlike the history that we know. The country used to be awash with magic, but now the only people who style themselves \\"magicians\\" would more accurately be thought of as magical historians. That is, of course, until the emergence of Mr Norrell and his protege Jonathan Strange.I don't want to describe too much more of the plot, because for such a long book, the plot is surprisingly straightforward and simple. The joy of the book is in the writing, the details, and the intricate world created by Susanna Clarke. The style of writing reminds me of Dickens or Austen, but loaded with wondrous (and not-so-wondrous) magic, and peppered with footnotes that help fill out the fictional history of English Magic.In short, the book was a delight. Setting the book in almost, but not quite, familiar terrain is a great way to make the reader feel simultaneously comfortable and uncomfortable, and her characters are as well-drawn as her world is detailed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is thick, and will be hard for some people to get into. There's one main story, but there's a lot of side-stories, and this may annoy some readers. If you don't like that kind of narration, don't read this. It took me a while to get into it, but once I got to a certain point, I found it interesting and more coherent, and it then became really easy for me to continue as I was genuinely enjoying myself. My point is, if you find yourself put off at first, have some patience and stick to it, you may find it very well worth your effort as I did.It was fun to read about an alternate version of history (early 19th c) where magic is real. There's also a few fun spelling quirks here (surprize for surprise, chuse instead of choose) so this story has more of an authentic feel to it, as if it really was written during the early 1800's."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Wonderfully imaginative, expertly crafted, full of mind-boggling detail, I am thoroughly enjoying this book though my wrist is getting sore from holding it aloft. This tale of English Magic during the napoleonic wars is not for the feint of heart, by which I mean those without patience for gobs and gobs of glorious faux-historical detail. The footnotes are eye-killers, to be sure, but worth the strain. If you love immersing yourself in a well-crafted universe where anything is possible, you will probably love this."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Do not believe the pathetic reviewers who have come before me saying they couldn't care about the characters. What book were they reading? Are they so used to \\"villains\\" and \\"heroes\\" that they can't care about interesting but flawed characters? The novelist Ms. Clarke is most like in my opinion is Thackeray. She views her characters from a slight distance, highlighting all their hypcrisies and flaws, but lovingly. I have read a great many novels in the last few years that attempt to reproduce the 18th or early 19th century in tone as well as in setting, and this is the FIRST one I thought successful. If you like Fielding, Austen and Thackeray, you'll love this book. If you like whipping through bestsellers you pick up at your local Target, don't insult this book by trying to read it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The novel Jonathon Strange & Mr. Norrell is five-star fantasy in every way. The magic is original, not a re-work of another author's ideas. The characters' personalities are drawn in great detail and the fine details contribute greatly to their behavior throughout the novel. The characters both consistently act within their personalities and continue to reveal themselves through their actions. And the plot is so complex, the reader really doesn't anticipate the upcoming twists - they are always a surprise.This is fantasy without dragons and without a young man on a quest (unless, perhaps, the 30-something Strange can be considered so). Two magicians, one a recognized master, one an apprentice, collaborate to restore practical magic to England. The one's reclusiveness and the other's open-mindedness cause a rift as they pursue a common goal, and perhaps a common enemy. And the open ending is not a resolution so much as a door to what the reader can only hope is a sequel as surprising as the original."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It is England in the early 1800s as she has always been: the Empire that dominates the globe, full of scoundrels, snobs, and...well, magic. Susanna Clarke tweaks history by adding a magical past to England at its zenith: centuries back, magic and magical ability were commonplace; scholars of magic could move cities, create roads to nowhere, summon faerie servants to do their bidding, and leave the human world to reign over kingdoms on the other side of Hell. In Strange and Norrell's England, however, the rise of the Empire has also witnessed the devolution of practical Magic. It seems that only one man - the reclusive, wealthy, and vain Mr. Norrell - retains the ability to do real magic, an ability that he demonstrates by making all the statues in Yorkminster Cathedral come alive momentarily.Norrell resents the idea of other magicians; he buys up every magical book in every library in England, and makes himself valuable to the English government by conjuring up invading fleets of British ships made solely out of rain, to threaten the French fleet. His drive to become the sole magician in England leads him to take a terrible risk, unleashing a wicked fairy, known only as \\"the man with the thistledown hair\\" on London. Then, a new magician appears on the scene: the heroic, even romantic Jonathan Strange. Where Norrell is a sullen recluse, Strange is an affable fellow devoted to his wife. Where Norrell uses his magic for personal gain, Strange wants magic to save England. He even accompanies the Duke of Wellington on campaigns against Napoleon, saving Brussels from French invasion by temporarily depositing it in (it appears) the plains of Nebraska. Eventually the rivalry between Norrell and Strange puts Strange's wife at terrible risk; Strange goes near mad in his attempts to save her. At the end, he succeeds, but Strange and Norrell's fates are permanently linked together in a way promising for those wanting a sequel.This book has been mismarketed as an adult Harry Potter. It is more closely related to Jane Austen or perhaps Charles Dickens. First, because its author Clarke is, stylistically, an exquisite mimic of the tone of its times: Clarke's narrator has some of Austen's wit and powers of observation about Society, as well as some of Dickens' ability to put her full creative genius into the smallest scenes and characters (everybody in this book is terrifically interesting). Some reviewers (most notably the Times' Janet Maslin) objected to the book's length (it runs about 800 pages), but to my mind its length is completely consistent with its era and the charms of its story (it even has some footnotes, which are interesting in their own right). Who, after all, would have wished David Copperfield or Sense and Sensibility to \\"get to the point\\"? I would have been disappointed to have it end a moment sooner. It is not meant to be the book version of an \`action' picture, as the Harry Potter series, for all its charms, seems in comparison.Clarke adds to these strengths of style and character a plot that, for all its length, is quite gripping. I predict it will matter a great deal to you how and why Arabella Strange escapes her peril. People who prefer pure fantasy to historic fiction may not love this book as much as I did. But, if you like books that give a deliciously authentic sense of an era, and books that are full of interesting twists and turns, you will find a unique combination of them here."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I am not going to bore you with a description of the book.

I highly recommend this quirky, lovely book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I'm fairly young, I came across the Potter series about two years ago (or more precisely had it shoved under my nose). After finishing the fourth installment I considered myself Rowling's No. 1 fan. Since then I have made more than one fan site, have taken trips to other cities just to meet the author, and have convinced myself that I'd like to kinda be one -- an author that is.But then I'm not here to promote Potter.I found Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell after reading a article that mentioned a book like Potter, only for adults. I believed this. Bought the book and realized I had been sorely decieved. Like many others I believe there could not be two less comparable books.In a literary sense they hold nothing in common (and don't be fooled into thinking their writing styler is similar, you get that style with British fantasy), and yet for all their lack of similarity they do have one rather similar significancy:They both work magic. Horribly enchanting magic. The rush of adrenalin, of bitter-sweet excitment...when reading Susanna Clarke's book I wanted time to stop, to stay burning in that moment. (And all of this at the risk of sounding both cliche and melo-dramatic!)I did, really.But of course it didn't.I finished the book a time-flying 16 minutes later. Put it away on my shelf between my UK and US editions of Harry Potter...All the while reaching the conclusion that I have not read crueler books then JK Rowling's and Susanna Clarke's first novel(s)....I'm sorry I've realized that what I am writing here isn't nearly as much a review, as it is a 14 year old's rambling. But I've heard enough debates between whether Jonathan Strange fits the shoe as a classic or if it's simply a hype with too much Austen and Gaiman for it's own good. And they all forget what makes a book what it is -- the magic. The timeless hours that slip unconsciously by as pages flutter by, one at a time.I will never forget Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell, and I couldn't care less if the hype dies down and everyone else decides that it was simply that, a hype -- something to be forgotten.Fine. Let it be forgotten.I'll remember it.Today. Tomorrow. 40 years from now.I'll remember it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I suppose it is appropriate that when one reads a novel having to do with magic, then one must come under some sort of spell. To my weary mind the book gave the very distinct illusion that it was never going to end. Of course, being a rational human being, it took no great effort to dispel this illusion: one can lift the book with one hand; one can open the book and see that it is 780 pages; one can see oneself physically turning the pages--slowly, to be sure--while reading it. Perhaps therefore it is not the actual reading of the novel which creates this illusion, it is instead the dreary contemplation of picking it up again after lifting one's head up in the morning, and knowing it to be the meandering, simple-minded, illogical, trite batch of nonsense that it is.The premise is that \\"magic\\" has somehow disappeared from England for the last several hundred years. It is now 1806 and although there are a group of scholarly types who study it, there is nobody around to practice it. Except for Mr. Norrell, who shows up, does so, and to everyone's astonishment. He becomes famous. He is then followed by Jonathan Strange, who becomes his pupil for a while before they have a falling-out. Eventually a lot of strange and dire things occur, and the two must reluctantly combine forces to summon the famous Raven King--who began the practice of English magic in the 12th century--in order to defeat a mean-spirited faerie that Norrell foolishly summoned early on.It's a pretty interesting premise, but the execution of it is almost mind-numbingly dull. To begin with, the characters are very thin, transparent almost, if you will forgive me the indulgent allusion. We are led to believe after about 150 pages that Mr. Norrell is a fussy, selfish and fearful old man. Except that, well, up to then, nothing he does or says makes this apparent. In fact, after his first daring magical trick, he is quite arrogant. The Strange character is another bit of legerdemain. We are told, more than half way through the novel, that despite a plot-wise significant, personal tragedy, \\"he spoke in the same ironic, superficial tone.\\" This was also a bit of a revelation, especially since he never spoke in an ironic, \\"superficial\\" tone to begin with. And what pray tell is a superficial tone anyway?The tale is told in a documentary fashion, as if it were a history, and with helpful notations contained throughout. The notations are usually short fairy tales, placed strategically to illuminate some comment contained in the narrative. For example, Norrell will refer to a spell used in the year 1436 or something, and the notation will give its \\"history\\": Mary Smith, a 14 year old goatherd, after following a stray off the dirt path, saw a bright object which she picked up, and which turned out to be . . . and so on. These little stories are vaguely interesting, but unfortunately, stall what is a frustratingly meandering plot to begin with.Meandering because it is already loaded with meaningless, endless, useless details. Nobody simply meets somebody, they must meet, \\"secretly in a little graveyard upon a hillside not far from Castrejon.\\" There is subplot after subplot with full descriptions of some character and his wife and her wig and their library and the history of their library--only to have them disappear completely several pages later. There is a chapter which begins by telling us how Norrell arranges to have a weekly journal published. There are letters written by the two protagonists. There is an entire chapter devoted to an article Strange wrote in a major publication. There is even a lengthy discussion having to do with Strange working on his book. This would be boring even if it were real. Do we really want or need to know about the fictional history of magic? Okay, yes, there is lots of magic performed. Some is even imaginative, but mostly, not really--Grimm or Aesop this isn't--and only rarely does it advance the plot. Think about it. How, really, does the recitation of some magical trick advance anything once it ends?But that's not the worst of this. What is truly grating is that the events here do not make sense even in the fantastic world of the author's creation. Look, we're willing to suspend our disbelief, but please, construct your world with some boundaries. The Faerie obtains his first victim because of a bargain made with a foolish human magician. His second victim is obtained simply by whisking him away. But the third he must obtain by tricking humanity into thinking she is dead. Which is it? And what is to prevent him from doing this to anyone or everyone?The magicians begin practicing magic--and remember, no men had done so for 200 years--with incredible ease. There are no failures, no experiments, no mistakes. It comes as easy as anything, and it seems there is nothing they can't do. They raise the dead, move mountains and streams, change the weather, create roads in the wilderness. Mr. Strange moves the entire city of Brussells to the American West! This is oh so clever, but dramatic tension is surely sacrificed when the author can snap her fingers and let her characters do just about anything.Admittedly, one's interest picks up towards the end as the two magicians begin their final conflict with the evil faerie, but again, the path is cluttered with irrelevancies, and the denouement is, predictably, contrived.What's ironic is that this, a fiction about magic, isn't really magical at all. True magic occurs when an author creates believable, recognizable characters, makes their situations interesting to us, and perhaps causes a smile of wonder to cross our face on occasion. Regrettably, nothing remotely like that is conjured here."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"[I only left a rating because I was forced to, it refers to the poor quality of the ebook, not the content of the story]I like the book so far as I have read it but I have to point out that the translation to the Kindle was not done well. There are many places where there are multiple words in a row without spaces between them. Less frequently are the first letters missing from words yet often enough that it deserves a mention.This is something I have not experienced in any of the other Kindle books I have read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I love this book, I own it in hard cover and paperback. It is a very big book though and hard to carry around for re-reading, so I purchased it on my Kindle. The translation to the ebook was horrible. Words and names were spaced in the middle of them, capitals when there shouldn't be and not where there should be. Words were missing, letters were missing. The first chapter was hard to read and confusing, even though I've read the book before. I did request a refund from Amazon. I hope they fix this, and if they do I would be more than happy to re-purchase it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book\\"s premise sounded interesting and I read some of the reviews before downloading for my Kindle. I should have read more reviews. The book is VERY LONG, which usually does not deter me. But it is also very slow going (look up slog: a long, tiring walk or march). That's how I felt reading this tome--like I was slogging through every single page. The fictional footnotes were an interesting addition, but I found if I wanted to read it on my iPhone after reading it on my Kindle it would go to those footnote pages as the last page read when I synced my devices. Not a great reading experience, especially since the book was so long--trying to find my place on my iPhone turned into an exercise in futility. I quit reading about a quarter of the way through and went to the end. The last chapters are as slow as the first. Give me Harry Potter any day. But who knows....once I finally retire I may have the time and inclination to read this all the way through. But probably not!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I finished \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" and I'm not sure how I feel about it. On one hand, Clarke creates an impressive world. She uses footnotes to create a history within the story. For me it was one of the most enjoyable parts of the book. The ending for the most of the characters was great. In fact, the conclusion for all the characters aside from Strange and Norrell were creative and interesting.The reason I feel conflicted is that after having read this 800+ page book, I don't know why Strange and Norrell had to be the main characters. Clarke easily could have shorted this book by several hundred pages by simply reducing their stories. In the end large part of their lives such as Strange's work with the army didn't matter to the story. Norrell wasn't particularly interesting and basically disapears during Strange's section. He's mentioned here and there, or maybe a short chapter will focus on him. The way their stories ended was a let down.If this book were 400-500 pages and if it made Strange and Norrell just another set of characters I would definitely recommend it. I would probably read it again. However 800 pages with large sections I was bored with...I will say the gentlemen with the thistle hair character is probably one of my favorite literary characters. He was simply amazing."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Rounding up to 5 stars because this book takes a lot of flak from people who just aren't the right readers for the book.Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is the story of two magicians in early 19th century England.... an alternate England, readers quickly discover, where magic is widely accepted (if no longer practiced) as a part of life. The strengths of this book lie primarily in the character development, the author's excellent recreation of early-19th-century-style prose, and the superbly drawn backdrop and atmosphere behind it all: from fashionable London social gatherings to the bleak northern England landscape where the heart of English magic seems to lie.If the above paragraph doesn't constitute much of a recommendation in your mind--in particular, if you're distressed that I did not say anything about a fast-paced plot or action scenes--then you should not read this book.I was immediately drawn in by the first scene of this book: a rather humorous account of a meeting of the Learned Society of York Magicians, none of whom have ever done any magic; within a couple of pages I understood why Clarke is often compared to Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. The characters come instantly to life, even the ones who aren't very likeable. The relationship between the title characters is the focus of this novel, and it's so complicated and human and believable that I couldn't help but keep reading.The prose is great and does an excellent job of maintaining the sense of immersion in the time period. Most historical fiction authors make no attempt to use period language--nor should they--but Clarke can pull it off and it's brilliant. I love her subtle wit, and the footnotes are excellent. Normally I'm not a big fan of footnotes, but the way Clarke uses them, to give us background information, flesh out side-stories and cite to fictitious works of magic, adds so much to the story.And of course, the alternate-history worldbuilding is excellently done. Clarke does a great job re-imagining how England would be with magic as part of its makeup; quite similar to the real England in many respects, but the deviations are well woven into the setting and learning more about how it all fit together kept me reading. And as I mentioned before, the atmosphere and scene-setting are excellent.I will still voice a few gripes. Some of the secondary characters did not seem quite as well-developed as they could be given the amount of page time they got; I suppose it's their English reserve getting in the way, but I didn't feel that I knew characters like Childermass or Lascelles very well at all. The scenes with Stephen Black--although he's a great character--became repetitive. And especially for a female author, I found Clarke's female characters a bit passive. They have personality, but when a man and a woman wind up in the same unpleasant situation for most of the book, he manages to carry on as normal while she does little but sulk. For a decade. Come on, have some strength of character, please.At any rate, I highly recommend this book, but to a specific subset of the population: only if you're happy to read a long, slow-paced book for the characterization, setting and prose. Read the Amazon excerpt before you buy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is definitely one of my new favorites. It is set in England in the 1800s, but in an England where magic has been prevalent throughout its history, but at present dormant. Enter Gilbert Norrell-a very learned magician who learned his craft from buying up all the available books on magic in the land. He is very content to be the world's only practicing magician. But then Jonathan Strange appears. He is drawn to magic, and then to Mr. Norrell who has become the epicenter of English magic. The two are quite a pair of opposites, but their shared love of learning and magic unite them. They begin to aid England in the Napoleonic wars with their skills and are perceived as England's heroes. But a rather foolish pact That Mr. Norrell made with a Fairy will come back to bite both of them. Despite their differences they will need each other to fix things and fulfill a prophecy to bring English magic back to its former strength.What a great book. Even though it is over 800 pages it was engaging from start to finish. Some parts read like a book right out of Jane Austen's era, but with a twist of magic thrown in for spice. The footnotes that explain references to ancient magical history are also very engaging. This is a wonderful and unique undertaking, and I count Clarke among some of my favorite novelists. I look forward to reading more from this wonderful author.About the Author:Susanna Clarke is a British author. Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is her debut novel, which is a Hugo Award-winning alternate history. Clarke began Jonathan Strange in 1993 and worked on it during her spare time while editing cookbooks for Simon and Schuster. For the next decade, she published short stories from the Strange universe, but it was not until 2003 that Bloomsbury bought her manuscript and began work on its publication. The novel became a bestseller. Two years later, she published a collection of her short stories, The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories (2006). Both Clarke's novel and her short stories are set in a magical England and written in a pastiche of the styles of nineteenth-century writers such as Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. While Strange focuses on the relationship of two men, Jonathan Strange and Gilbert Norrell, the stories in Ladies focus on the power women gain through magic.If you find this interesting, also check out: Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley and A Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin. Both are excellent novels that really paint the entire history of the magical world around the story."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a very unique and entertaining book. It is seven hundred and something pages long, but I never lost interest in it, and I actually didn't want it to end. The author has a dry sense of humor and is very creative and talented.

This one was fantastic.Initially I couldn't tell if I should give credit to the author, Susanna Clarke, or to the narrator, Simon Prebble, and I eventually decided they deserve equal credit. (I did go on to read -in printed book format- Clarke's The Ladies of Grace Adieu, and that was really good as well, so it wasn't just Prebble's reading.)Specifically, here are some highlights of Prebble's reading:1) He reads all the footnotes but manages to make them not disrupt the flow of the story.2) Each character's voice is unique, and he pulls off the women's voices without sounding corny.3) He performs the different accents (London, northern English/Yorkshire etc.)4) The intonations, the inflections, the timing as he reads the sentences are perfect -- he seems to understand and convey Clarke's meaning rather than calling attention to his own acting. Believe me, not all audio book narrators do this.PS To anyone not sure they will like the book because of the subject matter, it's much less similar to Neil Gaiman and more like The Lord of the Rings. I usually enjoy historical fiction, and the sci-fi/fantasy elements in this story did not take themselves overly seriously -- there is a wry self-depreciation throughout that reminded me of A.A. Milne."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I'll keep this brief because many people have said it better than I could. However, I LOVED this book! Some say the beginning was difficult to get through, but I loved it from the first word. It's a brilliant blend of many of my favorite genres, and not only is it astoundingly detailed and well realized, but amazingly original. I know that it is long, but it went by quickly for me because I couldn't put it down, and I've actually read it three times now and it is as fresh and interesting on each read. I'm not saying this book is for everyone, but if you like Jane Austen and fantasy, at least give this a try."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I've sat and wondered for a good time about this very strange novel, and really there is nothing like it that I can reasonably compare it to. Though I admire Ms Rowling, I find the comparison made of her and Ms Clarke slightly disappointing. Harry Potter is imaginative; but \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\" redefines the imagination. In Rowling's books readers are possibly awestruck; in Ms Clarke's novel I cannot help but feel, all at once, horrified, enchanted, outraged and ecstatic. Perhaps the comparison meant merely that, what Potter did for children, Clarke shall do for grown-ups. I find this, too, highly misleading, however.A friend of mine once told me that he found Ms Clarke's book enjoyable but \\"...terribly odd,\\" and then admitted that he only read it because \\"Neil Gaiman spoke so highly of it.\\" The book certainly is very odd, as he said, but I found it (after reading it) better than anything Mr Gaiman has offered the world. Ms Clarke talks about Lewis' \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" as the book that got her interested in the idea of magicians, and, though its inspiration is distinguishable, her magicians, her magic, is something much more remarkable. This novel stretches to the original definition of a novel: i.e., it is both unique and commonplace. This novel, it will be argued by the modern day critic, seems anything but \\"commonplace\\" - but that is the glory and wonder of Ms Clarke. She makes Magic so real that one believes it to be as true as anything else. The statues may speak at York; yet they are most remarkable strictly because they are statues. Fairies may seem unearthly; but it is only because in eight-hundred or so pages, our author proves the Earth so unearthly. The Magic, like all good Magic, merely \\"awakens\\" - it revives what really IS magical in our seemingly humdrum world. We are all under an enchantment; it takes a spell equally strong, a dose of reality equally bombastic, to shake us from our bewitchment, our slumber. Like Mr Honeyfoot, we all are very perturbed about there being no Magic left in the world, and we demand (some in an uproar) why this is the case. Ms Clarke proves that there is such a thing as Magic; for she herself is quite a practical magician, in the only way all true writers prove themselves to be."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"\\"Logic only gives man what he needs...Magic gives him what he wants.\\" ~Tom RobbinsThis book is difficult to rate. At times I loved it, and at other times I just wanted it to end. This book has taken longer for me to read than any other book in recent memory(of course it didnt help that my wife and I watched all four seasons of Lost during my regular reading hours for the first month). I like to try to read approx. 30 books a year and this book is likely to keep me from my goal this year. This urgency may have made me more frustrated with the pace of the book than usual.I was really looking forward to the book originally. I thought the concept sounded pretty intriguing - magic coming back in early 19th century England via Strange and Norrell. I like the way the author writes, she definitely has a way with words; however, I just felt it fell flat. It didn't really hold my attention very well. Just when it started to get good, it would start what I felt was another boring section. It definitely isn't meant to be a fast paced book, which is alright by me; however, it just felt like the plot wasn't going anywhere for the first 2/3rds of the book. I liked the last third of the book for the most part; however, it wasn't enough to make up for the first part. Reviews on Amazon kept me going but I just didn't feel it lived up to my high expectations."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Wow, this is a first attempt by the author...and wow. This book is fantastic. For those who enjoy the slower style, remeniscent of Ann Radcliff and Lord Dunsany, this book is a treat. The plot is complicated and intricate but the length of the book prevents you from getting lost, and surely not bored. In the beginning, Mr. Norrell demonstrates the forgotten art of Practical Magic, and forces all the Theoretical Magicians to give up their occupations. He then decides to single handedly return magic to England. Eventually he meets Mr Strange who has all the natural talent and none of the resources, and Mr Norrell takes him on as a pupil. While these things are happening, a faerie is working his own terrible will against the two magicians. There is a war going on now, and Mr Strange is sent by the English government to assist. As his powers grow, he becomes more obsessed with the foundation of magic, and faerie. If i were to give a more precise summary, it would take several pages, so if you enjoy wonderfully realized characters, white-knuckle excitment, well-researched historical fiction, with a dose of fantasy, please buy this book. The only thing that will dissapoint you is that it isn't longer."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"First, let me say, this book will require patience and quite a bit of time in order to make your way through it. Not that it's not enjoyable, but simply put, it is long.Susanna Clark does a lovely job of using the preexisting mythic character of the Raven King to create a central mythology that the book revolves around.The setting of the book is England around the time of the Napoleonic wars. The difference is that magic actually exists, though it has subsided into something that scholars study, rather than a practicable, practical art. The book begins with the \\"discovery\\" of Mr. Norrell---reclusive, socially inept, secretive, and consequently, the one man in England who is able to apply magic to real life. Later, Jonathan Strange discovers he has a knack for magic, and under the tutelage of Mr. Norrell, rapidly develops his gift, much to the dismay of Norrell, who studied for years to accomplish as much. The book chronicles their rivalry, Jonathan's love and loss, and the final event that seeks to drive a great and ancient evil out of the world.I also listened to the audio version of the book, which is beautifully performed and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Right about the time this novel takes place, the Romantic Era is getting started. At the turn of the 19th century there is a heavy backlash against civilization on many fronts with Rousseau and Novalis as two of the primary generals. JS&Mr.N; takes place right at the birth of this amazing movement, but is written modern, i.e., with the presumption that all humans are petty fools, or evil, petty fools leading sad but mildly laughable yet ultimately meaningless lives. That's the bitter taste of this novel, despite the cute Austen-ish language.I still give it five stars simply because S. Clarke is so skilled with her absurdity and meaninglessness. Just when you thought Western cultural exhaustion couldn't be repackaged any better than it has already been packaged 100,000 times, here comes Clarke to dazzle us once more. That is to say, if you've seen \\"Waiting for Godot,\\" and after half of the play is through it dawns on you that YOU are the fool waiting for Godot, then you'll appreciate Clarke's skill at getting you to turn the some 800 pages of a book that relentlessly denegrates our human race as represented in the quaint retroactive nostalgia of early 19th century Britain. But it's not only the humans that get the full modernist cold shower. JS&Mr.N; also weaves in a very modern, all but dystopian cyber-punkish version of the Northern Euro fairy mythology. Clarke's fairies are all but demons from Hell--the sort Swedenborg described so morbidly and chillingly.I do agree with many of the other readers that this book is not for everyone. Either you buy into frumpy, eccentric English ways, or they put you off. If you're a sucker for the Rule Britannia vibe (as most of the American intelligensia has been since the War of 1812), you'll definitely love this book... But as you can tell from my lines I have a love-hate relationship with JS&Mr.N...;."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Let me say first of all that this is one of the only books I've thoroughly enoyed written in the last sixty years by a female author. If you like whimsical historical fiction with a fantasy twist, than this book is absolutely for you. It chronicles the rise of English magic at the start of the nineteenth century through the eyes of two practicing magicians, two theoretical magicians and a faerie. Hard to put down once you get past the first hundred pages, and sad when it finally ends.Four of five stars."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book made me feel like a kid again. It's like the Scholastic mysteries you used to read after school, only this one is for adults. It recreates the feel of a novel from the 19th century, and has evocative illustrations throughout.The book is the saga of a well-read \\"practical\\" (practicing) magician vs. the speculations of academic magicians (those who study but do not practice). Later, the practicing magician takes on a brilliant but unstable apprentice who goes on to surpass his training, applying instinct and insight to resurrect heroic-age English magic. Along the way, the master magician and his pupil must face the growing menace posed by an ancient fairy who was summoned by one of the master magician's earlier spells.Imagine C.S. Lewis and Ludwig Wittgenstein as magicians...The length may seem a bit daunting to some, but I found this to be a pleasurable fireside read for some cold autumn nights. I will watch for Ms. Clarke's future works."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is a fantastic book. I purchased it many months ago, but I have not finished it as of yet. I find Clarke's writing style most accessible and engaging.

While interesting, after I'm finished reading them, I find that I need to begin the chapter again to stay on track with the story.Simply a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I can't think of any other writer since Dickens who's managed to enter so thoroughly a world like this one, in which in throwaway lines minor characters lose plum jobs in governmental agencies whose purpose everyone long since has forgotten and major characters so laughably are naive, hopeful, and terrible judges of their acquaintances. In this rich, nuanced novel, Ms. Clarke has created a fantasy utterly believable and endearing.If it's a slow read, that's only because each word illuminates another aspect of the gingerbread of this novel; it's slow in the way the very best books are slow.A wonderful book I can't praise nearly highly enough."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"A friend put this book in my hands and said: \\"One of the best books I've ever read. I was sad when it was over.\\" Having been the victim of bad advice, I felt a deep sense of skepticism. That skepticism was misplaced.Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell tells a character-driven story that has been seamlessly intertwined with British history. A desire for a renaissance of magic drives the title characters of the story. Clarke's eye for human foibles, eccentricities, and surprising nobleness help her create a large cast of interesting, complex, and-most importantly-believable characters.Clarke employs a number of creative strategies in this work. The most significant of these is her use of footnotes. Yes, we typically associate footnotes with dusty fragments of information found in a variety of scholarly journals. Clarke, though, uses these well-written pieces to give further insight into the characters and to give deep roots of believability to her novel of the fantastic.Though 800 pages in length, the smooth pacing of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell allows for quick reading. I highly recommend it. Not only did it bring me joy as I read it, but I find that my thoughts keep traveling back to the characters and events of this well crafted tale."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"this was great, starts out slow...but if you want a book you'll forward to coming home to this is it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I'm always hesitant to make a commitment to a fiction book with 782 pages. Indeed, I passed this title over several times due to its length, but when I finally bought it and read it, I could not put it down, often staying up late into the night!Others have summarized the plot, but it has to do with two magicians who want to bring magic back to England after centuries of disuse. Each has a strategy toward accomplishing this, but both ultimately have to come to terms with an early 19th century version of the \\"Law of Unintended Consequences\\". Beside the two title characters, the book is populated by a variety of additional characters who all contribute to the story in their own way.Mr Norrell and Jonathan Strange is an impressive d&eacute;but for Susanna Clarke. She has constructed a unique book by combining elements of British history, 19th Century literary style, and magic. (In this respect, she improves upon the great JRR Tolkien or the slightly less-great CS Lewis, whose worlds were wholly based on fantasy and/or allegory and which are of course written in a more contemporary style.)And let's not even consider comparisons with JK Rowling's works, with their rat-a-tat-tat plots, cutesy characters, and simple-minded moral absolutism (good and evil are very clearly telegraphed and differentiated, with no grey areas inbetween). Having read a number of those books in the past, I can scarcely recall anything that was in them now; I don't think I'll ever say that about MN&JS.; If you are however one of those who considers the Harry Potter series a \`great read' and examples of great literature, then you probably will not enjoy MN&JS.;I note many readers seem put off by the meandering descriptions and slow character development, and the ambiguous and not always honourable motivations of the main characters. Evidently they've read little 19th Century English literature. For me the meanderings and asides were a big part of the charm of this book, as were the period spellings, idioms and turns of phrase. Finally, I found the attention to historical accuracy within the context of the magical world quite appealing - clearly a lot of research went into putting the two together.Reading this book was like taking a long lazy ride on a picturesque river on a beautiful summer day. Sure, you could have got to the end a lot faster by cutting out a lot of the journey, but why would you want to when the trip there is so interesting and enjoyable?"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It seems like a lot of the reviewers foolishly bought this book expecting \\"Harry Potter for adults\\". It's expected that they were sorely disappointed, because that's not the aim of this book at all. Just because a book is about magicians doesn't make it Harry Potter, folks. J.K. Rowling's writing is modern and highly accessible to anybody, whereas this novel was explicitly written in a style to emulate 19th century fiction. The written voice is very much of that period, and if you don't have the reading skill to navigate the laborious but poetic nature of such writing with all its 1800s British nuance, it's likely you will get frustrated trying to read this novel.However, if you have no trouble with this sort of writing, you may well love this book as I did. Clarke imbues this novel with no small amount of subtle, lighthearted wit and irony. The real novelty comes in the way she has crafted such a cohesive narrative out of the unintuitive pairing of 19th century British society (such as one might find in Jane Austen) and magical fantasy. You wouldn't think it would work, but it does.If one were to argue that the book starts off slow, I might find a little room to agree...however, once the book reaches the second act and begins to concentrate on Strange rather than Norrell, that's when it really starts to take off, and by the third act everything begins to come to a head in a dramatic way. So many different subplots are interwoven with one another but it's all tied up very neatly at the end. Although the door is left open at the end for a followup to the story, I think the way it ends is perfect and I'm not sure what a sequel would really contribute.In summary: If you have a taste for more classical literary style and for fantasy, you'll find this book a good read. If you're looking for Jonathan Strange & Mr. Potter, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" has been referred to as \\"Harry Potter for adults.\\" The story is set in England in the early 1800s, where two very different men are trying to revive practical magic. There's bookish Mr. Norrell and the younger, more affable Jonathan Strange: two very different men who have similar goals, but approach them in very distinctive ways.Author Susanna Clarke is a very gifted writer. The style of this book is very unique, and Clarke manages to seamlessly blend elements of fantasy, mythology, and a good old-fashioned comedy of manners into one giant novel. However, \\"giant\\" is the key word here. I'm not one to shy away from lengthy books, but I had a very hard time getting into this one. Although extremely well-written, \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" is also incredibly dense and difficult to get through. The pacing of the novel is ungodly slow, especially during the first two-thirds of the book. Clarke constantly shuffles back and forth between hundreds of characters (many of whom aren't all that significant) and often goes off on random tangents that detract from the main core of the story. The book is also full of numerous false footnotes, which are obviously intended to enhance the story, but I found them to be very annoying.Don't get me wrong here: this is an amazing book, and it's unlike anything I've ever read before. The basic storyline is fascinating, but Clarke failed to hold my attention for long periods of time (until the very end of the book, where the pacing finally picks up a bit). If you are like me and prefer largely plot-driven novels, you'll probably have a tough time with this one. I hear the book is being made into a movie, and this is one of those rare occasions where I'll probably enjoy the film more than the novel. But, to each their own."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Let me state upfront that I am intriged by magic and faerie worlds - the kind found in medieval ballads, legends and folklore - but am no fan of modern fantasy novels.

OK, I confess I find it hard to suspend disbelief & my tastes are literary, but I want to be enchanted!! I crave a good read!! That is why I am so deligthed to have stumbled upon Susanna Clarke.

What we have here is a subtle literary pistache I think - a highly imaginative comedy of manners perhaps, certainly well researched and full of ideas that draw from the deep well of English literary tradition. I loved Susanna Clarke's counterfactual history, her wry humour, marvellous language and wonderful footnotes. I loved the interprentration of the weird otherland realm with mundane reality & the amorality of her very English faerie. JS & Mr struck just the right note for me."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I read this book in January 2005 while it was still cold and snowy and dreary here in Connecticut. Now, I'm a person who doesn't like Winter, but this book had me wanting it to snow forever just like I wished the book would go on forever. I was so transformed to old England, I had to keep tucking my feet under the covers to keep the draught out. I kept expecting the gas lantern to go out and I don't have one. I kept wanting a hot cup of tea.Magic in the book and in the air around when you read this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Magic has been dead in England for hundreds of years--the only magicians who remain being those who study about magic rather than actually performing it. But one man, Mr Norrell, is intent on returning magic to England, defeating the troublesome Napoleon, and proving that magic might serve the country. Norrell insists that the returned magic avoid any connection to fairies, and he takes special care to heap scorn on the reputed father of all magic in England, John Uskglass. Only once does he violate his rules, calling up a fairy to return the dead fiancee of the Prime Minister.Mr Norrell claims to wish magic to return to England, but he goes out of his way to make that difficult. The only way to learn magic is through books, but Norrell has gathered every book he can find and hides them from anyone. He sends his (semi-magical) servant through England exposing fraud. Still, when a second true magician appears, Mr Norrell cannot help his fascination and insists that the newcomer, Jonathan Strange, become his student. Of course, he doesn't go so far as to share his most important books with his student.Strange is initially content with the arrangement, but his experience in the military convinces him that Mr Norrell has taken a wrong path--that English magic is inseparable from John Uskglass. The two magicians quarrel and sever their relationship.In the meantime, the fairy Mr Norrell relied upon to raise the dead fiancee takes an interest in the minister's black servant, and in Strange's wife whom, he eventually kidnaps into his perpetual but grim world of Lost Hope and continual parties celebrating cruelty and death. Strange didn't pay much attention to his wife while she was present, but with her absent and thought dead, he seeks madness.JONATHAN STRANGE & MR NORRELL is a strange, but powerful novel. For much of the book, there really isn't a plot line. Rather, Mr Norrell and Jonathan Strange wander around England and the world discussing magic and working strange magics (Strange occasionally moves cities for the convenience of Wellington's army). Author Susanna Clarke takes the reader off into long digressions with Steven Black, the servant who captivates the fairy, Norrell's servant (who is possibly the most intriguing character in the story), and Mr. Seguntus, an academic magician who did not give up his studies after Norrell broke up the Magician Society of York.STRANGE is a literary work, with not a few parallels to English literature of the 18th century (long digressions, author notes to the reader, an omniscient point of view). Still, Clarke uses these devices rather than being limited by them, keeping the reader captivated.This is a massive work--close to 900 pages in the hardback version--and requires an investment in time to read. But the book definitely provides a high return on this investment. I recommend JONATHAN STRANGE & MR NORRELL highly."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Ok, everyone has their tastes... their favorite medium, their favorite authors, their favorite styles, etc. but the people who gave this book one or two stars should have their own favorites severely scrutinized. I shudder to think of what we would find.This book was absolutely wonderful from start to finish. Loved every minute of it and actually wished it was even longer. I was only disappointed by the fact that I hadn't discovered a new (to me) author with a half dozen other books I could pick up immediately. Ms. Clarke and her J. Strange and Mr. N. just tickled the hell out of me and I NEED to have more from her NOW! PLEASE!?!?!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I missed the hype on this book. I found it in a pile of books my aunt gave to me and it seemed an appropriate read after I finished Peter Carey's \\"Jack Maggs.\\" I didn't even bother reading the synopsis until I had pushed through the first couple of chapters. Like others who had less kind things to say about this book, I found it boring at the beginning and hard to get through.Looking back now, I wonder if anyone realizes that the section about the boring and stodgy Mr. Norrell SHOULD be boring and stodgy? Likewise, I found Jonathan Strange's section more light and humorous, and the last section takes on its character's creepy, mysterious personality.The magical events promised to me in the synopsis spurred me on. I was intrigued to at least push through and see what happened with the girl he raised from the dead. By the time I did make it to Lady Pole's story, I was hooked.Anyone who has read the works of Neil Gaiman will at least feel a tinge of familiarity when the book finally does enter the world of Faerie. The footnotes are just an added bonus. Through them, Ms. Clarke creates an alternate England for us with it's own history in magic and stories of talking mermaid statues and stolen babies.*Personal Opinion Time: Don't compare this book to Harry Potter. Harry Potter is a nice book, but pales shamefully in the light of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. They're really not similar at all.All in all, I have to say that I would be hard pressed to find a book that appeals more to my sense of the fantastic and my need for a solid story. I was amazed and astounded by this book. I will definately be reading it again and again."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I received this book last November for my birthday and just now got around to reading it. I don't have much of an attention span and haven't read many books lately, just magazines. When I read the first chapter or so I thought it was going to be the hardest thing in the world to finish. Then I found myself dreading getting to the end. Every word, even the footnotes, leads to something even more fantastic than the last. It's funny and mystical and almost makes you feel you're in gray, cold, misty, scary olde England. And I'm in dusty, hot July Oklahoma with my air conditioner broken. (I wish I'd read it in winter on a windy day beside a fire.)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Others have detailed the texture of this book by outlining its density and forewarning of its length. They are correct. This book is the literary equivalent of an Amish quilt. It is heavy, warm and cozy with small sparkling tales that serve as the patchwork for the whole. This is the most lovely book I've had the pleasure to read for many years. It is wholly dissimilar in style and substance to Harper Lee's _To Kill A Mockingbird_, but stands in my mind as its equal in terms of great literature."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"\\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" is, quite simply, one of the most breathtaking works of imagination I have ever had the pleasure to read. Not only does Susanna Clarke successfully create a sense of place in her novel, she creates a sense of place that is real and unreal, subject to wonder and enchantment, humor and terror. The characterizations in the book are fantastic; the wit is pervasive. The footnotes to events reinforce the depth of the story, weaving a mythology throughout the novel. The last third of the novel turns dark, very dark indeed, and I found that soon I was possessed by a sense of dread as events unfolded.For all of the length of \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell,\\" I felt that the novel ended too soon: such is the world that Susanna Clarke created. Magic, with its natural roots and stones and wind and water and flame and fire, seems so probable here. And so elemental. And so English!I cannot recommend this novel highly enough."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell are the only practicing magicians left in nineteenth century England, a country that was once filled with magic. But when Mr. Norrell weakens in the presence of the huge temptation to do something unsafe in order to further his reputation as a great magician, he unleashes an evil fairy. This exposes England to a multitude of magical problems that Norrell and Strange must endeavor to rectify.Upon reading this novel, the reader enters a very real and delightful world of magic and fantasy. Susanna Clarke expertly makes the fantastic seem very real. And her tome is written in a wordy Victorian style that reminds me of the styles of Hawthorne and Poe, making it even more delightful and classic and authentically nineteenth century story-telling. The hardcover edition even contains old-style sketches that make it more unique and enjoyable. The superfluous footnotes even reflect this time period, however some may find them overwhelming and tedious. Sadly, many people may not enjoy these classic details as much as I, and will, undoubtedly, find themselves growing bored because of these things. But in spite of all these Victorian flourishes, this has all the characteristics of a great novel: well-defined characters who demand our compassion, picturesque settings, and loads of excitement. I found this novel to be unique and interesting and tremendously fun!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"There are many better reviews above, but I feel compelled to say something in thanks to the author.What an oddly compelling book. I'm struggling to classify it, which was perhaps the aim of the author. It reads something like a Jane Austen and Neil Gaiman collaborative rewrite of Midsummer Night's Dream set during the Napoleonic Wars, but with more (theoretical) magicians. Nope, that's still not it.It starts as a rather curiously written (with footnotes!) tale about theoretical magicians in York. My initial attraction to the book was just how much fun it was to read the prose (and the footnotes). By the time I had finished, I felt like applauding the author for not only writing an epic (historical) fantasy, but managing to do so in such an original manner.I heartily recommend it to anyone who likes Austen and Gaiman, or historical fantasy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is now one of my favorite books of all time but let me preface that with saying that I didn't even think I'd finish it while I was trudging through the first 400 -- yes 400! -- pages. Not that they were so bad. They were witty and eloquent in that long-winded British kind of way. But where was this story going? Character after character was introduced until I could scarcely keep track of why Stephen Black the butler and this \\"man with thistle down hair\\" and Jonathan Segundus and many others were even in the book at all. \\"Just get on with Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell already,\\" I began saying to my book.And then something happened. Somewhere around P. 400 -- yes 400 -- these random characters that had been methodically built up independently suddenly began to collide in a way that made me realize Clarke herself is a magician as mighty as the ones she writes about. How delightful to watch a puzzle that you have been dumbfounded by come together piece by piece. I read the second 400 pages in two days and was sad to see the book end.

Too bad the Kindle edition doesn't live up to the paper version."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a surprising hybrid of two genres: the historical fiction novel & the magical fantasy. Susanna Clarke, the first time author of the book, hits on a winning combination with this story, as her sales and reviews already testify. Because the two component genres contain some of my favorite stories (Aubrey/Maturin, Captain Alatriste & Harry Potter, LOTR), I quickly ordered it and moved it to the top of my reading list. This is what I thought:The novel is long and contains many meandering side-stories that are loosely related to the main issue: the friendship of England's first magicians in many years, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, as well as the tests to that friendship that threaten to destroy it. So when you begin reading, do not expect a straightforward and traditional storyline- this is not Harry Potter, and it is not Jack Aubrey & Stephen Maturin. You will find a variety of interesting and entertaining anecdotes and tales that all serve to flesh out the quasi-historical world of England during the Napoleonic Wars. To top this off, the book is flush with footnotes, a great many of which actually distract from what you reading, but provide meaningful background to the story and its characters. Once I had completed the story, I almost felt that the book itself read like its many footnotes: interesting, funny, and not completely pertinent; but good nonetheless.When you read Clarke's story, you will be introduced to a world very similar to our own, where magic, once common place, is the stuff of legend. In to this Mr. Norrell is thrust, a be speckled and ill-tempered old scholar who has deliberately and meticulously acquired nearly every book \`of' magic and \`about' magic in the Kingdom. Mr. Norrell, who at times seems to prefer the study of magic to its actual practice, decides that he is the man to bring magic back to England in the service of the crown, in order to defeat Napoleon. This glorious re-introduction leads to Mr. Norrell finding an apt pupil the one Jonathan Strange, and soon the two of them are changing the face of Europe (quite literally in some cases) with their skills. Unfortunately a wide variety of circumstances, events and characters (including a capricious fairy) threatens to tear apart their association, and perhaps all of English magic.All in all, a good read, but a long one; you'll want to see what happens next. . ."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"We started the audiobook on a long trip. I was immediately hooked. My wife, however, immediately went to sleep and asked me how I could listen to something so dull. Later on, even she perked up at several parts. As I listened to the rest on long commutes, she asked me for plot updates every day, though she never had the energy to finish it for herself.Simon Prebble is an amazing reader, and his interpretation is equal parts fairy tale wonder, Masterpiece Theatre, and very dry college professor (reminded me of classic John Cleese). Characters were real, clear and precise. Although many have said reading the footnotes was a chore, he integrated these amazingly well and they added just the right accent to the story, without being overly distracting. There is plenty of humor mixed in the dry places, and I think I would have missed this if reading, rather than listening.I have never read (or listened to) anything like it. The academic, historical style certainly isn't for everybody, and I can see how some pure fantasy, pure history, or pure fairy tale fans might object, because it doesn't really fit into any category very neatly, so it's hard to know what to expect when you first start it. I think this is also reason for the polarity in the reviews. If you read John Grisham, or Harry Potter, you know what you're going to get. With this one, it's a mystery until you try it.So, I thought it was well worth a listen. In the interest of equal time, maybe I can talk my wife into writing a rebuttal."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING BOOK. But it is really hard to get into. It took me about 200 pages to just get interested, and at that point I was more determined to finish than actually WANTED to finish....until I got to about page 300. The first 300 weren't horrible, but it was slightly drawn out, and i reluctantly say boring b/c it doesnt accurately represent the rest of the book. If you are willing to put in the time you WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. I could not put this book down, and was extremely satisfied when I had finished."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is a fantasy novel about two magicians (and a nasty thistle-downed-haired fairy) written in the form of a true historical novel, complete with footnotes to clarify the text and/or \\"refer\\" the reader to other sources. It is, if it is your taste, a wonderfully droll and imaginative book. I say, if it meets your taste because a complaint could be made that, when those moments of magic-making appear in the \\"history\\" they too are done with the writer's option of simply stating an historical fact. Some readers might like the writing at these points to \\"soar\\" a bit more than it does with wonder and imagery as the writing would surely do in other more traditional types of fantasy. For instance, when J. Strange brings some corpses to life (to question them) the scene is (to make a pun) almost lifeless, as it would be in a true historical novel. Still that complaint aside, the book is thoroughly readable, very entertaining, and the many pages go by rather swiftly. Oh, one more thing, the type font on the paperback is small and it might be wiser for some to avoid the mass market paperback and obtain another version."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book has a mixture of alternate history, fantasy, romance, and action all rolled into one book. The characters are well developed, and the author has done a wonderful job recreating the battle against Napolean using magic as the main source of defense. I highly recommend this creative & very original novel...it is unlike anything I have read before."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is, without question, a wonderful book. However, I would not reccomend it to you if you are impatient, easily bored/distracted, or looking for an exciting adventure novel. Speaking bluntly, the first 200 pages are really, really boring. I opened the book expecting something like a more sophisticated, 19th century version of Harry Potter, and instead got treated to the tale of a stuffy old magician (who, at the beginning of the story, hardly does any magic at all) trying to make peace with London society.But if your attention span can handle the novel's plodding beginnings, you will be greatly rewarded. This story just keeps getting better and better as it goes along; the plot thickens, new conflicts and characters emerge, and by the last 100 pages, I found that I couldn't put the book down. The author gives us a tantalizing and wholly realistic glimpse into a place that is both a world of historical past and a world of complete fantasy. It left me wanting more, as any good novel should. Overall, I reccomend this book highly to anyone who wants to read it. Believe me, it's well worth reading it in the end."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"With one piece of work there is a new \\"heavy hitter\\" upon the sci fi/fantasy scene; and Susanna Clarke is her name. After reading Mievelle's Iron Council, I was skeptical that Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell would be deserving of the Hugo Award it had in August of 2005. Needless to say after having finished JS&Mr.N; my always wavering faith in the Hugo Award voters has been restored. JS&Mr.N; is a gripping and entertaining novel with many obvious influences as well as many brilliant original ideas.There are many aspects of this book I particularly enjoyed. Clarke has the exceptional ability to interweave horrific imagery amongst the mundane without creating a sense of \\"hokiness\\". Her world is entirely real and the use of historic events and people was an excellent choice. She really captures the essence of early 19th century Europe which makes the infusion of her stylized magic that much more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed the range and depth of her magical universe. The magic is everything from grandiose (transplanting of cities to other places) to horrific (the re-animating corpses) and everything in between. Its forms are complex and there is an immense history to it (Clarke provides footnotes to many magical references to help build and inform). It's all expertly cultivated and it grows on you through out the novel.Clarke's characterization is another strength of the novel. Strange, Norrell and some of the secondary characters are very human in their flaws and decisions. I commend Clarke for not drawing a straight line between right and wrong. Allegiances will change throughout the book and I found myself liking many of the characters although not always rooting for them.Clarke draws from many of the classic Victorian novels written around the time this story unfolds. She perfectly recreates that hilarious English wit and pompousness. Much of the dialogue reminded me of the witty English banter exchanges between Watson and Holmes in Doyle's classics. The haughtiness of certain characters intermingled with Clarke's sense of absurdity is hard to describe but I laughed out loud more times than I can remember.This book is not without flaws and at times Clark's rawness shows through. The book tends to wander to subplots and anecdotes that might not be necessary. The paperback edition weighs in at 844 pages and it might have benefited from some tighter editing. One example of this is multi page history of a servant character that is rarely mentioned again. Albeit somewhat entertaining, this excerpt is one of a few that should have been cut to add some brevity. Another example is most of the exposition involving the Greysteels which was entirely unnecessary and came way too late. The characters hardly served any purpose and were altogether uninteresting. The plotting is slow and enduring as the characters and mythology is what drives the first half of this book. I actually considered this an asset but others might be bored by the seemingly endless exposition. The first third of the book slowly and subtly introduces us to magic and to the relationship between the title characters. If you are looking for frantic page turning plotting a la The Da Vinci Code, then perhaps this is not your cup of tea.In the end these are minor complaints in light of what a major accomplishment this book is. Many are calling JS&Mr.N; the \\"adult Harry Potter\\". I actually agree with this statement for various reasons. The subject matter has obvious similarities with a complex historical background. There could definitely (and hopefully) be numerous sequels. The book is extremely addicting and I tore right through it in about 10 days. And finally I think it has appeal to both adults and youngsters. While not as simplistic or dominated by child characters as Harry Potter, I see no reason why this book couldn't be absorbed by junior high age kids and up. There are some horrifying images but this book is entirely appropriate for anyone old enough to get through it. There is absolutely no sex, drugs, or swearing of any kind. There is some mild violence but honestly this book could be marketed and edited in a way to make is fall under the same \\"juvenile fiction\\" that Harry Potter is officially categorized as. I would recommend this book to any reader of any age that likes the Harry Potter series or isn't intimidated by the book's size.Bottom Line: Clarke won the coveted Hugo in her first attempt. A feat certainly not accomplished in the last 25 years if ever. I eagerly await her next offering....."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I really respect the uniqueness of this book. You can compare it to Harry Potter or War and Peace or probably a lot of other things, but really Clarke has her own style and wit. She's not afraid to show it, even though some of her choices aren't obviously the right ones. Norrell, for example, is a difficult character to pull off. He's often annoying, petty, unkind and self-centered. And yet he's not just those things. He also reveals himself in surprisingly positive ways at times. So to some extent it's hard to know if you like him or not. But it's not hard to know that as a reader you're enjoying experiencing his story, and maybe staying curious as to how he'll react to things. Johnathan Strange is a bit easier to get along with, but he still provides many unique moments. For example, when he resurrects the Portuguese war prisoners so he can interrogate them, but then afterwards finds he doesn't know how to send them back to death. The images of the dead pestering him in the particular way they do is funny and clever. Feels a little like Latin Magic-realism, but it's got Clarke's own flavor to it.The fusion of history and fantasy is very well done, and some of the images of magic are startling and memorable. The fleets of boats made out of water, for example, are so vividly beautiful to imagine. I'm glad the author put the image in my head.I don't agree with some readers who've said that \\"every sentence is important\\" and \\"not a word should be missed\\", etc. This is a long book, a sort of kitchen sink of a book with its footnotes and polite, gentile conversation. There are a lot of things that could be cut and pruned out of this. What's wonderful about it (as is the case with Neal Stephensons novels) is that you just don't mind. Clarke is a talented writer who I was happy to spend time with, who somehow has storytelling gifts that make me willing to move at a gradual pace. It's a great book to come home to day after day. In this world of short attention spans and commercials screaming for attention... Well, a novel like this is a quiet joy. I hope to find more like it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The plot of _Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell_ has already been summarized, so I won't outline it again.I have read quite a lot of 18th- and early 19th-century literature--and history. I was struck by how well Ms. Clarke reproduces the period's literary style. And by how well she understands its social culture and the personalities that culture developed. There's real depth here--she's not just throwing in a few period spellings for faux atmosphere. And then she adds the twist of a truly otherworldly magic.The book completely engrossed me all the way through. I think that some people who complained about the length don't understand the tradition Clarke is working in, which is that of the 18th-century picaresque novel. Such novels are long. They are driven by the different adventures the characters have, not solely by one plot whose end goal must be reached as efficiently as possible. That's a modern concept, and it's not poor writing to adhere to an earlier literary model. Clarke's footnotes are short stories in themselves and perfectly delightful.I've heard another volume is on the way. I hope it's just as long--but I also hope Clarke writes it faster than the first novel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is my first review to give on any book I have ever read. I have read many books along this subject line of magic; from Harry Potter, Lord of The Rings, The Shannara Series, yet it would be wrong to compare jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell to any of these. All of theses books have thier own merrit. In JS though, it has a Charles Dickens feel to it, while still being readable. The magic that is performed is not too over the top, yet has just enough fantasy to make the magic different from other books of magic. The good thing about the use of magic in this book is that it is not overly used, which I find to be a good thing.The way Clarke is able to include a history of magic with English history is quite amazing. All places and events, and even some of the characters are taken straight from history. What makes this good is that there are really no alterations of Enghish hisotry in Clarkes' version. To see how the maddness of King George was attributed, to the battle of Waterloo. All of these events have just enough historical fact to make you beleive that magic did in fact exist in England.One of the most important points that I wish to make about this book is the character development. Some books (but not the ones I mentioned above) have little in regards to character development. Yet Clarke spends time with each character, unitl each character becomes real. I will not give anything away, but there will be a time when you will hate some of the characters, but then go back to liking them again.On a final note I must implore you to stick with the book. Some parts of the book do seem to drag on, and you might not want to finish reading. Some reviewers have stated that they finished reading after 200 pages. Just read it. If you spent the money on the book, or at least taking the time to read it, you owe it yourself to finish the book. You will not be disapointed. I will not go as far to say this is now my favorite book, but I have no problem of including it with the Harry Potters, Lord of the Rings, or the Shannara's."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It's my belief that many people picked this book up hoping for a page-turner in the vein of the Potter stories. But that's just not what Clarke has in mind.The tone of it is very proper, filled with affectations of language that are not just there to further the plot. It's a stylistic choice that fits with the vision we have (accurate or not) of how people spoke and wrote in pre-Renaissance salons of higher-class England. This demands a little patience from the reader, sure, but the reward is the opportunity to indulge in delectable sentences and lovely desciptive prose.Unlike the Potter books, Strange isn't written for adolescents. This is almost like Tolkien (though nowhere near as ponderous), with an author inventing a deeper world, a pseudo-history if you will, complete with footnotes.Like Tolkien, the rich imagination of the thing is its most compelling virtue, and the ultimate reward for a slower-paced story. Once the book grabs you, it becomes quite easy to believe you're not reading fiction at all, but a factual account of real events long since passed. The tone of the writing contributes to that; since there's nothing \\"modern\\" about the phrasing and the pacing, it serves to immerse you that much deeper in the world of the story.At any rate, if you're open-minded about it, this book should appeal to fans of Dickens just as greatly as it should fascinate fans of Alan Moore or hell...even J.K. Rowling."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I loved this book and highly recommend it, but don't have much to add to the other positive reviews. I just thought I would jump on here to recommend that if you're a Kindle user, skip the ebook and go old-fashioned paper on this one. The extensive footnotes are a royal pain to navigate on the Kindle; they are all at the end of the book, and you have to bookmark and search your way around every time you want to read one, which is often (several times per chapter). It was so frustrating and cumbersome to read the footnotes on the Kindle that it really detracted from the otherwise great pleasure of reading this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is not a criticism of the story, which I enjoyed. This is an admonishment to Amazon on their pathetically poor effort at transferring this book to the Kindle format. Transfer errors are so common that hardly a page does not go by in which you as the reader are not yanked out of the flow of the story as you try to worry out what the original text was. It is as if someone was paid to cut the pages from the book, scan them into a computer, remove all of the white-space, and leave the computer to its best efforts to guess at the original words. Well fine if that is the only way to establish an electronic copy of the book, but I can think of no good reason why they did not employ a proofreader to correct the very numerous and obvious mistakes.Shame on you Amazon. This is NOT the quality of product that I was expecting when I purchased my Kindle."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Many books are to be read, some are to be studied, and a few are meant to be lived in for weeks. Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is of this last kind...Magnificent and original.\\"-- Washington PostAnd that is what I did - lived in it for a few weeks. I am usually a fast reader, especially when it comes to fantasy, but this book was meant to be lived in for a time. It is not a typical modern fantasy novel, but is as literary as it is fantastical. It draws of the influence of the Romantics like Austen as much as it does classic fantasy writers like McDonald and Tolkien. It is a book full of side stories, minor characters, a fantastic magical literary history told through footnotes, and a plot that builds slowly but deliberately upon itself.Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is an epic tale of the re-birth of magic in nineteenth-century England. Amidst familiar elements of setting (such as the Napoleonic wars) one is presented with a world where magic actually worked. Or did until the habit became to study about magic rather than to actually do magic. Two magicians - very different in character- who, as teacher and pupil and then as rivals, attempt to bring practical magic back to England. A rambling exploration of their attempts and the consequences thereof comprise the extent of the book.The magic in play is not some disneyfied nursery appropriate version, but this is a fairy-tale that remembers that fairies are dangerous and magic holds its own perils. It is the divergent responses of the two magicians to the unveiling of the danger that most intrigued me. Norrell chose to hide it - to suppress any mention of Fairy so as to protect the common people by letting any recollection of Fairy just fade away. He essentially bans books, forcefully prevents the publication of information he disagrees with, lies about the power of Fairy, and ridicules those who believe in it. By controlling knowledge he hopes to protect the people from the danger - and retain all magical power for himself. Strange wants to embrace knowledge and crosses the lines of sanity in his quest to do so. He pays dearly for his knowledge, but still chooses to discover what he can so as to be equipped for his job. He wants magic to be in the hands of the people - accessible to all - allowing all people the power to protect themselves.I kept having this book recommended to me as something that a person involved in religion would find interesting. The parallels between the debates in the world of magic and those of the church are interesting. Besides the amusing critique of those who merely talk about and study magic/religion and don't actually practice it, I found the whole idea of the control of knowledge relevant. People in power can often control ideas. Even with the advent of widespread communication, it is those with the most money and therefore audience who hold the power. What then becomes most important - truth or power? Will they twist the facts or lie in order to serve a greater good? In the church, will ideas and knowledge be suppressed if they get people asking the wrong sorts of questions? Is it more important to keep people ignorant within the safe confines of a particular doctrine than it is to earnestly seek truth? I've seen Norrell's power plays in the church as knowledge and the right to ask questions is suppressed. I find myself as more of a Strangeite who will pursue ideas no matter where they lead, no matter what it might cost. And I support that for all people. To blindly trust in a voice just because it has authority/power seems wrong because I don't know how I might be being manipulated. I want to be a truth seeker.Many reviewers commented on the near absence of the church in this book. I found it refreshing to not have to read another book lamenting how the church persecuted magic, but I think the symbol or idea of the church existed in her structure of magic. The magic here seems to contain the debates, structures, and realms of religion, philosophy, and academia combined. It is an alternate world that speaks to the issues in our own. Its questions can be our questions if we care to scratch the surface of the story."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It took me a few pages to get into the story, as the author takes you gingerly into the reality she has created for the readers, which is so close to mundane that you suspect that the story is just a mundane story about magic, until a few chapters later you find yourself burning the midnight oil. She describes the characters to sound, once again, quite normal, and a few words down the line you realize that the same characters are no more mundane than when a military general confides in you that the government is poisoning body fluids through tap water or some such quiet madness. She is witty, humorous, and makes imagination beautiful."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I didn't expect to like this book. I picked it up purely because I had nothing to read, and it was long enough to last me a couple of days. Boy was I surprised. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell was an unexpected delight for me to read.Imagine if Jane Austen wrote about fairies and magicians and you've got the tone down. Now take everything you know about England and throw it out the window.England in Jonathan Strange...ect. has been re-vamped in a much different place from the one we know. The time is around the turn of the 19th century, and the past of the country is greatly wound up with the Raven King, a man who rules northern England for hundreds of years, and has now disappeared. Magic is pretty much gone from the land. Magicians are gentlemen who talk about magic (actually practicing it would be beneath them.) But then, to everyone's great surprise, emerges Mr. Norrell, a magician who can actually do magic. He takes society by storm when he brings a young woman back from the dead (thanks to an unknown, very bad barging with a fairy), and becomes one of the main reasons the British navy hasn't been overrun by Napoleon.Then, Jonathan Strange shows up. Another gentleman, who also practices real magic, he becomes the pupil of Mr. Norrell. Magic is disputed and two great magical minds fight against a background of evil fairies, great kings, and the spirit of magic in England.This book is not for those who need action every minute. It's more charming than anything, and the plot is slow but steady. I found myself enthralled by about page 300, even though the real action of the book doesn't take place until much later. But this book is a real old fashioned story teller's story. It's a story for those people who want to guess ahead of time the answers to the mysteries, and be surprised when the real answer is something even weirder then even they guessed. It's a story for readers of long books, and most of all for people with patience. If you can love the writing of this book, even though the story can sometimes be slow, I promise you'll miss it when you finish it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to most people out there. Despite being a large book (about 800 pages) it is not esoteric and is completely readable (ignoring the time commitment required). The book is very clever and humourous, it integrates real history into a fantastical new history. Suprisingly enough the book is also realistic, not in the subject matter, but in its treatment of characters. It is hard to doubt existence of a Mr.Norrell who hoards all the magic and books that he finds in an attempt to restrict the magic available to any Englishman's hands.The book is about two magicians who manage to bring magic back to England after a 200 year absence. There is Mr.Norrell a cranky old man who wants to be the only magician in England and Jonathan Strange, the younger more likable magician who manages to convince Mr.Norrell to take him on as a pupil. The book deals with a misguided fairy, a nameless black servant, and several charming women who unfortunatly catch the attention of a certain magical being. Jonathan Strange and Mr.Norrell progress through their learning of magic and provide their magical services to England.The only reason that I didn't rate this book as five stars is that as I was reading I was dissappointed to find that the cleverness and humor (the most enjoyable aspects) died off in the last quarter of the book. They were replaced with quite a bit of well written suspense. In all its a very good book, extremely well written, and definatly worth the time that it takes to read its 800 pages."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I really enjoy reading so the length of this book didnt really concern me. However, I can imagine it would for some. Also, I enjoy English/British humor and storytelling and this is chock-full of references to all things British and jokes aplenty. Ms. Clarke has a winner with this wonderful book, I was engrossed from the first page! Her writing style had me biting my nails in suspence while her dry wit had me laughing. This was a very good investment of my time.I was initially worried because a friend had tried reading this and quit after 200 pages, which from other reviews seems to be the case with many. However, she enjoys fast action and drama of John Grisham novels, which this is not. This is a slow burner, I believe it's meant to be savored, not gulped. Give this book some time. Don't try to read it all in a week."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The book is long but that isn't the problem; the problem is that it feels long. I have to confess i gave up after about 100 pages, but that shouldn't be an objection to a review - after all, does anybody blame you if you stop eating an unappetizing meal?The book: fake Victorian style - appealing at first ('finely wrought', a certain elegance of style) but then tiresome. PS - if I want Victorian style, I'll read one of the Victorians. After all, they lived it, and that shows.The plot - some kind of alternate history of England including magic. It took so long to get off the ground that it drove me slightly batty. I would've given up earlier if not for the desire to finish what I started.In short, I think the lavish praise for this book is just the punditocracy (the journalistic and literary establishment) reacting to the frills of style and the appearance of sophistication."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"No one has mentioned! the major flaw! in the book so here goes! Every freekin character! speaks in breathless! rushes so that I can\`t concentrate on anything! other than the next exclaimation!

Great reviews, I\`ll give you that, but just so you\`re warned Ms. Clarke\`s writing is dour and relentless!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Strange is an alternate history novel set in 19th-century England around the time of the Napoleonic Wars. It has a fascinating premise: that magic once existed in England and has returned with two men: Gilbert Norrell and Jonathan Strange. The novel explores the nature of \\"Englishness\\" and the boundary between reason and madness. It has been alternately described as a fantasy novel, and a historical novel.Clarke spent more than ten years writing the novel which draws on various English Romantic literary traditions, part Jane Austen, part Charles Dickens, part Gothic. And she infuses the entire narrative with a very droll, English dry wit which as page 100 becomes page 200, then 300, the 400, then 500 ... tends to wear out its welcome.I REALLY wanted to like this book, but found myself dreading to keep reading. NOTHING HAPPENS! The first 300 pages of the novel could have easily been discarded since those pages did absolutely nothing to advance the plot. The story doesn't just dawdle, it creaks like a stone statue with rheumatism. And Rule #1 is: Be entertaining.The fact that the book has been almost universally lauded says more about those reviewers bias than the quality of this book. Group think is not always a good thing. Some reviewers rhapsodize about the rich language and clever literary homages, while others call it daring and imaginative. They forgot to mention it was BORING!Not Recommended, unless you're one of the university-centric snobs who worship at the altar of 19th century English fiction, still buying into the canard that it is infinitely superior than modern fiction."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is the magical creation of Susanna Clarke. It is the story of the return of magic to England some 200 years ago. It takes place in a time when magic was no longer practiced in England, but still studied by many. Mr. Norrell, a practical magician, decides that he shall return magic to England, but has no idea how out of control a little magic can get when he takes on a task that proves to be bigger than him.Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is by no means a page turner, at least not until the last 200 or so pages. The Washington Post describes it by saying that \\"Many books are to be read, some are to be studied, and a few are meant to be lived in for weeks.\\" This is one that applies to all of the above categories. However, what keeps the reader reading is a interesting, constantly evolving story line and a sense of magic in Susanna Clarke's words. Her writing is exquisite and is captivating in itself.As I first started this book, I was a little disappointed. I thought that the story was too slow and that it wasn't driving enough. The book is broken up into three parts. The first two parts of the book are spent setting up the tale, introducing us to the many delightful if not woeful characters, and setting a magical tone. When part three of the book kicks in, it turns into a page turner. When I got to part three, I appreciated the time she took in parts one and two setting the tale up. In part three of this book, you can literally feel the magic coming off of the pages. It's wonderful!As you read the pages of this book, you feel like you are in fact reading history. The book is complete with very informative footnotes, and I found myself often forgetting that this was a work of fiction. She even incorporates Lord Byron into the book, a wonderful surprise. While he doesn't play a main character, he shows how capable Clarke is of spinning a convincing tale.This book is like reading a cross between Jane Austen and Neil Gaiman. Certainly a book of fantasy, yet so realistic at the same time...an oxymoron if you will, and I mean that in the best way possible. Susanna Clarke won the Hugo award for this novel in 2005 and I can think of no one more deserving. Quite impressive for her first novel. Truly a fascinating read. I can't wait to start digging into my signed, first edition copy of The Ladies of Grace Aldieu, Clarke's second publication, a collection of short stories that is beautifully illustrated."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It took me a very long time to read this book. I would've stopped reading it a while ago, but I wanted to see what all the hype was. Is it this chapter? No. Maybe it will be in the next one. Nope. The last 1/8 of the book held some dramatic tension I guess, but when Strange and Norrell meet again, they become friends. No magic fight. No human fight. No argument. 750 pages of building of the differences in views and opinions of these two magicians and at the end when you think there will be some kind of resolution to all of the long, long, long build up there is nothing. I felt drained after finishing this book, wishing I had never started it. So if you're looking for a very heavy paperweight, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Magick is a topic close to my heart and several of my friends and I discussed this book. It still gets mentioned often. To do magick or to study it as an arcance topic - that's the question here. I adore great big fat books. I like to live in their worlds for awhile. And I will put this book up with the best being currently written. As good as \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy; and maybe a bit better. Please Susanna Clarke write more and write fast. I'm a geezer and don't want to miss out on your vision."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Strange & Norrell is a compulsive read, and there are many fine things about it - notably the incredibly extensive back-history which Clarke creates (mostly through footnotes) to describe the history of magic in England. It is also an often funny book - i.e. when Strange tells his wife and brother-in-law that he has decided to become a magician because he met a man under a hedge who told him that he should.BUT - the book eventually disappointed me. There is not really any plot in the book. The crumbs of a plot are there, and the potential for a powerful and climatic battle between Strange & Norrell vs. an evil faerie is present, and is much anticipated, but this battle never happens, nor does any real climax occur. A climax is kind of side-stepped and though \\"good\\" more or less wins, this does not happen in a very satisfying way.Would I recommend the book? Yes, I would, if you're willing to be lost in a highly intriguing historical / fantasy novel for a few weeks, and don't anticipate being bothered by the lack of a plot or a climax."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is a wonderful, wonderful novel. It is written in an older tone, and probably isn't for everyone, but this streaks above anything published recently in the genre. Closer to the Gormenghast Series than Tolkien, and even better than Peake's masterpiece in my opinion (more likeable characters for a start).A must buy, though I advise reading a couple of pages first to see if you like the older writing style (in Australia it isn't wrapped in plastic)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"My 12-year old son and I are reading this book together. We read a few chapters every night. He is a sophisticated reader, with a wide palette, having recently finished all of the Hitchhiker's Guide novels as well as Memoirs of a Geisha. We are thoroughly enjoying this novel. We discuss the nuances of the characters, speculate as to what various clues and foreshadowing could mean, and absolutely marvel at the breadth of Ms. Clarke's imagination. We read every word of every footnote and chuckle at the witty, dry humor. He is picking up a lot of European history as well. Since we are both of mixed race West Indian heritage, the subplot of the former slave Stephen King has been of particular interest. My son has never had the opportunity to read anything regarding the status of non-whites in largely white historical writing that exists today. A recent episode of \\"Regency House Party\\" on PBS (set in the same time period as \\"Strange & Norrell\\") also addressed this same subject. This was a show my son would never have otherwise been caught dead watching, but his interest was sparked due to the connection to the book. Kudos to Ms. Clarke, she could hardly have written a better book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I was looking forward to this book, but after reading it, I don't get what all the fuss is over it - it's okay. While Clarke does an admirable job of writing in an archaic style (she's very good at it, don't get me wrong), it gets old. The book was fine - it wasn't bad, but it wasn't all that great either. Wait for it to come out on paperback."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Don't listen to anyone that tells you this book is \\"too long\\". It's a marvel. A marvel. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell are two characters that will stamp themselves upon your memory permanently, and the world that Susanna Clarke creates is unrivaled in any fantastic fiction of the last fifty years. She spent ten years writing this book and it shows, from the meticulous footnotes to the vibrancy of every supporting character. If you haven't met Vinculus, or Stephen Black, or the merrily terrifying Gentleman with the Thistle-down hair, you are missing out. No one has thought up anyone like the Raven King, and no one has ever so successfully melded history and historical fiction with fantasy.Like I said, a marvel. Ignore every bad review you see here. That this book could be rated a mere three and a half stars and other books filled with hackneyed drivel rated higher, is only a testament to how eager most readers are for digestible pablum. This is not digestible pablum. It is a five-star meal. EAT!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I loved this book.I love a lot of books. I wouldn't give all of them five stars.Now, the reason I gave Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke five stars anyway is that it managed to take everything I normally wouldn't touch with a barge pole, and made it into a damn good story.To those of you who don't know me, here are some fun facts about me. I:1) Hate long books (no attention span anyone?)2) Hate tedious descriptions (never finished LOTR)3) Was bored even by the film versions of all things Jane Austen4) Can't think of anything I find less interesting than history.This book:1) is 1040 pages long, an amount about three times bigger than my usual pain threshold.2) is filled up with so many descriptions and explanations, they had to put some of it into footnotes. The footnotes probably comprise a larger word count than the actual story (lies, lies, but there's a LOT)3) is apparently very inspired by Jane Austen, thematically (somewhat) and in style. Maybe I should start reading Jane Austen.4) reads like a history book at times. Again, the footnotes (!).But I loved everything about it. When you're reading it, provided you like it of course, it WILL be the best feeling ever when you find out that you're not even half-way into the book - a lot can happen before the end, and it WILL. In fact, it only gets better (but then again, the first couple of chapters are sort of boring, if you're anything like me.*)And believe it or not, I read every single bloody footnote. It's important for the world-building as well as the overall mood of the story, a factor that I personally value highly. Along with the writing style, it helps create that exact and very fitting atmosphere. Perfect book to read on a rainy day in Autumn by the way - wouldn't achieve the same effect on a sunny day.Sure, there were some of the more descriptive passages that I most likely wouldn't be able to recall ever having read. I can imagine my eyes sort of blurring at the time. And then I probably got distracted by a squirrel. But, but, but, when (and there will definitely be a when) I reread the book, I will take the time to read it all. And given the awesomeness of the book in general, I can't see why I wouldn't enjoy all the little details. Never thought I'd say that.So that was essentially what I didn't like about the book (and it turns out I liked it anyway! Win). But oh, there are so many things about this book that were absolutely amazing to begin with. The characters are well-developed (some more than others), they have their own motivations and personalities, and best of all, NONE are extreme in their alignments. Selfish? Sure. But not evil for evil's sake or good for good(nes)s' sake. I find that more sympathetic in characters than anything. In fact, I think the characters are probably the part of this book that made me like it the most. A character-driven book.But the plot is obviously pretty important, too. There are all these little subplots and somehow they intertwine in the strangest of ways. Most of my favourite books have somewhat complex plots - not too convoluted, but in a way that's believable in the 'willing suspension of disbelief' kind of way. Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell happens to have this kind of plot as well as be one of my favourite books. What a coincidence!A thing that bothered me a bit was the ending, though. Not that I minded it. I just really wanted more I guess (also some parts were kind of unresolved. You know what I'm talking about if you've read the book). Good thing Susanna Clarke is working on a sequel! (source: good ol' Wikipedia)All in all, this book was on all accounts, a great book. Magical, one might say (*snigger*). Not in the 'you're a wizard Harry' or the 'one ring to rule them all' kind of way, but in a mystical, 'ye olde-fashioned' kind of way. And I think I actually prefer that.So if you, for instance, happened to have stumbled upon this book on a library shelf or on the internet, and you read the cover or the description of the book, and you thought it sounded like the worst or just the most boring book ever, please give it a shot anyway. And by shot, I mean read it ALL. Near the end (aka the last couple of hundreds of pages) it really picks up the pace and the intensity and you will not regret it. That is, if you're anything like me...* Totally worth it though. Oh look, I can make footnotes too!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Susanna Clarke's achievement in this, her first book, is quite remarkable: not only in this maiden effort does she master the diction and style we would sooner associate with Jane Austen and W. M. Thackeray (the two most famous chroniclers of the Regency setting of her novel), but she also creates an entire alternate fantasy history for England that presumes both a practical and theoretical tradition for magicians stretching all the way back to the first King Henry. What's more, the book becomes something of a page-turner after the first few chapters (more on those below), with long sequences that effectively evoke genuine suspense, horror, and pathos. And she is an absolutely marvelous scene-painter, particularly when it comes to the description of the magic her central characters effect (both for parlor tricks and for practical purposes). This is the sort of book in which you can pleasurably get lost for quite a few evenings: it's its own little world. To be able to do this with a first novel is extraordinary, and mirrors the achievement of Clarke's own hero Jonathan Strange.With this in mind, it is important to point out too (as Mr. Norrell himself would) that a noviate is always apt to make errors, and Clarke, like Strange, does commit quite a number. The opening chapters move very slowly, though things pick up by the early chapter in York Minster (where Mr. Norrell first works his magic), and even further in the chapter entitled \\"Brest\\" (where Mr. Norrell first works it for practical purposes). Quite a bit of editing might have helped Clarke sharpen some of the novel's longeurs considerably, and there are some characters that don't seem to go much of anywhere, and not all the there are any number of loose ends at the end of the book (some of which are clearly intentional, but several others which just seem forgotten after they've been dropped). Nonetheless, I would happily read any other fiction by this writer, and hope (as she's promised) she returns to this world of her own making in her subsequent novels. There's so much here, including not only an alternate history for England but also Wellington, Byron, Lord Liverpool, Napoleon and (best of all) George III in all his kingly madness, that it's hard to be patient for her next full-length effort.I would have awarded this a full five stars (even with my few exceptions to Clarke's novice's errors) had Tor Paperbacks issued this in a less miserably inconvenient format. Be aware that this novel is much too long to fit coveniently in a mass-market paperback form, and that the type is particularly hard to read. They should have issued it in three trade paperback volumes, as did the novel's British publisher, Bloomsbury Books."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I have recommended many books and said that is was great once you get past the first couple of capters, but it is very rare to say to someone that you loved a book, if you can just get through the first 300 pages. This is that book. I devoured the last 500 pages of this book, despite slogging through the first 300. I encourage anyone to give it a shot because the character developement and the story are superb and well thought out. The only reason it is not getting five stars is because it was so hard to get into during the first 39 chapters."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The author can easily bring you to England, Spain or Fairy with her vivid descriptions, wonderful use of the time's language and most extraordinary ability to put into words what the characters feel. At times scary, magical, loving, exciting, murderous, fantastic and ever so real. A truly original story that is colored with proper British history.This story had me enchanted 99.99% of the time. The last few books I have read have all had disappointing endings. Maybe it is the books or I might be in a funk..... I am sure it is I that is off. I saw the foreshadowing; after all, it was prophesized, but I didn't enjoy seeing it fulfilled. This one sad event keeps me from giving this six stars. To shame Miss Susanna Clark. The next work you author, strive to make me happy at the conclusion.I plan on recommending this work to most everyone. If I am to be saddened, so shall they. I do hope that Miss Clark is busy working on her next piece to make me happy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I picked this book up for only a few dollars, and I didn't really expect a ton from it. I read a lot of sci-fi, but not much \\"fantasy,\\" so this was a new experience for me.In short, this book is fantastic. It has a very unique charm that most books do not. First, it's written to resemble writings from the Victorian period, a bit odd at first, but it grows on you. Secondly, Ms. Clarke sets up a very intricate, rich and complex mythology for her England. As it is set during the Napoleonic wars, the historical context offers a very clever way to incorporate her new myths into the world of Mr Norrell and Mr. Strange.The characters are very well fleshed out, as is the plot. Which takes me to my next point. As the world of the book is so rich, it takes a while for the author to get into the story. I completely appreciated it, however, as the complex universe that she built was very interesting and grandiouse - much like Herbert w/ Dune. So, just like the title of this review, once you get through the first 350 pages, the book is brilliant. It's fun, interesting, exciting and dramatic. A must read - if you're patient!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I did enjoy the half of Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell that I read, but I just got too darn tired to continue. I am happy to read big, bad, heavy books that will conk me in the head every time I try to read in bed. I quite enjoy English works that take a long time to build up to little or nothing if the journey is good. I freely admit I loved the historical style, complete with footnotes, in Jonathan Strange. It seemed like everything that I would want in a book, history, magic, written for grownups! But it was just too much reading with nothing going on to take. I have to agree with other reviewers, it is a personal style thing. Perhaps at another time in my life I will come back to it, but for now I'm okay with not knowing how it all ends up."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Even for you speedreaders, this one is going to take a while. Susanna Clarke's debut novel is a tremendous success. After reading it, I find it unbelievable that this is her first. She is good. Real good.If you like fantasy, and you like it in the British style, I doubt there is any better book out there. The characters are wonderful and the story itself is at times funny, charming, sad, and downright scary.So why not five stars? This book is longer than the Nile River and is sometimes slower than a three-legged mule. Sometimes Clarke feels she needs to expand on a thought and you'll find numerous footnotes throughout the story. These footnotes are teeny weeny and sometimes covers multiple pages. If they were normal font, you could tack on another 50 pages at least to this book. And sometimes the book just doesn't seem to be going anywhere, especially in the beginning. It's like a bio of these two magicians.Several times I could only read one chapter at a time, because it was so slow. But it does eventually pick up, so hang in there. It truly is a beautiful book, and though it's a behemoth, it deserves to be read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"After reading some of the reviews about this novel, I understand that there are people who love it for the writing style and supposed wit. I myself believe that a book on the best seller list should, at the very least, hold some entertainment value for almost everyone. After fighting my way through 300 pages of this cure for insomnia, I cannot for the life of me, understand what makes this book so wonderful. It is page after page after page of the most tedious, uninteresting drabble, occasionally interupted by a rare burst of actual excitement and innovative storyline.. The bursts are too few and far between. Maybe a degree in English lit would make this 10 lb. sedative more appealing, but I for one was greatly disappointed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I made myself finish this book. It was tedious and horribly boring, all 800 pages. I would have much rather read a book about the footnotes because they were much more interesting. This book has about as much magic in it as a chopped onion does. Now I know why it took her ten years to write it; she kept getting bored and forgetting to write more. Why are all these pseudo authors recommending other books in almost all of these reviews? There is a special section for that and it's not in the review box. Yes this book is terrible but using the review area to plug for other books is disrespectful, and not helpful at all to people who are looking for a book review not an advertisement."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Help my english, and still very fun.

After all it is her first attempt. But I forced myself to finish this book and lost all patience with her in doing so. The only character for whom I felt even the vaguest of stirrings of empathy was Stephen Black. The book lacked warmth. And she was allowed to be totally self-indulgent with the footnotes, which really grated on my nerves. This is a total shame. This same story could be told well. It simply isn't."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"What this book lacks in imagination and verve, it tries to make up for with footnotes and breathless, \\"Victorian\\" sounding prose.It doesn't work.Several of the characters spend a lot of time under some form of enchantment, but the enchantment itself is rather dull, and mainly consists of the characters being forced to dance when they really don't feel like dancing.

The language is beautiful and the characters are fun and humourously believable.The plot is a little slow the first 100 pages or so but stay with it and you will be rewarded with a fun, twisting plot that keeps you guessing.

Simon Prebble's reading is very entertaining and adds to the flavor and atmosphere of the story. I especially liked how he enhanced the personalities of Vinculous and the Gentleman with the Thistle-down Hair.HOWEVER, I have a couple of issues with the quality of the CD and packaging.This is a long book and therefore has lots of disks. The external box contains five or six internal CD booklets, each of which holds several individual CDs. The spines of each of these booklets are completely undifferentiated from one another. There is no way to know which of these booklets has the specific disk you want other than flipping through each of them. The outer box is proving to be flimsy as well. After only one listening, the outer box is already starting to tear and the tabs that close the box on either end don't seem to want to stay closed anymore.Here is my biggest beef with the audio version. There appears to be no thought as to the audio layout. Most disks do not end at the end of a chapter. The reading abruptly stops mid-chapter with no notice. There is no musical interlude to let the listener know the CD has ended; the reading is simply cut off and my disk player switches to another disk.I greatly enjoy the story and highly recommend it. This audio version, while entertaining, is poorly designed and constructed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Starnge and Mr. Norell is one of the few books I would rate 'classy'.

Its a book which has a lot of magic but the drama, the language , the style are what makes it a good book.

As far as I am concerned, that is the besetting flaw of this book--it is endlessly discursive. I freely admit that books of this nature were required reading for university English literature coourses, and being forced to read them may have poisoned my view of ALL novels in the genre, whether originals or, as here, deliberate copies. Nevertheless, I must say that \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell\\" reminds me of nothing so much as a cross between \\"The Hobbit\\" and either \\"Silas Marner\\" or one of Anthony Trollope's more lugubrious novels."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"As I was getting to the reviews here I noticed that the editorial review above used the expression \\"Sophisticated, witty...\\".Sophisticated and witty are two things that this book definitely isn't.

In the sense of \\"funny\\" used when talking about daytime TV, maybe it is.Perhaps the book is an outstanding example of the Fantasy genre, I would't know.

I know it's a critical and fan favorite, but my god, people, the snail's pace? The thudding language that apes Dickens' worst paid-by-the-page excesses? (For an example of how to do this sort of thing correctly, I urge you towards Charles Palliser's The Quincunx.) A lack of characters who are in the least likable, or even empathetic in some negative, but compelling, way? No, thanks.

Last week, after being snowed into my apartment with no access to the library, I gave it a shot. 200 pages in I tossed it across the room. Why, you ask? It's dull, it's depressing, it's slow, and it's just not entertaining. I could have watched reality TV that sparked more interest and pathos.At that point my friend calls, and says, \\"Oh, it picks up at the 300 page mark.\\"Right. I shouldn't have to trudge though 300 pages for a book to get entertaining. The editor of this novel should have been fired."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"No doubt this review will be bracketed by a pair of laudatory reviews. Since you can scroll down to another review for the plot I will just say the following;Ms. Clarke's writing style IS reminiscent of Dickens. Does anyone else remember that Dickens stretched his stuff out, as much as he could get away with, because he was paid by the word? Also while working your way through Dickens you were supposed to be absorbing some sort of moral lesson, something which is conspicuously absent from this novel.As for comparisons to Jane Austen, Austen's works are actually funny (the reader actually enjoys all that dialog in Emma). Ms. Clarke's work is occasionaly mildly amusing (at best, sometimes, in the footnotes, maybe).There is no concrete \\"good guy\\" in this novel which makes it difficult to care about the characters in the novel, except those stolen by John Uskland (and you hardly ever see those people).Also people talk about the \\"Victorian\\" feel of this novel, but something is really missing here. To the Victorians religion and the Church were a natural part of life. However in this novel the Church (of England in this case) is barely noticeable. For example, in Jane Austen's writings clergymen are always popping up. Admittedly if magic existed and the Church were powerless against it, the Church would cease to exist, but in those circumstances Mr. Norrell would have had no York Cathedral to work wonders in.For Regency and Victorian fiction you would do far better to read Georgette Heyer's books (she has written many period romances) or Connie Willis' \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog.\\"This book is too hard to follow and too hard to get interested in."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Take The Quincunx with it's rich Dickensian language, throw in a liberal dose of English Magic a la Harry Potter, and bind it up with some of the best use of footnotes in fiction since David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest, and you have a glimpse of this special book. Yes, some people will read it because they think it's another Harry Potter (it's not), or because there are references to Stephen Kings Dark Tower series (there are), and that's perfectly okay! Any excuse to expose people to a terrific story, great characters, and wonderful images. Every once of research and toil that Ms. Clarke spent in the ten years it took to write this are on amazing display. Yes, it's fantasy. Yes, it's literature. It's pretty much everything you'd want from a book called Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I love this book! However, I am disappointed in the quality of the Kindle edition of this and every other book Ihave bought and downloaded to my Samsung Tab 2.

It's kind of refreshing to read a fantasy book that isn't quite so dramatic and actively cinematic. It seems like the novel's encounter with film has left fantasy with more cinematography than dazzling prose. Clarke does a decent job of making it a novel, not a film-in-waiting, but it's at the expense of a gripping storyline. In descriptions worthy of War and Peace, she takes the reader all over England, taking page upon page to describe the flight of a group of crows. The book itself covers the rise of two practical magicians in England during the Napoleonic wars, when magic is more like a history lesson than a practical tool. In many ways, this novel defies a straight summary because the plot winds around, using the legend of the \\"Raven King\\" as an anchor point for the many other threads of the novel. It's a good read, but it can get dense and boring at times. Probably a good summer read, when you've got long stretches to get into the novel a bit."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I can't believe I bought this for a dollar! Great book, especially if you only paid a dollar. My copy is not for sale, sorry."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Lots of tension in the story drives it on.

The Prestige]] Very similar atmospheres, if you like one you'll like the other."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"4B - Onilee P.Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrel was like an adult Harry Potter - just without all the little british kids. Its still an England based book, but its somewhat more advanced, in the sense that the magicians are older. All in all it was a good book. Strange wasn't presented until the second part of the book and I guess since his name is in the title I was expecting him to be presented sooner - so it kind of threw me off gaurd. The suspense towards the middle of the book was exciting, and I liked it alot because I wasn't able to guess the outcome. I hate it when you already (pretty much) know what's going to happen in a book. Anyways, it was a good book, I would highly recommend it (especially if you liked the Harry Potter books). The only part I didn't really like was the end. It wasn't a bad ending, its just that I wanted it to end differently (I think its just because I'm a girl - a guy probably would feel differently)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"One of those amazingly, intimidatingly clever, but witty and compulsively readable books (like The Eyre Affair) that make one glad to be a reader! It seems ridiculous to cite an impressive historical accuracy in a book about magicians, but this period was a favorite of mine to study, and all the little details she puts in seem to be dead on the mark. I like that in a work of fantasy! (I'd have given it four stars, but the ending was depressing--at least until there is a sequel.)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"When I started this book, I really didn't think I would like it. In fact, I just about gave up after 50 pages. But I got on to Amazon, and after reading some of the other reviews, decided to give it until page 150. Boy am I glad I did that! Once the book got going, I found it hard to put down.There are many twists and turns, but the major plot revolves around Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, both magicians. Their relationship is rather entertaining, and their various \\"hangers-on\\" contribute a lot to the side stories. I found that I couldn't place it in any genre other than just fiction, because it is not your ordinary novel. The ending ties up all sorts of loose ends, in a way. It does leave an opening for a seqel, which I think would be interesting, but I don't think any sequel could match the majesty of this novel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This fantasy novel had some good moments including some charming characters and witty prose. The first fifty pages had me enthralled and excited to snuggle down with an engaging read. The concept of reviving the magical arts in England could have been quite enchanting. However, it soon became a meandering odyssey without momentum making it an actual chore to read. It is unnecessarily long-winded and never really achieves anything. The numerous footnotes were annoying and further served to destroy the momentum. If it is important put it in the story. But I don't think this author really knew what was important to the story and just added everything they thought of. A great disappointment."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Warning: this book is long, really long! The story is divided into three volumes, and the first definitely requires patience and a lot of will to go on reading. It is mostly because it is very directed at developing characters and no so much at advancing in the story. It tells us how magic is slowly leaving England, how nobody seems to know how to use it any more and how the magicians left are actually theoretical magicians that read books on the subject. Then Mr. Norrell comes along and we find out that he can actually perform magic. He's a reclusive man that is also awfully full of himself and decides that no one should be studying magic besides him, after all, he is the only practical magician alive. Norrell ends up in London doing what he wants: helping the English fight the French with magic - Clarke writes beautiful scenes on account of that. In the meantime, the magician also spends a lot of energy trying to stop the other so-called magicians and hides every book of magic he can get his hands on. This volume is quite slow paced but some of the scenes where magic is taking place are beautifully described and a pleasure to read.But it turns out Norrell is not the only magician left, since there's also a handsome man called Jonathan Strange who can perform magic, even if he's quite unaware of his abilities until someone tells him he is part of a prophesy. Mr. Norrell takes this news badly and sees Strange as his rival. The second and third volumes are easier to read. I've read some review that said some readers could start in the second volume if they think they cannot endure the first one, which probably is a good advice. Jonathan Strange is brought into the spotlight in the second volume and he is much more likeable than Norrell, even though he is too easily distracted to understand at once what's happening and that is a little exasperating sometimes. As the war against France escalates, Strange is sent to Portugal to help Wellington fight the french with his magic. Clarke did an amazing job intertwining her magical story with England's History. There's also a funny and suspenseful scene involving a visit to King George, the mad King who happens to be able to see and talk to fairies - like most madmen apparently do. Although this book is not exactly funny and sometimes is rather dark, some bits do feel like magic.I don't give it five starts for a set of reasons, starting with the first volume being quite dull. The footnotes are too many and too long, some of those footnotes could be standalone stories. It's interesting to know that the whole world behind the book is so well thought, but at the same time it keeps breaking the pace and a number of times I lost track of the story when I got back to the main text. I guess some readers can just ignore the footnotes altogether. I have to admit I was beginning to cringe at every paragraph that started with \\"Stephen and the gentleman with the thistle-down hair\\", most of it was just chatter that didn't enrich the story or helped it move on. Honestly, I was as bored as Stephen listening to the fairy. And I still don't understand the magic court \\"The Cinque Dragownes\\" chapter, it seems completely pointless.I think I would have made it quite shorter, but this book is undoubtedly a beautiful read full of magic. It's like you're transported to a complete different world and feel each character as a friend and understand their doubts and actions. It's really well written."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"For those who compare this book to Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, I think that is a very bad comparison. Magic is in the book, but often it is more of a side story, especially in the first 1/2 of the book. Even in the second half where magic is more prevalent, the story is really more about characters. Unfortunately, is too much detail in my opinion. I often wondered where the story was going. It is not a very plot driven book. Great insight into some very unique characters, but sometimes too much. This book dragged for me in many places and I often found myself reading to book out of shear inertia, hoping to finish it soon so I could start another book. Don't get me wrong, I love getting into the characters, settings, etc. Lord of the Rings is a great example of this. But in this book, it was too much. If you're looking for a magical adventure, fantasy, etc. you probably won't like it. It's not an adventure. It's more of a character study of some very unique people with their own quirky personalities, with a little magic thrown in, and only a very little adventure. In the end it's not a terrible book, but could have used some healthy editing. The book could have been cut by 1/3 without missing anything."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I get it, I really do, but that doesn't make me like it. At first it was wonderful, I was aware that Segundus wasn't a main character but everytime I read about him after the first chapter, I was happy. He was one of the few characters that didn't make me cringe in disgust. There were three characters I liked Stephen Black, Segundus, and Jonathan Strange. I enjoyed reading about the fairy, mostly because Stephen was there and I would have been happy following him around because at least things were happening to him. I read Norrell and I was bored and ticked off. I read Strange and I was usually just bored. Which is part of the problem, everytime we're with a character very little that is interesting is happening at the time. Oh, some magic will go on, but interesting, engaging magic happens very briefly, just enough that I made it through the book. The king was fun, even if we only saw him once, but nothing else mattered. She could have made this interesting, she could have made this something I actually took time out of my day to ponder, but there's nothing to ponder. I know why Mr. Norrell is such an unlikeable 'secrective' man. I don't have to wonder at his motivation, I know his motivation, his motivation is what made me want to read Segundus instead of him those first couple of hundred pages because I hated him and felt no sympathy or attachment.Why don't I like the female characters? Well, where do I begin with them? I can't really review the ones that show up near the end well enough, becaue I was plowing through the book intent on finishing it. Plus, the female characters are female characters, if they're anything besides being female they're insane or vindictive. At least some guys got slightly indebt, 'I like them in the book even if I hate them as a rule', personalities, like Childermass -- oddly enough, I actually disliked it when he took a more active role near the end of the book. I liked his smarmy character, he offset Norrell well enough so that Norrell's antics were interesting in that his little minioin came around placating everyone but keeping a firm foot down on what was happening. Arabella, Mrs. Pole, were just uninteresting. Arabella I pointed out as hostage material early on when she became mroe than the love interest. Mrs. Pole just became haughty and cruel in an uninteresting overdone way in the end. The rest of the female cast is easy to shrug off.Not so much with the male ones, but I can usually point to something (even with Norrell) that they did that was of interest. It might have been predictable, but it was interesting.But enough about characters.The writing style was not what I hoped it would pan out to be. It started out interesting with that Victorian feel to it, but by page 100 I was reading 10 pages at a time to give my brain a break. Things that can ruin a book: bad narration. And it's not bad as in \\"horrible grammar\\" the style is just so uninteresting that I can't keep engaged with it that long to be able to concentrate on the words to enjoy them so I start zoning out. Next thing I know I've 'read' twenty pages without retaining a word. I like Victorian style writing. No, scratch that, I like books written in that era. It's like Clarke pulled in everything I hated about that style of writing and put it into the book without actaully putting in any elements that interested me. And I love Dickens, I know this rambles with Dickens, but it is not him. His characters can be one dimensional to a point, but at least at the end I feel like I know them, like they've grown and changed and matured. Nothing happened worth mentioning in this book. I feeel like the end was just put there because someone said it was getting too long and Clarke had to find a way to tie up all the loose ends so she wrote that and to say it was a letdown after all the buildup would be stretching it. It wasn't like I expected some magnificent fight. I would have been dissapointed in that. but this was just lack luster to a fault.Oh, and the footnotes? Sometimes it makes the book. Sometimes footnotes are witty enough to make me love the book or even recommend the book even if the actual story sucks. I started ignoring the footnotes to this book after fifty pages and maybe glanced at them once or twice afterwards. They didn't need to be there.Subject matter was predictable. All the questions and issues it covered I could point to other books that did it and did it better. Not only that, they did it more subtly, which is impressive seeing as a coupe that I'm thinking of are action fantasy. So yeah, all question brought up are things that have been before. Knowledge, who should have it. Should it be kept from people or shared? The consequences of both options. Power and how to weild it. Like and death. Servatitude. And so on and so forth. One of the problems is that they are brought up but barely explored. I don't expect an answer, but the book was dealing with so much and weighed itself down with some things that weren't consequential that I don't feel inspired to explore these questions. When these things are brought up, I'm usualy given a little to work my mind around, a new perspective to consider and juxtapose to my own world view, a flaw, a belief, a fact, this brought the subject up. But my views of everything stay the same and unquestioned. Nothing new to the table, nothing to think about unless I felt like it and then I'd go somewhere else to start because this isn't inspiring me to think it through.So, yeah, if you want to tote around the superior knowledge that you read an 800 page book, good for you, knock yourself out. Just don't go looking for something or new. I don't know, maybe other people will find gems in it, and as I said, the magic can have it's moments, but to me the characters are cardboard cut outs. The plot is stupid and overall a let down, and the subject matter is repetetive and done better in other stories."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Clarke's novel is essentially pastiche. She has adopted (one can hardly say mastered) a certain voice then spends her many pages ruminating in it. But there is more --much more-- to good writing or storytelling than chewing the cud. One reads page after page longing for something to happen. It seldom does."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"First off, while this is a great book, it is not an easy summer read. There are footnotes galore that must be read in order to understand the story, but to me that is part of the books appeal. This book completely immerses you into its world and the level of work Susanna Clarke did on it is amazing. The story is fascinating though I will admit there are a few spots it drags a bit. But the different story lines intersect beautifully and again the detail - especially the clever use of footnotes - makes this a must read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I gave the book 3 stars for being extremely well written, but found the book's dark overtone too much for my taste."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The Good:The prose is excellent, as you would expect from such a highly lauded work. Clarke was clearly trying to make the setting more realistic by emulating classic authors such as Dickens and Austen, authors on whom we rely to summon up the nineteenth century for us. Thus, her novel seems almost as real as history. Which is great. The use of footnotes to provide background information is unusual in a novel, but it came across as charming.The Gentleman with the Thistle Down Hair was an enigmatic and interesting villain. He popped up quite a lot, but still it was never really clear what he was all about, or why he acted so strangely. Presumably, his erratic behavior was related to his being a faerie. His ideas of proper behavior and general morality were refreshingly alien, and creatively done.The Not-So-Good:The overarching plot is about the relationship and competition between Norrell and Strange. But I never really cared about it, and it seemed like a rigged fight anyway. Strange was far more sympathetic than Norrell, and more talented, and it seemed like just a matter of time before he got the better of his former master.Moreover, the novel is too long. It sags under its own weight. Clarke seems content to allow too many chapters to reveal exactly one fact to the reader. For example, one chapter reveals that Lady Pole hates Mr. Norrell (at least, in my reading, that was the only relevant information in that chapter). Couldn't that have been worked into another chapter, for the sake of expediency?For the full review, head over to [...]"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I'm inclined to admit, I seldom finish any fictional work, apart from \\"the classics,\\" aside from this one.You see, my bend is more toward the non-fiction. What interests me is natural medicine, metaphysics, quantum physics, aesthetics, psychology, etc.So I MUST say, this little piece was a serendipitous treasure, melding reason, knowing and beauty. A courtship between what I loved in fiction and lined-up with what I groped for in research. And it came without necessarily seeking it.Should you read it-- and if you are at all like me, you should-- pay attention to the two protagonists. One accumulates all and exercises little in action, a \\"heady\\" fellow; and the other practices all, groping for head knowledge. The dichotomy is brilliant, and each facet is part of a whole truth; not unlike our own."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Since the departure of The Raven King from England magic has become quite defunct in practice. In fact there are no longer anymore magicians left in the country, or at least not until the appearance of Mr. Norrell. Bent on returning English magic to its former glory in the public eye Mr. Norrell astounds everyone with his magical acts. Soon another magician, Jonathan Strange, appears on the scene and though their differences instantly set them apart Strange becomes Norrell's pupil. Together they set out to reestablish magic in England; beset the perils of wicked faeries, public conjecture and above all each other.Susanna Clarke's first novel flows effortlessly into an epic fantasy to rival Tolkien and Rowling; yet she writes with all the superior lyricism and social wit which Jane Austen possessed. For any reader of fantasy who also happens to be a fan of Austen this novel is a dream come true! Clarke is a brilliant new writer with a flair for writing rarely seen in contemporary authors.Personally, I enjoyed this book immensely! Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is my favorite book of the year thus far. Clarke's characters were not the usual heroic figures without fault; each possessed his or own idiosyncrasies and flaws which severed to animate them as believable people. Mr. Norrell is a sad little old man who fears everything but nothing so much as that his power and influence over English magic might be diminished. Jonathan Strange on the other hand is a charming, courageous, tolerably handsome young man who is excessively arrogant.Whenever the plot seemed to lag I was still continuously amused by Clarke's flourish for language and poetical passages. I have seen many reviews which criticized Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell for being so long and full of detail and yet after 1000 pages I am dying to read more! Clarke's gothic world of magic, wicked faeries, mysterious kings, and great magicians has bewitched me and I can scarcely bare to leave it!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Absolutely, unequivocally, one of my favorite books of all time, if not THE favorite. The world the author weaves is believable, poignant, witty and magical. The book is so layered, and the characterization great. It really reads like a cross between Jane Austen, Tolstoy, Wilkie Collins and Harry Potter, if such a thing were possible. If you love one or two of these authors, you'll LOVE this! It's not at all dense and hard to read, as some reviewers have suggested. Sure, it's not Dan Brown, but neither is it War and Peace. A page-turner...classifiable as adventure or suspense. The ending was so gripping I was pretty much skimming things to find out what happened!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I tried. I really did. But it just didn't work. First I tried the audiobook--I have large chunks of time where I can listen as I commute or work out. About 6-8 hours in, I couldn't take it anymore--because nothing had happened. I kept listening and listening, thinking that finally it would get going--and it never did. I got home one evening, realized that I had wasted another perfectly good hour and a half listening to nothing happen, and pulled the book off my Ipod. Enough. But--so many liked it--so I tried reading it. But that didn't help either, as still nothing happened. Finally the book just sat by the chair and I had no incentive to pick it up again. Clearly, this is a book that is read for atmosphere, or historical setting, or for characterization, or something that escapes me, and not just for a plot moving along to a conclusion. Tolkien can get pretty slow at times too, but at least its pretty easy to skip over the songs or poetry, or other parts that I consider dull and keep moving. I could never do that with this book. So I finally just skipped over the book. I didn't even turn to the end to see how it ended. By then, I didn't care. And I still don't."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I find myself in the minority on this one, but Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell for whatever reason just didn't strike a chord with me. The characters are colorful and distinct, and the settings, from Wellington's London, to rural England to Venice of the era are fantastic and atmospheric. The writing is delicious - evocative of popular 19th work right down to the quirky 3 page long digressive footnotes. But the story just fell flat for me. As a literature fan, I appreciated it very much - but as a fan of fiction, it just didn't grab me. If any of the above sounds appealing, by all means give it a try - but if you're going for a quick fantasy fix, or \\"Harry Potter\\" for adults, maybe go somewhere else."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"In JS&MB;, Clarke proves she's a wonderful writer. The scenes of wintry London and rural England are fabulous, and she has a knack for crafting characters at their persnickity best. But the biggest problem with this book is one of momentum, er...the lack of one. Little keeps the book moving forward, and it's a heavy book to keep balanced on your chest at night. I loved the characters, loved the mood, but the book on a whole never really goes anywhere. It's a quite maddening read. I really wanted to love this - devoted weeks to it, but the enchantment never came.I too was taken by the Harry Potter meets Victorian England marketing ploy. And the book does plod like an Jane Austen novel. All in all, more a page borer than a page burner. But three stars because Clarke can write. It's a shame she can't pace (or edit).And the footnotes detract. What's she trying to prove? As the book was coming to an end, I was glad for them though (they made the pages shorter)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Thia is not a Harry Potter magic kind of book - it casts you into a world of the magical unknown.This is the story of two magicians, and when you dabble where you should not go, you pay the price. The story is told with a great deal of historic information with many explanations to heighten the level of knowledge..The book, with 10 years of research and writing is a must for fans of the 1800's and magic....\\"you know who\\" would probably surrender to these 2, and they didn't even go to Hogwarts!!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"While I thoroughly enjoyed the voice of the book through the first 60 pages, and was further tantalized by a story set in a vibrant and Sherlockian era, Ms. Clarke suddenly took a bizarre turn and started in about some minor character's impulse to help Mr. Norrell redecorate his house. Immediately following that debacle were long, drawn-out bits of exposition (disguised as dialog) that did absolutely zip to further what started as a promising plot. The author tripped and staggered into things that seemed to have nothing to do with what had been presented up front. A great conflict is established in about the first 30 pages or so, a conflict that could have staggering ramifications, but nothing of substantive story value materialized to infuse the narrative and make me want to keep reading.The other thing I found distracting and annoying were all of the footnotes inserted throughout the text. This wasn't supposed to be a textbook, it was supposed to be a fantasy novel. I didn't feel like \\"studying\\" all of the back history. While I think this was done in a vain attempt to be \\"artsy\\" I blame the editors for not excising such nonsense out of the novel--or at least insisting it end up in the back of the book (or better yet, the author's website) to be referenced at the reader's leisure. And I feel while the prose was fresh and quite readable, the author clearly didn't stop to ask in the first 100 pages or so whether she really had a story worth asking readers to journey with her for 1000 pages. This comes at no great surprise since directionless bloat seems to be the norm in the large majority of this generation's fantasy works.Great potential but poorly executed such that I could not finish it, and I cannot in good conscience give more than 1 star to any book I couldn't finish."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The first 100 or so pages were excellent. After that, it was tedious at best. Much time is devoted to major charachters like Mr. Segundus, who then tend to vanish entirely for several hundred pages.The book could have used a brutal editor to cut it down to a fraction of its current size, and it would have been far more readable. Its a pity, because the core of a really fantastic saga is clearly there. But it gets buried under piles of mush."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Susanna Clarke is a first rate wordsmith and social satirist, and in this book creates a lavishly textured alternative vision of 19th century England - a place where magic is very much real and alive. The highlight of this novel for me was the witty dialogue and the way the characters were presented as infinitely fallible, yet somehow likeable at the same time. I found myself laughing out loud often, and was taken in by the wintry landscapes and somber mood against which the satirical writing is juxtaposed.Having said that, I must say I did find the novel to be rather slow moving, and found myself unable to sustain reading sessions for long periods of time. I think this is partly because the very thing that makes the characters funny and enjoyable, their quirky shallowness, eventually suffuses the entire novel with a sense of shallowness. It's as if one can't enter the world of any particular character and share in their sadness or passions. The characters inhabit a world in which very bad things happen yet are stoically accepted - it's as if the characters themselves are magical apparitions devoid of real human emotions."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is a doorstopper of a book, coming in at over 780 pages and weighing several pounds! It takes quite an effort to hold it up or prop it up to read, but the effort is well worth it. The first time author has presented an early 19th century England that had once been divided north and south into two different kingdoms, the northern half ruled by the Raven King, a human/fairy magician. We are introduced to two magicians whose task it becomes to restore magic to England, since the magic has basically been forgotten. There are amusing side trips into Wellington's Peninsula campaign, and a new view of how the Allies won the battle of Waterloo. This is also a book that covers, in a light-hearted way, the social classes and the differences between them. It's somewhat of a comedy of manners in part, and also a mystery and a search for something elusive. Despite the length and the size of the book, reading it from cover to cover was not a chore, because the author keeps the reader continually interested in finding out what was going to happen next. This is a very good book, and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The positive points of this novel have been well described in previous reviews. It is well conceived and well executed, representing a different and compelling picture of magic that I recognized from my childhood fantasies and fairy tales. It's beautifully descriptive, and I didn't mind the slow-developing pace, because the path is pleasant enough, and it's always clear that it is actually going somewhere.The reason I am only giving it 3 stars, however, is because after finishing I felt frustrated and disappointed by the lack of substantive human connections (\\"connexions\\") in its relationships. Each of the characters is well-realized and distinct, but they seem to operate in separate spheres of motivation and emotion. I mean, they interact, but there is a definite lack of emotional drama in the interaction. I know this is part of the novel's style (a certain aristocratic detachment), but I felt the lack of inter-human emotion, especially in the resolution of the book's climax, to be totally false. Maybe I'm a simpleton to require \\"heart\\" when there's so much other great stuff going on, but the few glimpses we get of Norrell's emotional connection to Strange and the friendship between Lady Pole and Arabella Strange were for me too-brief respites from the solitary English moor that is the emotional landscape of this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"To those who continue to write that the book is \\"boring\\"...well, you're not listening to us.Do *not* read this book unless you love the Brontes, Jane Austen, Dickens, Thackery, etc.Do *not* read this book merely because you love fantasy.Read this because you love English literature. It is beautifully written with absolutely wonderful characterization, and I expect it to win many awards. I could quibble about a few minor issues, but any flaws are more than made up for by the excellent writing and realistic world.You need patience to read this, and you need a deep love of reading. Again, if you don't appreciate 19th English literature, don't attempt this.As an aside, I just read that the film rights have been sold."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is now one of my favorite books of all time but let me preface that with saying that I didn't even think I'd finish it while I was trudging through the first 400 -- yes 400! -- pages.

The plot it's everywhere so you will need to have a little patience to connect all the dots, but for me that only made the experience even more fun.I really hope to read in the near future more adventures of the last two English Magicians alive.Thanks Mrs. Clarke for a great read.Cheers"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"_Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell_ is a riveting book about two English magicians who, in an England where magic occurred in years past but not in their time, decided to bring magic back to England again. Mr. Norrell is a picture of a scholar who has studied for years and years in order to insure that he is the only magical expert alive in England. Jonathan Strange is a man who tries to learn about magic under the tutelage of Mr. Norrell, but then allows his natural aptitude for magic to guide him instead when Mr. Norrell keeps back some of his magical knowledge. The two magicians also disagree about how the Raven King, the founder of English magic and ruler of various faerie realms, should be discussed in terms of modern magic.This book was amazing. The characters were intriguing and I thought it was really nice to read a fantasy book meant for adults instead of the young adult stuff I've been reading lately. The dark element of the book was well done, and the malevolence of some faeries and a bit of dark magic was portrayed in the novel. One of my favorite moments is when the Raven King finally does show up in England; the author builds up to the moment and the character perfectly, and the depiction of the Raven King was perfect.It is a long book, but it is worth it. I will probably read it again sooner or later."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Great book with a super narrator.

As soon as I finished it, I started reading chapter 1 again because I couldn't let it go. It is beautiful and dark and fun and smart.

I bought Clarke's book of short stories because I refuse to leave England/Faerie."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"A wonderful high-end entertainment, especially as an audio-book. The story is a bit of Harry Potter for grownups, about two Englishmen in the early 19th century, learned in magic and acting on the world-stage of London and the Napoleonic European continent. The other venue is the land of faerie, with enchantments not at all charming, and with many evocations of England's great magician-king of long ago, John Uskglass. The work is long (and perhaps would be a bit tiresome to read), but holds up well as a tale beguilingly told, over many sessions, by the magnificant reader, Simon Prebble."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Ah, what a delightful doorstop of a book. It's over 1,000 pages, and still I didn't want the story to end. And speaking of endings, Susanna Clarke pulls off a consummate ending to a story into which she threaded numerous strands. She wraps them up just right, in a way I didn't foresee but which, to my hindsight, is perfect.But enough about the ending -- no spoilers in this review, I promise!The story takes place in Regency England and revolves around two English magicians, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, and their activities during and immediately following the Napoleonic Wars. At the beginning of the story, magic has become, in people's minds, a theoretical construct only, and a dusty group of theoretical magicians meet periodically in Northern England to discuss it. Perish the thought that anybody actually practice magic. That would be downright ungentlemanly.But a new member of the society has other ideas, and pretty soon, he discovers that there remains one practicing magician in England: Mr. Norrell. Though Mr. Norrell practices magic instead of only talking about it, he's conservative in what kind of magic he'll practice -- nothing too wild or woolly -- and he jealously guards his knowledge until a talented upstart, Jonathan Strange, becomes his pupil. And even then, though he admires Strange's talent and enjoys Strange's friendship, Mr. Norrell continues to withhold significant areas of magical knowledge from him, telling himself Strange doesn't need to practice those kinds of magic, nor does anyone.Mr. Norrell breaks with his conservatism once, however, and performs a type of fairy magic to raise from the dead the wife of Walter Pole, a prominent politician, to curry Pole's favor. Then the trouble starts: a malicious fairy, \\"the gentleman with the thistle-down hair\\" who is never named, places under enchantment not only Lady Pole but also Walter Pole's head servant, Stephen Black, and ultimately Jonathan Strange's wife, Arabella, as well.And enchantment by the gentleman with the thistle-down hair, by the way, is not fun. It starts out somewhat that way for the adventurous spirit, but it becomes a sort of death-in-life for the enchanted. The more time spent in faerie the darker and more dismal and tedious grows the stay. The gentleman with the thistle-down hair is a fairy king but he's a neglectful one, and his brugh, which he disguises as a run-down castle, is surrounded by the bones of the people he has killed for sport over the ages.Mr. Norrell's goal has been to \\"return magic to England\\", though paradoxically he wants to control most of the knowledge and practice himself, and he also wants to keep under wraps, as much as he can, the magic performed and inspired by John Uskglass, a powerful magician-King from centuries past whose knowledge has largely been lost. When the brave and resolute Strange discovers some of the Raven King's magic and begins performing it himself, Mr. Norrell strongly disapproves, creating a rift between England's only two practicing magicians.Strange and Norrell hold it together long enough to help Wellington defeat Napoleon, but compared to the gentleman with the thistle-down hair, Napoleon was a piker. Can they put aside their differences to defeat the malicious fairy?To say this book is magical would be gross understatement. It's an enthralling combination of mind-blowing fantasy and tongue-in-cheek fun-poking at the manners of the day. Delightful, dry humor is woven throughout, and its sheer imaginative power rivals the works of Tolkien."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is not too long, even with it's 800 some pages: in fact it just might be the total opposite of that general idea. For people looking for an instantaneous plot with immediate storytelling, then this is not for you. This book is purely about reading and enjoying it without any rush; it's not about getting to the end as fast as possible. Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell took me weeks to finish, coming from someone who read the largest Harry Potter book in a day. But to read this book is to savor it without worrying about how many pages have been read so far, or how far from the ending you are.The footnotes were more than enjoyable, as each one was needed, not to further the plot, but to enhance and enrich the overall setting and to make the time era and world much more believable. What Susanna Clarke did was write the history of this alternate England and give it to us in her footnotes. The short folk tales, which she included in addition to the text, were like little gems that were found in such a labyrinth. Placing all those extra bits and pieces of information directly into the text would have been nothing more than a long, boring info-dump that we, as the reader, would have to sludge through. Instead, every time a little footnote appeared, I would jump on it with vigor.The characters were beautifully crafted as well as a truly real setting. Each person was a dear friend before the story had its end. And even when I finally reached the end, I did not want to finish the story, but wanted it to extend beyond those few 800 pages, for even with that length, the story was not long enough."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Everyone else has said all that can be said. Suffice to say this is a really thumping good read. Yes, it's oh so long. There are times you're going to want to skip ahead. Yes, it is very weird at times. But overall it's extremely COOL. I read it a year ago and it stays with me."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I've read several Harry Potter stories and found them morally simplistic. Good and evil are clearly separated, and there is none of the ambiguity in those books that permeates real life. In this book, Ms. Clarke pens a far more sophisticated story of magic and moral ambiguity. A more difficult, but more satisfying story than Potter by far. I would also commend her on the fantastic ending --- I did not think the plot lines would come together so neatly."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"If you are planning to read this book, you have to get through 100 pgs of not that interesting annoyingly english plot set-up. I almost gave up when I went on Amazon and read all these wonderful reviews. I stuck it out and became hooked. It turned out to be a great book and I'm happy I read it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book had a lot to live up to when I read it because I had heard such wonderful things about it. It is just as good as everyone says and is delightful to read! Clarke really is the next big thing. It is witty, suspenseful, thought provoking, and unbelievably fantastic."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Reading the story of the revival of English magic, I fell in love with the romance of magic welling up to the surface of a world that thought it safely forgotten. Clarke spins a seamless blend of a novel of manners and the chaotic world of faerie. The characters are rich and complex, equal to the ambiguities of their actions.A book for people who luxuriate in turns of phrase and vivid detail, \\"Strange\\" avoids the \\"re-do Tolkien for the 9128th time\\" trap. Clarke has her own voice, and it is strong.To top it all off, from reading other reviews, it appears that this book irritates both the snobs and the attention deprived--a sure sign of a book written by someone who loves to read, for people who love to read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Like other viewers, I was more than a bit underwhelmed a good third into this book, but I kept reading, and then I didn't want it to end. I just read the last 300 pages in one evening/morning. Fabulous book. But you have to actually read it before you rate it . . ."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Tremendous, both in size and in quality!This book does come with a bit of caveat emptor - if you don't like fussy, British comedies of manners, you probably won't like this. It's almost entirely unlike 'Harry Potter'. If books were beverages, this would be a fine, aged Bordeaux, and 'Harry Potter' would be a Coca-Cola. Nothing wrong with either drink - some people hate wine, some people drink Pepsi - it's just a matter of knowing your tastes. I'd also say it took about 150 pages for me to start really enjoying Clarke's writing, which is a pretty daunting investment.But once I started liking it.... I nearly swoon when I think of how it affected me. The characters are neatly and precisely drawn, yet they jump off the page as flawed, thoughtful, complex human beings. I was particularly impressed with what Clarke did with Mr. Norrell. His failings seem innocuous at the beginning, but you can see how they become much more serious in different contexts. It's very difficult to write good characters in fantasy or sci-fi books, because so much writing must be dedicated to setting the imaginary scene. This is hands down the best job I've ever seen in magical fiction.The footnotes are just fascinating. It's like walking into an orchid hothouse - you're knocked off your feet by the lushness of your surroundings, and you want to absorb every last detail, even though you know it's impossible. Clarke is funny, suspenseful, piercing, lyrical, didactic, and gosh, I could go on forever.Clarke has also imagined some really brilliant acts of magic. They are very subtle - in one case, a magician replaces a mundane object with its reflection in a mirror - and you're left gasping at how simultaneously clever and lovely the descriptions are.Just for the record, no, I don't know Susanna Clarke. I absolutely adored this book. By the end, I would happily have read another 800 pages if I could have. I devoutly hope it doesn't take her another ten years to write the sequel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Unfortunately I do not have time to write a lengthy review, but I just had to give this book 5 stars. Like another reviewer said, if you are expecting action, look elsewhere. If you are interested in the pubescent development of Potter & Co. and are expecting to glean further knowledge from this narrative, you will come away dissappointed. Think of it this way: would you be interested in a heavily character-driven novel in which some of the main delights come from the psychology of the characters, the beauty of the writing, and the social complexities that result from the characters' actions in attempting to revive the practical aspects of an occupation that has been relegated to academia for hundreds of years, all set in England in the 1800s? I would say that that, plus magic, is what you should expect. That being said, it is superb. It is magnificent. It is so good that after 850 pages you don't want it to end because you know that your next book won't be as good. I highly recommend it, but approach it with maturity, not infantile glee. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"\\"Can a magician kill a man by magic?\\" Lord Wellington asked Strange.Strange frowned. He seemed to dislike the question. \\"I suppose a magician might,\\" he admitted, \\"but a gentleman never could.\\"These past two-plus months, I've had the extreme pleasure of reading Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell: A Novel. It's the first novel for author Susanna Clarke. It had been on my to-read-list since July...and was a gift to me from my fiancee.Such a well-crafted book deserves a well-crafted review. I can only hope I am up to the task.Years ago, when I was in high school, I greatly enjoyed the works of the Bronte sisters, Jane Austen, Wilkie Collins, and--most of all--Charles Dickens. Their writings captured for me the essence of English life, and the English country, in these authors' times. This was accomplished through the style and language of their writing, the use of small settings and every-day social functions within their stories, and proper, detailed characterization. Pacing the story was key, especially to Dickens, who wrote serialized novels, and needed to keep folks coming back, chapter after chapter.Susanna Clarke has captured these things well in JS&MN.; The language harkens back to Austen, and also is speckled with local or country colloquialisms, and older style spellings from time to time, such as \\"chuse\\" for \\"choose\\". The pace of the plot is slow at first, only building towards a crescendo as the novel nears its ending. Instead, the emphasis at the start really is to put all of the elements of the story in place, one by one, so that they are readily, and credibly, used when needed. The settings used in the story are as one would expect for a novel set primarily in England during the period of the Napoleonic Wars: country homes, parlours, upper-crust London homes, libraries, the English countryside, and even the battlefield. They are described as one intimately familiar with them would describe them: detailed, but not overly so.At the same time, this is a tale of magic. More properly, this is the story of the return of English magic to England. In many ways, English magic is its own character within the story. In the Middle Ages, magic was prevalent within England, especially after the \\"Raven King\\" brought his army out of Faerie and conquered northern England, holding it for three centuries until he, one day, vanished. Following his departure, magic slowly faded from use within England. At the start of the Napoleonic Wars, magic was the stuff of legends only, and magicians were only \\"theoretical\\", scholarly, upper-crust types who could not actually practice their art.And that brings us to the start of the tale. Mr. Norrell, one of those scholarly types, has the ability to practice his art, and decides it is his calling to restore magic to England. After performing his first public act of magic, he travels from York to London, hoping that the news of his magic will interest the government. He does not mesh well with London society, initially, and it is not until after he brings a young bride back from the dead, that the members of the government, as well as London society, truly take notice. How he manages this act of magic has grave consequences for many, if not all, of the major characters in the story.Norrell is a self-contradictory character. He wishes to bring back English magic, but he wants to lead a quiet life, and he doesn't seem to want any other magicians to be \\"on the scene\\". Norrell startles himself, and us, when he takes on an apprentice, a man by the name of Jonathan Strange. Strange and Norrell do not necessarily have characters which mesh well together. Where Norrell is quiet, cautious, and bookish, Strange is dashing and adnventurous, and carries out his magic as much by intuition as by book-learning. After Strange helps out with the defeat of Napoleon in Spain, and again at Waterloo, an inevitable break occurs between the two. It is this break, their differing views on magic, and the consequences of the revival-from-dead act which propells the story together towards its foretold conclusion (for there was also a prophecy): the restoration of magic to England.The pacing of the story is slow, and deliberate, at the start, as characters and settings are introduced. And it is not just the characters of Norrell and Strange which are covered in great detail. Other major characters include Norrell's aide Childermass, Strange's wife Arabella, the revived Lady Pole and her husband and their Negro butler, and a nameless fairy, amongst others. Historical characters play roles, including Lord Wellington, Byron, and even the mad King of England. Each of these characters gets the attention required to provide substance and depth to their descriptions. Once all of the elements are in place, the storyline slowly accelerates towards the final confrontations, and the inevitable.This all makes for a long story. Patience you must have, because the payoff is there. The ending of the story is not what I expected, but it felt truly natural, and it was truly breath-taking.This tale of magic is certainly not in the style of Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. It is brilliantly different. For those looking for a completely new magical experience, combined with some true skill in word-smithing, I heartily invite you to read this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I did end up liking this book. It is very clever. But, it was very slow to begin with. It really didn't get fasinating until I was halfway through -- which is 350 pages. The second half of the book is a whole lot better than the first. It isn't an adult Harry Potter. The only thing it shares with the Potter books is magic and England. Other than that it is quite unlike J.K. Rowlings' books. I am planning on reading it a second time to get all of what I missed the first time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"First of all, a warning - please try not to read the synopsis on the back cover of the novel. It gives far too much away for serious readers who like to discover a book a page at a time and not have the synopsis spoon fed to them in 2 minutes !Having said that, Susanna Clarke's much hyped debut novel, still delivers the goods, even if you have had some of the fun of discovery stolen from you because of that back cover synopsis.Very rarely have I come across a writer who can comfortably convey humour through serious prose set in some very serious situations. To be honest, the only other writer who comes to mind is... J.R.R Tolkien, who was able to lighten the mood with the antics of Merry and Pippin or with descriptions of Treebeard and the Ents. Similarly, Ms. Clarke seamlessly takes the reader through the some pretty dark territory and when you least expect it, introduces a segment or sometimes just a phrase, that brings a smile to the readers' lips.Broadly speaking, the book is set during the Napoleanic Wars in the 19th century in a world where magic exists, but for various reasons has faded into disuse over the past couple of centuries. Into this setting arrive the two title characters with ever-improving feats of magic, thereby capturing the imagination of England and Europe.However, as the two magicians start exploring increasingly intricate magical spells, they unwittingly expose themselves, their loved ones and perhaps all of England to the mercy of darker forces.In addition to the sheer quality of Ms. Clarke's writing, she uses footnotes as a very engaging device to give the reader additional details and back stories on various characters and incidents. These footnotes sometimes occupy more of the page than the main story !The different plot threads are skillfully woven together to bring the reader to an interesting and satisfying conclusion. As I have said, I am left hoping that she will either write a sequel or will stick to the fantasy genre.Great stuff !"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"&#65279;Clarke's first book is an amazing work on several accounts. The writing is elegant and masterful. She follows the tradition and style of some of the great English writers of the 19th century-making this reader think in particular of Jane Austen or George Eliot.The plot is full of interesting turns, while the adept characterization and accounts of daily living maintain interest during lulls in action. The area of particular mastery is the psychological tone of the novel. It creates a mood that is cheerful and wholesome-and at moments eerie. All in all a wonderful read. I now regret reading it so quickly, sad that the experience is over."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I just finished reading this book and found it to be a fascinating and well-written book. As others have said, I agree that it is very easy to put the book down before Mr. Strange is introduced as the story seems to drag a bit up to that point. However, once the interplay between the two magicians begins, it is a very compelling story, in my opinion. I must confess that I am perplexed by reviewers on this page who post a review without having read the book in its entirety. This is a disservice to prospective readers."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"this is a wonderful book - part Dickens, a little Tolkien, and a dash of C.S.Lewis - the comparisons to Harry Potter aren't really fair - this is a deeper, far better book.

If I had read the book without outside information - I would have assumed it had been written in the 1800's - the author has truly captured the feel of the era. It takes more effort than the Potter books - you can tell this was written for adults - no spoonfeeding the plot line for you! It is a british book at its best."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book was bound to be rated on a diverse scale.I thought the book was a superior work with flaws. I found it to be a very well paced read, despite its size. It held my interest, although there were many times ,the plot was simply lost. A good editor would have been helpful.The extensive footnotes added to the reality of the \\"world\\" created by Ms Clark, but they too became annoying after a while. It almost seemed that the author had so much to write that it simply poured onto the page without structure.Gee..lots of negatives. but like magic, I somehow thoroughtly enjoyed the book and was sad when I finshed the experience."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book felt as if it could have been written by Charles Dickens or Wilkie Collins had either of them decided to write a \\"fantastic\\" story.

But for the rest of us it feels as if we've discovered a new work by an old master.Clarke's world is as familiar as an old fairy-tale with its enchanted balls, wicked fairies and dark woods, yet the story is new and thoroughly original.

I was continually struck by the sheer power of her prose and her flawless recreation of the written and spoken language of the time. To sustain such a voice through hundreds of pages is in itself a great feat. However, Clarke also invokes an imposing and stunning world of English history and magic that is completely convincing and detailed in it's vision (the footnotes are incredible). Besides it's a truly gripping story.I keep reading reviews that compare it to the Harry Potter series, but the work is so utterly different that comparing the two is like comparing a go-cart to a Farrarri, it just shouldn't be done.

Clarke does a fantastic job creating a tradition of magic--largely via footnotes--in England intertwined with the history of the country. I did some background checks to try and figure out who was real and who was fictional. Through their adventures Strange and Norrell encounter Sir Walter Scott, Lord Wellington, and Lord Byron to name but a few. At close to 800 pages with a very small font, this is a book you really have to commit to spending some time with. But, it is time well spent and the story and characters will stay with you for a long time. This has been called by more than one reviewer \\"Hogwarts (or H.P.) for adults\\". One reviewer commented that it fails because it does not have the clear delineation of good and evil present in H.P. or other fantasy literature. This I feel is one of the book's strengths: it overcomes one this simplistic weakness of good characters vs. bad characters seemingly inherent in much genre fiction . Like Le Carre's genre-busting novel _The Spy Who Came In From the Cold_, JS&MN paints the world (magical and otherwise) as a morally complex place where good and bad exist in the same people. This is just one aspect of the novel. There is so much more here. Currently at number three on the NYTBS list, this novel deserves all the critical and commercial success that has been poured upon it. I do not think it is too much to say that this novel will be read for years."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This novel has brilliant passages but is insufferable. The book weaves together three narrative strands: a magical fantasy that runs about 250 pages; a romantic ode to English Literature embedded within an English period piece, about 300 pages; and a detailed bedding of footnotes and fully fleshed back stories, which occupy the remainder of this 782 page colossus. The narrative is buried under the depredations of the artsy and self-indulgent writing of the first-time author.The overall story of the only two magicians in Napoleonic England is actually somewhat interesting, even amid the irritating and uneven weaving of these disparate narrative tracks. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell struggle to restore magic without understanding their power, the world of faery, and the moral challenges that power brings. The result should be a tragedy and a riveting tale.Instead, stylistic conceits get in the way of the story. As the book nears an end, and the reader wishes to engage with Jonathan Strange's struggles to fight an adversary and rescue his wife, we get strained homage to English Literature rather than story. We get Strange's letters, or the story shifts to the viewpoint of a Doctor, a latecomer to the long book. We get Lord Byron. In fact, we the reader get anything except direct narrative. It becomes clear that the author has learned a great many writing tricks from reading Jane Austen and others, and wishes to include each of these stylistic conceits somewhere in this one book.As a reader, the urge to stop reading is powerful, the lost narrative threads become more and more difficult to pick up, the story recedes behind the authorial over-writing, and the reader stops giving a damn about Norrell, Strange, wives, Byron, and even, incredibly, about magic. What starts as a must read and a possible work of fantastical art, dims into the tedious. A more incisive telling would be shorter, better, and more worthy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The pseudo-scholarly, pseudo-gossipy tone of the book is wonderfully captured in this description of Lord Byron, offered by magician Strange: \\"I found his lordship at his pretty villa upon the shores of the lake. He was not alone. There was another poet called Shelley, Mrs. Shelley and another young woman-a girl really-who called herself Mrs. Clairmont and whose relationship to the two men I did not understand. If you know, do not tell me. Also present was an odd young man who talked nonsense the entire time-a Mr. Polidori.\\"Almost 680 pages of the 780 odd page book proceeds in such a fashion: all is a leisurely tour through the Victorian world, rendered scholarly by carefully attributed (fictional) quotes and a plethora of content footnotes (also fake). The topic is magic, real magic, and the interactions of the title characters with the world of Faerie. Norrell and Strange have brought real magic back to England, pursuing spell-casting and casting aside the generations of \\"theoretical magicians,\\" who preceded them - men who never cast a magic spell but devoted themselves to scholarly debates over the attributes of past magicians and their works.One of Norrell's first spells, as a side effect, establishes contact with the world of Faerie and its reigning king, a creature who has a curious sense of morality and a very limited understanding of human desires and human behavior. After we have spent several hundred pages chuckling at this gentleman from the other world, including his amazing interaction with the insane King George III, it occurs to us that he is quite dangerous. He is not malicious, but his moral code is incompatible with our concern for human health, life and safety. The last hundred pages give us all the dramatic tension deliberately left out of the earlier pages, as Strange (and finally Norrell) must conduct a magic battle with this king, a battle for which they are, to be honest, rather ill-equipped.The plot, again, is merely a plot, a necessary element in the construction of a novel. The point is the satire: directed at scholarly habits and all who have ever deemed themselves scholars; directed at the Victorian world; directed, very likely, at modern witches. Susanna Clarke incorporates enough information on folklore and real Magic into her piece to convince me that she knows quite well who she is poking fun at-and to leave me wishing I knew exactly who might be her targets. She treats us all as she treats Byron and the unfortunate Mrs. Clairmont, and I, for one, found it great fun to be on the receiving end of her veiled barbs."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I would be pressed to add something new to what previous reviewers have put down, so I will summarize what has been mentioned: this is a wonderfully slow book without a single bad character (though the narrative was a little irritating with its profusion of \\"rathers\\"). The characters are the key to enjoyment. Their portraits become clearer and clearer until they are all lined up and presented in a dramatic and satisfying ending. You can't do without this one - It is truly a restoration of English Magic."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is a fine piece of literature by newcomer Susanna Clarke.It's difficult to break new ground in the tired genre of fantasy, where a comparison to Tolkien often seems more a marketing ploy to attract readership than a tribute to style or story. However, after reading the first couple of pages of Strange & Norrell, I was hooked. Nearly 800 pages later, when I closed the cover for the last time, I was gratified and satisfied.Immense in scope (10 years in the writing), the backdrop of Strange & Norrell is 19th century England, the story a sort of alternate reality in which two practical magicians (as opposed to those who only read about magic) endeavor to bring back magic to England. Not only is Clarke's style refreshing, her tale is original, and she relates it engagingly. The two title characters are rather stuffy Englishmen, but Clarke contrasts them nicely, and the reader will often root first for one and then the other as the plot unfolds, like a labyrinth filled with dead ends, traps, portcullises and a variety of surprises. All of the secondary and tertiary characters are colorful and, as in theatre where there are no small roles merely small actors, none are superficial to the story. Yet for all of Clarke's storytelling talent there was something that kept me from fully identifying with either of the protagonists. I never seemed fully able to immerse myself in the story; I seemed only able to watch events unfold from outside the confines of the tale. It is for this reason alone that I was unable to award five stars to Strange & Norrell.Although some readers may find Clarke's use of old English trying (shew instead of show, etc.), I found the technique lent a flavor of authenticity to her tale. Ms. Clarke's narrative is nearly flawless, teeming with evocative descriptions spanning from the macabre (the stone statue that several hundred years previously had witnessed the murder of a young girl and was suddenly gifted with the power of speech so that it might scream out its anguish is akin to something Poe might've written) to humorous, ranging from deadpan to hilarious. The description of an unshaven doughy-faced man - \\"He had shaved himself with no very high degree of skill and here and there on his white face two or three coarse black hairs appeared - rather as if a family of flies had drowned in the milk before the cheese was made and their legs were poking out of it\\" - had me chuckling, while several exchanges between Stephen and the gentlemen with the thistledown hair - \\"Burnt, sir! I hope no one was hurt!\\" \\"Well, some people were. The strong, young men were able to run out of the conflagration in time, but the older, enfeebled members of the family, the women and infants were all burnt to death\\" - had me laughing aloud.Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is a wonderful first novel, and Susanna Clarke is to be applauded. Oh yes, and comparisons to Tolkien and Rowling are unfounded - in the future perhaps it will be Susanna Clarke with whom many aspiring fantasy writers will be compared."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Lets make two things clear right away. This book does what it does brilliantly. What it does is not typical of genre fiction, and certainly not any sort of Harry potter-esque story.This is a story of characters, of in-depth quirky people interacting and plotting and joking and doing all the things that people who don't live in Middle Earth or go to Hogwarts actually do. This is a story of setting, fo an alternate Britain brilliantly realized. This is a story of magic, both the scholarly kind and a deeper, wild fey kind. It is a story of high society and all its foibles. It is a story of myth and history and how they interact. It is all of these things, and it is brilliant. Norrell and Strange are stunningly well realized, but so are the supporting characters, from cynical servant Childermass to the delightfully terrifying Gentleman with the Thistledown hair, to real history figures Duke of Wellington and lor Byron. The setting is fascinating, and the magic never fails to feel enchanting and mysterious. Points in this book made me laugh out loud, and others made me shiver with the sheer strangeness of it all.It is not a story driven by a plot. It is not a page turner. It is not action packed. You do not race from page to page, eager to unravel the mystery which will build to a grand showdown between good and evil. The last 100 pages are gripping, but almost entirely devoid of battle. There are plot twists and mysteries, but they do not drive the story, nor are they the main focus of most of the book.Thats what this is. if you buy this book expecting Harry Potter with bigger words, you will be disappointed. if you read the first chapter and think \\"this is boring, when does the action start\\", you will be disappointed.if, however, you take pleasure from characters and setting as brilliantly realized as they can possibly be, and don't mind 4 page interludes about a scholarly dispute over some magical occurence, you will love this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I'm still undecided. I loved the plot -A group of wannabee magicians finds someone who can actually cast spells - despite their beliefs that magic is long dead. Consequently, they can no longer even research magic as stipulated in the wager. After that the book meanders aimlessly for 500 pages...I didn't love this aspect quite as much...There is no reason that this book needed to be 750+ pages for the rather anti-climactic (but satisfying) ending. One wonders if she is taking a page from the Robert Jordan School of bad writing. (Which is good writing - just too many needless descriptions) Anyhow, I did find the footnotes quite a good concept. It was fun to read little blurbs about the etiology of a phrase or the background of a location. I guarantee this idea will appear in future fantasy works.A lot of people liked this book but I was fairly indifferent. When I read gargantuan tomes I expect them to be as good as G.R.R. Martin or even and Early R. Jordan. Otherwise aren't we just wasting paper?Relic113"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"If you approach this book thinking it will be an easy read, as in Rowling's excellent stories, you will be disappointed, as several of the reviewers here attest. However, if you enjoy reading novels similar in style to Dickens and Trollope, you will be enthralled by the detail, humor, and complex plot of this story. It is true that Clarke over uses footnotes, and sometimes I felt I was reading a treatise on the Napoleonic Wars; however, the footnotes also add to the details of the story and provide an in-depth look at the topics relevant to the story line, and the writing style Clarke uses duplicates the typical writing styles of 19th century England. Also, this book does not present the typical Tolkien motifs of sorcery, as in the 3 m's (myth, magic, medievalism) that many of us have become accustomed to in this genre. There is also not a blatant quest, as in Tolkien or Rowling's stories.If you want to read a detailed, rather slow moving, but invigorating story, I recommend this book. I would not recommend this book for young adults."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This was one of the most maddening books I've ever read. Clarke possesses some very real talent, often sucking me in for pages at a time. At times it read as a satire, but one that pays as much homage to the genre as it does snarky scorn. There are moments of exceptional wittiness and sheer brilliance. Unfortunately, there are also interludes to nowhere, stock characters drawn from failed early Corman-Nicholson collaborations, and pointless meandering. I want to like this book much more than I did and I'm a bit in awe, but ultimately, it felt like it was three times longer than it was. For me, the biggest failing was that in over 700 pages, we couldn't get the characters to get any further than two dimensions. They just weren't interesting enough to spend that much time with. The side bars, footnotes, even some of the meanderings were actually quite enjoyable. It's the central story and characters that utlimately didn't work for me.I give it one star for audicity, one star for percolating brilliance, and one star in recognition of the amazing research."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I was excited to get this book, since I have arthritis and reading the hard copy just doesn't work for me. But there are extensive footnotes, and those are not accessible on my Kindle Touch. (Yes, I did check with customer service about this, and other Kindles may be able to access them.) I have no idea how important those footnotes are to the story, since the hard copy is out for me. But at the very least it should be stated somewhere that Kindle Touch owners are buying an incomplete copy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Widely regarded as one of the best works of the modern fantasy canon, JONATHAN STRANGE AND MR. NORRELL was a book I've been meaning to read for a while. And while every one of these 1000 or so pages is evidence of literary brilliance, it wasn't something I was fully emotionally invested in. Still, though, I'm glad I finally read it.At the turn of the 19th century, it seems like no magic remains in England. But then a practicing magician named Mr. Norrell turns England upside-down when he performs the first bit of magic in England in several centuries, and immediately shoots his way up the social ladder. Norrell wants to use magic to do England good, but he's particular about how to regulate magic--which is why the sudden appearance of a second English magician, the charismatic Jonathan Strange, rocks Norrell to his core.Whereas Norrell's squirrelly looks and socially awkward demeanor are a disappointment as the face of magic, Strange's carriage and behavior earn him the goodwill of a fair number of Englishmen. Yet even as tensions between Norrell and Strange continue to develop, a long-simmering magic plot to take over England keeps threatening to come to light.Susanna Clarke takes the subgenre \\"Regency fantasy\\" to a whole new level with her superb command of that time period's language. Think Austen with a heavy dose of magical elements: not only was the language reminiscent of Regency England times, but Austen's almost insidious portrayal of ridiculous people had a heavy showing in JONATHAN STRANGE AND MR. NORRELL. While Strange and Norrell are arguably the main characters of the eponymous novel, we readers don't really LIKE them the way we usually do protagonists, because most of them are not good people: Norrell in particular manipulate nearly everyone out of fear of a loss of influence, meanwhile letting his even-less-appealing \\"friends\\" manipulate him in turn. All the unsavory characters in the book make Jonathan Strange look very good indeed, but he's no real \\"wounded hero,\\" just another self-centered guy who does not give enough consideration to others in his life.That, I guess, is what ultimately disappointed me about this book: it doesn't break any conventions or tread new ground in terms of genre or sociohistorical issues. Clarke crafts an alternate, magician-focused history for England, but, with the exception of head-scratchingly long footnotes showing just how in-depth Clarke has got with her alternate history creativity, JONATHAN STRANGE AND MR. NORRELL didn't blow me out of the water with originality in its fantasy genre.Additionally--and this may just be me--I found it a bit off-putting how small a role women played in the novel. For a book written by a female author, I had expected a bit more subversion of historical attitudes toward the role of males vs. females in society; yes, the book doesn't attempt to focus on the inequality and tensions between different parties, but I was surprised that the book didn't take such a step with potentially strong and interesting female characters such as Arabella Strange and Mrs. Pole. No, at the end of the day, things and people seemed to be pretty much what they had been before the book started, which results in reader's confusion along the lines of, \\"I just spent three weeks reading 1000 pages...and did anything significant really happen?\\" Hrmph.So, in some ways, reading JONATHAN STRANGE AND MR. NORRELL was for me like reading a classic that the \\"great authorities of literature\\" say is a must-read but on a personal level was a slog to get through. While I certainly appreciated Clarke's Austenian writing style, I closed the book realizing that 500 pages could've been cut out and I would have thought nothing was amiss."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is a story of two wizards, lets call them Steve Jobs and Mr Gates, who take completely different points of view on the venerable discipline of computing -- or as the author refers to it quaintly: magic.At first, Mr Gates is all about building an empire with himself at the center. He runs around the country buying up all of the intellectual property and shutting down all potential competitors.Then along comes this upstart Steve, with a completely different and open perspective. Steve thinks that everyone should be able to own their own magical devices and practice magical applications in their homes. Steve's style of magic is irreverent and yet, approachable. Mr Gates says that Steve is up to no good. As the author sums it up, Mr Gates is the fearful one and Steve is the arrogant one.Most of the book deals with these two wizards and their evolving relationship from competitors to colleagues; and also the effects that their quarrels have on their environment. Hard drives are reformatted, core memories are infected with viruses, and more and more elaborate firewalls are erected. Meanwhile the two heroes debate the efficacy of VonNeumann's merge-sort algorithm against the Comb sort designed by Wlodzimierz Dobosiewicz.Unfortunately the book never really develops into a conflict strong enough to engage the reader in its resolution. There should have been a major magical battle, but the author completely fails to realize the opportunity. The villain of the story is an Anonymous uber-hacker who wears a Guy Fawkes mask, and basically steals and murders his way through the story without ever drawing the attention of either of the Most Powerful Magicians of their time. Alas."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It had me hooked from the very beginning but as I went on in the book I found some characters and chapters completely useless to the main plot of the novel.

I own both the hardcover and unabridged audio versions of this book, and I'm happy to say that they complement each other quite well. I hear Simon Pebbles doing a BRILLIANT job of articulating the voices of the dozens of characters, and when I get a tad lost in the plot threads, I can refer to the text. This is a book to own, to read every year, like THE LORD OF THE RINGS, to savor.....and, actually, I think the historical background and daily social lives of the early nineteenth century ARE detailed enough to make it qualify as \\"historical fiction.\\" It is a wonderfully elaborate world Ms. Clarke has articulated, and I'm beside myself with joy for having discovered it for myself."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is not a book you are going to be able to knock off in a weekend. It starts off slowly (we do not get to either of the title characters for quite a while), and it takes a while to get adjusted to the quasi-textbook style of writing. However, I would heartily recommend all readers to persevere, for when all is said and done, \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" is a remarkable novel. Many reviewers have compared it favorably to Tolkien, and appropriately so, as the book creates a complex, detailed world inhabited by magical creatures. It is the depth of characterization and setting that makes Clarke's book so special; you finish reading this book half-convinced that the magical England she describes either did exist, or should. Clarke does not let an opportunity to digress slip by without being taken advantage of; the numerous footnotes (tedious to some, but heartily enjoyed by me) contain entire fables that could stand on their own as solid short stories. The impressive length of the book allows Clarke to flesh out fully even allegedly \\"minor\\" characters, and the subplot involving the hilarious efforts of the gentleman with the thistle-down hair (whose name we never discover in the 800 pages of the book) to make Stephen, a Black servant, the new King of England--much to Stephen's dismay--could stand as a worthy novel on its own.The only criticism I have of the book is that the occasional archaic spellings (e.g., \\"chuse\\" for \\"choose\\" and \\"shew\\" for \\"show\\") seemed grating and overly self-conscious. Clarke's beautifully precise syntax and phrasing are sufficient in themselves to convey the atmosphere of 19th century England, and given that she (wisely) did not choose to adopt archaic spellings consistently, the few examples she did come across as being arbitrary and somewhat pretentious.Bottom line: This is not a book that grabs you from the opening pages. If you read primarily fluffy page-turners like \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" or Grisham novels, you may not have the patience to immerse yourself in the tremendously appealing and complex land and characters that Clarke has created. But you should try, because the journey is worth the effort."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I really did want to like this book. I enjoy fantasy books and don't shy away from a long book (this one is 782 pages). Though there were some fun, imaginative parts to this book I found it much too long for what it delivered.An often-mentioned character for whom the last third of the book is named, The Raven King, appears on only about 3-4 pages in the entire book. After I understood the aspirations and human faults of the two main characters I began getting excited about the coming of the Raven King, but his appearance is brief and his character woefully ndeveloped. It was the Raven King, rather than those who populated the pages of this book, that I longed to learn more about. In a sense, the book was an appetizer...and the entree never arrived! In the end I wound up feeling manipulated. This is the author's first book, and I couldn't help feeling that I just spent money, and time, indulging in what ammounted to a marketing campaign for what is bound to become a series."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The gist of the story can be gleaned from the bookjacket, the wonder of the book cannot. Ms. Clarke has created a new world for us to enjoy if we only take the time.But, don't read this expecting Harry Potter, it is not, but it is just as good. Don't expect Jane Austen, yes, it has the flavor of the period, but, again, it is not, but it is just as good.To properly savor this book, allow the time. I once rushed through a book of this size in two nights, but this one needs more care. I took eight days to read Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell and that, even, was too fast.So....read slowly, and savor the words of this world. Take your time with the footnotes; while they are not required, they make the book ever so much better. And, if you find from time to time, as did I, that the book suddenly seems a bit tedious, make a cup of tea. Then, come back and read ten more pages, and you will once again be entranced.I work in a library, and I would recommend this book to almost every reader I know.I recommend this to any reader who will take the time to enjoy this world. This is an entrancing book. I hope you will read and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The story is gripping, of mythical scope and beautifully written - I cannot recommend it strongly enough.Mr Strange and Mr Norrell, the eponymous (anti?)heroes are the two great magicians of their age (the early 1800s). They are drawn together by common-talent, but driven apart by differing aims and personalities into a fearsome rivalry. Norrell is self-serving, vain and insecure; Strange is bold charismatic and iconoclastic. The book is set in an alternative version of the past, peopled with figures like Wellington, the wars in Spain and other late Georgian-era facts in a very heady and convincing mix. Through the actions of the two magicians England and the Kingdom of Faerie are brought into violent conflict. If this all sounds very fantasy and like a children's book - it's not. The writing is sophisticated, gritty and humorous. The characters are visceral and the tension and drama of the story masterfully handled. It is an immensely well-crafted book that heralds the arrival of a very original and imaginative literary writer. Just wonderful!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I was very anxious to read this book that I had heard was meant to be oddly fascinating and curious and intelligent...however, although the author is obviously quite keen on discourse and perhaps history and tries for an interesting yarn, this story lacks any real aspect of great storytelling. I found myself pushing and pushing myself through the book at all stages. It is very much a long-winded work and, once you're half way through, you know you're INVESTED so heavily that you are unable to drop it before reaching the glory of the story ending. But when the outcome is sadly lacking, you'll find yourself suffering great pangs of remorse for having wasted your precious time. I think what happened here is that the author had a great first draft on her hands but the thing was so bloody long she couldn't bear to take a crack at re-writing it to make it great."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a novel of England during Napoleonic Wars in an alternate universe where magic, though not common anymore, has previously been a regular part of life. Magic historians still flourish, but practicing magicians had not been seen for hundreds of years until Mr. Norrell demonstrates his ability.Mr. Norrell feels his job is to bring practical magic back to England, but only by himself-he has sought out and crushed the attempts of any other magician in England. Things continue on in this way, with Mr. Norrell as London's favorite novelty and the Government's chief war weapon, until Jonathan Strange arrives on the scene showing that he, too, can practice magic. To everyone's surprise, Mr. Norrell takes him as his pupil.The rest of the novel is too complex to explain, but involves fairies, war, rivalries, madness and, of course, magic, as Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell unknowingly fulfill a prophecy and bring practical magic back to England.The best part about this book is the mythology that Ms. Clarke has created. There are footnotes that relate to books and magicians and history that make up this alternate universe. This was an excellent addition and I applaud Ms. Clarke for this background work.The style of the novel, however, is it's downfall. Ms. Clarke has written it in the language and style of a 19th century novel, which (while delightful to one like me who enjoys Austen and Radcliff and the like) can make it very hard going. I actually started reading it two times before I succeeding in getting past the first few chapters. As it is such a slow read, I was apt to set it down and forget about it for days.While actually reading it, though, I was fascinated. The story is very deep and intricate; it is obvious that Ms. Clarke has put tremendous effort in its crafting. Despite my enjoyment of it, though, my dissatisfaction with the ending and it's general slowness makes me rate it lower than it probably deserves. I certainly can not give it a universal referral and am surprised that so many people have managed to read and review it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I've spent several days listening to the unabridged audio version of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norell. Initially, I was delighted by the world described in this novel: a cool pre-Victorian world where magic is the province of scholarly magicians and where fairies and humans co-exist. I liked the Eccentric Mr. Norell and the young upstart, Jon Strange. But over time, I grew bored with the contrived conflict between the magicians, the endless tedious footnotes and the snarkiness of Norell vs. Strange, neither of whom I ended up liking by the end of the book. (These two male leads remind me of a couple of immature schoolboys rather than the adults they were supposed to be).While I stuck it through to the end to find out what happened in the Norrel vs. Strange conflict, I found the ending to anticlimactic and not very satisfying. Overall, I would've liked this novel more if I had been able to empathize with Strange and Norell.3 Stars for an average read which could've been better if I'd actually LIKED Norrel and Strange."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The plot: Mr Norrell is fixated on getting a monopoly on magic. His goal is to convince others not to study magic, in case they actually learn to do magic, and to buy up all books about magic so that he is the only magician around. Oh yes and he is a real magician. Jonathan Strange is an aimless bachelor who takes up magic to impress a girl. Jonathan has a natural aptitude for magic, while Mr Norrell is very rational and bookish even though he is a very powerful wizard. Their paths cross when Mr Norrell agrees to tutor Jonathan. But remember, Mr Norrell is dedicated to being top dog. Obviously he will take Jonathan down a notch when the time comes.Much much more happens all through the story - hence the long long reviews here. Subplots run in and out of the world of fairy and through military politics in England. It is easy to follow as you read but a lot happens.This is a bestseller that someone might care to read in a few years - in other words it is well written and entertaining not just coincidentally the next big thing.. I recommend reading this and think that it would appeal to almost anyone. Almost any chapter can stand alone as a separate short story. If you want to be cautious then read the first chapter to get a taste of the book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Thhe story of two magicians easily transports the most skeptical reader into the misty world of English magic in all its mystery, glory, trickery, and power. Clarke returns magic so seamlessly back into English life, weaving into historical narratives with such ease, that it is impossible not to believe. The book is filled with tension which reaches incredible levels towards the end. Sometimes your suspicions are correct but sometimes Clarke takes an unexpected turn, only to turn back and keep you guessing at the final outcome...which should have been inevitable but gets forgotten in the excitement. The style of writing, and useful footnotes, construct a magical but not suffocatingly detailed world. This book is thriller, mystery, fantasy, adult Harry Potter, Dickens, and Austen all rolled into one."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"An interesting read! (mostly)This in not your everyday fantasy adventure. In fact, those of you expecting something akin to George Martin's \\"Ice and Fire\\" series or Steven Erikson's \\"Malazan Book of the Fallen\\" novels will probably be disappointed. This is a fictional story dealing with the reemergence of magic (after centuries of absence) in England of the early 1800s. The first part of this novel is ponderously slow in its development, but if you persevere you will be rewarded with a thrilling tale and an excellent ending.Well written, great character development, an intriguing plot and a superb ending make this book a definite winner. However Clarke's greatest writing asset is her use of descriptive prose: i.e. to convey the subtle textures of a landscape; to chill us with the eeriness of a dusky, poorly lit room etc. She has the ability to transport the reader to the place she is describing, and to me, this is the writing quality that separates the great writers from the merely good.All in all, the book is so well written that, when I look back, I can forgive the rather tedious pace of the first third of the book; in fact, in retrospect, the slow plot development seemed to mesh perfectly with the era of England portrayed in this novel. There was a slower pace of life, a quiet civility with an air of standoffishness that separated the \\"gentile\\" class from the lowly servants and working class of the time, and all this added to the realism of the over story. Recommended! 4 1/2 stars"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This jet black tome has been hanging around the place a fair while; a friend of ours lent me it about a year ago but despite Amazon's best efforts to convince me that it would be right up my alley given my predilection for Terry Pratchett, Joss Whedon and Jasper Fforde, I never got round to starting it. Only when I ran out of reading material in English did I embark on the intimidating 800 odd pages. And then I never looked back.Set in the early 19th Century, it's about the return of magic to England after a long absence. This magic is wrought by the two central characters, Norrell- a fussy, bookish egotist and his relatively normal apprentice, Jonathon Strange. The book starts with gentlemen questioning a world where we can only read about theoretical magic, where \`magicians' can study spells but are unable to perform any. Practical magician Norrell soon steps in and performs some impressive feats. Shortly after, Strange becomes his adept apprentice and before long both titular mages are in the government's employ helping the English battle Napoleon's armies and gaining ever greater powers. That would be an entertaining enough plot, but JS & Mr N also contains elements of history, mystery and social comedy.I hold that it would be quite remiss not to mention the narrative style and period detail shewed to the reader. Indeed, this is probably the closest I will ever come to reading Jane Austen. One word is never used when ten will do and if there's an archaic irregular verb then it is boldly inserted. I often stopt to reread a sentence that contained words I'd mentally underlined in wavy red pen; However there's no denying that it adds to the Georgian atmosphere and sense of otherworldliness.I read aloud the first couple of chapters to Sita and she could not be doing with it all. Judging by other critiques of the book, it's not to everyone's taste. To enjoy this book you have to be willing to suspend your disbelief, enjoy tales of magic and care about people who do, frankly, sound incredibly pompous and English. Still that's not too hard to get over, surely? The multiple plot threads will keep you spellbound and I personally can't wait to hear about their further adventures."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"To be honest, it took me forever to finish \\"Jonathan Strange...\\" At the same time that I enjoyed reading it, I found myself putting it down for weeks at a time. The book is so dense in its ideas and characterizations that a little simply went a long way. Don't get me wrong: I found Clarke's writing superb and her imagination on par with J.K. Rowling's (and for me that's saying a lot); but I kept losing patience with the book as a whole. It went on and on and didn't seem to be going anywhere. Finally, having read the last half on an extended vacation, I have to say that this is, all things considered, an extraordinary novel. All great works of literature introduce us to characters we come to care a great deal about, characters who transcend the page and become as real to us as ourselves; and they make us either see our own world in new ways or introduce us to worlds we couldn't possibly imagine. \\"Jonathan Strange...\\" works remarkably well on all counts. Norell, Strange, Childermass et al. are all beautifully realized characters, and the world Clarke has them inhabit is both familiar and extraordinarily, delightfully new. As long as you don't let the length of the book deter you, and you can give in to the richness of its wonders, you'll be in for a helluva ride. Trust me -- and Clarke: all the disparate, seemingly unrelated strands come together in the poignant, bittersweet finale."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Susanna Clarke dazzles in a subtle way in her debut novel, \\"Jonathan Clarke & Mr. Norrell,\\" a startlingly original fantasy. No Dungeons & Dragons or Tolkien ripoffs here. Instead, a well-written, intelligent historical fantasy, which reportedly took Clarke a decade to write. With a story this rich, it was worth the wait.It's the early 19th century, in England. The Napoleanic wars threaten England, but that's not the only struggle going on. Magic is all but dead in England; the so-called magicians don't actually want to handle it, but want to leave it to old books and stories. Once the English magicians were powerful and respected, but now they just write boring essays about magic. Except for Mr. Norrell, a cautious little Yorkshire man who taught himself how to do magic.However, things take a twist when he gives his help in the battle against Napolean -- a new magician enters the scene, the enthusiastic and charming Jonathan Strange. The two magicians begin to work together, but things begin to go awry when Mr. Norrell realizes that Jonathan is attracted to all magic -- including the more dangerous varieties. He's increasingly fascinated by the legend of the Raven King, a changeling child who ruled Faerie and Earth...Historical fantasies have rarely been as detailed and rich as this one -- usually either the \\"historic\\" or the \\"fantasy\\" is abused. Often the best authors can do is write alternate universe stories where America lost the Revolution, the Roman Empire never fell, and so on. But Susanna Clarke shatters that with her richly-realized look at 19th-century Britain, with unique magic and a slight mythologic twist.Clarke keeps her writing solid, detailed and dignified, also footnoting extensively, with little wry winks and nudges to keep the book from being too serious. It does get tedious at times, and the finale gets a bit stretched out, but the positive far outweighs the negative. She has a flair for the historical parts of the book, keeping dates, battles, and political movement entwined in the plot. But she doesn't neglect the fantasy either; there's a mythic flavor in the story of the Raven King and the old magicians, reminiscent of old legends from ancient times. Her handling of magic is especially good -- less is more, and hints of past greatness make the magic all the more stunning.The title characters are the best of the book -- both are products of their times. Mr. Norrell is cautious, studious, ingenious and quiet, the sort of person you could imagine having a talk with Ben Franklin. Strange has more of the wild, society-be-damned wit that characterized some great artists of that time. And Norrell's faithful servant is just one of many solid supporting characters.If Jane Austen had written like Diana Wynne-Jones, the result would have been something like \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.\\" Well-written, enticing and thoroughly original, this is a keeper."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is quite possibly one of the best books I have read. I was a little disappointed by the ending, but the many pages it took to get to that point were absolutely delightful and well worth it. Clarke weaves mystery, adventure, humour, romance, suspense, and magic together in a most superior way. I found myself rereading many passages in awe of her writing style. I highly recommend anyone read this book, as there is something in it for lovers of all genres. Once you start Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, you will not be satisfied until you have reached the very end."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It took me weeks to listen to all 26 discs, but every moment was delicious! It probably helped that I had read about 1/3 of the book before having to return it to a friend. The footnotes--delightful gems that they are--do interrupt the narrative flow, so I imagine it might be difficult for the first-time listener to take it all in. It requires concentration to take in the wonderful details and to appreciate Simon Prebble's masterly reading.At times I of despaired of finishing, but now that it's over, I'm ready to start over from the beginning. Its depth, complexity, and imagination remind me of the intense pleasure I get from reading \\"War and Peace,\\" \\"Bleak House,\\" or any novel of Jane Austen's.Don't bother with this book unless you are prepared to give yourself to it entirely while you are reading or listening. But if you do, you will enjoy it \\"more than anything in the world.\\""},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I quite agree with other reviews : this book should not be picked up if you want fast-paced, non-stop action. Ditto if you are looking for the second coming of Harry Potter. This book is a whole different story. I loved the descriptions, the long character developments, the use of old English and the not-so-clear bad versus good war.It is a long book. I read it in a week and a half which, for me anyway, is a long time to read any novel. But I did enjoy every moment, actually slowing to reread some paragraphs. It's not a \\"on the edge of your seat\\" kind of book but you do want to know what is coming around the corner. I also enjoyed the other characters, other then Mr Norrell & Mr Strange. It's rare in books that you want to know what happens to other, lesser charcaters just as much, if not more so, as you do the main ones.As a first novel, this is hard to beat. As a novel, the research involved must have been incredible! Hats off to Ms Clarke!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"\\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" offers a fresh look at magic and sorcery, elevating the dark arts from the margins and placing them front and center. This bold scheme pays off for author Susanna Clarke, allowing her plenty of room to blend history and fiction in a manner that is convincing and entertaining. Anchored by many, many pithy footnotes, the book's version of the history of English magic become believable and compelling, much live H.P. Lovecraft's Miskatonic University and environs begin to take on a life of their own.The characters at the heart of the book, Mr. Norrell, a bookish, boorish loner, and Jonathan Strange, a brooding, brilliant romantic, are opposites bound together by their singular skills at wielding and interpreting magic. A host of supporting characters, some historical transplants and other fictional archetypes, populate the sprawling tale and numerous subplots. Indeed, two of these, John Childermass and Stephen Black are the most vital, engaging characters in the novel, and arguably they upstage the main characters much like Flay and Swelter do for a time in the first two Gormenghast novels. Could one or both take center stage in an encore?Ms. Clarke chooses her words carefully, employing her poetic license fully in using a hybrid dialect to add another level of verisimilitude to the story. Admittedly, sometimes this literary device is a bit grating, but anyone who makes it past the first few chapters likely won't mind.I have one point of contention, not with Ms. Clarke, per se, but with reviewers and critics who mistakenly categorize this novel as fantasy. It's not. The fantasy novel has a distinct set of characteristics, and other than magic being an everyday sort of occurrence, \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" has little in common with the initial forays into fantasy by William Morris or the form's finest expression in Professor J.R.R. Tolkien's works."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I just finished reading \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell,\\" which is a huge doorstop of a book. Sporting a black cover and numbering more than 700 pages, it looks awfully forbidding, especially to someone who doesn't relish the idea of taking weeks to read a book.My advice: do it. There hasn't been a book since last year's \\"Pattern Recognition\\" By William Gibson that has been so totally absorbing for me. Author Susanna Clarke creates an entire world in those 700-some pages. And like all great fantasy writers, her magical world follows rules of its own that are oddly similar to, but not quite the same as, those of our real one. Or is her world the real one? By the time you finish reading, you might begin to wonder.As one who spend a week and a half inhabiting the universe of magicians Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, I was simply swept away by the exhilarting language, the lovingly created characters and the deliberately old-fashioned spellings. The book is designed to look as if it has been published in the early 19th century, and it's written with an omnisicient narrator who, curiously, seems like a character on his/her own. There even are a few instances in which the narrator says \\"I did such and such,\\" but we never find out who \\"I\\" is. The style, although touted as similar to Jane Austen in the jacket blurbs, is more like Thackeray with its wry humor and tongue-in-cheek view of English society.But it's the main characters who command the attention, and you are unlikely to meet figures who are as fascinating as the two magicians, Strange and Norell. And when I say magicians, I'm not speaking of the pull-the-rabbit-out-of the-hat variety. These are the real deals: magicians who can turn the rain into a vision of a British ship of the line or transport whole towns at will. Crazy? Maybe so, but you have to willingly submit to Clarke's logic for the drama to unfold. In this world, magic is real.The plot turns on an odd falling out between the two magicians and the mysterious disappearance of Strange's beloved wife, Arabella. There are tangles with fairies, trips to enchanted netherworlds, and a prolonged section in Venice, in which Strange flirts with madness to have his wife returned to him.It's all beautifully crafted, right down to the fake footnotes referencing phony books. The result is a book that almost makes you believe that the Duke of Wellington employed a magician to help him win the Napoleonic Wars.\\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" is a beautiful trip to a world the reader is sorry to leave, Much in the tradition of J.R.R. Tolkien and Neil Gaiman, this book just vibrates with a life of its own."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I don't think I can add much more to what has already been noted by other reviewers for this book (there are so many reviews), but I did want to add another 5-star rating to its credit.This isn't a \\"hold on to the seat of your pants\\" kind of book, but is instead a very intelligent and thoughtful novel that focuses on an imaginative, inventive, and magical alter-England. It does require patience to read because of the sheer enormity of the novel, but the rich descriptions and characters build up the story in well-developed layers, making it a sincere pleasure to read.I sincerely hope that Ms. Clarke continues to explore her writing potential--because with this as her first offering, I can't wait to see what else she has to offer in future!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The book really grabbed me at the beginning. I was intrigued and quite excited about where it was headed. And then after the magic of the stones that spoke, I got entangled in the mire that is this book. I kept reading hoping that it would pick up or get exciting. After slugging through most of it, the ending got a bit exciting but not by much. I think it could've been a fantastic story if Clarke would have hired an editor with any common sense that cut it down to 200-300 pages."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I loved this book. It takes its time in the beginning - it was something like 200 pages before the second title character is honestly introduced, and about that long before I began truly to care about any of the characters or the story. No one I recommended this book to got through the beginning. Yes, it's slow. Yes, the language is (I assume deliberately) old-fashioned, perhaps somewhat difficult. Yes, there are voluminous footnotes that don't relate directly to the story. I happened to enjoy the footnotes -- although they don't add much to the story, they add enormous depth to the world. Think of the first section of the book as establishing the world -- it takes a little while longer for Clarke to establish the characters and plot. But establish them she does, and if you ask me, awfully damned well. I read a lot of fantasy, I love the magic and alternate worlds, but for me, at least, I don't see a whole lot of fantasy that has truly well-done, deep characters. This one does. The plot is similarly deep and compelling, once it gets going. The book is long and, at times, slow, but stick with it and for me, at least, it was more than worth it. Truly one of my all-time favorites."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Picture an England during the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century, very much like the historical England, recognizable in many ways to readers familiar with the period, except that this England has a magical past, a distant connection to medieval English magic which has dissipated and diminished for hundreds of years but is now starting to come alive again. This is the setting of Susanna Clarke's wonderful book, which conjures up a familiar alternate England which becomes progressively more strange and fascinating as the story unfolds.The seminal figure of English magic was The Raven King, a mysterious figure who emerged fully formed in the 12th century, a human child raised in Faerie, to become the ruler of the entire north of England for the next three centuries with his capital in Newcastle, and additional demesnes in Faerie and on the far side of Hell. The last of the golden age magicians, Dr. Martin Pale, was nearly contemporaneous, and upon his death the decline of English magic became manifest until our story opens in the early 1800s, when the self-taught bookworm Gilbert Norrell emerges in Yorkshire as England's first practical magician in nearly 300 years.Like J.K. Rowling, to whom her work has been compared, Clarke is adept at plotting and characterization. Clarke has said that her favorite character is Childermass, Norrell's loyal and highly competent servant; my favorite characters are the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair (a powerful, volatile and amoral Otherlander) and Stephen Black, an admirable person who reminds me of a personal friend with a similar name. My favorite plot device is the hidden and indescribable double life of Lady Pole, which is as frightening as anything in Robert W. Chambers. Please believe that I have said nothing that will ruin the experience: you will enjoy this book. ***"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is one of the most unusual books I've ever read! Difficult to categorize, I've seen it referred to as 'fantasy', 'alternative history', and a 'grown-up Harry Potter'. It's all of these, but none of those descriptives quite capture it. Set in 18th-century England during the Napoleonic wars, this long, meandering tale gives a lot of exquisite detail without ever really going anywhere specific, opening with with a gathering of dusty, stodgy theoretical magicians who are prodded into wondering what ever happened to good old English magick and those who actually practiced it. On that note they find Gilbert Norrell, a practicing magician who has no desire - at first - to share his knowledge with others. He's soon convinced that it would be in England's best interests to bring magick back, and where better to start than with influencing the war with Napoleon? Many reviews I've read tend to give the impression that the whole book is about this, but that's very misleading. It's not, at all.Soon after Norrell begins to meet with England's government about the different (and amusing) strategies to thwart Napoleon's army, he's approached by the young and eager Jonathan Strange, whom he agrees to take in as his student, although he tends to frustrate Strange beyond endurance by concealing as much as he reveals, even going so far as to ship half of his rare books of magick to a secret location so Strange can't read them! Even so the two enjoy a prosperous and famous partnership, until their one primary point of disagreement - the relevance and history of England's \\"father\\" of magick, John Uskglass (a.k.a. The Raven King) - finally comes between them in an irreconcilable way and they become bitter enemies.The couple of people I've discussed this book with say it held their interest at first, but then petered out. It was the opposite for me. I found it a little tedious at first, but stayed with it because I absolutely love the very wry, faux-proper writing style that only English writers can pull off really well, and the more I read, the more entertained I was. My one complaint is probably the same as others have had - nothing ever really happens. There's no big climax, per se. At the same time, this obvious drift from formula is compelling in its own way, and once I stopped waiting for the big build-up and the clincher and just settled back to enjoy it for what it was, I really got into it. At 800+ pages it's a long tale, probably unnecessarily so, but I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Reading not for the faint-of-heart, only due to the lengths at which Susanna Clarke goes to create the historical accuracy and feel for her book. It's long, don't get me wrong, and it feels as though the first several hundred pages are nothing more than character development, but once you allow yourself to be absorbed into the story and become part of it, you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"In the world of fiction today there are two notable types of writing style. Neither one lesser than the other: The Stacatto, a fast and furious read. Think of Koonz, Brown, Grisham. A perfected modern craft in line with readers modern appetite. J Strange...is not of this ilk. A modern throwback to detailed prosaic writing...but in a modern tone.J Joyce this is not. But embodies a modern style that is simply rich beyond expectations. I for one have to applaud Ms. Clarke for her superb attention to detail and a very well crafted story. The story is simply wonderful and I like to think of it as Harry Potter for adults.Reader, this is not a quick stacatto. We are trained for blasting through texts in our ultra expedient lifestyle. But please, do youself a favor and absorb the diligent world Ms. Clarke has crafted.

Thumbs-up."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Susannah Clarke has achieved a triumph with this book. Being a person who loves to read just about all things British, especially Tolkien and Beowulf, I was interested in this book because it looked like a new sort of fantasy from the land of the best fantasy writers. Well, it proved to be worth the 20 bucks I spent on it. It is a remarkable cross between the satire of Dickens and Austen and the mythology created by Tolkien and Beowulf. The incorporation of historical characters such as Napoleon, Byron, and the Duke of Wellington enrich an already loaded story with humorous depictions of most of the higher class of Britain. I just hope we'll soon have a sequel that reveals more about John Uskglass and who he truly was. Keep writing, Susannah.

It's not a page-turner or a fast book, but the writing and atmosphere were so wonderful that it was hard to settle with reading anything else when finished since other books seemed clunkily-done in comparison. It could have been longer and I would have happily kept reading, I hope she writes another."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I received this book as a gift from my mother-on-law for Christmas. I had never heard of it and had no expectations of it, and so I was very pleasantly surprised when I ended up loving it!If you want plot-plot-plot, action-action-action, this is not the book for you. It really is a lot like a Jane Austen book except that many of the characters do magic. The narrative meanders quite a bit and the footnote side trips were probably my favorite parts.I enjoyed the fact that it was quite long, so I didn't have to rush to the end to 'find out what happens.' The ending is a bit dissatisfying, but is a good fit for the book. I loved it, but I can see that it may not appeal to the tastes of many who like fantasy fiction."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Let me start by saying that I knew nothing about this book, except that it had been nominated for a Hugo, and that a friend recommended it. It had no hype to live up to.It started out well: I like fantasy that takes place outside of the standard elf-infested tract worlds. And after just a few footnotes, it became clear that Clarke had done an insane amount of work on the background. She probably has in her notes a complete history of English magic from 1100 to the present. This is comparable to Tolkien, who created an entire world just to tell the story of the Lord of the Rings.But for some reason, none of this magic seems to have made much of a difference: there are folk tales told about fairies and the Raven King, and an obscure section of law dealing with magic, but that's it. Norrell and Strange, the eponymous wizards, are said to be mere shadows of the great wizards of old. Even so, Strange can move mountains and rivers, and even transports the city of Brussels from Belgium to America.So why is the history in this novel nearly identical to the one in our world? Why didn't some wizard of old transport Paris or Brest to the middle of the Atlantic during one of the innumerable wars between England and France? For that matter, why are there no French (or Spanish, or German, etc.) magicians?This could easily be overlooked if the characters or story were interesting, but that's not the case. Most of the characters are either unsympathetic or worse, boring. There might be an interesting story in here, but it's lost in lots and lots of padding. There is usually a stage at the beginning of a novel where the action doesn't advance very quickly because the author is setting the stage, presenting the characters, and introducing plot elements that will become important later on. We don't mind that it's slow, because it promises that if the setup is done properly, the main story will be the better for it. Unfortunately, JS & Mr. N never delivers on that promise.After 500 pages, I gave up from lack of interest. And oddly enough, I haven't flipped to the back to see how it ends, because there are no lingering questions. No \\"does he kill the villain?\\", no \\"who does the heroine go off with?\\", no \\"how do they manage to save the world?\\" After 500 pages of introduction, Clarke still hasn't managed to introduce the central element of conflict that can drive the plot.If some kindly editor takes a red pencil to this novel and cuts it to half its length, it might be worth reading. But if you think a novel should include a story, don't bother."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I know I've read a good book, when I turn the last page and say \\"wow, that was good!\\". That didn't happen for me with this book. It wasn't a page-turner for me. For me, it was a lack of excitement and adventure in the book. If you find war exciting, then maybe you'll like this book, because that's where most of the book \\"moves.\\" Otherwise, I found it very slow-paced. There are some moments in the book where there's some mystery and excitement, but they don't last for long.I wouldn't recommend buying the book, but if you've nothing great to read this would be okay if you needed something to read and you could borrow it from someone or the library."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I normally shy away from the bestseller list as most of what's on it is rather plebian.

Talk about your formulas for success.As if premise isn't enough, the author has taken writing to an entire new level. His portraits of the characters are three, four, and five deminisional.

The author obviously has a wonderful imagination, and it's an impressive ambitious story. Overall the book is a worthwhile read, but be prepared for large chunks of tedium that could easily have been pared down without taking from the storyline."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Be patient the first 150 pages. Those pages are necessary to set the book. Do not skip the footnotes. They are stories within a story, quite enjoyable. I enjoyed reading and listening the cd."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I concur with most reviewers that Susanna Clarke's debut alt-history novel is ingenious and witty, fantastical and humorous. Imagine if Lewis Carrol, Oscar Wilde, and JK Rowling had all written a novel together--that about sums up Jonathan Strange"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"When I was a kid my favorite books my parents read to me were always by Roald Dahl. There was something dark and unsettling in the books, and the worlds these stories took place in seemed so real that you might accidentally fall into them yourself if you awoke during the witching hour.Ive always been interested to find more books that could match this atmosphere, but everything fell short in the end. Then this book came along and it really has captured all of my hopes and more. The characters are complex, their voices are real, the history of this world is rich - I only wish I could see for myself Norrel's library and read some of those books myself.Some minor bothers - I found four typos, and why did the Darkness spell remain after the faeries death, and who was that man Strange saw on the King's Roads? And I thought some of the magic was too easy - you shouldn't be able to move cities with such little effort. But Mrs. Clarke has proven herself to be a well-read theoretical magician so I think I will just take her word for it.As the pages go by the only worry is that this story cannot possibly resolve everything. And of course it doesn't. But it does tie together well, and succeeds in telling an important chapter in these two magician's life. But now I am left without any more to read to find out what happened before and after this story. She said that her next book will take place in the same universe, and I might wish that this book take less than 10 years to write, but then it might not have contained every thing that made this one the best book I have ever read.Thankfully I didn't have to outbid Childermass when purchasing this book. And luckily I was able to finish it before Norrel tried to make it disappear."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I bought this book due to the fantastic articles written in the New York Times Book Review, Entertainment Weekly, etc. While this book has incredible detail and constructs an elaborate world, I had to force myself to stay with the plot and continue reading.As a former graduate student, I am used to books that are intricate, scholarly and somewhat dry. Around 500 pages in, however, I gave up on this one. Perhaps, I might return someday to find out what happens. But at the moment, I prefer to spend my time reading something more engaging."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"recommend doing. The reader, Simon Prebble, was superb. The story is fascinating although I'm not much of a war history fan, so I could have done without the middle section. But it did serve to define Strange and further differentiate him from Norrell. Overall, I found the book fascinating; sometimes funny, and sometimes sad. I do know I'm very glad to have \\"read\\" it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I cannot remember the book that I enjoyed mre than this one in quite a long time. You would think that I was recommended this book or that I have read something about it, somwhere, but the fact that I haven't makes me wonder, and feed my hunger for exploration and \\"thirst for knowledge\\". To know that there exist such jewels as this one, and that I haven't discovered them yet, keeps me standing...and wanting....And now, after some exaggaretion (one should emberk upon it every now and then) I should cool down and state my oppinion in more peacfull manner which is not so aggressive as the one stated above. :)As I have said, I stumbled upon this book in local book club/cafe and not knowing what to expect, I laid my hands on it and took her (the book) home. Not much of a blurb (there goes the tought in my hand) - \\"Harry Potter for grown-ups\\", as I might have mentioned somwhere I am not a fan of Harry Potter so this wasn't any kind of recommendation to me. How wrong was the blurb.Quite some time Aago I read \\"Les Miserables\\" by Victor Hugo, and the feeling I had was much like the feeling that I head whils reading this book. Sence of loss, and almost beautifull sorrow. Towards whom and what I cannot say, but I can say that the words filled me with warmth, with ecstasy, with hatred in one word with emotions. Thing that don't happen very often since I was trained to look upon the work of an art in a more (or less) objective way. Poor old me.Jonathan Starnge & Mr Norrel is a book that stands side by side with greatest novel of rmanticism (not of romance) but don't you expect bildungsroman now, cause it is not. From Napoleon to Lord Byron Susanna Clarke presents her characters with such a loving grace that you must feel for them, you can almost hear and smell her world how lifelike it is. She didn't lose herself in endless narative which bores to death, every word is well placed and this is one of those books that are simply too short and you feel at loss when they are over.Eternal struggle for knowledge, stupidity of humanity, elite vs common, Emipristic versus scientific, questions that will remain open even as the post-modern discourse of rediscovering identity of oneself starts to dominate prose.I strongly recommend this one, and with it Umberto Eco's \\"The Name of The Rose\\". Read them both and enjoy, and think, and cry, and be human (or humane) in the noblest form that you can manage."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Overall, an entertaining read - but I agree with previous comments that it will not be to everybody's taste. There's a good dollop of Henry Fielding in there, with the 18th century novel's speed and pace at the outset, and whilst Clarke undoubtedly needs a lengthy space to set our her vision of 19th century wizardry, the final 200-400 pages sag and could have done with more judicious editing. Plus the change in tone here and in particular in the final pages wasn't 100% convincing. However, this is a book that sweeps you up in its world and carries you along: definitely a good example of the willing suspension of disbelief. And some of the minor characters are fantastically good value (Lord Wellington for one)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Not only could this book give readers a concussion if it fell on them while they drifted off to sleep, (heavy, huge hardback edition), but at times it could quite possibly be the cause of the sleepiness. Still, big and unwieldy as it is, the book is worth a look.Susanna Clarke's book, heralded by some critics, is, in my humble opinion, a strange combination of wonderful prose and monotonous blandness, interspersed with a dribblingling of truly inspired and magical moments. The search for those moments is what kept me determined to finish this lengthy undertaking. But in the end, and though the writer indeed deserves praise for weaving a story of this verbal magnitude together, there just weren't enough of those magical moments to allow me to feel satisfied.In the end, what comes to mind is that reading this book was a bit like reading one of those textbooks that Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell spent so much of their time with. Just add the dust."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I am not even sure how to begin describing this book.It is very imaginative, creative, and beautifully written. The story is set in an alternative version of England, a magical England, during the Regency. It's written very much in the style of Jane Austen (there's even a part where a character says, \\"I take no leave of you!\\" just like Lady Catherine said to Lizzy in Pride & Prejudice), with a few archaic spellings thrown in (shew for show and chuse for choose).Here's an example of the beautiful writing: \\"She did not rise at the entrance, nor make any sign that she had noticed them at all. But perhaps she did not hear them. For, though the room was silent, the silence of half a hundred cats is a peculiar thing, like fifty individual silences all piled one on top of another.\\"The book is full of fake footnotes citing imaginary English references on magic and fairies. These footnotes are funny and entertaining, once you get past the idea that something in tiny type at the bottom of the page is going to be dull. You get lots of stories and things about magicians of old, especially one mysterious guy, the Raven King.When the story opens, English magic is all but dead, and though it is studied by \\"theoretical magicians,\\" no one can actually do magic. But then this one guy who lives in the country in Yorkshire, a fussy little man named Mr Norrell, comes along saying that he can do magic, and makes a display, and then eventually contrives to get all the theoretical magicians to stop calling themselves magicians or having anything else to do with magic.Mr Norrell establishes himself in London and tries to get the attention of some important people so that he can do some magic on behalf of England in the war against Napoleon. Eventually he succeeds, though the spell he uses to get the attention of an important person, Sir Walter Pole, ends up causing all kinds of trouble.Another magician enters the scene: Jonathan Strange, who becomes a magician sort of by accident. He's young, headstrong, and much more like one would imagine a magician should be than Mr Norrell. Mr Norrell agrees to take him on as a pupil. These two gentlemen represent two very different approaches to magic, and perhaps they were supposed to be similarly sympathetic, but they weren't. Mr. Norrell was so miserly with his books and so close-mouthed about magic that it was hard to like him. Far into the book, you understand his motivations a little better, but it's a little too late. Jonathan Strange was much more likeable.There are some other stories going on here as well - the butler, Stephen Black; the strange gentleman with silver hair; Mr Drawlight and Mr Lascelles, the socialites that Mr Norrell has taken up with; a street-magician named Vinculus; John Segundus the kind theoretical magician; and Mr Norrell's man of business, Childermass.The intertwining stories were beautifully told and nicely woven around each other, and once it found its pace (the first hundred or so pages were slow going) it was very, very engaging. There's nothing like this book out there. I've heard people call it \\"Harry Potter for grownups\\" but it's not that at all. It's its very own thing.But. I was a little bit disappointed in the end. After creating these vivid characters and their wonderful stories and dropping intriguing little clues all over the place, it kind of petered out. Maybe I just didn't like the way some things turned out, and maybe (because I got so wildly curious that I read too fast) I missed some things that would have made the ending seem better to me upon a slower reading. And I will reread this book, armed with knowledge of the ending, and see if that makes the ending better.It seemed like Ms. Clarke should have gone through her manuscript one more time looking for a few things that could be enhanced or explained more at the end (you didn't miss anything until then, because you just assumed it would be explained later). I think maybe the manuscript got too long (it is almost 800 pages) and she just wanted to be finished with it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Susanna Clarke is a good writer but a poor storyteller. This book is far too long and poorly paced. It gets off to a very slow start with a group of 'theoretical' magicians natting on about nothing and it takes 75 pages before something interesting happens. Then, right after something interesting happens (inanimate objects talking), it goes right back to being boring for a while while Ms. Clarke indulges herself in pointless subplots and endless character studies. This pattern of a moment of excitement followed by long periods of boredom repeats itself endlessly throughout the book.Did I mention the footnotes? They appear on every page so the author can relate the history of magic in England - after a while they just get annoying because most of them are silly and they also fail to advance the plot.After examining every minor character in excruciating detail book the ends abruptly. How does Lady Pole exact her revenge on Mr. Norrell for selling her as a slave to the bad fairy? What is the signifigance of Drawlight turning into a tree after being murdered? Why is the Raven King, the most interesting character by far, stuck with nothing more than a lame cameo? What are the words of the new book written on Vinculus' body?Pages and pages of trivia and she leaves you hanging at the end. Annoying. I'm just thankful I borrowed the book from the library instead of wasting money on it.I fear there is a sequel in the works. If so, count me out. There are far more accessible books out there, with better editing, to read. Only read \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" if you have a lot of spare time to fill."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"\\"Jonathan Strange & Norrell\\" is a strange novel indeed, but arrestingly so, one of the qualities of a masterpiece. The book even looks strange, with its lengthy footnotes, quaint typesetting, and antiquated spellings (\`stopt' instead of \`stopped,' or \`chuses' instead of \`chooses') all meant to evoke the bygone era Susanna Clarke is writing about: early 19th century England.Strange & Norrell re-imagines English history as the history of English magic. (Harry Potter by way of Jane Austen gives you some idea). The events of the novel begin sometime around 1806, a time when English magic had been relegated to dull history books and practiced only by \\"theoretical magicians,\\" members of gentlemen's clubs who are really just dry and dusty academics. No one actually does magic anymore.Enter Gilbert Norrell, a small, elderly gentleman with a nervous disposition who claims that \\"I myself am quite a tolerable practical magician.\\" Norrell's attempt to revive English magic involves establishing himself as its foremost practitioner, and eliminating all potential rivals to the title of \\"Greatest Magician of the Age.\\"Enter Jonathan Strange: a young man of independent means who almost literally stumbles upon magic as his vocation. He is Norrell's opposite: impulsive, courageous, sociable, and anxious to try new things. Strange comes to discover that magic can be learned not just from books, but from Nature herself: the trees, the stones, the sky, the rivers (talk about \`books in the babbling brooks') just as Romantic artists, poets, and musicians were around the same time enamored of the idea that Nature is the fountain of inspiration.Over the course of 800 pages, Clarke charts the growing enmity between Strange & Norrell, as well as detouring to several subplots, one of which includes a blood-chilling villain: a powerful faerie with the evocative descriptor of \\"The Man with the Thistle-down hair.\\" Amusing cameos are also made by King George III, the Duke of Wellington, Lord Byron, and a whole host of English figures from the Napoleonic era. Strange's encounters with Wellington in Spain and Byron in Venice are calculated to delight any and all Anglophiles.Indeed, the novel entire is a love song to England--or perhaps a melancholy ballad. This is not William Blake's \\"green & pleasant lands,\\" an idyll of the rolling hills, verdant countryside, and quaint cottage manners (though these welcome features do appear from time-to-time). In an encounter between Strange and the wicked faerie, for example, \\"the wood no longer struck Strange as a welcoming place. It appeared to him now as it had at first--sinister, unknowable, unEnglish.\\"Hamlet's line, \\"There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in our philosophy,\\" could have serve as an appropriate epigraph to this story. The unpredictability of Susanna Clarke's world--the eerie sense that a mirror could become a door or a dark forest suddenly spring up in the middle of a city street--owes something to G.K. Chesterton's wild-and-woolly \\"The Man Who Was Thursday,\\" a book Clarke has cited as an influence. As the story progresses, one begins to feel like a disoriented visitor to the \\"kingdom behind the mirror\\" that Strange describes: \\"I wish I could give you an idea of its grandeur! Of its size and complexity! Of the great stone halls that lead off in every direction ... I saw staircases that rose up so high I could not see the top of them, and others that descended into utter blackness.\\"Though Clarke's pacing is deliberate, she holds the reader's attention with her meticulous craftsmanship, characteristically British wit, and the generosity of her visionary imagination. A single one of her footnotes contains more humor, style, and creativity than most fiction released nowadays. \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell\\" is a sumptuous medieval tapestry of a story--a tapestry that doubles as a magic carpet--gilded with lavish detail, colorful characters, exotic places, and finely-wrought decorative flourishes. \\"Author as magician\\" clich&eacute;s are as applicable to the prodigiously talented Ms Clarke as they are to her sister sorceress, JK Rowling. Prepare to be enchanted."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I was very excited to read this book -- I had heard many rave reviews of it, and I was intrigued by the premise. Also, I love a good long book I can sink my teeth into. Sadly, this was not the book for me.It is clearly very well researched, and I did enjoy it, for the first 200 pages or so. I started off really liking the footnotes, which maybe don't add to the story so much as make bibliophiles like me feel cool for reading them. At some point, though, I got tired of them and simply stopped reading them.There were parts of the book I really liked. I particularly enjoyed reading about Stephen Black's interactions with the Fairie who would never take no for an answer. I enjoyed almost all of their scenes together -- the Fairie wants to give Stephen Black the world, and Black, sighing, continuously tries to give it all back. What a great dynamic.In the end, however, there is just too much going on in this book. I was constantly confused by secondary (and tertiary) characters. I never really felt for either Jonathan Strange or Mr. Norrell (good or bad), and that's what destroyed this book for me. I felt much more for Stephen Black than I ever did for either of the magicians, who really felt flat to me. Now, Black is a significant character, but he is one of many, and finally, my interest in his story doesn't make up for my lack of interest in the rest of it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"First, I agree w/ all the rave reviews, and yes, the book is long but well worth the effort.

No kidding, this is it.You do have to comit to reading it, because the first 150-200 pages are not fast paced and you may find your self bored, but the time invested in these pages will be more then worth it.You will love and hate characters. You will worry about the characters. You will get to the end of this monster book and not believe it's over though you've just read over 800 pages.If Susanna Clarke writes any thing else I will buy it and I will gladly and freely say that she is one of the most talented story tellers I've come across ever."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Must say that how ever enjoyable the book and the Miss Manners writing style was (yes, it's Miss Manners' voice narrating the novel), it should have run no longer than 300 pages and not the 800 that it does.The ending is barely satisfying as it turns out the two magicians, Norrell and Strange, do not do battle. Throughout, the writer \\"surprises\\" by avoiding conflict, but the avoidance also deflates the story. The two magicians also do not remain the main characters of the book, despite the book's title. The supporting cast takes over at the end, does all the work, and does it by accident. This diffuses the little momentum the book has.The characters seem never to know what's really happening around them, which is realistic, but they never figure it out either so there's not one ah-ha! moment. The author adheres to a consistent \\"logic\\" when handling magic except for the glaring inconsistency at the end when a major spell persists beyond its conjurer although all other spells from this same person die out.On the plus side, there is a touching love story brought to a fitting conclusion.The length and diffused plot are, I think, meant to be entertaining in a gossipy parlor-room conversation style. And it is if you don't want anything more out of a book, or several days' reading labor. You can get as much from Miss Manners' columns.I would recommend devoting time to some poetic writing and Welsh magic from, say, Alan Garner, instead. If you want something longer, look up and get the delicious American \\"Folk of the Air\\" by Peter S. Beagle."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I found it both really hard to get into this book and really hard to stay with it as well. Although it is well written, language and construction wise, and the ideas it contains are interesting, the delivery failed to grip me as a reader. The author has adopted an early 19th century writing style, which although clever, is possibly one of the things that helps keep the early 21st century reader from easy immersion in the story. I also found the footnotes irritating - there were just too many of them and I found they distracted from the 'flow' of the story rather than enhancing it. The main negatives however, were the lack of almost any attractive / sympathetic characters and the very slow pace of the narrative. The combination of these two factors led me to 'plod' through the book out of a sense of duty (given the hype) rather than reading with a sense of keen enjoyment. There was no reading through to the wee small hours with this book and nor did I ever tell myself that I could just 'squeeze in a few extra chapters' before the main business of the day - and end up reading practically all day!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Susanna Clarke's \`Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell' is undoubtedly unique, but despite the rave reviews by hallowed publications such as the NYT etc, it doesn't live up to the hype. Not by a long shot. The craze for the Potter series may well have helped create a marketplace for this kind of novel, but fantasy buffs will be disappointed. There's very little in the way of interesting magic - let alone comic hi-jinx - taking place and the theoretical and philosophical arguments pertaining to magic and its use are dreary in the extreme. The two main characters, Strange and Norrell, are equally unlikeable, the tone of the book is oddly nationalistic, and the plot - two dull magicians battling for supremacy in the context of Britain's battle against Napoleon, is hardly a page-turner. Which is a pity as if there's a dire shortage of humour and excitement, there's an oversupply of pages, and only the culling of around 600 of them could save this turgid tome from a non-stop snore fest. With contemporary British literature like this you start to wish the French had won."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I bought this book because it had such good reviews, but found myself wanting to put it down often. Well, it is completely overrated and much too long. Although fairly well-written, it is slow and not exciting at all. I can at least say that about the Harry Potter series. Thing LONG and hard about bothering with this slow moving sleeper."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Another succesful marketing of a LONG novel that really is just ok. It never gets where it wants to go, or I guess I should say that it never took me there. Sort of the DHALGREN of the fantasy/magic genre. But wait this just won the HUGO award for best Science Fiction novel of the year. What?? Science Fiction?? Hey, if HARRY POTTER can win the HUGO then why not this. Hugo Gernsback is spinning in his grave! Some day maybe a science fiction novel will win the HUGO again - but I doubt it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This topic of magic is obviously popular these days from the success of Lord of the Rings to Harry Potter. Afterall its fun, vastly entertaining and when done well full of wonder. The genre is great and i hope it continues.This book is about magic, many spells are cast, but thats it. The writing is tedious, the characters are flat, and the whole narrative stops and starts leaving the reader and the characters hanging. The story has real promise and perhaps a good editor could have streamlined it into something more fluid, but that never happened, possibly because this first time author is a full time editor herself. She obviously dispelled with that part of the process. To say this is on par with Tolkien or Austen is grossly unjust. And to say it was well researched is also shameful. Dont buy into these footnotes. If they were important for the fiction then they should have been woven into the narrative or at least used cleverly and sparingly like Borges.I finished the book, i think out of respect for the tree this massive book was printed on.

It was slow going from a plot point of view. Also, my 63 year old eyes had GREAT difficulty with the small print. I'm sure it was done to keep down the size of the book - it's over 1000 pages in paperback as it is - but it is very difficult to read. In addition to the small print, the pages are quite faint, making it even more difficult. Perhaps if the plot had been worth it, I might have persevered, but..."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Seeing that the book won a Hugo, I was excited to read it. Unfortunately, the cover would be the only time I would be excited over the course of 1000 pages. The prose of the book is very relaxing-- the read really is faster than you'd expect. It's a thousand pages but reads like 500, this is due to the smooth, conversational nature of the writing. The book has a very good nack for the \\"proper Brit\\" of the 1800s. Unfortunately that's all the book has. And the book is hurt by what it doesn't have-- conflict and tension. I don't need action scenes to enjoy a book, but I do need to care, and over the course of the book you're given no reason to care. The \\"villian\\" is hardly villanous, and he has his own plot which doesn't actually meet up with Norrell and Strange till the last 100 pages or so, and even then there is no real fight, just a lot of talking, and not even arguing. The conflict between Strange and Norrell is similarly underwhelming. At some point in time the book becomes Strange's book, no conflict, no sense that Strange's magic is actually \\"perilous\\" the author just forgets about Norrell. Over the course of a thousand pages these simple problems are magnified. There is no pay-off, no tension, no suspense, no real reason to read. The book is uncompelling and below average. It reads smoothly and takes itself very seriously so it gets rated highly. It's nothing new in the book world. If you're looking for a nice fantasy fix, I'd look somewhere else, to Jim Butcher, or to Laurell K Hamilton."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The premise of this book is quite good. However, the writing style is undeniably British. None of the main characters are particularly sympathetic, nor are motivations well explored. Some of the smaller characters are interesting and sympathetic, but my favorite of them just vanished in the middle of the book with no explanation whatsoever. Even the ones that don't per se vanish, like Lord Byron, appear to be randomly thrown in to provide a bit of color to the incredibly dull protagonists and don't seem to really advance the storyline. I read it all the way through because I couldn't believe that a book with the reviews that this one is getting wouldn't get better, but it didn't."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I was excited to read this book but could not get past the first hundred pages. It was just dull, and I found myself forcing myself to read it.It's well written, but there is too much information to take in, the end notes were annoying, and I didn't enjoy the form of the novel. It was just off-putting altogether."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I never \\"got\\" the Harry Potter thing. As a lifelong reader of Tolkein the appeal of a children's book about magic, however thick, eludes me. When I read the original reviews for this book in other media I was intrigued not by the comparisons to Harry Potter but by the substance of the book itself. I think that if the Harry Potter comparisons are marketing driven, they do a disservice to the author. This novel is much more mature, and more of an indulgence in language and character than any children's novel could hope to be. Perhaps some of the other 'adults' that are such fans of the children's fantasy genre ought to work their way up to grown up literature. Harry Potter is a good start, but the writen word is meant to inspire and entertain on its own. You dont need a thrill a minute. An English moor delivered by the pen of a competent author, and appreciated by a sophisticated reader are what literature is all about."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This bookis infused with the spirit of Charles Dickens. The words take you back to Victorian England, and there is where you want to stay. This book beat The Crystal Cave, which I had thouroughly enjoyed. It cannot be compared to Harry Potter; it is too sophisticated! I only hope Ms. Clarke has a sequel in her; or even another different book. She needs to keep writing. Charles would be proud!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"After over 700 people have weighed in on this book, what is there to add? I found the way the author invented an entire alternative magical history of England to be very creative (although the footnotes became tiresome). Mr Norrell, a crabby, insecure type, sets himself the task of restoring magic to England in the early 19th century. Magic apparently flourished in the early Middle Ages but then inexplicably died out. But Mr. Norrell wants only a genteel, controlled, domesticated form of magic -- not the wild, unpredictable powerful type that lies buried just under the surface.Mr Norrell finds no acceptance in the England of his day, embroiled in the Napeolonic wars, until he brings the newly-wedded bride of a cabinet minister back to life. But in doing so, he makes a pact with the devil that continues to haunt the pages of this overlong book.Another magician arises -- Jonathan Strange. He is more normal in his appetites and more daring in his ambitions than his mentor. At first the two get along but increasingly a rift develops between them. Strange sets out to help the armies of the Duke of Wellington in the Iberian Peninsula and plays a crucial role in the British victory.Much more happens in this massive tome -- which ultimately lost my attention. Despite the author's skill and erudition and imaginative feat in conjuring up a new reality (she is the true magician of the book), the novel lacked heart. The characters were not sufficiently vibrant and compelling to justify such Dickensian or Tolstoyan length. It's an act of hubris to create a book such as this. I applaud the author's ambition and imagination -- but it could have done with some trimming."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Based on it being a number one bestseller and highly rated fantasy novel, I eagerly started this book. After about 200 pages, I wondered when the plot would start moving forward. Written like a historical narrative from the 1800s, it teases the reader to keep turning the pages but many of the payoffs are muted and felt like you're reading a history book. The overall story is interesting, but it takes about 650 pages to pick up the pace. The fantasy element is minimal, but it gives a good impression of an English magician in the 1800s."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Despite some not very likeable characters, heroines carelessly disposed of and then revived and then doomed to be separated from her love, I did enjoy reading the book. There was something beautiful, yet real, grounded, yet surreal about the world evoked; and the many strands of the story came together in the end rather neatly. It falls between the epic scale of Tolkien and the contrived phantasia of fantasy-fantasy, which is refreshing. Less footnotes please. Really, it does NOT read in anyway like a historical account, and it shouldn't."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I purchased this book based upon all the rave reviews it has been receiving. About 100 pages in I set it down and realized I had a hard time picking it back up again. Overall, this book took me an agonizing 3 months to finish. At about 500 pages in I thought to myself, \\"I am really not enjoying this book at all, so why don't I just put it away?\\" It is the rare book that makes me not want to finish reading it and this is one of them. However, I did finish it and must say it is very dull and plodding with too much description about boring details and not enough action! Also, the book is full of footnotes that are stories within themselves that I eventually did not bother to read anymore. I wanted to like this book, I really did. I suppose I've just read too many really great books that make this one so dull in comparison to them."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I consider this novel to be a \\"dense\\" book, dense in the respect that it cannot be read quickly. Missing even a sentence can be detrimental to the story as a whole.

It is everything I love in a novel, mysterious, atmospheric, historical and magical. Please please take the chance and read this book, you will not regret it! I did not find it hard to get into at all. I end each chapter with a satisfying sigh. It is also quite funny. What an amazing debut!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is for a particular type of reader:If you like historical fiction like Jane Austen, Georgette Heyer, the Aubrey & Maturin novels, etc. AND you like Fantasy, you will enjoy this. If you want a quick and action-packed read - this is not it. You will also need to know a little about life during Wellington/Napoleon era to truly enjoy it.It is not an easy read. It is however, a highly creative world set in an alternative 1800's England/Europe. From what I know of history, this author seems to have done her research. I love the use of archaic spellings \\"chuze\\" etc.I found myself snickering throughout, and I do love the footnotes. Yes, they do remind me of Terry Pratchett as another reviewer mentioned.I'm also reminded of Sylvia Townsend Warner.So try it, you may like it. I did!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The plot of this long book is not easily reduced to a digest form-let's just say that two men who can do magic and have come to it by very different roads try to re-introduce magic to England in the early nineteenth century. The basic story is interesting but the subtext is more so. If magic is so powerful why did it die out in the world? Is there more to it and is the power of magic always good or even usually good? These questions are suitably, for a novel, addressed within the confines of the story and there is no resort to parenthetical preaching by the author.Of course \\"magic\\" may be viewed as a placeholder for any type of power wielded by a few over the lives of the many- especially something like science. This analogy is nearly made evident in the plot line by the upswell of journals devoted to magic after the two magicians become well known; by the scholarly manner in which Mr. Norrell goes about learning and applying magic and by the author's use of footnotes.There is no final answer to the moral question of good vs. evil inherent in magic (or science) but the types of issues that any one person might use to make their own decision are examined (we are guided by the earnest enthusiasm, conventional morality and good intentions of Jonthan Strange which are woefully inadequate to address such questions as:is it right to directly kill other men in war, in a fashion against which they have no defense, to support your own side; is providing your side an advantage in war that results in the death of many of the other side moral; would raising the dead be morally acceptable?) Clearly these are the types of questions that were raised in the use of the atomic bomb in WWII and in cloning and other cutting edge science.Interestingly, the end of the book might be a reprise of the beginning (and this is left a little indefinite) with a group of feckless magicians manque sitting around talking about magic but not doing any. Has it died out again? Have Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell decided it best to withdraw from the world and take magic with them (certainly they come to realize that the moral issues raised transcend their power to answer.) Have ordinary men decided that, in fact, ignorance is preferable to knowledge since the risk exceeds the perceived benefit?A reader can enjoy the story alone but the temptation to look under the surface at the author's purpose is nearly irresistible and if one does the entire story is a more work than one might expect from a novel. This can result in reader fatigue in a book this long."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I cannot possibly understand how this book can garner even one poor review. One of my top three favorite books, this book certainly is not one to turn to for conventional gripping action, obvious definition of good and evil, or even a writing fashion typical to our time. But rather than leaving something to be desired because of this, the book exceeds the quality of any other materials that are in these days being published. It does this with beautifully crafted characters (that mesh together perfectly), engaging and humorous dialogue, ethical dilemmas and curious analysis of the definition of \\"good/evil\\", a general elegance, and a fantastically organized history of all its own. Suffice it to say, I LOVE this book. Stimulating and gripping like no other book I have ever read, through beautiful words and scenarios that transcend themselves in order to create something great, this novel grabs the reader, gives them material to identify with and CARE about, and takes them on more twists and turns than they ever could have conceived possible.If you like words, reading, and fiction, you should be set for one of the best reading experiences of your life, no matter the length. To ask that the book be reduced for an easy, quick experience is to ask Mozart to remove a few notes here and there from any of his works. To reduce its length would only, regrettably, reduce the impact and the grandeur of the novel as an experience. And this is not, as it is, a reading experience to be missed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"People calling this Harry Potter just don't read much. I'll not spend much time defending that point. It's not worth it. But, this book is NOT Harry Potter.What it is, however, is a really well-crafted work by a brilliant author. Clarke uses her upbringing, her education, and a boatload of research to flawlessly recreate a conversationally-toned novel that depicts an early 1800s England rife with delightfully rich interactions between colourful characters in a well-painted landscape.The book makes magic important, but not silly. It makes magicians pompous, but not without sticking barbs into their personal hot air balloons. There isn't that candyland sense of magic as depicted in the schoolkid set's hottest fictional property.The chapters read well, and you'll find enough to keep you turning along. The title characters are perhaps the most fleshed out, but I'll accept that. It's appropriate for the style Clarke is mimicking through her narrative. And stories? The book is rife with stories.If you read The Amulet of Samarkand, by Stroud, you'll have a better chance of catching the flavor intended here. In fact, the books go well together. One is for younger readers, but definitely more developed than the early Rowling books. But it would bookend really well with the fiction brought forth by Clarke.Great read, and worth it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book sat like a brick on my shelf for weeks without attracting much interest, until one rainy day when I started reading and couldn't stop. I'm just sorry it had to end. A great mix of wit, storytelling and some geninuely magical writing.Sure, it's a bit slow in parts and any kind of military exploit is tough going for this reader. But every time I let myself be lulled to less than full attention, Clarke brought me back with something extraordinary, like the episode in Venice with the decayed socialite who in her old age can speak only cat or the ships made out of rain.And don't neglect the footnotes despite their tiny typeface--there's a poem about the Raven King in a note early on that ranks among the most moving and lyrical pieces of writing I've encountered in years. A real masterpiece--I'm just sorry I can't read it for the first time again."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Sometimes a book is published that seems to be exactly the type you will enjoy, but turns out to be a disappointment. An excellent example of such a book is Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke. This book details how magic is revived by two magicians in England in 1806. It is an alternate history. What the book does well is provide a rich literature for British magic in footnotes, create believable historical characters, and engage the reader to the end. The book falls short though in ending badly, in creating unsympathetic (arguably stupid) characters, and giving the female characters no personality or agency.If the book had had an ending to suit its length it would make up for much, but instead the ending seems patched on. After 782 pages I expect to feel that my reading time was well spent. It is apparent from the fact that \\"darkness\\" covers the world at the novel's end that Clarke intends to write a sequel, but why would I read a sequel to a book if the plot can not not be brought to some kind of conclusion in so many pages? One problem many books seem to have is being too long. I think this is a problem of the author not knowing how to end the novel and not doing enough revision. If something could be told in fewer pages then it probably should be.A second problem with the book is the unsympathetic and boring characters. Neither magician is sympathetic. Jonathan Strange is particularly unpleasant, pompous and self-important. Granted this could be said to be true to the literary form of the British novel, but the plot would be more interesting if the main characters are likeable.Second, I must object to the comparisons of this book with those by Jane Austen (review). The characters in Austen's novels have personality - both the female and the male characters. In this book the female characters are dull and uninteresting. That the women are boring characters is quite surprising since Jonathan Strange's wife, Arabella Strange, plays a significant role in the book. The issue is the total lack of agency that she has. She has no particular skills or intelligence. When she \\"dies\\" her husband finds another young woman to marry, though their marriage is forestalled when Arabella revives. The message of the book seems to be that women are replaceable, but necessary. That is why it is unfair to compare this to Austen. Though Austen's characters had limited agency they did manage to accomplish things, in the private realm. Clarke's female characters are singularly unaccomplished.The fundamental problem with the book is the concept - making an alternate history of a magical Britain and creating it to be as dull as an actual history. The magic has been taken out of magic."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Rave and hype is a blade that cuts two ways. It will boost the popularity of any product (or person), but it may also leave people with a faint sense of disappointment, when reality doesn't meet expectations. And that is probably one of the reasons why I am not entirely happy with this novel.It is easy for me to see that I am mostly alone in not being swept off my feet by 'Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell'. It is not that I dislike it at all. I find the story delightful, if somewhat slow. The comparisons to the novels of Jane Austen are apt in the way that Susanna Clarke uses a dry and witty sense of humour to convey her sly observations of human behaviour. The plot is convincing and completely logic within the framework of another, magical England, the overall construction is admirable, and things come to a satisfying end.So what is missing? Perhaps I find the novel clever rather than charming, intriguing rather than engaging. And, most importantly, I find it difficult to like any of the two main characters very much. Mr. Norrell is a miser, a nervous, edgy little man. Jonathan Strange grows on you, but still I miss the kind of feeling that would allow me to really care what happens to him.I will still recommend the book to those who have the patience and time to get involved and will enjoy the cleverness and humour. But I will be careful not to hype it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is a wonderful, wonderful book, but you must be prepared to devote some time to its almost 800 pages. While not being overly heavy, the novel is neither a quick and easy read. Susanna Clarke is a wonderful novelist and the story is fascinating, complex and amazingly detailed. (Much of the detail comes in the form of footnotes, where Clarke describes many little stories of magic, fairies and other such fantastic tales). Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is the story of those two men, the last two, the only two magicians in England in the early nineteenth century. The novel follows their story and the story of magic in England at that time. At times, I warn you, the novel moves rather slowly. The ending, however, is quite compelling, well-constructed and ultimately satisfying. Clarke has created a fantastic world, a parallel universe in which the practice of magic is as much a vocation as the law or the church. The story is wonderful, but, what is special for me was the fabulous characters. So many of them are so richly drawn and they grow and develop over time. Characters like these are a rarity and make this novel such an undeniable pleasure to read. Clarke tells the story with much, much subtle humor, along the lines of Jane Austen and Patrick O'Brian. As I said before, this is a long book, but well worth every page. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Since so many readers have written so many great reviews I will try to keep mine succinct and to the point:I'm one of those readers who craves a book that will draw me in and engage me the way books did when I was first beginning to read: a book that will take its time with me, and will offer more and more depth with each successive reading. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is that book.Ms. Clarke's writing style reminded me of some of the best (and sadly forgotten) writers of tales of the weird and fantastic from the 20th century: J.S. Sheridan Le Fanu, M.R. James, E.F. Benson, even Mervyn Peake (though much more accessible than the Titus Groan trilogy). Clarke writes with deft, subtle irony and wit, as well as moments of hypnotic strangeness and quiet passion. She assumes that her reader is intelligent, as well as open to something more than the current trend of contemporary confessional narrative. (Don't get me wrong, I loved the Kite Runner, Life of Pi, The Lovely Bones, Middlesex), but, like many of you out there, I enjoy a range of books with one thing in common-- they open up a part of my mind that was formerly uncharted, they show me a window to a place I would never have known existed otherwise. The world of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is vast, ancient and so firmly entrenched in real places and events that I sometimes find myself \\"google-ing\\" the characters names and can't believe that some these personalities and histories are NOT real. If you've read and enjoyed Mark Helprin's \\"Winter's Tale\\", which tells a similar fantasical story about the history of New York City, you'll love this book.If I can use one of Clarke's own metaphors from JS and Mr.N: this work is like travelling the King's Roads-- it is only a glimpse into an immense world that has come into being and now into reality through her role as author (or as some writers feel, intermediary). I got the feeling many times while reading this novel that the characters demanded of Ms. Clarke that this story be told.How many of us have wandered through the bookstore looking for something magical, only to come away disappointed? Well, there is magic in this book, but like real magic it cannot be mastered through Cliffs Notes or \\"Magic for Dummies\\". You will get no immediate gratification. It will take some focus and a little effort to get the hang of-- but don't most things worth doing take a bit of effort? How many books have you devoured recently that a week later you can't remember the plot of? Would you prefer a TV dinner or a home made meal?This book, if you will slow down your usual wild pace and settle in, will stick to your ribs. You'll pick it up and open to a random point and begin reading again. If you're lucky enough to live in England, you might begin to notice the overgrown fairy roads and catch glimses of vague shapes moving along them.Now, my question for the author-- when do we get a book written by John d'Uskglass?Sincerely,L. MooreSan Francisco, CAUSAljmoore@sfsu.edu"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The worst part of this book was that after the huge investment in reading time - it ended! Like a lot of good things in life, JS&MN; started off slowly enough, but after 150 pages or so, I was captivated and found myself taking the book to work and keeping it in my desk drawer.When you're reading a certain kind of book, coming to its ending is a bit of a shock. You've grown so accustomed to the characters and the world they inhabit, that it's utterly startling to turn the last page and realize (once again) that they only live their lives inside the head of the author - and you!I find that I agree with many disparate opinions about this book. If you find your patience wearing thin during the first 100-200 pages, you may well not enjoy this book. If, on the other hand, you're willing to hang in there, you'll find that the author has created a vivid and fully realized world populated with characters that are as strange, yet oddly familiar, and certainly as memorable, as any whom you may ever have met."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book was recommended by a friend whose taste in literature I deeply respect, but after reading the first part of the novel I harrassed him daily that the payoff had better darn good. Lucky for him, it was.Part one: Mr. Norrell read so dreadfully slow and boring I almost didn't make it through. It reads more like the introduction to a dissertation than a fictional novel. I found the footnotes particularly distracting as they are not truly footnotes in that they refer to non-existent books and yet they must be read to make sense of the storyline.Clarke went overboard by writing 300 pages of dull material to emphasize an exceptionally dull character. Heavy editing would have benefitted this part of the novel.Part two: Jonathan Strange did read better than part one, but only because Clarke made the effort create a slightly more likeable, interesting character out of Strange. There are also more interesting locations and events (Strange actually does magic rather than read about it). It still suffers from overwriting and onerous footnotes.Part three: John Uskglass makes up for the tiresome reading in parts one and two. At last the novel comes back round to the two most interesting characters, Childermass and Vinculus (who could have made the previous 600 pages far more entertaining had they been more fully fleshed out). Proving that patience is truly a virtue, Clarke finally folds together the former hundreds of pages into a series of events that bring the story to a very satisfying ending.Clarke's debut is not by any means comparable to a Harry Potter book and I believe that many avid Rowling readers will be disappointed if they are expecting likeable characters, a quickly-paced storyline and loads of action and adventure. This novel is a serious investment in time and energy, but the conclusion is well worth it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"After reading the negative reviews of this book, I thought it would be helpful to clear up some misconceptions and set out a quick test of whether a reader is likely to enjoy \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\".Here's my take: it's NOT Harry Potter. If you want a quick-paced book, with lots of action and easy-to-read prose, THIS IS NOT YOUR BOOK. Here's the test: If, by the end of the first chapter, you have not laughed out loud or even chuckled, YOU WILL PROBABLY NOT LIKE THIS BOOK. And that's perfectly OK - I hope I've saved you from buying it (nothing's worse, IMHO, than buying a book you end up hating).I personally love this book - I'd easily rate it as one of the best books I've read in years. But I also love Jane Austen, Mervyn Peake and Lord Dunsany. To me, this book is both an homage to and a witty send-up of 19th century literature. But you have to like that kind of literature and \\"get\\" the jokes that the author is making (both in the style of the prose as well as the play on historical events) to really enjoy this book.I want to make it clear that I think it's fine if people hate this book. However, I am troubled by comments that suggest it's a bad book. That's not true - it's simply a matter of preferences. For example, I happen to detest Dickens and like comic books. But I don't think that Dickens is an awful writer and comic book writers are superior to him - Dickens just isn't my style. So I'd emphasize that, in my opinion, Susanna Clarke is a phenomenal writer. But the pleasure of this book lies as much (if not more) in the way it's written as the events that take place - so if you're not interested in prose for its own sake, it'll be hard going."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I'm giving Jonathan Strange a 5 for the simply reason that I thoroughly enjoyed it all the way through, but I'd warn all readers to be more wary than usual of reviews (including this one). More than many books, this one I think will be a matter of true personal taste and experience will be your only truly accurate guide.To begin with, Strange is often referred to as a \\"fantasy\\" novel, an \\"adult\\" Harry Potter (ignoring Potter's self-obvious claim to millions of \\"adult\\" readers). If you're expecting fantasy in the form of Harry Potter magic (though done by bigger people employing bigger words) or Lord of the Rings-like quests and elves, be advised neither is here. Fantastical might be a better genre-word here than \\"fantasy\\". There is certainly magic here, both human and faerie (very different forms), but when one of the major storylines is how magic has gradually disappeared from England and when one of the major characters has as his purpose the destruction (not Black Tower hordes of evil monsters destruction but economic, social, or legal destruction) of those who would become magician, as you might imagine there isn't a lot of magic going on, at least not for the first few hundred pages. Those looking for a lot of wand-waving or fireball-flinging would best look elsewhere.One of the signs of the book's maturity is that one can't really generalize too much about the magic in it. Magic is almost invisible in the beginning and near-constant toward the end. It is scholarly, bookish and tedious and also vigorous, physical and exciting. It is human and Faerie and a melding of the two. It is all-powerful (Spain complains about the rearrangement of several of their country's geographic landmarks) and ineffective (you can see visions in water but they seldom are helpful). It is the subject of dry articles in academic journals and the cause of near-rumbles in local taverns. It is wonderfully complex and realistic. It is at times dazzlingly original (ships and sailors formed of rain, statues anguished over crimes committed beneath them), and handled often as if it is the most pedestrian, mundane aspect of daily life, except for the whole raise-the-dead, towering-shaft-of-neverending-night sort of thing.As for other fantasy genre elements, there is no band of diverse creatures setting out on a quest to defeat some dark lord; no tall, shining elvish archers; no nomadic horse-loving tribes. If you want to find a Tolkien analogue, it isn't Lord of the Rings but Smith of Wooten Major, an often forgotten story about the collision of the human and faerie realms.Strange is also referred to as a historical novel. It is set in early 19th century England, Wellington and other historical figures make their appearance, characters travel in carriages rather than cars. But the book's historical setting, like its magical element, is more pervasive than emphatic. It exists alongside the characters and story and serves them rather than being front and center as is true of so many historical novels. One is always aware of the historical setting, but I don't think anyone would come away from Strange with a truly enlarged understanding of the time period, as say one might from Lindsay Davis' mystery series set in ancient Rome, where specific foods and social rituals and forms of clothing etc. are constantly set before the reader. The setting is utterly believable, I'm sure meticulously researched, detailed and accurate, but it still doesn't feel like a \\"historical novel\\". Which from my view is a strength not a weakness.My advice therefore is not to place your should I read or not bet on the book's labels. What should you know?It's long. Very long. Longer than it seems according to the page count, since there are pages and pages of small-type footnotes throughout. Is it too long? I'm sure many people will think so. It takes its time in setting up story and character, leisurely is probably too fast-paced a description. It is far from compelling in the first few hundred pages in the sense of \\"must turn page to find out what happens\\". Personally, I found it compelling through character and style rather than plot. If you prefer plot, then prepare to be somewhat bored until the latter third where it moves along more speedily and in more traditional compelling manner.It's discursive. Very discursive. It will wander away quite often and sometimes at great length from the major plot lines, interrupting with academic asides or summaries/analyses of old folktales, or snippets of poetry. Again, some will probably find this maddening, some will simply skip the footnotes entirely. I liked the discursive nature of the book and found the footnotes often as enjoyable as the main text, always tolerable, and only rarely annoying.It is often beautifully written. it's one of those books where you'll pause over a line to reread it or let its effect linger a little while, whether due to the simple beauty of description, the efficiency of its brevity, or its dry wit. It is a true pleasure to read. Not to find out what happened. Simply to read.It's often funny. It is at times frighteningly dark. It has at times a domestic feel and at other times a grand mythic feel, especially in connection to the Raven King, the mysterious magician-king of old North England who also ruled over a land of Faerie and allegedly another land bordering Hell who disappeared centuries ago with the promise of return. Whether that return is to be wished for or not is the core dispute between the two magicians of the title.It is character driven. There are many wonderful scenes of \\"action\\", more so toward the latter half, but they tend to be understated while the book focuses more on character. Both Strange and Norrell are fully-fleshed out characters, totally believable in all their assets and flaws. We are given the time to know them and if Strange seems more appealing due to his more active role in the book, Norrell is no less accessible or recognizable for his minor jealousies and passiveness, though we may wish to deny the same traits in ourselves. The story of their meeting, their partnership, their sundering and what comes next is one of the major storylines and one of the more engaging, even if it happens mostly on the interior and despite the fact that the characters themselves are not particularly compelling by nature.There is a lot more one could say about this book. It's a lengthy work and a dense work. One could discuss the conflict between wild faerie and civilized England--presented in shades of grey rather than black and white. The sharp social commentary. The distant narrative tone. But this review is edging close to the length of one of her footnotes, so I'll bring it to a close.Try Jonathan Strange. If it doesn't draw you along, keep trying. If it still doesn't, try skimming footnotes, skimming pages, dipping in now and then to keep up on plot and catch one of those well-crafted lines, then come in for a landing and try again word by word. It isn't a rollercoaster ride on a summer Saturday . But it is a memorably gorgeous walk on a crisp autumn day, filled with slow sensual delight. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is hard to describe. In terms of genre, it is both fantasy and well-researched historical fiction, which makes it a rather rare bird. The writing style falls somewhere between Austen and Gaiman and Dickens. The plot is somewhat rambling and disjoint, forsaking the standard quest narratives; in some ways it is a fantastic history of England, in some ways a tale of rescue. If it is anything, it is the story of the relationship between the two title characters, but one of them is not even introduced for two hundred pages.. Unlike most of the better modern fantasy, this book is not a page-turner, and I mean that as a compliment; rather, it is a book to savor. Not that the plot isn't engaging - it is - but I frequently found myself comparing how many pages I'd read to how many I had left, deciding that I was burning through the book too quickly, and setting it down while I turned the passages I'd just read over in my head.As befits a character-driven fantasy, almost all the characters are likeable, or at least understandable; even when they take larger-than-life action, they do so for incredibly human reasons. There are also a number of historical-character cameos, all of them well-drawn and believable..I do not agree with Mr. Gaiman's statement that this is \\"the finest English novel of the fantasticke to appear in the past 70 years.\\" Tolkien is better; his work has an epic grandeur that this book lacks, perhaps because Susanna Clarke so realistically and concretely evokes the precise historical era at which she aims : the imagination has a somewhat wider canvas to paint on when reading Tolkien or similar high fantasy, with more blank space to be filled in by the reader. Setting fantasy in a specific historical setting means that the magic stands out against the realistic elements, rather than dictating the whole scope and shape of the world, and readers who prefer their fantasy more total - who prefer to sink themselves into a wholly fantastic world - may prefer other books. (On the other hand, readers who prefer to sink themselves into specific historical eras, but still appreciate fantasy elements, will no doubt enjoy this book, especially the ways in which the author incorporates magical elements into the recorded historical happenings of the era, such as, for example, the battle of Waterloo). I would also argue that Mr. Gaiman's novels are \\"better,\\" in that I personally prefer them slightly, if only because they tend to have a little more tension and action in them.But on the whole this book is very, very good, and I recommend it highly to anyone who likes historical fiction, fantasy novels, or just quality writing and well-drawn, likeable characters. This is not, however, fantasy for the action-oriented, or for those who desire a bad guy or monster every few pages. This is a book to be read while sitting in a comfortable chair by a warm fire, something drinkable near at hand; a book to be quietly enjoyed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Historical fiction is hard, because you have to respect the past while seeming to move about freely within it. Genre fiction is also hard, because you have to work to create a totally believable world without letting any of the scaffolding show. And when you try to blend the two, the difficulty of the task is compounded. It's wondrous that Susanna Clarke pulls this off, and miraculous that she does it so well. Not a note rings false. She imagines Great Britain at the close of the Age of Enlightenment, in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars, and she also imagines that world having the study and investigation of magic as one of its core components. Her Gilbert Norrell is one of the miracles of this book -- precisely the sort of magician that the era of Hume, Dr. Johnson, and Benjamin Franklin would produce. Her Jonathan Strange is also totally believable -- a product of the era of Byron and Shelley who is also reminiscent of Jane Austen's Mr. Knightley, yet just as sardonic and intellectually venturesome as his sometime mentor, sometime adversary. And John Childermass, Norrell's servant and conscience, is brilliantly realized. And I could say the same about just about every other character in this book. Every step of the way, her vast, crowded, action-packed, yet intensely thoughtful book works perfectly. I usually hate these analogies, but imagine if Jane Austen teamed up with China Mieville to write a book with J. K. Rowling, William Makepeace Thackeray, and John Le Carre as an editorial advisory committee. (By the way, I am a historian who works on this period, so when I say that this book works as a historical novel as well as a fantasy novel, it's the real deal.)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"1. Have you read the Amazon excerpt or, better yet, the first chapter? If not, please do so. This, for better or worse, is what the next several hundred pages are going to be - dense, semi-archaic prose; voluminous footnotes in tiny print, few of which relate to the plot; and a very focussed, extremely painstaking approach to what some may feel is a genre best treated with a little less solemnity.2. Do you have a LOT of time on your hands? The book demands as much. It does not easily lend itself to brief sessions of reading over an extended period of time.3. Would it bother you to spend all that time and all those pages on a narrative whose main characters are somewhat less than sympathetic? If any of the answers are \\"No\\" then maybe another book would provide a more pleasurable reading experience.However, please note the five star rating. This is a magical experience, with double meaning fully intended. I've read the book twice from cover to cover in the last six months and will probably revisit it again this summer. Ms. Clarke has created a world which compares, in richness and detail, with any of her contemporaries and most of her predecessors. The plot holds together remarkably well considering the infinity of digressions she provides. I am dying for a sequel. If you're interested, but not convinced, I would strongly recommend taking advantage of Barnes and Noble's comfortable chairs, or those in your closest library, and perusing a chapter or two. If you're not hooked by then, let it go. Otherwise, clear your calendar for the next several days and enter a new world. Real English magic may not exist, but Ms. Clarke's will more than suffice."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"First of all, I never believe book-hypes. They virtually say the same thing over and over again, it will be the next Tolkien, if Harry Potter has fed your thirst for fantasy, try this, making unworthy comparisons that only a ridiculously gullible person would believe. Now I did not believe that Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell would live up to its hype, yet I bought it all the same. I was dumbfounded.To start out with, it's every bit as complete as Lord of the Rings, Dune, and Harry Potter, creating a convincing history of magic and magicians that's almost believeable. In every chapter there's at least 3 footnotes elaborating on fairies, various magicians, magical books, and the like, some betraying the term \\"footnote\\" by being several pages long. But they do not get tedious.Also, the characters are wonderously detailed, having they're own funny, shocking, even haunting personalities, with names that depict the nature of the character just like in Dickens. The thing is, neither Jonathan Strange or Mr. Norrell are your ideal appealing characters. The side characters, such as Stephen Black,Childermass, and John Segundus, would be your ideal main characters. Yet it is their flaws that somehow makes them so likeable.As well as funny and enthralling, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is also utterly haunting. The fairies and their somewhat ambitious acts chilled me, and whenever the gentleman with thistledown hair took the stage I muttered \\"Oh please no.\\"As for the plot, too much must not be given away, but essentially, Mr. Norrell, the only practical magician in England for centuries, emerges from hiding and proceeds to make all sorts of wonders happen, and is soon joined by Jonathan Strange. Yet signs of the greatest mideval magician of all time's return, The Raven King, have found their way into into the story, while Stephen Black, an African servant, is held in thrall by a fairy.Do not hesitate to buy it, it may be intimidatingly long, but I promise you, you won't want it to end."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Susanna Clarke dazzles in a subtle way in her debut novel, \\"Jonathan Clarke & Mr. Norrell,\\" a startlingly original fantasy. No Dungeons & Dragons or Tolkien ripoffs here. Instead, a well-written, intelligent historical fantasy, which reportedly took Clarke a decade to write. With a story this rich, it was worth the wait.It's the early 19th century, in England. The Napoleanic wars threaten England, but that's not the only struggle going on. Magic is all but dead in England; the so-called magicians don't actually want to handle it, but want to leave it to old books and stories. Once the English magicians were powerful and respected, but now they just write boring essays about magic. Except for Mr. Norrell, a cautious little Yorkshire man who taught himself how to do magic.However, things take a twist when he gives his help in the battle against Napolean -- a new magician enters the scene, the enthusiastic and charming Jonathan Strange. The two magicians begin to work together, but things begin to go awry when Mr. Norrell realizes that Jonathan is attracted to all magic -- including the more dangerous varieties. He's increasingly fascinated by the legend of the Raven King, a changeling child who ruled Faerie and Earth...Historical fantasies have rarely been as detailed and rich as this one -- usually either the \\"historic\\" or the \\"fantasy\\" is abused. Often the best authors can do is write alternate universe stories where America lost the Revolution, the Roman Empire never fell, and so on. But Susanna Clarke shatters that with her richly-realized look at 19th-century Britain, with unique magic and a slight mythologic twist.Clarke keeps her writing solid, detailed and dignified, also footnoting extensively, with little wry winks and nudges to keep the book from being too serious. She has a flair for the historical parts of the book, keeping dates, battles, and political movement entwined in the plot. But she doesn't neglect the fantasy either; there's a mythic flavor in the story of the Raven King and the old magicians, reminiscent of old legends from ancient times. Her handling of magic is especially good -- less is more, and hints of past greatness make the magic all the more stunning.The title characters are the best of the book -- both are products of their times. Mr. Norrell is cautious, studious, ingenious and quiet, the sort of person you could imagine having a talk with Ben Franklin. Strange has more of the wild, society-be-damned wit that characterized some great artists of that time. And Norrell's faithful servant is just one of many solid supporting characters.If Jane Austen had written like Diana Wynne-Jones, the result would have been something like \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.\\" Well-written, enticing and thoroughly original, this is a keeper."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell combines the style and pace of a Victorian era novel with a dash of magic and it's resulting messes to create a 1000 page book that is bulging with mock historical digressions and footnotes that will either make you pull your hair out or fall off your chair laughing. The Victorian style and pace make the fantasy die-hards go crazy, but it fills the historian and Victorian fans with delight. The things that are most frustrating to the average reader are the slow pace (I'll admit I nearly gave up near the end) and historical digressions. To an audience that is more used to such things, however it is a very fun and interesting book.The book follows the stories of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, although it is 260 pages before we meet Strange and begin volume two and we start to follow his story. This slow introduction gets a little frustrating because Mr. Norrell is a very horrible man and the lack of moral characters starts to irritate you after two hundred pages or so. A quarter in to the book, we finally meet our protagonist and the reader begins to get more comfortable reading through the chaos caused by these two magicians learning magic and their participation in the war against France. After the war is concluded the plot slows down again and things get dull for a while. This would be fine place to end the book except that some of the plot threads still have not made any progress since the beginning of the book and characters like the man with thistle down hair still are complete mysteries to the reader. To keep the reader in confusion about a problem and then slow the pace of the book down is very unkind and it makes you want to give up on the book altogether. Then volume three begins three where there is a horrific mess with everything and all seems lost for a good 100 pages. This is like the climax of the book but it is so drawn out and slow that you begin to go crazy (and so does the main character at this point in the book). Finally the book ends with a bang and you still don't feel completely resolved with all of the issues raised but you shrug your shoulders and hold your breath to see if it has a sequel. In general, the book has a stop and go sort of feel where you can't put the book down in some places and you can't bear to pick it up in others. This is just fine for a patient reader but it can make everyone else go nuts.The other thing that can frustrate the average reader are the historical digressions. Throughout the book there are footnotes, and sometimes they take up more of the page than the actual text. This is convenient because the reader can skip them at will or read them and enjoy the humorous tone of the mock-historical observations, but some of the digressions are in the text. For instance, the first 200 pages barely advance the plot at all because the protagonist has not even been introduced to the reader. A great deal of that is spent on discussing Mr. Norrell's experiences with high society and frankly it is quite dull to read. These can all be very discouraging when all you want to do is to finish the book off.The book is very long and can make a reader impatient with the plot lines that never resolve and the slow pace and sometimes you just want it to end. Don't go into it expecting an action-packed Harry Potter adventure, but with patience and a lot of time, you'll finish the sucker off with a feeling of satisfaction that you managed to kill the 1000 page beast that has been lurking on your book shelf unfinished for who knows how long."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I don't believe anyone can write a reasonable review until they've finished a book - and this book is a beautiful example of why. I had a completely different opinion of the book at the end than at, say, 250 pages (where it seems not a few folks put this heavy tome down). You see, the book grows on you like a very subtle magic spell. This is how it went for me:The first 150 pages, all about Mr Norrell, are fusty and tedious, just like he is. The tedium is broken by the footnotes which simply sparkle with promises of how big and complex Clarke's world will be. Several characters pulled me along - Vinculus is a marvelous gypsy full of life and tantalizing malice - and Childermass - well, could he be the mysterious Raven King or a secret magician?In the next couple of hundred pages Jonathan Strange is introduced. Clarke refuses to moderate her idea of him - he should be romantic, but he simply can't be - he's just too true to the driven scientist - he only has one passion, and he doesn't even begin to get comfortable it until well on (i.e., magic).The historical setting (heavy in the mid section of the book) is \\"litely\\" handled - but it does make one go to other sources to check out Wellington and Byron and King George - so there are fun history facts to check on.And then, in the last third of the book, things really start to happen - the man with the thistledown hair is a fully realized villian, and his victims are indeed pitiable. (One of them, Steven Black, has a wrap-up that is worth the whole 800 pages.)By the last 200 pages everything is just absolutely swimming along. Gads, Clarke even introduces a classic (perfect) heroine (Emma Greysteele)! Everyone is busy huffing and puffing to perfection. Small irritating people grow into bad guys, bland people start to really deserve rescuing, the magicians are brewing up real magic, and Good and Evil start to be recognizable. The ending is heart-thumping - everyone is busy busy busy interacting. The best part is that Dr. Norrell and Jonathan Strange have developed into a dual magical entity - it's quite wonderfully done.So, after the first 150 pages I would have said the book was a 2. After 500 it was a 3. And by the end it was terrific - 4 stars! This is a book that you need to keep with 'til the end. Well done!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"In general I dislike fantasy books. Harry Potter excepted, most strike me as third rate derivatives of Lord of the Rings. So I bought Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell for my mother, & read the beginning just out of curiosity. After only two pages I knew I was in for a treat, and so it proved. I haven't enjoyed a book so much for years!There are a very few books that I wish I could somehow erase from my memory, just to have the pleasure of reading them again for the first time. Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell is one of those.Ms Clark has an imagination easily the equal of J.K.Rowling. The story is packed with memorable images - a fleet of battleships conjured out of rain; a wooden mermaid on a ship's prow, who, when animated, uses all the insults learnt from generations of sailors. The author's descriptions of sounds and colors are quite haunting: 'not quite blue, not yet lilac, not quite grey - the color of heartache'. Also like Harry Potter, everything and everyone is perfectly & evocatively named, some of the names of spells are wonderful.This magical environment is superimposed not on an English boarding school this time, but on Regency England with its stock cast of upstairs & downstairs characters, mad kings, foppish gentlemen callers and Napoleonic generals. Ms Clark merges the magical with the mundane in a completely natural way. 'In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, faries in England were fond of adding to their magic, exhortations to random collections of Christian saints. Fairies were baffled by Christian doctrine, but they were greatly attracted to saints...' The Duke of Wellington's battles in Spain, with the aid of a military magician, seem quite plausible.And the footnotes! The footnotes are almost the best part of the book. Everyone who reads it has a favorite footnote. There are nearly 200 of them, ranging from pithy observations ('It is all very well in fairy-tales to ask, \\"Who is the fairest of them all?\\" But in reality no magic, fairy or human, could ever be persuaded to answer such an imprecise question.') to extensive self-contained short stories, to explanations for the magical layman - my favorite being the important difference between 'books of magic' and 'books about magic'. Books of magic are rare and precious in this story - sought after by everyone, obsessively collected and guarded by Mr Norrell, and carefully described, in the ever-present footnotes, by the author. Books have such power; when Mr Strange at last manages to enter Nr Norrell's forbidden secret library, something momentous just has to happen...We recognise people like Mr Norrell & Mr Strange in every era and many endeavours. Norrell is a cautious 'by the book' practical magician taught by years of study. He considers modern magic a gentlemen's profession, wants it regulated by the government, performs dull 'public service' magic to protect coastlines and so on, and disavows 'fairy magic' as a dangerous throwback to more primitive times. Mr Strange has a natural practical ability, a disaster waiting to happen when combined with his obsession with the Raven King, aka the Magician King, the Black King, the 'magician par excellence' who centuries ago ruled northern England, where the stones and trees still remember him...Ironically though it is Mr Norrell, in sorcerer's apprentice fashion, whose magic conjures up what he most scorns yet fears - the Faerie King, referred to only as, 'the gentlemen with the thistle-down hair', whose anarchic presence thoughout the book is both entertaining and malevolent.No review can convey how enjoyable this book is. Writing about it makes me want to read it again. It's a real book of magic, worth 10 stars."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Where people are getting the idea that this is Harry Potter for grown ups is WAY beyond me. It's actually better! Think Jane Austen on magic and you've pretty much got it. I also found it strange that someone said they couldn't relate to the characters--that they were cold. Not only did the characters seem real, but so did the world that Ms.Clarke created for them. I'd give this book three thumbs up (magic, you know--I can always conjure up another thumb if needed.)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I saw that the hype has lasted and got this book for my kindle without previewing it. The idea is great- if I were at a party and some one described it to me I would say \\"This has to be a book! Write this book please!\\" Unfortunately, the execution is terrible. I've since seen that it has been called Dickensian- as if his books were slow paced slogs filled with unfunny jokes and boring, clueless, passive characters. What I think is going on here is that the writer believes she is being Austenian- that her feeble attempts at wit and breaking the fourth wall are like Jane Austen's addresses to her reader. They are not. I read about 20 pages, saw which was the wind was blowing (or not blowing, nothing much happens) and decided to skim the book until the plot kicked in because it is by a first time author. I skimmed quite a bit- the plot does NOT kick in. I never thought a book with a fantasy/ magical premise could be so incredibly boring. How do you make reading about magic as dull as reading about loading a dishwasher? I almost wonder if the premise of this book came from a different mind than the one who wrote it up- the writing is so pretentious, so cautious, so ponderous, SO BAD. Spare yourself and read a Diana Wynne Jones book instead. Any DWJ book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I only read about half of this book which still came out to 400 pages. The story drags along worse than any other book I have read. I was confused by all the praise. Perhaps the readers who liked it are more history rather than fantasy readers. It dragged along and even when magic did occur it was described in such a mater of fact manner that it had no impact. The Characters really had no major redeeming characters and after one of the characters had a loved one die clearly by magic they did nothing about it.The part of the book that had so much to work with regarding the Napoleonic Wars could have been so exciting but was another event to be ticked off in the chapters.If you are used to more fast paced or even remotely exciting fiction DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. If you like stories that are well researched alternative histories where the characters are secondary to the setting you might like this book. Overall: Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"When looking for something to read, I always check out Amazon reviews.This book came highly recommended from many readers and it sounded like a good story.I made it through 465 pages of this 800+ page book.At that point, I simply could not keep reading and began to skim.Finally, I just gave up, life's too short to be this bored.Nothing interesting happens in this incredibly long book. There is ONE section where the maincharacter raises the dead and that's actually interesting. You think it's going to get goodand then... nothing.While the book was nicely written, there has to be some sort of point and something of interest for the reader.It just went on and on..."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It's interesting to read the comments here. JS&MN; absolutely blew me away. I didn't want it to end. I can't wait for the sequel. And I really can't wait for the movie (s). So I'm surprised to find that not everyone loved it, and in fact, some people utterly hated it so much that they gave up after a couple hundred pages.The most common complaints if I have it right: too slow and boring, Mr. Norrell and Jonathan Strange not likeable and/or traditionally heroic, Mr. Strange takes forever to appear, feats of magic presented as commonplace, story aimless, pointless, meandering, too many secondary characters of little or seemingly no consequence, Jane Austen-ish, Dickensian prose not appropriate. In short: a stuffy, dull, pretentious, overlong slog.Even many of those who liked or loved the book seem to concede that it takes a while to get moving. Personally, I found Volume 1, focusing on Mr. Norrell's efforts to responsibly re-introduce magic to England, to be gripping and Susanna Clarke's careful, considered construction of her awesomely imagined, alternative England to be a strength, not a weakness. The premise is irresistible. Magic exists in Victorian England, but no one practices it anymore except miserly, Scrooge-like Mr. Norrell, who has hoarded virtually all of the important books of magic in existence. The reader knows things cannot go on like this forever, that Norrell is tempting fate and headed for a fall. Naturally, there will be others who will threaten his prized collection of books and challenge his supremacy as the sole practicioner of English magic, and we can guess, based on the title, that his chief nemesis will be none other than Jonathan Strange. This understanding creates great tension and expectation in the reader. Who is Jonathan Strange? Where is he? When will he arrive? How will Mr. Norrell react? Strange, before he ever physically appears, haunts the first volume and Mr. Norrell like some mythological figure, and Clarke teases out this tension masterfully.Did I like Mr. Norrell? No. His actions often infuriated me. But he is not all bad. He sincerely wants to legitimize English magic and his repressed passion for this cause, is, ironically, contagious. The reader roots for him to loosen his grip on his monopoly, share his wisdom. He is a fascinatingly selfish, spiteful character in the tradition of Ebenezer Scrooge - his own worst enemy - and Clarke writes him in such a way that, despite his faults, one holds out hope for his redemption.Strange is even more complex. Thankfully, he isn't impossibly handsome or darkly mysterious (at least not at first). He's actually rather average, if just a little bit \\"off.\\" He starts out as a gentleman, respectable, with an \\"ironic smile,\\" someone who better fits polite society's image of a practicing magician than Mr. Norrell. Despite their many differences they share one important thing in common - they are both ordinary men grappling with extraordinary forces that they deceive themselves they can ever fully understand on their own.Too cluttered with secondary characters? Who? Drawlight, Lascelles, Childermasss, Vinculus, Arabella, Lady Pole, Lord Wellington, and even the King of England? All of them play some vital role in moving the story forward or fleshing out the general atmosphere, and Clarke brings each of these characters to life with great humor, compassion, and at times, a devilish, or fairie-ish, sense of mischief. (One pictures Clarke biting her lip to keep from grinning as she pens Drawlight in particular.) Part of the fun in reading the novel is in envisioning which actors will play these great character parts in the film.Like many of the best novels, JS&MN; boasts a subplot that could easily stand by itself - the tragicomic coupling of the cheerfully amoral fairie The Gentleman With The Thistledown Hair and the proud, put-upon black servant Stephen Black, held captive under the fiendish, if well-meaning Gentleman's enchantment. The Gentleman has the potential to be a breakout character much like Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean. Someone on IMDB suggested Jude Law. I could see that.Clarke's depiction of magic, to me, was refreshing, authentic, and completely believable. Her decisions are impeccable. She's never groping or going on autopilot like the writers of standard fantasy. Her choices always seem inspired, organic, original. In so many fantasy books, magic is everywhere and therefore familiar. Here, at least in the first volume, it is rare and, as a result, exhilarating. Clarke is a visually inventive writer and her imagination is so rich that in the process of writing a great novel she has also written what should make a major motion picture. The imagery of the third volume, where magic is now exploding all over England, is staggering.JS&MN; has been criticized for trying to be too many things: Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Patrick O'Brian during the battle scenes, JK Rowling, JRR Tolkien. It doesn't try to be many things, it is many things. As all great novels should be. It's not labeling itself, and I think that's why some hardcore fantasy fans are left cold. It's a safe bet that most fantasy fans are not into the works or writing style of Jane Austen. JS&MN; may not be a work of genius, and it may not be the greatest English novel of the past 70 years as Neil Gaimen has claimed. (Who has read all of the English novels of the last 70 years?) But it is great storytelling, a brilliant expansion of The Sorcerer's Apprentice idea. And Susanna Clarke is one hell of a sorcerer.Another contributr here remarked \\"Brilliant but not for everyone.\\" What brilliant is?"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Recommended by a grad school literature professor, this book became a favorite before I had read even a hundred pages. Not merely a story but a universe of perpetually astonishing sophistication, complexity, and authenticity. I can only wonder how long Ms. Clarke must have inhabited this universe, plot points and characters weaving themselves in reveries at leisurely afternoon teas. I'd love for her write one of the peripheral books of magic (apparently fully realized in her mind) that play such an active role in the story... perhaps Lanchester's \\"Language of Birds\\"?"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I got it as a birthday gift. In recent times with two children, it has been almost impossible for me to read anything serious, but I ended up reading this 1000-odd page book within a week! Set in the beginning of the 19th century, it starts off full of the atmosphere of old England (York) - where gentlemen were what they ought to be ;-) and there was a \\"propah\\", unhurried way of doing things.After Harry Potter (which also I loved, especially the first and last books) I wondered whether there could be anything \\"new\\" in a magic/fantasy type novel - I was quite wrong! This book is quite different in its dealing with magic and writing style, and has its own brand of \\"magical\\" atmosphere.The author's evocative descriptions of \\"the Other Lands\\" - or magical neighbouring lands of England, takes the reader into those lands. While reading it, I felt transported to York, and London and Faerie (land where Fairies live), and the land of \\"Lost hope\\", and Venice, and any place the characters chose to go. Skillfully interwoven with magic is the practical use of magic: unlike in Harry Potter, where the magicians live in a world of their own and rarely mix with \\"muggles\\", here, magicians are just normal human beings who have chosen to study magic and practice it as a career. Just like someone trains to be a doctor, or wild-life warden, or whatever!The writing style is not only evocative, but also direct and simple. There are some quaint spellings like \\"shew\\" for \\"show\\" and \\"chuse\\" for \\"choose\\" - but these only add to the old world character of the novel. Characters are drawn well and stay consistent throughout their \\"life\\".I particularly loved:- the concept of magically recovering the \\"essence\\" of a person long dead, from the legacy they left behind.- the build-up for the Raven King, and how his magic uses everything in nature (stones, river, trees..).- the concept of the King's roads leading naturally between England and Faerie, and entering such a road via a mirror.I will say no more of the story, read for yourself!The only negative about the novel contents, I thought was the rather long foot notes (some of which cover 3/4's of the page)! Another minor negative was the small print size - not the sort of \\"easy read\\" typeset I am used to nowadays!It has its share of war descriptions, quiet but potent violence, and death - so not recommended if you are particularly affected by such stuff.Apart from that, I would say it is definitely worth owning / gifting.

As a fan of some of the Victorians myself, I found Clarke's imitation of their writing style and novelistic structure to be quite precise. Her concerns with the human soul, with survival after death, and with the struggle of good and evil within a human being are both modern and typical of the 19th century.The reader slowly walks into a world that is partly familiar and partly quite bizarre. It's the English drawing-room, calling-card era, with the overlay of magic, an art that is allegedly long forgotten. Clarke's mock-scholarly footnotes are charming.However, the book takes just a bit too long to get started and to invite the reader in."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"After wandering all the King's Roads, being shewn Every Possible Magic Phenomena No Matter How Tiny, and just when my eyelids were starting to close like flames being extinguished from a gaslamp, I finally cast a spell for myself of *Courage & Muster (*\\"Courage & Muster\\" appeared in the 1135 publication of Lawrence Musseltree's The Reckoning of Things to Come) to give myself the strength to carry on.

Clarke tells a story of alternate history and English magic during the Napoleonic wars.The book itself took ten years to write, and the craftsmanship shows through.Set during the reign of King George, we meet a group of theoretical magicians (those that study magic but are unable to practice it), who discover the existence of an actual magician, Mr Norrell. They challenge him to display his power, and if so, they will cease to be magicians in any sense.He does, and all those who agreed (all the York Magicians but one John Segundus) cease referring to themselves as magicians.When asked to perform a resurrection, however, Norrell relies on powers beyond his own, asking a boon of a fairy, a gentleman with thistle-down hair, who makes an ill bargain in order to bring the woman back from the dead.Jonathan Strange, the other capable magician apprentices himself to Norrell after the two encounter a strange street magician who utters an ominous prophecy. And that's just the first part.The novel takes the reader on a journey, through the Faerie realm, and across Europe during the war. It's written in a voice evoking that era, and is complete with the feelings of the age, including misogynistic writing (even though the author herself is female).Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell is a great read, but a challenging one at that. The illustrations illuminate the passages as much as the extensive footnotes referencing works both factual and false.If you are a fan of modern English Fantasy, you might find yourself enjoying Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell. If Clarke had more work in publication, she might rival favorite authors like Moorcock and Gaiman for top spot."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is now one of my favorite books of all time but let me preface that with saying that I didn't even think I'd finish it while I was trudging through the first 400 -- yes 400! -- pages. Not that they were so bad. They were witty and eloquent in that long-winded British kind of way. But where was this story going? Character after character was introduced until I could scarcely keep track of why Stephen Black the butler and this \\"man with thistle down hair\\" and Jonathan Segundus and many others were even in the book at all. \\"Just get on with Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell already,\\" I began saying to my book.And then something happened. Somewhere around P. 400 -- yes 400 -- these random characters that had been methodically built up independently suddenly began to collide in a way that made me realize Clarke herself is a magician as mighty as the ones she writes about. How delightful to watch a puzzle that you have been dumbfounded by come together piece by piece. I read the second 400 pages in two days and was sad to see the book end. It's a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The first four pages of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, (at least in my edition, the 2005 paperback) is a list of praise and quotes from reviews as to the quality of this novel. Coming across this, and the size of the book, is extremely daunting to a reader, and the prospect of watching to see if a novel comes to the level of quality so proclaimed is a challenge in and of itself.Susanne Clarke has fashioned a masterpiece of English literature, one that throws back to a Victorian style, rich in prose and story, and is easily one of the greatest works of fantasy literature that I have ever read, rivaling some of the great classics of the genre, from J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings to Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a complicated, extraordinary and exceptional work, and I am very pleased to have read.The story is one that is complicated and fascinating. It begins in 1806, and tells the tale of two magicians who come forward in England with the intent to return English magic to a nation that has long been without it. Mr. Norrell is the first to come forward, and begins to bring magic back into the world. He is shortly thereafter joined by a fellow magician under his tutorage, Jonathan Strange, and they begin to study and practice their new craft. Thus begins a tale of friendship, rivalries, prophecy and history. Some of the greatest themes of literature are present here, but the story plays out in a truly original manner. There is the story of the differences between the master and apprentice, and within that context we see a number of themes; old verses new, tradition verses innovation.This story takes place during the Napoleonic wars, which play an integral part of the direction of the characters. Interwoven throughout the story are well known figures: King George II, Lord Wellington, Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, Lord Byron, and others, which give this story a rich historical context that borders on alternative history, but in a manner that far surpasses other known authors of the genre, such as Harry Turtledove, but in a way that far surpasses his works. Indeed, Clarke seems to pay as much attention to detail as J.R.R. Tolkien in his own works, with precise and detailed language to describe the events of the story.The story takes place throughout England and continental Europe, and feels like it. From the dialogue to the characters and to the descriptions, it is a quintessential product of England, and draws upon its long history and literature. Oftentimes, I would find myself reading and feeling much like I was back in the country, something that I have longed for much lately. I know of a number of the locations in the book, as well as a good deal of the history of this time, and Clarke's novel falls well within the context of the time and history here.This book is a very complicated one, and having finished it only a short while ago, I am still processing all that has happened. It is written far differently from most other books - much as in the style of Jane Austin, from what I've read and it takes some time to get used to. Indeed, I read this book in two parts - I had started reading it almost a year or two ago, and put it aside to read something more accessible. Returning to it just a little while ago, I found that once I got into the story and characters, the pages flew by. But beyond the normal story here is a book that is rich with story. Throughout the pages there are footnotes of references to the author's world, giving the readers insights into the surrounding history that helps to shape this story. A number of these footnotes could be an entire story within themselves, and Clarke has singlehandedly created her own mythology that not only stands well on its own, but is so detailed that one could almost mistake it for a mythological history in and of itself.This book is a stunning debut of a new author. Looking back over the first couple of pages of praise that has been bestowed upon this book, I can see why it has been rated so highly by reviewers and fellow authors of the genre, and I am thrilled to say that this novel lives up to all expectations. Clarke has brought forth a complicated, yet intriguing, read to the fantasy genre, one that is most likely destined to become a classic, and one that, despite its real world historical contexts, is highly original, innovative and entertaining, one that I am sure to return to, and highly recommend to all fans of the genre, or a good read in general.(Originally posted on my blog)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Great book -- Clarke weaves a story in the style of Jane Austen but makes magic the centerpiece. She has you wondering whether magic really has been an area of academic concern for centuries!It may sound goofy (considering the ample amount of pages), but I would have liked another 300 pages! The end came too soon!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"If you enjoy the writing of Jane Austen or Henry Fielding you will enjoy this book. Wry, engaging, full of thoroughly interesting characters, and English from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"If Dickens had ever written fantasy, he might have produced a work like this. Clarke's style owes a great deal to Dickens, including her way of giving little background stories on the various characters - Jonathan Strange's manservant Jeremy Johns, for example. She is happy to provide footnotes of reference to the reader, of the history of magic and the life of the mysterious John Uskglass, also known as the Raven King, a human abducted by fairies as a child who returned as an adult to rule the North of England for 300 years.The names invoke Dickens as well; where Dickens gave us such names as Chuzzlewit, Pecksniff, Trotwood, Nickleby, and Headstone, Clarke delights with Greysteel, Sixsmith, Drawlight, Godbless, Childremass, and more.Unlike all other modern writers I've read, Clarke doesn't put modern-day people into 19th-century settings. Her characters ARE of the 19th century, with customs and ways of thinking intact. Even the spellings are accurate - \\"chuse\\", \\"surprize\\", \\"any thing\\", and a few I didn't know, such as \\"headach\\". Her language is perfect; her characters don't have a trace of the modern era about them.As with other readers, I didn't want to read this book too quickly, even though I was dying to know what came next. It's simply too good to rush through, and Clarke's language is so eloquent that it must be savored.I can only assume that Clarke has read all of the works of Dickens; the truth about Vinculus echoes one of the themes in Dickens' novel \\"Barnaby Rudge\\". It's rather like viewing a familiar landscape, one seen many times before, through the eyes of another. Dickens, too, used Venice as a backdrop (in \\"Little Dorrit\\"); Clarke's London is the same as his.This may well be the best modern novel I've ever read. More, please!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"For those seeking a long engrossing book which is entertaining as well as being challenging to the intellect, I heartily recommend Susannah Clarke's Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norell. Yes, it is very long--a positive aspect for me, as it puts off the chore of finding another book--and it uses a style of language which some may find vexingly archaic. I LOVED it! Give me vexingly archaic any day, so long as it is flawlessly executed, which this is. A lively cast of characters, amusing anecdotes, and much vivid historical detail is only part of the charm--in addition, the author brings us a dark and Byronic--Lord Byron is actually a character in the novel--world within a world: the magical world of the Raven King. Not only engrossing but enchanting!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Mr. Norrell has kept to his library for years studying and practicing magic until he is invited to become a member of a magicians' society in York. When Mr. Norrell shows his power he reveals himself to be England's first practical magician in hundreds of years and sets out to be his country's savior from Napolean. Everything goes according to plan until he makes a deal with an otherworldly gentleman only called \\"the gentleman with thistledown hair\\" who sets in motion a magical plot that could bring down the monarchy. Another wrinkle in his plan happens when he takes on a flashy young gentleman, called Jonathan Strange, as his apprentice whom he loves dearly but can't control.Susanna Clarke's \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" is an amusing, but way too long, romp through an alternate history of the Napoleonic Wars and English fairy and magical lore. The characters are vivid, the story is compelling, and the depth of background in her alternate history is breathtaking. The problem is that she crammed too much in. Footnotes on backstory and amusing anecdotes about fairy lore are helpful in understanding up to a point, but after 500 pages I thought she was just trying to cram in things the editor would normally have cut out of the text of the story itself. A couple of times I just got tired and put the book away. This is why I give it a three instead of a four.Having said that this book is definitely worth reading. You just have to have a lot of patience. The last 200 hundred pages flew right by."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Strange & Norrell is a surprisingly good and enjoyable fantasy book. It's not your typical fantasy with elves & hobbits and the like, but rather a history of England in the early 1800s with two competing magician personalities. Jonathan Strange is outgoing and experimental, whereas his mentor, Mr. Norrell is cautious and conservative with his magic. There are numerous subplots and extensive footnotes, the book reads almost like a history ( I mean this as a compliment.)The book is quite long, but very readable and never tiresome. Despite all of the characters, one is able to keep them all straight as we zip between different settings. The beginning of the novel concentrates on Norrell's introduction of magic and it's limited uses against Napoleon. Later, a rival magician and Norrell's apprentice, Jonathan Strange goes to Spain and uses magic in a more unconventional fashion battling Napoleon's army.The two inevitably have a falling out and more magic consumes the novel in the last third of the book. Despite it's length, I really enjoyed the book and found no tedium whatsoever. Fantasy is usually not my cup of tea, but this is not your typical fantasy novel, in some respects it's in a class of its own"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"For those of you who prefer your books time-tested for quality, I believe this book to be worthy of reading again and again; it is my hope that our contemporary readers will, in time, elevate Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell to the level of a classic. Suzanna Clarke crafts a tale that is designed for those who have an attention span for literature of the 19th century, but rather with a cunning imagination that is tangibly surreal. I can only apologize for the quality of my own writing...I am a far superior painter who has read and listened to this book six times over the past 3 years and I have not exhausted my delight in her word choice, the development of her characters, and her bizarre use of pineapples.

We wonder if the writer will ever be able to create anything so marvelous again.

And I am certain he's right -- though I haven't read much of the genre. This book is hard to beat. The writing is a sheer delight. Ms. Clarke is having such a good time with her inventions and her characters that you practically have no choice but to enjoy yourself too. I particularly enjoyed her ruminations upon cats. And I loved many of the individual sentences, including this one: \\"The King said nothing, but he tapped his nose and looked very sly.'' Mr. Norrell is one of the best-drawn characters I've encountered in literature. He is a formidable scholar and magician who is vain, myopic, frightened, reprehensible, childlike and yet somehow sympathetic. Some real-life figures - Lord Byron, the Duke of Wellington, King George III - enliven the story as well. I had a funny sensation as I read along. Nearly every book or movie or TV show about magic that I can remember builds part of the plot around the idea that the hero must overcome everyone else's disbelief. For some reason, it was a relief to find a story in which the magic is simply accepted as fact. I must find a quibble, and here it is: I was a bit confused by the ending, and I lost track of one of the novel's villains; I'm still not sure what happened to him. At first I was a bit intimidated by the sheer physical size of the novel; it's a load to carry around in a backpack or briefcase. And I worried I might be put off by a somewhat old-fashioned writing style and a bunch of footnotes. I needn't have worried. The footnotes are charming, and Ms. Clarke's style is, well, enchanting. \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell'' is great fun - a deeply funny, satisfying novel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I'm not going to leave an elaborate review as I'm still reading but so far this book is very engaging. Humor is dry, but amusing. Book reads increadibly well and for those that like magic, 19th cent. England, British humor, the book is an enjoyable one. I plan on keeping it on the bookshelf for when my kids are old enough to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Ms. Clarke is a tremendous writer who can conjur up humor in any situation via her perfect use of words and language. I find myself smiling several times each page although there are very few true humourous scenes in the book. Rarely do I enjoy a book largely because of the writing (e.g. John Irving), usually modern authors are way over the top, but Ms. Clarke never takes herself or her characters too seriously and the book speeds along, even at 800 or so pages. My only regret is that we may have to wait another 10 years for more books from Ms. Clarke."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I let this book sit on my bookshelf for about two years before I finally read it. I'm ashamed to admit that I was somewhat turned off by its immense size -- I kept thinking of how the act of holding the book while reading was going to activate my carpal tunnel, and I wished I could have divided it into four smaller volumes just for ease of holding.My physical ailments aside, I'm so glad I finally decided to start this book, because I just loved it. I loved the formal dialogue and gentle pacing, and I sort of found it jarring when I'd finish reading for the evening, and have to return to the \\"real world\\". I enjoyed getting lost in old England. I also loved the footnotes, which were full of fun stories or just entertaining information. The dry humour was unexpected and appreciated.If there'd been a sequel, I would have immediately run out and purchased it when I finished reading. As it was, the book I read after this seemed so thin and shallow and disappointing. It was like eating an Oreo after having a slice of chocolate ganache cake."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is largely a dual biography of the two named characters, English magicians of the Napoleonic period who are at various times rivals, friends, and enemies. Their story is told against a fictional history of England in which Northern England was ruled for centuries by John Uskglass, the Raven King, a great magician who ruled kingdoms both in England and Faerie. Uskglass inspired generations of English magicians, and details and anecdotes of these are found both in the text and the whimsical footnotes.English magic in this book has an impressive history, but by the era of Mr Norrell all English students of magic have for around 250 years been just that - students with knowledge of theoretical and historical magic, but no ability to cast the meanest spell. Norrell changes that when he makes the statues of York Cathedral speak and becomes the first true English magician of the modern era. He remains the only one until the young son of a minor landowner, Jonathan Strange, discovers his own remarkable talents.Norrell and Strange are very different men and magicians. Norrell is obsessed with dominating magic, and tries to drive any potential rivals away, not reassured by the fact that his own abilities are so superior as to render any true rivalry impossible. His skill is fueled by his unparalleled library of magical literature. With limited access to Norrell's great library, even after becoming his student, Strange is forced to rely more on his creativity and imagination.The story is told in a style deliberately reminiscent of the British novels of the era - for reasons I can't quite explain, it seems especially suggestive of Thackeray. Like a real Victorian novel it is long, and occasionally the plot moves more slowly than in most modern fantasies, but the skillful writing and striking characters more than make up for any pacing difficulties.It's a pleasure, and entirely too rare, to find a really original fantasy which owes no debt - absolutely none - to Tolkien's rings, wizards, and hobbits. In that sense, this book reminds me of some of John Crowley's work, but is, I think, much more successful."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Susanna Clarke literally creates a fascinating alternate universe to 19th century England. Her work reads like a thorough study of the time written in the prose of the period. This is, in fact, its primary downfall. The language is so rich (with purposeful alternate spellings and a host of footnotes) that it reads like an over the top dessert. The mind almost drowns in the words of this book. As for plot, it is a rather singular study of two \\"magicians\\" and their impact on the government of England and families of the elite in whose circles they navigate.At more than 700 pages, the book is not for the light reader. There are complexities which are revealed that may be lost on anyone without a smattering of understanding of English culture or history. The madness of King George, Wellington's view on the Napoleanic war and the class system in England are all touched upon in Clarke's work. This is in addition to a created mythology surrounding northern English folktales and lore.Ms. Clarke's work is slow. It unwinds much as real life might, with periods of little activity and not much plot development. Many of her critical characeters exist in only the barest sketch of detail, while several ancilliary persons are well fleshed out and detailed. I found this inconsistency frustrating as I frequently wanted to know more about some individuals and found myself invested in lesser characters. The two characters who most struck me for their portrayals were Jonathan Strange, the upstart magician, and a servant, Stephen Black. It was the latter character who evoked the greatest symapthy and connection (or connexxion - as Ms. Clarke woud write it). Black's struggle between duty and desire was both relevant and real. I commend Ms. Clarke for capturing this so well in her text.If you are prepared for a deep and detailed work which will likely lead one to further read about the period - by all means take up this book. However, be warned - there are few shallow spots upon which to rest."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I have recently finished listening to this book on CD and everytime I put it on I was transported to old England. I had attempted to read this book a couple of times but would get a little bored so I decided to listen.

I just don't see anything here worthy of merit. The characters are wooden and the plot all but non-existent.I would say that Ms. Clarke is a British Anne Rice--not a compliment in my book.

I found the characters interesting, the plot engaging, and the book to be truly imaginative (something that can rarely be said of adult literature anymore).

It's a challenge for both muscle coordination and eyes. I love a lengthy novel, the longer the better for me, but this book is set aside for the time being.

They're distracting at first, jumping back and forth between the text and the side stories, but after a while she gets the flow and doesn't make them 6 page footnotes anymore. They are interesting stories so kudos to her for making so many neat side stories. The book takes a while to get into, like I said. Seriously, it's going to be a few hundred pages. It's overkill, yes, but you'll know the characters so well by the end, that it's like you know them in person and know exactly how they think and act.It's hard to say if I would recommend this book to someone unless I knew their reading style. Most people won't wait hundreds of pages for a book to get good but if you know an avid reader, then I'm sure this book will be appreciated.It has weasley characters, dashing, funny, sympathetic, malicious, and inspiring characters. It has tension and so much suspense toward the last few hundred pages that it could almost kill you. It has magical history, magical places, and magical spells galore!

It's always a bit of toot toot to read the silly books they choose (last month it was some insipid tripe by their old favorite Jeffrey Eugenides) and make snide comments from both ends while sipping barley wine or (in this case) winter warmer.In any case, this book looked more promising than the normal Big (and I do mean BIG) Readers Book Club fare based on the historical aspect and magic (Hoppy loooooves doing magic tricks). Unfortunately, I was to be disappointed once again. This is a big book (something like 800 pages) and as is often the case with such things, is in serious need of an editor. I foolishly expected some good characters and development (based on size), but was instead treated to shallowness (something I'm surrounded by at work, so I do recognize it) and longwinded paragraphs full of misssspelllings. I don't like that. And I didn't like all the footnotes. Fraser does this and as much as I enjoy his novels (they are very good), I don't like the footnotes.

I would have liked to read a book about the solely about the Raven King.Overall-Too long and I don't know what it was with the characters the author meant the dialog to be funny but every single character in the book just ended up sounding smug. I could never get past that part."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I fell for all the positive hype and purchased this book expecting greatness. I was sadly disappointed. The characters were not that interesting really and the plot tended to drag, very heavily at times. An adult Harry Potter this is not nor is it a \\"fantasy\\" novel as most would expect. I plodded through the whole thing, determined to find what everyone liked about this book. I guess I missed it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I kept thinking something would happen in this book but nothing every materialized. The best part of the book was the story at the end of the book, that had nothing to do with the main story, about the Raven King. If you like vanilla boring history books with no real hero or villain and no climax this is the book for you. Don't waste your time there are better books available."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I don't often bother with reviews, but this book is just so boring I feel compelled to type about it just to have gained some entertainment from it at all. I read a lot of books and this is only one of two books I've ever read in 25 years that I did not enjoy at all. I lost interest in it before I was half through it, but insisted on soldiering through it. It was so slow and dry it took me a full two weeks to finish it (though I can typically read a book this long in about three days).I let my sister borrow it with a warning that she wouldn't like it and she never finished it and is convinced I gave it to her to punish her for some insult she had paid me. It's a personal thing really, obviously plenty of people liked it. I honestly wanted to like it as well, but just couldn't."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Reading other reviews giving this 5 stars has become too much for me. I truly do not understand how anyone finished this book. The footnotes taking up sometimes overhalf the page made me feel like I was reading a research paper and not a very interesting one either. The best two words to describe this book are TEDIOUS and BORING!!! I read fiction for pleasure. There was no pleasure in reading a single page of this book. I did not finish it. I could think of no reason to continue to waste my time. I was not enjoying it or learning anything. I bought this based on reviews and wish I had saved my money."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book was absolutely horrible. I am a hugh fan of Harry Potter. JK Rowing creates a world of magic you can believe in and a main character that seems genuine, like a boy you could know. This book does none of the above. With a ridiculous amount of footnotes and a painful slow pace this author truly wasted my time. Don't let it happen to you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I agree with the last two posted reviews that this book was a huge disappointment. After reading some of the hype and reviews on Amazon, I thought I was in for a great fiction read that I would be hard pressed to put down. What a joke! I found it tedious, the footnotes irritating, and dull overall...I also did not get past page 150. Maybe I can sell on Ebay?"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"The lowest I can go is 1 star - this book is so boring, un-interesting, lacking any high- or low points, that it is app.799 pages too long. A cocking book for British Food might be more exciting and interesting. The Author moves along the story very slowy - the points are missing and the conclusion is just about the most awfull. The book could be written in one page - pupil fight teacher, teacher fight pupil - during that the consequences for the rest of the world is nearly horrible.Next to that, the plot is completely un-realistic and a kind of very sought for - The Author obviously hoped to be the next J.K. Rowling - but Harry Potter by many length beats Mr. Norrell and even though Harry Potter is a book for children - it's far better than this. Don't waste your money or time on this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"If it hadn't been for my strong determination to finish everything I start, I would have put this book down weeks ago. The first four hundred pages were soooooooo slow. I used to avoid the book, try to hide it somewhere and forget it, but this determination told me that I had to finish and know if it was worth the time. Having finished it last night I can say that it's a \\"good book\\". That's all I'd give it. Ask me in a month and I won't remember the plot nevermind the intricacies-- not exactly the stamp of a great novel. The last two hundred pages gripped me, I couldn't wait to turn the page, but did I really have to wade through 600 pages to get there? This book should have been edited to half its size... less is sometimes more. I wish someone had told Susanna Clarke that."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Just a look at several different reviews and you get the idea - people either love that book or are bored to death. I honestly tried - and reached about half through before I decided that life was too short to spend it on this volume.There is no plot - really, there isn't. The so called \\"well developed characters\\" are indeed, well developed - at the very beginning, but after that they simply do not change that much. Nothing happens for pages and pages. I do admit that the language is beautiful and text-wise it is good work.But \\"Lord of the Rings\\" keeps you in its magic spell when you read it, or \\"Big Fish\\" or \\"Time Enough For Love\\" or LeGuin's EarthSea books. They all have magic. This one doesn't - even though it is written about it. I simply did not want to meet any of the characters again and for me that's enough reason not to finish the book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I am the kind of reader who begins one book, then puts it down and takes up another, and another, until I find one that I absolutely must finish reading. Sadly JS&MN is not that book. I have been reading it since September of last year and am only halfway through. It is rare when this happens. The premise of the book is wonderful, but the execution of the story is done with such a slow pace and dry writing style that I find myself putting it down after a few pages. Frustrating! Susanna Clarke is a talented author, there is no doubt about that, but I despair of ever being able to get to the last page of this disappointingly dull novel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Not knowing Clarke's background it's hard to assume the authority to say this but at least from a reader's perspective she has entered the genre entirely unfettered by any preconceived notions of what fantasy novels should look like. Perhaps her fresh perspective is exactly what we needed. Strange & Norrell is neither one of the host of Harry Potter imitations, nor a Tolkien imitation, nor a New-Wave/hard-SF/Space-opera offering, nor (thankfully) some enormous world-building cycle in imitation of Robert Jordan. Her book is a burst of creativity and light on the fantasy genre and is completely : a re-creation of the 19th century novel dealing not so much with a system of magic but a system of British Thought. It is the sort of considered literature that will introduce many, many readers to the potential of fantasy literature who might otherwise have consigned it to a ghettoof exploitation and imitative vehicles. We believe that Clarke--along with Neal Stephenson operating from the science-fiction side--may have legitimized a path for other writers to explore speculative elements in their historical works where they have otherwise avoided. In fact, to understand how thoroughly Clarke has crossed genre lines, this is the current list from Barnes and Noble of \\"People who bought this book also bought:\\"The Shadow of the Wind Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n, Lucia Graves (Translator), Read by Jonathan DavisGilead Marilynne RobinsonThe Plot Against America Philip RothI Am Charlotte Simmons Tom WolfeSkinny Dip Carl HiaasenNot a fantasy book among them! Compare that with another popular and well-respected female author in Laura Resnick (In Legend Born, The White Dragon, and The Destroyer Goddess) who has all fantasy recommendations:Goddess of the Ice Realm David DrakeThe Grand Crusade Michael A. StackpoleThe King Betrayed Deborah ChesterThe Assassin's Edge Juliet E. McKennaImpossible Odds: A Chronicle of the King's Blades Dave DuncanFool's Fate (Tawny Man Series: Book 3) Robin HobbGoddess of the Ice Realm David DrakeWe don't point this out to cast aspersions on Resnick but rather acknowledge how insulated so many well-considered fantasy authors are and what a leap it is for Susanna Clarke to bring other readers inside.WHO SHOULD READ:There are two peculiar but vast audiences that will deeply appreciate this book: those readers who enjoyed Harry Potter from JK Rowlings (but were looking for something a bit more \\"mature\\" or \\"literary\\") and those readers who enjoyed Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle. One of the themes that appears to be operating in Hogwarts is the relationship between master and apprentice but it is a here fully developed and in full flower in Strange and Norrell. Stephenson's interweaving of science-fiction in to historical non-fiction--something we didn't think could possibly be equaled--is done exceptionally well by Clarke with the insertion of her magicians in to the times of the Napoleonic wars. It is a novel that carefully examines the clash of generations within the bright trappings of English humor, Victorian phrasing, and magic. It's a tremendous example of what can be accomplished with some literary talent and the courage to unfetter an imagination. Really a fine, fine effort that we can recommend to almost anyone with the stamina to tackle an 800 page book.WHO SHOULD PASS:As in many good works of literature, there is a lack of what we would call action. There is no open conflict in the sense of combat (though one duel). There is a lack of any inking of sexuality from any character. While it is easy to toss this sort of advice out, these lacks echo curiously in a book about conflict, about matrimonial love, and contains large sections actually within the battlegrounds of a war. The entire book, in some sense, is a purely intellectual enterprise--filled with purely intellectual delights. A good foil for Clarke is Stephen Pressfield's historical novels of Greece (The Gates of Fire, The Tides of War, The Last of the Amazons, and The Virtues of War). In Pressfield, we have books that are substantially about violence, conflict, and sex that are intellectual in nature but visceral in its theme. Clarke is precisely the opposite: her books are about the intellect and it is in this realm that she rewards--and rewards greatly! Readers should understand this entering her books and not be dismayed when her characters flatten at the point where one might expect a bit of adrenaline to begin coursing. In all other respects, however, this is a fabulous book.[...]"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Like many readers, I was intrigued by comparisons with the Harry Potter series. An epic set in late Georgian England with two magicians trying to return magic to the land sounded too much fun to pass up. The first few chapters established a wonderful sense of atmosphere- Ms. Clarke has a fantastic sense of worldcraft.Unfortunately, the story quickly begins to drag. This kind of novel depends on its characters, and while many of them are colorful, none are of them are appealing. In a good story, whenever a character I like is off stage, I find myself anxious to learn what's happening to him or her. In JS & Mr. N, I never felt concern for any of the characters. By the halfway point I lost all interest in any of their fates, but diligently read to the very end.If you're looking for an escapist adventure with characters that grow to feel like good friends, do not buy this book. If you want a good long read with lots of detail, and don't care too much about the characters, this might be a good choice."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This was recommended to me by a friend. He knows I love Dickens and said this book was like reading the same but with magic. When I read the prologue, I agreed and I began loving this book. But when I got to chapter 3, I realized the tone of the book had completely changed and I was not enjoying it. I did try because the writing is very good, but I couldn't make it beyond chapter 7 without giving up. I wish the book would have had the same comical flare that it did in the prologue. Not for me, but maybe for others."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Those of us who appreciate Terry Pratchett are familiar with the delight a well-placed footnote can add to a tale. Some of Ms. Clarke's footnotes are not quite as delightful as others, but many of them provide a little escape - a sort of \\"short story\\" break from the main novel.I picked this book up without having read a single review; no one had recommended it and the only thing I knew of it was reading the jacket there in the store. But I'm a sucker for a Big Book, so I bought it. As many others have commented, I had some trouble getting into it, and I did set it aside for a longish period of time after getting to perhaps the 150-page mark.Then I got the flu. I did not want to have to be up and down, back and forth to the bookshelves, so I picked up this behemoth of a book with (apologies, Ms. Clarke) the thought that perhaps I'd even be able to fall asleep. A curious thing happened then: I got into the groove. The pacing seemed just right, the plot moved - slowly, but steadily - and whenever I was tempted to get a bit bored, there was a lovely little fairy-tale footnote to revive my interests like a cool drink of water.A few months later, I was having a bout of insomnia, so I picked up the book - I didn't remember much about the plot from my flu-addled reading, but I did remember that it was a \\"slow starter\\" and figured it'd help me doze off. At 5 A.M. the next morning, I reluctantly set the book aside and got up to start my day, despite a completely sleepless night... and even though I was exhausted, I still had to get a little bit more reading in before bed that night.I've read it four or perhaps five times in total, and it gets better every time. Some people will never \\"get it\\" and will never be able to appreciate the layers and careful construction of the story - even the little bits that don't seem to go anywhere. They're the people, I reckon, who'd want to know why you need \\"all those strings\\" to make a handwoven Persian rug. Ms. Clarke doesn't sell her characters out, though - they move through their universe as people in that time, of those stations, did - dignified, stately, precisely, with a minimum of flash and drama. (The main exception being, of course, the Man With the Thistledown Hair, and it's in HIS \\"flash and drama\\" that most of the difficulties of the other characters are rooted.)I feel certain that there are deep philosophical references, symbolism and observations on our culture and human nature, and - as usual - they've all gone right over my head. That's all right, because I enjoyed it quite well without them.I have friends who insist (rather pretentiously, IMO) that they'll never read past the first 50 pages if a book hasn't \\"hooked\\" them by then - they say they don't have the time to \\"waste\\" on something that can't prove itself by then. I feel sorry for them, knowing that they would probably discard this book without ever discovering its hidden jewels."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Though I was told that this book was mesmerizing, fantastical and well written; it was still shockingly so. Rarely do I come upon a book overflowing with originality, elegance, and grace as well as humor. I laughed often while reading this book, it was somewhat embarrassing to be in a room alone chuckling to myself. This is my all time favorite book in all the world. Not like anything I have ever read before. I know the size of the book can be overwhelming for some, but if they can get over it they will be rewarded with a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I have never had a favorite book. I've read so many books that the notion of singling out just one title seemed to me absurd. Well, screw that mode of thinking. Ms. Clarke's debut novel is, hands down, my favorite book. It never ceased to surprise me. Why say more? Except, perhaps, God bless that woman's heart."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"For me, the intriguing feature of the book was that, rather than creating an illusionary setting for her story, the author placed the fantastic alongside the real. No Hogwarts School was required in this highly adult treatment. She departed from wizard-like portrayals of an occult science by artfully, if laboriously, depicting English gentlemen who sculpt magical acts within the structural and historical contexts of nineteenth century Europe. Parallel dimensions were progressively revealed as they interface with the \\"English world.\\"As a reader of some patience, I would have liked the laying of groundwork to be less pedantic. A full third of the way into the book, I found myself muttering, \\"Move on.\\" Nonetheless, the use of period language and culture was exquisite. But the dower tone of many early nineteenth century authors was also captured, which weighed on this reader's spirits. Also, having read all 782 pages, including voluminous footnotes, I gained little sense of the import or relevance to the story of the society of magicians. Nothing of substance tied it back in during the resolution scenes or chapters. Further, I expected to learn a soupcon about magic. Because the author focused on product, keeping process obtuse, what I took from the descriptions was that stumbling upon the real thing can be nasty business. That having been said, Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is still quiet worth the read.Many writing critics attribute to written works themes that were never intended by the authors. At that risk, I must say that I enjoyed the author's treatment of her character's interactions with magical arts and the resulting evolution of their personalities by intermingling elements of protagonist and antagonist. The author gave another fine polishing to the corrupting mirror of unchecked power and illustrated how that corruption transcends all sentient beings.Finally, despite giving Tinker Bell a bad name, the author's twist on the faerie community jumpstarted this reader's imagination as to folklore and parallel worlds that bridge earth, heaven and hell."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"To me, an audio book is made or broken by the narrator. While a terrible reader can ruin a great book, a brilliant performance can elevate a mediocre text and make it compelling. All of which makes the audio CD of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell a double whammy-- you have Susannah Clarke's tour de force debut, made perfect by Simon Prebble's riveting performance. Once I started listening, I simply could NOT stop.I'd compare Prebble's brilliance to that of the late Patrick Tull. I thought his O'Brien series performances couldn't be surpassed. As a body of work, this may be true, but JS&MN; is easily the best single work I've ever heard, and one that I listen to over and over with delight."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is one of the few books I've read that when I got to the end I wished that I could keep reading. Its long - no its loooooong, and there are a few times where I found myself losing interest, but once the momentum of the story really kicks in its brilliant. Almost the moment I finished this book I went to buy \\"The Ladies of Grace Adieu\\". I love the perfect way she built the concept of a world where magic once truly existed and makes it seem so real, that a small part of you wants the book to be part of a hidden and forgotten history. I hope the author is writing more sometime soon.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone.

However, if you long to immerse yourself in a great tale, that will take you to magical worlds--jump in! It's hard to believe that this is the Author's first book. The amount of detail in the story is incredible, and the characters are well developed. This is a story of magic, kings, fairies, and all sorts of mischief. I really enjoyed this book and recommend to all devoted bookworms:) If you liked The Magicians, and Harry Potter, and the Neil Gaiman stories, you will love this book!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"To seriously explore Susanna Clarke's JONATHAN STRANGE & MR. NORRELL, I recommend you have some quantity time on your hands. This voluminous (over 800 pages) novel set in a very different 19th Century England is crammed with subtext and footnotes; and although reading this book proves daunting Clarke's prose is engaging, humorous, and majestic. This is very much a tribute (and a throwback) to the complex, intricate English novels of the early 19th Century; if Austen and Dickens appeal to you, then by all means give STRANGE & NORRELL a go.So Clarke is a gifted writer, and the world she creates--an England with a rich heritage and history formed by magic and magicians, only the craft has been in disuse for years and years--is compelling and infinitely interesting. So what's the problem here? I can only describe the fundamental problem as a distinct lack of fluidity; this is a novel comprised of a series of rambling, often disjointed, sub-stories, ultimately with not very much happening at all. We are introduced to countless characters, many whom we meet only once and never see again; several minor characters are as unpredictable as they are unbelievable. And (to me) the focal point of the entire novel, the return of one John Uskglass (the Raven King), was so anticlimactic I can't begin to mask my disappointment. As I turned page after page (after page) I kept asking myself, \\"When is this story going to actually take off?\\" I was still asking myself that when I turned the final page.To be sure, the actions and adventures of Mr. Norrell (an ultra-conservative practitioner of magic who wishes to monopolize the craft all to himself) and his pupil Jonathan Strange (who wishes to revive a Golden Age of English magic) are wondrous and interesting, yet the lack of a seamless plot throughout has this novel ringing hollow. Am I glad I took the time to plunge into JONATHAN STRANGE & MR. NORRELL? Absolutely. Ultimately, was I a bit disappointed for all my time and effort? Again, absolutely.--D. Mikels, Esq."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"A first indicator of what you're going to experience in this book is the fact that the introduction is by Neil Gaiman. If you know of and like his work, this is your book ... although it is quite, quite different from much of what Mr. Gaiman does.With over 700 other customer reviews, I don't want to go into a lot of details about my personal experience with this work. I just want to record for the ages that I think this book is utterly entrancing in a slightly creepy way. It's a bent and dark world of astonishing characters and relationships and plots. It's not for your average fantasy reader at all, though. Whoever you are, be ready for something that might be unlike anything you've read in years."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I keep this book under my pillow at night.

Read it, and Enjoy it!!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a beautifully crafted novel. I would recommend it to all lovers of fiction and prose, not just to fantasy buffs. In fact, I think Clarke's writing might resonate more with readers who love literature, beautiful writing, and carefully developed characters than with some (but definitely not all) strictly fantasy readers. JS&MN is not really a fantasy novel after the tradition of most genre-fantasy novels. Story, character, and setting development take precedence over fast paced action, though this is done in such an exciting and fascinating way that the result is a world and characters so believable that the reader is completely drawn into them. And while the novel is long, the actual writing in this novel is not at all difficult to read or understand, and there is plenty of magic, fairies, and strange lands throughout. It's a fantasy novel about our own world-a realistic fantasy, an alternate retelling of our own past that asks and realistically answers the question we've all always wanted to know to know the answer to: What if magic really was real? It's true that this novel isn't for everyone-if you're looking for a light, fast paced summer read this might not be it. However, if you love magic, artful writing, unforgettable characters, as well as wonderful storytelling and plot, JS&MN is one of the best."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr.Norrell is, simply put, amazing. I am an avid reader and this is my favorite book of all time. The writing is beautiful and the story is captivating. You will not regret picking up this book!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"First I would recommend this book. At times it felt a little Harry Potter-esque in that they both deal with magic and England. Ms Clarke's novel, however, is set in the early 1800's and that at times feel much more Jane Austin than JK Rowling. What you should know first is the author's overuse of footnotes, as well as my hatred of them in general, especially in novels. I believe she has 180 or more and many go on for more than a page. She does cleverly use them to help set the mood in the reader's mind that magic is not only usual in England, but that the lack of current users in magic is more the problem. I, however, was frustrated by them thinking that I'd miss a fact or a subtlety if I didn't wade through them. They are not important. Also, Ms Clarke has a Michener way of going on ad nausea over details that aren't important to the story. This happened much more in the beginning than towards the middle or end. There, once she gets the plot underway, is where the story does grab you and makes you want to read on. The plot takes interesting turns that I never saw coming and the characters get more developed and better to understand. She also blends real history with fantasy in a way that more than once sent me to the Internet to confirm historic battles and events. This is a good and engaging novel. With firmer editing and some 300 pages less, it would have been great."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Let me start my saying it's rare that I love a book enough to give it five stars. I consider myself a \\"picky\\" reader; and it's rare that I'll find a book and find no faults with it. But I could find no faults with this one; I loved it from start to finish. I've seen several negative reviews on here from readers disappointed that it's not like Harry Potter (GOD FORBID!). No, this book isn't like Harry Potter. If you're looking for a light fantasy read (as much as I love Harry Potter--and I do--I still consider it \\"light\\" reading, as opposed to real literature), then Jonathan Strange isn't for you. This book blends fantasy (fairies, magic, etc.) with historical fiction (Engand in the 1880s), and does an excellent job doing so. A fun, wonderful read! I will be eagerly awaiting Susanna Clarke's next novel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Before reading this book several people told me it was being hailed as the 'Harry Potter for adults.' Something I found a bit odd, considering I thought Harry Potter was the Harry Potter for adults. Despite the fact that I do not agree with this speculation, Ms. Clarke has given us a tale as wondrous and intoxicating as those of everyone's favorite adolescent wizard. There was so much detail put into this novel that I don't find it hard at all to believe it took ten years to write. The footnotes used throughout to give depth to the rich history of magic Ms. Clarke has created were fantastic. At times I found myself so enraptured by the specifics that I could almost believe I was reading a history book rather than a work of fiction. The characters were well developed, and the settings were so vivid I still have scenes burned into my imagination. Hopefully they will remain there for years to come. For a first novel, Ms. Clarke shows exceptional skill in her craft, and I look forward with much anticipation for her next work. Any fan of words would do well to read this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Susanna Clarke penned the best novel written in 2004, period. As much as I loved Alan Hollinghurst's \\"the line of beauty\\", winner of the 2004 Man Booker prize, \\"Jonathan Strange...\\" should have won. Bah, literary gossip aside, this is a damn fine read. Think about fantasy written by W.M. Thackeray. No, wait, whenever I mention fantasy people think of either Harry Potter or sword&sorcery fare. Well, rest assured Clarke's novel has close to nothin' in common with that pulp. First of all, the language is utterly beautiful and the writing is brilliant. As for the topic: this carefully footnoted mammoth of a novel is closer to historic fiction than true and sound fantasy. It deals with the return of magic to england, almost-singlehandedly accomplished by one Mr. Norrel, a misanthropic, obscurantist, bibliophile and ultimately hilarious character. Magic is used for practical purposes, such as fighting Bonaparte and protecting her Majesty's kingdom. Things begin to change when Strange, a younger magician, becomes Norrel's pupil. He's far more curious about magic' \\"exotic\\" uses, like visiting magic kingdoms of the netherworld and summoning the Raven King, once Britain's fairy ruler. The friendship between the two magicians turns into rivalry and....I won't give the plot away, suffice it to say that this is a page-turner. One little complaint: the ending seemed a bit rushed, meaning that mrs. clarke probably had her editor's breath on her neck. Anyway, read it and you won't feel disappointed! Allegedly, it took 10 years in the making. My only hope is that Mrs. Clarke, under pressures from her editor, won't turn into a bestseller factory and dish out one novel a year because that would in all likelihood spoil the quality of her writing."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Many of the customer reviews make much of the page length of this book, noting that the length is amplified by the inclusion of many footnotes. As we \\"read\\" the book by listening to the cd, this did not present an issue. In fact, it enhanced the experience. Since we were listening to it together, we were much more aware of the laugh-out-loud humor it contained. We are both avid readers, but thoroughly enjoyed the extra dimension that sharing this cd version afforded. Mr. Prebble's reading is superb. We recently \\"read\\" (thanks to Jim Dale) Books 4 and 5 of the Harry Potter series in this manner, and our enjoyment of those books led us to chose this cd. Messrs. Prebble and Dale sound like they're having a whale of a time with the accents and voices these books contain. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I usually never give a book this much time to get me involved. It was a gift from a well respected fellow reader. So I felt I had to give it the benefit of the doubt. I strongly urge those who wish to put the book down to continue. If once the first chapter in the Jonathan Strange section is finished, and you have not yet gotten into it, then put it down, but it gets much more interesting from here. The characters become more realized, and the historical and fantasy worlds are more fully defined. By the time I hit the last section, it was a page turner."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"It is written that it took Susanna Clarke ten years to write this novel. I don't doubt that in the slightest. I thought at first it might take me ten years to read it. I ordered the book this past October and couldn't wait to start reading what others have billed as the adult version of Harry Potter. Perhaps, but I myself didn't see it that way. After I started reading, I found my mind wandering to other things and I knew immediately that this book wasn't holding my attention. So, I set it down and picked up another book, which I read in its entirety within a week. It bugs me to start a novel and not finish it, but I wasn't at all enthused about going back to Clarke's novel. But the more I thought about it, I couldn't imagine anyone working ten years on just one book. So I made myself start reading it again. It wasn't until I'd read well into the book about half way, or let me say to Chapter 42, Strange Decides to Write a Book. From this point on, I found myself with a totally different attitude since the book had begun to hold every moment of my attention.I only wish I could give this book a better rating because the last half of this novel is very good. But that's just it. The first half nearly bored me to tears. I am glad I stayed with it and finished it...finally. I do commend the writer for the vast amount of work that must have gone into her efforts. BUT, the book is entirely too big and hard to hold. My fingers grew tired just from the book's weight. The print was too small for me. And the punctuation seemed to be totally ignored. Thus, those are my reasons for giving the book only three stars. Had this book been about half the size it is, covering the last half of its story, then I think Clarke had a wonderful plot, her characters were excellent, and her prose very good."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This redefines the word 'piffle'. If you leave this book in a fishstore, floating goldfish in ten minutes. Save your braincells and avoid this trash. And if any 'wise' guy tries to enlighten you, slap him upside his mug with a cod! This could put Lunestra out of business."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I first heard about this book where it was presented as a Harry Potter for adults. I think that other than the mention of magic there is very little similar between these two works.As I read it I just said to myself that this is just like reading Dickens. It has Dicken's skill at characterization and subtle humor. While HP has cutsy magic this interacts with strange and mystical worlds here you get the magic and worlds like in the \\"wrinkle in time\\" series.The Characters are deep and nothing happens just as you expect. I found myself deeply satisfied when I finished reading this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I don't generally care for history/fantasy mashups, but read this because my son recommended it. The Napoleonic atmosphere and social mores were well enough grounded in history to ring true, without being a dry historical recreation. The magic, ranging from gentlemanly theory to dark worlds of faerie, was beautifully and naturally woven in. The tone of the writing is very much &#34;of the time&#34;. My one criticism is the length of the book. Very long, and could have benefited from tighter editing. The story would not have suffered if it had been shortened up by a good editor. If you're not a dedicated reader, you will probably not make it through this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Maybe the time and place you read a book has as much to do with your enjoyment as the story itself. I read Jonathan Strange during some gloomy winter weather while I had the Flu. This may have brought me into the right frame of mind to really appreciate the mood, scene, and story. In any case, I recommend this book to anyone stuck in bed, too sick to eat and too miserable to read about anything real. I liked the author's wry sense of humor and skill at adopting the voice of another period in history to tell a very intriguing story. There are too many wonderful twists and turns of plot that would be spoiled for other readers if I describe the book too much. In short, there is/was an alternate universe where magic is real, and magicians squabble like 20th Century academics about publishing their work. Of course the government steps in and the rest is alternative history. As any good story does, this one ends but the reader knows it is by no means finished. I'm looking forward to more magic!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I saved 50.00 getting the product used-it was like new, an excellent story read extremely well. I'm very happy I bought it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"A different view on the magic theme. Placed in England and around but nicely integrated in to real events. Not much real action but a nice and calm story telling with just enough of action to keep the reader interested. Easy reading."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"*Spoilers Within*I need to start off by saying, as others have, that this book is certainly not for everyone. This isn't a bad thing, though. Clarke has crafted a beautiful novel that reads smoothly for the audience it's geared towards, while it may stump others who are used to the fast-paced, action-packed, romance-ridden novels that have become so popular. It reads like Austen-- so if you're not into Austen, you most likely won't dig this book. That said, if you LOVE Austen (as I do) and also have a great affinity for the fantastic and sometimes ridiculous, this will be right up your alley.I like to make lists, so that's how I'll review this novel. The things I like best about this novel are:1) The tone. I have never read an author who sets a tone so beautifully before. Throughout most of the book, the feel of the world she's created is dark and dreary, but the book never feels heavy or weighed down by it. Her dark skies, rainy afternoons, and Perpetual Darkness are balanced artfully with a near constant outflow of humor. Even the darkest moments in the book never feel especially bleak-- at some points in the book she made dreariness seem almost inviting. She could have chosen to make the entire novel be heavy and somber, but she did the exact opposite with it, which I thought was very clever and creative.2) The humor. As most people have noted in their reviews, Clarke is a master with subtle humor. Her jokes don't beat you over the head and are never inappropriately placed. Most of the laughs come from the very obvious jabs at English propriety. Like Austen, she points out ridiculous human behavior without ever directly saying \\"humans can be ridiculous.\\"3) The characters. Clarke doesn't bother to introduce characters who don't serve some kind of purpose. Unlike some other writers (*cough* George R. R. Martin *cough*) Clarke won't mention a name more than a few times if that person doesn't ultimately affect the course of action within the plot. Case in point: Vinculus. At first I thought it was strange that Clarke kept bringing up this particular character's name after it seemed that he would be insignificant, but after reading on I began to realize that every mention of Vinculus' name, and eventually every one of his appearances, was another spoke in the wheel always turning in the direction of the action. All of her characters are illustrated not through descriptions, but through their actions and words. She never outrightly says that Lascelles is a despicable person, but we KNOW he is based on what he says and how he behaves.4) The villain/the conflict. The gentleman with the thistle down hair! His character reminds me of Christoph Waltz's character in Inglorious Bastards. His attitude throughout the whole novel is just delightful, and yet his appearance in any scene is enough to make your skin crawl. He doesn't exude the typical villain's persona, which is absolutely brilliant, because it makes him even more frightening. And I think it's wonderful that Clarke could have written an entire novel in which good-battles-evil without the opposing forces every really meeting (except for once-- and that was towards the beginning, before the two knew they were enemies,) and even without the opposing forces every really understanding what they were up against. The triumph occurs almost by complete accident, but is all the sweeter because it comes at the hands of Stephen Black--who, I might add, I was rooting more for than any other character in the novel. It was a completely unconventional way of seeing the conflict through to the end.So there it is. I loved this book- if I didn't know better, I'd have thought that Clarke knew exactly what my tastes were and wrote this book just for me. I loved every word of it, but I wouldn't ask her to to write more of it because it was so perfect just the way it was. If you're a fan of Austen, The Lord of the Rings, and Dickens, then I'd venture to say that this book will be one of your favorites!That said, throughout the novel I began to cast this in my mind in case a movie or series was ever made based on it. I just like to cast books in my head, so here's what I came up with:Mr Norrel- Ian HolmJonathon Strange - Paul BettanyArabella- Anne HathawayLady Pole- Mia WasikowskaGentleman With Thistle Down Hair- Jude LawStephen Black- Djimon HounsouChildermass- Michael SheenVinculus- Tom HollanderLascelles- Rupert EverettDrawlight- John LeguizamoMiss Greysteel- Justine WaddellLord Wellington- Kenneth BranaghI could cast the whole book but I'll stop there. I'd love it if they made this into a miniseries or something-- but I'd only trust the British to do it justice.

I just found myself losing interest every so often so that I'd have to take breaks. The characters are very interesting, the plot is, too. The real magic of it all is in the last third of the book, though, when it seems to come into its own. That's where the real action is, the real development, and the real interest. Granted, the beginning portion helps to lead up to it, but the first 2/3 of this book are at some times extremely difficult to get through. Overall, I would recommend it. However, don't go into it expecting it to be a quick read (not even for its size). The impression the book leaves is lasting, and it is very unique. However, it is not everybody's cup of tea."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This has got to be the best attempt ever at writing in any pre-modern style and making it sound totally natural. I've never seen it done this well. It reads like it could really have been written during the Napoleanic wars, but it's as clear and crisp as any tight narrative in modern style. The magic parts are spooky and the human relations are hilarious and melancholy in the right measure. Even if you don't like fantasy, you'll like this. It's one of a kind."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is a story of a world that might have been or is still in the making.

All are wonderfull all should be on kindle. I will read them again when I am 90."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is an epic tale of nineteenth-century England and two magicians, first teacher and student, then rivals, who change its history. In 1806, most people believe magic no longer exists in England- until Mr Norrell (note the British Mr) of Hurtfew Abbey reveals his powers and becomes a celebrity. Another magician emerges: young, handsome, and daring Jonathan Strange. Strange becomes Norrell's student, and the two join forces in the war against France. But as Strange is increasingly drawn to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic, he risks sacrificing everything that he values, including his partnership with Norrell.I just loved this book, which was written in a typical British style with humor and wit. Though the book is over 800 pages long, I don't think I was ever bored by it. There's a whole host of great characters, funny and strange. It's really just hard to describe this book, but if you decide to read it, you will be rewarded. There are long \\"historical\\" footnotes at the bottom of pages, there are fairies, shady characters, and bumbling politicians. In short, everything you could ask for in a story of any kind, especially a fantasy story. Bear in mind, though, that if you're looking for a story about magicians throwing magic at one another, this is not the book for you. It's more subtle than that. There were a lot of side-plots in the book that all eventually came together.*You can read all of my reviews at my book review blog, [...]*"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this epic novel. Stayed up way past my bedtime most nights just to finish the chapters; I couldn't wait to pick it up again."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Clarke's Johnathan Strange & Mr Norrell is an ingeniously plotted, wonderfully detailed novelization of the history of English magic. Norrell is an eccentric, introverted anti-hero, paired against rebellious forward-thinking Strange. These two characters are only a portion of our meandering dialogue, however. There is an arc about a long-dead (or is he?) king, a thistle-haired fairie, a servant who would be king, aristocrats, generals, theoretical and practical magicians and at least three significant arcs following wives and would-be girlfriends. If you think that sounds like a lot to cram in an average-length book, you'd be right, so Clarke doesn't even try. My chief complaint about the work is that it's just too long. There are so many explanations and descriptions that it detracts from the work and becomes monotonous and repetitive (Strange's war exploits, Norrell's books or nightly dances anyone?). A good editor could have shorn this book up to a more respectable 750 pages and saved the reader 200 pages of bloat. The footnotes in this book are enough to fill a long novella. Still, the book is an interesting and creative effort where the only \\"Abracadabras\\" to be found are used in jest. This is an evaluation of \\"serious\\" magic, and it's importance to England. I really like this book and place it in high esteem. With a little trimming, however, it could have been a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This became my favorite book the year I read it. A really neat amalgam of real historical events during the Napoleonic Wars sprinkled with what could have been if magicians were involved. More than a bit of faery lore is worked into the story but not the kind that evokes images of Tinkerbell. These faeries are dark and malevolent, more along the lines of a Del Toro character. The pace and brooding nature of the plot feels more akin to the Bram Stoker \\"Dracula\\" text rather than the thriller plots seen in much of the fantasy genre.Even more compelling than the characters and the story development is the method in which the novel is written. Much of the important story details take place in the ever present footnotes, giving authenticity to the historical nature of story. Brilliantly thought out with a plot the educated (but imaginative) will find engaging."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"What an incredible book - one of the best Christmas presents I've ever received! The hardback is huge and heavy, so I have recently purchased the Kindle edition which means that I can take it with me wherever I go. It's a fantastical story about magic and magicians in the early 1800's. It is elegant, intelligent and witty, and I can't put it down. I chuckle to myself often at the author's skill in inserting humour when I'm not expecting it, and although I'm reading the book avidly, I also dread finishing it. I do know, however, that I will enjoy reading it again and again."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"***UPDATED***I was delighted to get an email from amazon about my kindle edition of this book. It seemed a mass mailing to any who had purchased it and mentioned the numerous typos in the edition I had received and said a corrected one was now available. To get it, all I had to do was reply by email \\"yes.\\" Why this step? Downloading the new version would wipe out any notes etc. I might have put in the original edition, so they were avoiding do that without my permission. Nicely done, Amazon! I am now almost done reading the revised kindle edition and the typos are indeed gone.Original review: Fabulous book but the kindle edition introduces numerous typos (scanning errors?) not found in the print (HB) edition and not all the footnotes are hot linked. Poor job of translating to this format-- something that I have (luckily) not encountered previously even with public domain books on the kindle."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I simply loved this book, and for the following reasons:1. The use of English. I could almost hear the words spoken in my head in some sort of delicious old-fashioned accent, and I loved it. The carefully written prose was actually what kept me going for the first two hundred pages or so, as I didn't like Mr Norrel, who is the main character for that part of the book.2. The footnotes; I really loved those, because they give information about the world that wouldn't have fitted into the story, but that was still interesting and/or entertaining to read.3. The world. This book seemed very well-researched to me. Clarke seemed to have a good idea in her head of what England with magic would be like, what the magic itself would be like, what kind of clothes the people would wear, in what kind of houses they lived, and so on.4. The characters. I really liked the way Clarke described them, and I particularly loved Jonathan Strange and Childermass. I found them to be attractive, even though I have never seen any pictures of them, because of how they seemed to move and talk and because of their personalities. Loved them.This book was a slow read, people are right about that, but I didn't see that as a bad thing. In a world where everything goes fast, this book allows someone to take a bit of rest and stop to enjoy the scenery. It is written slowly enough that you can pay attention to the characters, the storyline, the world, and the way it is written all at the same time. I find that a nice change from books that go so fast that I have finished them in a few hours, but where I can hardly remember how it was written or what the names of the main characters were. Reading this book left me happy and content.To those who say you need patience for this book: I am a person who is usually very easily distracted, easily bored, and I quickly change what I'm doing unless something really interests me. This book interested me from the first few sentences because I liked the authors choice of words. What you need for this book is not patience, but to be able to read a book, not to be spoon-fed a storyline, but to enjoy a pretty piece of writing. There were only a few parts of the book where I was actually reading to know what would be happening next; I mostly just read for the pleasure of reading itself. This book is like a beautiful landscape; don't expect it to do the entertaining for you, but instead take the effort and time to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"When you begin a novel that spans more than 800 pages and you start noticing footnotes (shriek!!), it should serve as a warning. One the good side, Ms. Clarke's writing is quite good, and very consistent considering it is done in an \\"Old English\\" style.She is extremely detail oriented; leaving no stone unturned. Her development of a \\"history within a work of historical fiction\\" would not be matched by many authors. Even the footnotes are so well thought out, I began wondering if I was reading history, imagined or real? I would also have to say that the writing, in some spots, is quite witty and humorous! Do yourself a favor, give it at least 100 pages before deciding this book is not for you. The pace is slow and it definitely takes a while to start making some sense of character and plotline.I think it's best to say that if JK Rowling and Jane Austen were to co-produce a novel, this would be it. A little Harry Potter, a little drawing room comedy, a little swashbuckling thrown in for good measure.Now, for the bad news. It is just too darned long! There are way too many plot lines with secondary characters; some of which are revisited after several hundred pages! At this point, you've forgotten what the plot line was or you simply do not care. It's apparent that Ms. Clarke had a great many ideas roaming around in her head. It's unfortunate she felt the need to include all of them into one book. Imagine, Rowling trying to squeeze everthying she had in mind for Harry into one or two books!Personally, I think one book with a tight plot and without an excess of characters would have been more effective. Alternately, I think she could have (with a shorter novel) have begun to build up steam for successive novels and make it a series.But, hey, let's be honest here, too. I did finish the entire book and there was certainly enough to keep me wanting to find out what happens."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is one of the strangest, longest, most unusual novels I've ever read. Since I like unusual things, and since I've read a lot of books, I found this book to be very interesting. The plot is different, the style of writing is rather arcane and obsolete, and the whole effect is eccentric, to say the least.The setting is the early 19th Century, during the British war against Napoleon's France. When Mr. Norrell is approached by a group of men who study magic, he demonstrates his skill with the arcane and forgotten talents of magic. The idea soon occurs to people: he can utilize his talents to help defeat the French usurper on the continent. Soon, a second man who's learned magic on his own, separately from Norrell, comes forward. His name is Jonathan Strange. Strange and Norrell soon collaborate, and Strange goes to Spain to help fight Bonaparte in the employ of the Duke of Wellington.The whole of this book is so fun that it's hard to explain. The author includes various footnotes, as if this was a history book, and there are a few historical characters and incidents. Events have some relation to reality, though of course the author includes \\"English magic\\" in the history of the world, and there are strange events in the country's past, notably a monarch known as the \\"Raven King\\" who has no real name, as far as anyone knows. One amusing note: Napoleonic fans will be amused to see how D'Erlon's Corps gets lost between Quatre Bras and Ligny here.I enjoyed this book a great deal. There have been many references to the writing style and invocations of Rowling, Patrick O'Brian, and Austen. Frankly they're all appropriate, but in some ways this book is unique. None of those people wrote a 1000-page book, for instance, and none of their stories have quite the weird aura of authenticity that this one has. I enjoyed it a great deal, and would recommend it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Susanna Clarke's \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" is a delightful Frankenstein's Monster of a book, stitching together parts and themes from many authors to make something utterly sui generis. If I'm still not sure how one or two of the minor parts fit in with the whole, the book still functions very well as an engrossing, often dazzling entertainment. Just as J.K. Rowling hit the jackpot by imagining a school for young wizards, so Clarke devised a winning formula by imagining early nineteenth-century England as a country literally haunted by its medieval magical past, seeking to recover its wizardly power to outfox that devil \\"Buonaparte.\\" The two men who answer their nation's call could not be more different: crabbed, secretive Gilbert Norrell, who fears the prospect of magic falling into untutored or unscrupulous hands, and bold, impetuous Jonathan Strange, who seeks Byronic glory in the recovery of English magic. (Byron, in fact, makes several appearances in the book, as does the Duke of Wellington.) The book could be described as an amalgam of Mary Shelley and Jane Austen (with the delicious shocks and surprises of the one, and the perceptive drawing-room comedy and fully fleshed characters of the other), with a good measure of Tolkienesque fantasy thrown in. Clarke wittily writes in an Austenian pastiche, even to the point of using authentic spellings of the period (i.e. \\"chuse\\" for \\"choose,\\" \\"connexion\\" for \\"connection\\"), which makes her matter-of-fact descriptions of supernatural horrors all the more effective. The book sprawls over nearly 800 pages, and it may be, as with \\"Piers Plowman,\\" that no one will ever wish it longer. But anyone susceptible to fantasy and magic will find this an excellent read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"My personal opinion is that this genre holds some of the most creative andtalented writers of any field, and this book is proof of that. Clarke'swriting upholds the English tradition in fiction which so perfectly rendersthe setting,the time period, and the historical characterizations sobeautifully that she seamlessly makes us believe everything she wants us to.And, the other thing, I am so thankful for an Epic without the Epicbloodletting. Clarke breathes life into the wonderful legacy left to usby Tolkien, and then takes it all the way to make it something new andshiny again. And without the elves and magic swords. I loved this book.May be tiring for someone not used to this \\"Dickinsonian\\" style of writing."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"Of all the books in the world to read, I don't think this one is worth the investment of time: reading 1000+ pages of small type.Good: Masterful, at times beautiful, use of language.

Slow-moving, at times tedious, plot -- especially in the first several hundred pages.Summary: To me, this entire book feels like a fantastical Jane Austen novel, only longer and with less dry wit. Personally, I only enjoy Jane Austen in small doses; so, this book was not very enjoyable for me. I still gave it 4 stars, because I don't deny that this book contains pretty writing. I understand why many people like it, but if you're not into it after the first 200 pages, just put it down and find something else.

She is a gifted and talented writer who manages to make a very long novel continually entertaining.

There are great writers around."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book is almost impossible to classify. It's clearly fiction, but how much is based on fact? Are the facts laid out in the story actual English lore, or created solely by the author? Parts of it are written as a novel, but it's laid out as an historical text, replete with footnotes and bibliographical references. I didn't know what to make of it, so decided to simply accept it as it was written.The commencement of the book was rather difficult to get through. I was still struggling in my mind to figure out what it was about, and found it slow and ponderous. Once I cleared my mind of questions (how zen), I was better able to follow the story line and really get into it. If you can get past the first hundred pages, then you can enjoy this book.The only complaint I do have is about those footnotes. There were simply too many. They slowed the pace of reading, because the reader is constantly forced to stop the main story and look up the relevant footnote. Constantly. There were some instances where a footnote was so long that it stretched across two or three pages. Sometimes the footnotes took up more space on a page than the actual text. Although the use of footnotes was a rather clever device, which changed the entire genre of the book, they often bogged down the story and were just plain too numerous.I won't go into characters or plot or story lines, because anybody can figure that out upon actually reading the book. This is a good challenge for a \\"pro\\" reader (one who revels in books over 500 pages long)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book had me at the first page.

This book is completely unique in theme, and seems to come out of nowhere, with no real precedent in English fantasy literature. The style is wonderful, a very affectionate parody of early 19th Century British prose, and the characters are all interesting (and many are lovable), and despite the large number of characters they're all easy to keep separate.The turn of events kept surprising me, and I certainly had no idea how things were going to end. In fact, our two major characters are left in a sort of limbo, and I hope we may see a sequel someday. The good guys, like Childermass and Stephen Black, are rewarded, while the bad guys get their just deserts. Two women who have very literally been consigned to a fate worse than death are eventually restored to a semblance of normal existence. And at the end, magic is alive and well in England after centuries when it seemed to have vanished. Even the nameless Raven King has returned, but not so's you'd notice it!I hope the author has not written herself out with this volume which I am told consumed a decade of her life, during which time her hair turned snow-white.

Yes, you need patience for this read. But if you care for an emersive fiction with cobblestone streets, shadows, portals into other worlds, war, magic, and England, then this gem is the best you can get.

Strange frowned. He seemed to dislike the question. \\"I suppose a magician might,\\" he admitted, \\"but a gentleman never could.\\"-----Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is a fantastic work of fiction, providing an alternate take on British history circa 1807-1820. To go with this time setting, the author, Susanna Clarke, writes in a style to fit the times, somewhat like blending Charles Dickens and Jane Austen together. The story is intricate and rich. The air of mystery hangs on every page, teasing the reader from the beginning to the very end. The sudden changes in the novel throw the reader down unforeseen paths, leaving his senses constantly on guard. The subtleness of magic permeates throughout England, though there are only two practical magicians. The backdrop of the French Revolution and England's war against Napoleon set the plot in an all-too-real world.Yes, JS & MN is an amazing work of art. The characters are very well defined and extremely complex. Mr Norrell is England's only practical magician, and he spends all his time collecting books of magic and books on magic, as well as sending his servant Childermass out to persuade theoretical magicians to forsake their studies. Jonathan Strange finds that he can do magic, and he seeks the tutelage of Mr Norrell, quickly mastering technique and rising to become England's second practical magician. Each man is connected in an intricate web of nobility and other well-to-dos, as well as a few lesser men.Clarke did wonders in her characterization, and there were qualities that I liked and disliked in many of the characters, especially with Strange and Norrell. Of course, Childermass was well defined, as well as Lady Pole and Stephen Black. Ah, there were many folks that I really liked.The plot of the book is also compelling. The folks of England remember back when magic was more common, back in the times of the Raven King, back when magicians conversed with fairies and magic was not lost. The main plot of the book centers around Norrell and Strange deciding to try and return magic to England. Typically, the magic is not explosive and avant-garde, but instead subtle and simple, like making illusions in the rain against the Frenchmen.Perhaps the most compelling mystery throughout the book is the many references to the Raven King. His character builds throughout the story, through footnotes and lowly folk gossiping. (Clarke uses many footnotes throughout the book to provide additional anecdotes and more info on certain subjects. This aspect seems almost like a history book, perhaps even one that Mr Norrell himself would read...) By the end of the novel, I was eager to learn all I could about the King.I really cannot say enough about this book. It was funny, witty, suspenseful, exciting, and at times even mundane, but never really boring. There are few idle words in this tome, and I think Clarke knew exactly what she was doing when she was writing each and every part of the book. I savored every quirky story. There were many quotes that I would like to put here, but I feel that I would rob you of something if I did so.I can't think of any negatives about this Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, besides the fact that it's so large that it's unwieldy and difficult to carry easily everywhere. I strongly urge you to read this book if you want to experience something unlike anything you've read before. While the novel does advance slowly at some points, it is not a boring read. No, it is a wonderful read. It's like taking a trip down an old familiar road, and remembering things sweetly passed. It's like eating chocolate ice cream for the first time. It is superb, and I praise Susanna Clarke for her brilliant debut."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I love this book, read it years ago and when it was published for the Kindle, immediately bought it and enjoyed reading it a second time. However, the Kindle edition has formatting (or something) problems. LOTS of typos, enough to be distracting, and an odd omission of the occasional word, also often enough to be distracting. I am tolerant of free Kindle books with typos and poor layout, but this one actually cost almost $9!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"this book has to be one of my all time favoritres. each character is complex and intriguing. i found that i began to wonder if it could have all been possible and even hoped it might."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I have just emerged from an enchantment, having been held in thrall for nearly seven weeks by a magnificent 780 page novel. In between I have dipped into other books, a short story collection of Alice Monroe's, a non-fiction book about the first trans-Atlantic telegram used to capture a murderer, a couple of English mysteries, and the latest elegant novella by Louis Auchincloss. But every few days I would plunge back again into the very odd and tantalizing world of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, as chronicled by their creator Susanna Clarke.This spell binding novel is about two magicians: one old and fusty and secretive; one young, handsome, and daring. From the outset it must be accepted by the reader that these are real magicians, not people who use sleight of hand to present the illusion of magic. To fully enjoy this tremendous novel, we must \\"suspend our disbelief\\" as Coleridge urged us to do when reading poetry. We must believe in a centuries old tradition of English magic in which the worlds of faerie and the human world were often co-mingled, not always with good results for the inhabitants of either kingdom.The year is 1807, and in England everyone is worried about Napoleon and his empire building obsessions which seem intent on subsuming the British Isles. Remarkably, a reclusive magician named Mr. Norrell is able to convince England's political and military powers to give magic a chance in defeating Napoleon's forces. Soon Norrell learns of a young, untutored magician of remarkable natural ability who wishes to learn more about the art of magic. Reluctantly Norrell takes Jonathan Strange under his tutelage, only to suffer the quite common fate of seeing his student rapidly outpace him in popularity and success.The two magicians are now at odds and go their separate ways, at least externally. But each secretly wishes to continue to outpace and impress the other, and the fates of each are inextricably bound. Jonathan is drawn into ever darker, more dangerous realms of magic, unleashing forces that ultimately threaten the lives of those he holds most dear. Meanwhile Mr. Norrell, deeply mortified by his student's independence and disregard of his cautious precepts, sets about discrediting his pupil in every possible way. In addition to the tangled relationship between these two magicians, there are many interwoven tales of others affected by the magic called forth, knowingly or unknowingly, by Strange and Norrell.Many times in the book various characters become aware of magic happening to them, and around them. Objects in rooms disappear or seem to be oddly askew, the air tingles, darkens, or glows, and the world's protective skin seems to be turned inside out, revealing something quite astonishing on the other side. Reading this I felt myself drawn into this otherworldly awareness of magic being just a breath away, viewed out of the corner of my eye, slightly out of focus, but unmistakably there. Author Susanna Clarke has created a virtuoso performance of character, setting, and rich, unforgettable story and subtext that lingers long afterwards and continues to beckon, like a path into the world of faerie itself."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I love this book-- if you like fantasy, but also regency/victorian period dramas, then this is it for you, the perfect creation. If you like either of these genres but NOT the other, then this is the perfect gateway to a whole new world! If you like neither of these genres, then WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU! TRY IT OUT RIGHT NOW. Seriously, take a chance. Give it a hundred pages. Once Jonathan Strange shows up in the story (who is possibly the most charismatic character ever created) then the book takes off at a gallop. Take a chance with it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This book was quite long - and it certainly had some slow moving parts (particularly in the beginning!). In fact, there were times that I regretted picking it up in the first place, but, I must admit, as the story drew on (and on!) it really improved. And the ending more than made up for the duller sections.My main complaint though was that the book was broken up into rather anecdotal chapters, which stole some of the cohesiveness of the book as a whole. That being said, there were definitely sections that I really liked - such as King George's and Lord Byron's \\"guest appearances.\\" There were some unanswered questions, of course, but it was very fascinating premise and the amount of details alone were impressive. It certainly had a real epic quality."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"During the Napoleonic Wars, Mr. Norrell, the first English magician in several centuries appears and starts using his powers to aid England against Napoleon. Mr. Norrell believes that he is the only person responsible enough to wield magic and proceeds to try to accumulate all of the known books of magic and prevent anyone one else from learning magical skills. However, when Jonathan Strange appears with some strong innate skills, Mr. Norrell feels forced to take him on as a apprentice. Eventually Strange becomes tired of Norrell's restrictive view of magic and goes off on his own, creating a deep rivalry between the two. Strange also faces danger as he tries to contact fairies and the Raven King, a legendary magician who ruled Northern England in the past.I have mixed feeling about this book. I really enjoyed the wit of it with many individual entertaining scenes. The overall story turns out to be interesting as well. The big problem with the book is its length. It takes forever to get the story moving, and up until about the last third of the book it is very slow-moving. In many ways, it reads like a book that was written in the 19th century, which I sure was the idea, but which can also be somewhat offputting to modern readers. Overall, I found that the strong writing and humor compensate for the slow plot and would recommend the book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I had much the same problems other readers had, getting past the first 100 pages. I heard some of the audiobook and I loved the reader's voice. This book is definitely a book for audio. The ending is excellent, I absolutely dislike Mr. Norrell and love Strange. This book is excellent on tape for the people who can't get past the first 100 pages."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"...and I'm grateful for this (by the way I love the HP books).\\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" is an outstanding GOOD book. And it is really a book, not a screen-play as many modern books use to be.The story is witty and unique. The writing style of Mrs.Clarke remembers me in a postive way of the Austen and Bronte novels!And it is, thanks heaven, no fantasy stuff at all. For me as a German it seems to be a funny, creepy and intriguing mix of historical research, dark british humour and social novel.I simply love it.The only thing I wondered was how Bloomsbury could release it as only one book? It would have made a great trilogy. Such a fat book as a debut novel was maybe a little bit too much bravery of the publisher.Anyway. Five stars are justifiable."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I confess to a predilection for fiction written about 19th century or late 18th century England. (See my reviewer page.) This is not to say that I am a fan of novels written *during* that period, but I enjoy good novels written *about* that period, and there is a great difference. One of the more absorbing aspects of the former is that, from the perspective of the 21st and late 20th centuries, one can clearly see the sense of propriety which dictated so much of English social behavior and which seems to have been lost in American culture. And of course there are other attractions.I am also a fan of science fiction, fantasy, alternate world fiction, call it what you will, and, although I have not written reviews about much of it, I have been reading it for fifty years. Ms. Clarke's novel combines the best of both genres.She constructs a wonderful tale of everyday British affairs during the time toward the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the rise of the British Romantic Poets (feh!), etc. with the extraordinary inclusion of two practicing magicians (a profession unknown to Britain since its demise several centuries before), who have dramatically opposed personalities. The way in which their stories unfold and articulate with the historic period are seamless, and I must add, wonderfully wrought.Ms Clarke's sense of humor is prevalent throughout the book, and, as in the British manner, understated. Here is just one wonderful example: Jonathan Strange, the more likeable of the two magicians, has been touring with Wellington in pursuit of French armies across Spain.In a footnote, Ms. Clarke writes, \\"Owing to a mistake in Wellington's maps of Spain the city of Pamplona was not exactly where the British had supposed it to be. Wellington was deeply disappointed when, after the army had marched twenty miles in one day, they did not reach Pamplona which was discovered to be ten miles further north. After swift discussion of the problem it was found to be more convenient to have Mr. Strange move the city, rather than change all the maps.\\"[Several years and several pages later] \\"The Duke of York remarked that King Ferdinand of Spain had sent a letter to the Prince Regent complaining that many parts of his kingdom had been rendered entirely unrecognizable by the English magician and demanding that Mr. Strange return and restore the country to its original form.\\"\\"\`Oh, said the Duke of Wellington, not much interested, \`they are still complaining about that, are they?'\\"Q.E.D.Another feature of the book which may not have been mentioned (I do not read others' reviews before writing my own) is that the book has a dozen or so wonderful full-page illustrations. My favorite one is opposite page 151.One word of WARNING: This is not fast food. If you do not enjoy the consumption of an excellent meal in good surroundings, ingested leisurely and perhaps accompanied by fine conversation, pass this literary meal by: you will neither enjoy this work nor be able to recommend it to others. Stick to McNovels: they'll fill you up without your having to pay the least attention to what you are consuming. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is for connoisseurs.Finally, being to a degree familiar (see the book Postcards of Nursing) with the differences between excellent and merely adequate portraits, I must state that the photograph of the author which appears on the back flap of the book, is itself magical. I realize that the author's picture is not a good reason to purchase or reject a book, but as it is so seldom remarked upon, and as this one is so good, I did want to mention it, in case, while browsing the book in stores, you might have the opportunity to regard it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"To say this book is about magic would be inaccurate, or even to say that it is what we know as a fantasy novel. It's not Harry Potter for grownups- it's something hugely more complex and more valuable. It's a work of art that makes you think and makes you feel. This book is ultimately about people; the way they deal with their own problems and the way they relate to others.The story is deliciously written, with wry humor and convincing period dialogue and mannerisms- it quite reminds me of something like Jane Austen, and yet manages to stay gripping and moves plenty fast. The plot very quickly takes on disturbingly dark tones, and remains tightly woven and intriguing right up through the wistful conclusion.Be warned, however, that this book is not for the faint of heart, with a hefty spine and some pretty serious literary wading involved. Clarke adds the charming touch of many extended (sometimes VERY extended) \\"historical\\" footnotes, which I found entertaining, but some might find irritating. If you're not already of a literary persuasion, I have a feeling you would get sick of this book very quickly.In case you couldn't tell, I'm a huge fan of this book. I'm currently in high school, so for years I've been searching for things in the realm of Young Adult Fantasy that have enough depth to keep me interested; I was overjoyed to find a book that had that depth and a whole lot more."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This novel is so many things - All of them wonderful and wonderfully executed by Ms Clarke - that it's hard to know where to begin or end in a review. Firstly, the book is and is about: ENCHANTMENT. It's also so very, very English and droll, that it can be seen, in the agglomeration of all its contradictory characters, as a take on England and the English Character.The book's literary ancestors are obvious: Tolkien, Dickens, Susan Cooper-and, I should say, the \\"High Romantic\\" poets of the Early Nineteenth Century in general. Clarke is a master of setting out verbal tableaux in masterful, lush prose, at capturing shades of light and dark---I was reminded of Shelley's \\"Ode to the West Wind\\" many a time.She is also the master of droll English understatement. As an example: \\"Early in November 1814 Mr Norell was honoured by a visit from some very noble gentlemen - an earl, a duke and two baronets - who came, they said, to speak to him upon a matter of the utmost delicacy and were so discreet themselves that half an hour after they had begun talking Mr Norell was still entirely ignorant of what they wished him to do.\\"It is a book that, if you are of a....hm.....poetic or \\"magical\\" temperament, will cast its spell on you from the first to last page. You shall be transported to scenes such as: \\"On a day in late December when storm clouds made Alpine landscapes in the sky above London, when the wind played such havoc in the heavens that the city was one moment plunged in gloom and in the next illuminated by sunlight......\\"These are the things that make the book truly great. The plot is also very well executed. But if you're in search of the Harry Potter sort of thing, then you, like the society patricians at the soirees asking for some \\"magic\\" acts to be performed for their diversion, had best look elsewhere.The magic in this book is the sort that makes you look at the tree limbs in relief against an evening sky with a chill wind picking up and get a sense that there might be something more to things than you can quite make out.My apologies to John Donne for stealing this review's title."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"First off I think the tag line, 'Harry Potter for grown-ups', I've seen attached to this book is misleading. The only similarities between the two is England and the word magician. I only say this because people who pick this up expecting the quick and accessible world of Hogwarts are in for a shock.A better reference point would be, 'Charles Dickens with magic.'The book is long and dense, with many footnotes and a deliberately paced plot. However, I was never the least bit bored, and found myself thoroughly engrossed with these characters, and what happens to them. The plot in a nutshell revolves around two magicians, Mr Norrell, and his student Jonathan Strange. Coming at the world of magic from two very different views, an incident happens towards the beginning of the novel that shapes the course of the entire story and both the mens lives.There are a multitude of subplots that while reading I had no idea how they related directly to the main thrust of the story, but by the end she does a marvelous job of weaving them all together.The book definitely requires some patience, but the payoff is so worth it. After nearly eight hundred pages I felt completely satisfied with the ending. And that says alot. Time well spent ."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I love the Harry Potter series. This is NOTHING like Harry Potter. It's also nothing like Lord of the Rings, or any other fantasy wizards and magic novel. It's more like a Jane Austen novel, if Jane Austen had a couple of the gentleman who also just happened to practice magic. You will either love this book or hate it. There seems to be no middle ground. Read the first few pages (since Amazon lets you do this). If you like her style of writing, which mimics the novels written in the early 1800's, then you will enjoy this book. If you don't like the style of writing, then it's not for you. This book is not a page turner to see what happens next. It's one where you savor the way the words are put together. Personally, I find this book very funny, but you must realize that the humor is very dry and very low key. I also love the footnotes. Some are fake references to books other characters in the novel have written. Some are short stories in themselves. All of them fall in the exact place where it is convenient to read them. Again, you will either love this affectation or not. I grew up in England, and all my school chums and I believed in Fairies, so I find that aspect of the story interesting, too."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"I bought this book at the recommendation of a blogger I read occasionally, and way before I caught wind of all of the hype that would have turned me off immediately. I am so pleased that I did.Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell, is a delightful book, the footnotes never fail to interest and tended to keep me reading, even when the book became tedious in spots. While I never really liked either of the main characters, I was delighted by the character of Stephen, and how his longing for an identity, separate from his slave past was woven so seamlessly into the plot. The ending left me wanting to know more, and hoping that this will not be the last we here from Susanna Clarke."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"This is a very literate fantasy with many interesting characters. As noted in some other reviews, the very detailed description of exactly how magic is accomplished is likely not for everyone. The volume certainly could have been edited by hundreds of pages without losing much; still many people enjoy the lengthy descriptions more than I.Although some have criticized the extensive footnotes, I felt they gave me an option to read an abridged or full version. I sometimes read them, and sometimes skipped them.My biggest problem with the book is the ending. Without spoiling the ending for the reader, I can say that the ending fails to use the characters well, and the handling of the denouement is inexplicable. If you read the book, you will inevitably read it to the end. I challenge you to stop at the end of chapter 67, and make up your own ending. Then finish the book and ask which ending you prefer, the one you imagined or the author's. I think you will like the one you imagined better."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed","review":"i am amazed at the reviews this book has been able to garner, as it is, unfortunately, way too long and simply does not deliver. excited by glowing reviews in newspapers and magazines i thought that finally a story about magic had come along that could in fact live up to tolkien et al. but it is so far off, it's not even funny. i waded through the whole thickness of this book, witnessing good ideas flipped at me and discarded without development, images pulled out of a sack and quickly stuffed away again, and all the while i hoped that finally the sinister evildoers would show their face for the epic battle that surely had to come after all those pages. alas, the book simply ends, leaving this reader frustrated and disbelieving. is this the same book we are talking about? i felt strung along and somehow tricked into reading something that is just utterly boring. i could not really get myself to sympathize with the characters, and what was the big build up about the raven king about? where was he? he came and went in about a second, and that's it.although i do admire anybody who can write and actually finish a book of that length and even get it published, i cannot recommend this book to anybody interested in a good, exciting read."},{"Title":"Where's Piglet?

I speak both languages and it is always such a pleasure to see a translation so elegantly done.The artwork by Mary Heebner is as sumptuous as Pablo Neruda's poetry and truly reflects the feel of the ocean. Her paintings capture the mood of each poem perfectly and add to the emotion of his words.It is I believe the only anthology that has focused solely on his poems of the sea.The book is bilingual with the text in Spanish on one page and English on the other. It contains my favorite of Neruda's poems, The Soliloquy of the Waves.Even the typeset and Neruda's name on the dust jacket painted in a blurry sea blue reflect the ocean that the poems are about.Pablo Neruda has been a favorite poet of mine for many, many years and this stunning book is a wonderful addition to my collection of his anthologies.

I read it to my six year old daughter and it was her favorite bedtime book for several months. It was a joy for me to discover how much I loved it, too.The themes are \\"mature,\\" in that a boy watches his entire family die and then his friend watches him grieve this loss. My six year old was not too young for this, however; to her, death is as natural as the sun coming up unless I make a big deal about it. Pearl Buck presents a deep reverence for life, death, and living with danger and uncertainty that permeate the story in an accessible and real way. The end message is hopeful and joyous.I found in this book something rare in children's and even much contemporary adult fiction: a nonthreatening, sensitive portrayal of how people deal physically and emotionally with overwhelming loss; it's sort of like Elizabeth Kubler Ross 101 for a child's understanding. How unusual, and valuable.Kathleen Norris wrote in The Cloister Walk that for many years literature gave her what religion gives some people in the way of guidance and comfort in life's challenges. It seems to me the pinnacle of good literature to show commonalities between people of all ages, all over the world and through history, suggesting values people from other cultures and times have used to deal with universal human dramas. For me, The Big Wave does that.I hope I'm not the only parent who thinks kids deserve books with more substance than Junie B. Jones and Captain Underpants offer. Pearl Buck obviously respected children and their capacity to understand. Add to that its lovely clear language and stunning imagery of the setting...well, all told this is maybe my favorite kid's book, even if it only cost a quarter."},{"Title":"The Big Wave","review":"First of all, I am disgusted at the ignorance of some of the other reviewers thus far. I am not Japanese, and cannot attest to whether or not Jiya and Kino are \\"ridiculous\\" names, but to assume that Pearl S. Buck needed to do \\"a little more research\\" about Japan is equally ridiculous. Pearl S. Buck was born in 1892. She lived and wrote in China and Japan in the early years of her career. I believe she lived in Unzen, Japan for an entire year in 1927. So if those names are ridiculous for little boys now, perhaps they were not so THEN, when the book was written, and in the particular area where Buck lived. I don't know.I found this book to be valuable for introducing youngsters to the tremendous and powerful body of work produced by the first American woman to ever win the Nobel Prize for literature, Pearl S. Buck. Her writing is deliberately slow and written in the classic style of fables to serve a purpose and set the tone and mood. Young readers who are not properly introduced to the historical context and significance of Ms. Buck's work may find her writing and this book to be \\"blah blah blah.\\" This is unfortunate. Children coping with loss and trauma, and children interested in both Japanese culture and earth science (volcanoes, earthquakes and tsunamis, which literally translates to \\"big wave,\\" for those who seem to be confused) would love this book. It is a useful book for teachers to introduce difficult material to youngsters as well. My only complaint is that this edition did a poor job of duplicating the masterpieces of Japanese printmasters Hokusai and Hiroshige, both of whom were major influences on the artwork of Vincent Van Gogh. The replicas in this book fail to do the originals justice."},{"Title":"The Big Wave","review":"I read this book many years ago, and have been waiting for the right moment to read it to my child. This week, while we are absorbing the 12/26/2004 tsunami in South Asia, I deemed the moment right.The story is set in Japan at some time in the past, when the farmers and fishermen in the community are following the paths their fathers and grandfathers set. We see the story through the eyes of Kino who lives on a mountain farm, and learns about the sea through his friendship with Jiya, who lives \\"in the last house in the row of houses toward the ocean, and [whose] house [does] not have a window toward the sea\\" because, as Jiya tells Kino, \\"the sea is our enemy.\\" Kino is relieved that he does not live near the sea, but his father reminds him of the great volcano, twenty miles away, and tells him that they \\"must learn to live with danger.\\"The storyline is simple, almost inevitable. A volcano erupts under the sea and causes a tsunami, which sweeps away the fishing village by the sea. Many lives are lost. As the survivors slowly recover, and Kino's friend Jiya starts to accept life again, Kino asks his father all the questions that children need to ask after a natural disaster. His father's answers each question with patience and wisdom, in a manner open-ended enough so that the reader (or reader and parent) can pause and talk about their own beliefs and feelings. Or the reader can turn the page and stay absorbed in this well-crafted story.My only disappointment with my paperback edition (HarperCollins, 1986, ISBN 0-06-440171-5) is that it left out the famous woodblock prints by the 19th century Japanese artists Hokusai and Hiroshige. I pored over these illustrations as a child and immediately recognized them when I saw them in my library copy. Pearl Buck selected each individual print to allow her readers to see the beauty of Japan, and they form an integral part of the story. I would recommend you buy the Library Binding version by HarperCollins (1999, ISBN 0-38-199923-8) or check out a book with illustrations from your library."},{"Title":"The Big Wave","review":"\\"The Big Wave,\\" by Pearl S. Buck, is a short novel that takes place in Japan. The main characters are Kino, a farm boy who lives on a mountainside, and his good friend Jiya, who is the son of a fisherman. The two boys bond despite the cultural differences between the farming and fishing communities. But with the presence of a volcano and the threat of the great ocean wave of the book's title, life holds danger for these boys.This is a simple but beautifully told tale. Buck's themes include courage in the face of danger, the impact of geography upon the lives of the Japanese people, and the cycles of death and life. But most of all the book is about hope and friendship. For a good companion text, try one of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books."},{"Title":"The Big Wave","review":"I liked this book.

It truly is a book that changes the way you see the world, and I believe any parent, or anyone who has a child in their life would do well to expose them to this story ASAP - for me it provided an outlook which in times of loss and pain, has truly been a blessing."},{"Title":"The Big Wave","review":"Well told story to aid children in dealing with disappointment, fear, death. Beautifully illustrates the purpose of life."},{"Title":"The Big Wave","review":"The Big Wave is a book about two families that live in Japan and one BIG wave!Kino a Japanese boy lives in the \\"midst of danger\\" with the ocean in front of him and a volcano behind him. Jya, Kino's friend lives on the ground and Kino lives on a mountin. When the big wave comes Jya's family gets wiped out and Jya has to live with Kino. This book fast-forwards from Jya's childhood to his early adulthood and I recommend it to everyone. I recommend it to everyone because I liked to read about a different place."},{"Title":"The Big Wave","review":"This was a great read with my nine year old daughter. It opened up many discussions about life, grief, sadness, and the ideas of &#34;home&#34; without being too graphic or overpowering. It was very age appropriate for my 9 year old daughter."},{"Title":"The Big Wave","review":"I'm a Japanese, I read this book, and I just wish the author had done a little more research before writing about Japan. Names such as Kino and Jiya are ridiculous - Jiya actually means &quot;old man&quot; or &quot;butler.&quot; It may be a good textbook, but it was a pain for me to read this."},{"Title":"The Big Wave","review":"The seller's description of the book's condition was correct. In fact the book was in better condition than I expected. Fast delivery and an easy transaction."},{"Title":"The Big Wave","review":"This book is set in japan about two boys who live near the sea. One day a &quot;big wave&quot; comes along and kills one of the boys parents and the boy whose parents were killed come to live with the other boy's family. They grow up and the orphaned boy marries the other boy's sister and they go and live on the beach where the orphan's parents used to live. THAT'S ABOUT IT. I consider this book to be mindless and confusing. You don't know if the author is talking about something the boys are doing at the moment or if the boys are recalling the past. I say a big no-no. But if you don't like reading, then you should read it because it is so short. It has about a moral or two which are good but could be expressed in a more exiting way. All that this book is is Blah, Blah, Blah..."},{"Title":"The Big Wave","review":"Pearl Buck's \\"The Big Wave\\" was my introduction as a 3rd grader into a world that was not a fairy tale world. Buck tells the story of friends, Kino and Jiya. They live in Japan as a farmer's son and a fisherman's son, respectively.Kino is not as comfortable with the sea as Jiya is. But they swim together and go on outings together, enjoying their friendship and their families.When the tsunami strikes, Jiya loses everything in his life.This is the point that is unusual in a children's book. Buck takes Jiya through the grieving process. Kino's father has many wise things to tell his son about life and death and the way we must accept that death is part of life.A child of 8 could probably read this book on her own, but read aloud, it gives a chance to discuss the fears and issues. The knowledge that families go on and life goes on even after terrible tragedy is a beautiful lesson in this well-told tale."},{"Title":"The Big Wave","review":"I enjoyed reading this brief story that contains much wisdom regarding living in the face of death and destruction, and the process of grieving."},{"Title":"The Big Wave","review":"We had read a portion in elementary class and wanted to read the whole book. We had some very interesting discussions and will recommend it to other 4th grade classrooms."},{"Title":"The Big Wave","review":"I'm reordering this and asking all my students (ages 7-17) to read it now in light of the tragic tsunami that struck Japan in March, 2011. Pearl Buck captures Kino's shock, grief and slow recovery with unparalleled sensitivity. This treats death, hope, friendship and love better than most books for children. I gave it to a doctor friend about 4 months ago because he had never read it. It's essential reading. Very timely now."},{"Title":"The Big Wave","review":"I first read this book when I was 9 years old, and it has stayed with me for almost 40 years. It's a beautiful story of life, of loss, of resilience and hope. Recent events brought me back to this book, and it's a story I want to share with younger family members."},{"Title":"The Big Wave","review":"The Big Wave is a pretty good book. I like the volcanoes and the huge wave. It would be even better if it was a little bigger book."},{"Title":"The Big Wave","review":"Better known for her youth in China, Pearl Buck has written an insightful tale set in undated Japan. Best friends Kino and Jiya grow in different situations as their fathers are engaged in seemingly opposed occupations: rice farmer and fisherman. But Buck's theme--the interweaving of skills which provide a balanced tapesty of Life--is gently expresssed in this little book. Besides the aspect of childhood friendships, she deals with the heavy topic of the role of Death in Life, by presenting the stoic Japanese philosophy which permits the renewal of hope despite overwhelming diaster.Although short this tale is not really intended for children under 12. Depicting cataclysmic events and mature themes, this book serves as an excellent introduction to a unit on Asia--both its geology and its Oriental perspectives on man's role in the world. It might even be considered an Allegory for middle school readers. Serious and sobering, THE BIG WAVE is a fast read for thoughtful minds."},{"Title":"The Big Wave","review":"The book is about two kids named KIno and Jaya. They ate ina smal town were a gigantic sunami is going to hit. Kino and Jaya need to find a way to survive.The messege is not to go back were you were because bad things are going to happen.

His father tells him this has happened once before and that the villagers below need to go to the castle. Kino sees several families or their children run to the castle. He waves to his friend Jiya. Jiya runs to the house of his friend Kino. There they watch as a giant wave wipes out all of the village and remaining people below, including Jiya's family. Given the choice to live with the old man in the castle or with his best friend's family, Jiya chooses his best friend's family. As time passes people begin to build on the beach again. Kino misses the beach and must make several decisions that not only affect him but the young girl he wants to marry."},{"Title":"The Big Wave","review":"This book taught a life lesson.

I just couldn't go on to the new day until I knew what was going to happen with Thomas, Gina, and Jonathan. I have never been so intranced with a book since I was in fifth grade and I read, The Ghost in the garden! Now that's what I call good writing! I even emailed Cherie (The Author) telling her how much her book meant to me, and she wrote back! I have never in my life done that! So you would imagine how pleased I was to get a response!

Well, it was like a snowball effect from there, we had everyone reading this book. This book was excellent! I literally could not put this book down once I started reading it! Of course I noticed it was the first in a series, so I had to go buy the rest of them! It turned out I loved them all and have since passed the collection on to my younger sister.

If you're looking to shore up your knowledge on specific areas, this may not be the right choice because the majority of the book is practice questions. You may want something else to supplement - but for me this was perfect (and, yes, I passed!)."},{"Title":"The COTA Examination Review Guide (Book with CD-ROM)","review":"I used this to study for my exam and found it very helpful.

It provides tips to take and study for the test, as well as answers at the end of each exam that thuroughly explain the right answer, as well as, if not more importantly, the wrong ones too. Because questions are often based on \\"the most right\\" answer\\", they tend to be quite tricky and this book helps enormously to learn how to best decipher the line of thinking behind each question.The CD ROM is a great addition to the book, such that it allows the user to take a computerized version of the test, that will mimic the actual test administered, so you're fully prepared on how things will go the day you take the 4 hour examination.I would highly recommend this book to any OTA student who wants to be confident in their ability to pass the exam the first time.

A solid performer like all of the books in this series."},{"Title":"Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution","review":"Those who have criticized this book thus far here are women who derive their sole identity and sense of importance, sadly, from their role as mothers. I know women who thoroughly enjoy being mothers, but they are few and their circumstances are unique. And even some of them still have a clear need to have another identity and a life of the mind they aren't permitted within the \\"institution\\" of motherhood. I myself, and most other mothers I know, struggle with the impossible expectations placed upon us to be perfect mothers/providers/etc., struggle to create a new and healthy understanding of motherhood, struggle to do right by our children and yet hold on to our own personhood, thinking, humor,... finding ourselves too often battling with self-hatred, resentment and guilt, knowing inside that no matter what, someone will criticize us for doing it all wrong. This book exposes this unfair situation in which many women who are mothers find themselves in. If to some Rich comes off as \\"angry,\\" well of course she is. It's a righteous anger. My only criticism of this book is the lack of attention it gives to the experiences of women of color and working-class women."},{"Title":"Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution","review":"When I first read OF WOMAN BORN, in the mid-seventies, it was a Godsend. Rich's feminist critique of the institution of motherhood elucidates the source of so many of the world's problems. When women, the source of life, the life givers, the ones who bear each one of us into the world, whether man or woman, are denigrated, oppressed, abused, imprisoned, and exploited by governments, religions, and cultures - everything is off-kilter. Rich accurately describes the state of motherhood in the mid-20th century and the toll it took on mothers and children. She helped me understand that the pressures mothers put on their daughters to conform to sexist stereotypes were part of the oppression they themselves were enduring. Re-reading this book over the decades, I've seen that while some things have improved for women since Rich wrote OF WOMAN BORN, we still have a long way to go before women are treated equally or given the respect they deserve for their role as life givers and nurturers. The worldwide upsurge in the revival of Fundamentalist religions that institutionalize the oppression and second-class status of mothers and their daughters is frightening, as is the rage expressed by some reviewers of this book. People who are threatened by the ideas in OF WOMAN BORN want to return to the days when women were chattel and children were seen but not heard.

During my research I found this book and it changed my entire view of motherhood..or rather the institution of motherhood. I have never realized how literally confining motherhood is. I look back at what my mom used to tell me about how kids held her back from what she wanted to do, and I realize (with the help of this book) what she ment. Not that was being rude when she said this, just that it is a fact that our patriarchal society uses motherhood to put women in 'their place'. Please if their is one book you take time to read make it this one. Rich writes this analytical book in such a way as to make it sound personal and interesting...not dry and dull. Highly, highly recommend it if you are trying to understand your mother or mothers in general. What an EYE OPENER!"},{"Title":"Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution","review":"Right after the birth of my second child I was in a poetry class at the local community college. We were assigned to find a poet and give a presentation of their poetry. I found Adrienne Rich and it was a Godsend. I was in a postpartum depression, I was so angry at the world, at my children, and this made me feel guilty and thus angry at myself. Her poetry and the book Of Woman Born, helped me realize that I was not the only mother who felt like this. I was not alone. This did not change my circumstances, once a mother forever a mother. But, I started accepting my life and the roles that I was required to play. She will always be one of my favorite poets. If she is ever in Minneapolis on a lecture tour or for a book signing, I would love to meet her and tell her in person how much her work has meant to me."},{"Title":"Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution","review":"This book is a miracle. I have read dozens of books about pregnancy, birth, babies and motherhood, and this blows them all out of the water. Rich's prose is poetry, and her research and scholarship are vast and impeccable. The critical reviews that report that she \\"didn't like motherhood\\" missed the point by a long shot (and misquote her). Rich's love for her three sons is clear throughout the book, but she does not shy away from acknowledging and facing the struggles that she faced as a mother. With this book, she explores the profound historical and cultural context in which all Western women experience both the bliss and the difficulties of motherhood. Of Woman Born is a huge gift to all people-- mothers, daughters, and sons. Read it and understand."},{"Title":"Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution","review":"It is powerful, candid, bold, and important. She opened my mind about motherhood and other issues but never strayed -- she is a fierce feminist, unafraid of telling the truth, and this book is a gem."},{"Title":"Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution","review":"If you want one book that tells the whole story of patriarchy, feminism, and religion in a relativelyshort readable form, poet Adrienne Rich's Of Woman Born is hard to beat.Let's begin with Chapter III, \\"The Kingdom of the Fathers.\\" Here is her opening: \\"For the first time in history, a pervasive recognition is developing that the patriarchal system cannot answer for itself; that it is not inevitable; that it is transitory; and that the cross-cultural, global domination of women by men can no longer be either denied or defended.\\" She goes on: \\"When we acknowledge this, we tear open the relationship at the core of all power-relationships . . . the sexual understructure of social and political forms. \\" And finally: \\"For the first time we are in a position to look around us at the Kingdom of the Fathers and take its measure. What we see is the one system which recorded civilization has never actively challenged, and which has been so universal as to seem a law of nature.\\" To explain her title of Motherhood, she notes that \\"Patriarchy could not survive without motherhood and heterosexuality in their institutional forms: therefore they have to be treated as axioms, as \`nature' itself, not open to question.\\" She demonstrates: \\"In the American colonies an ordinary family consisted of from twelve to twenty-five children. An \`old maid,' who might be all of twenty-five years of age, was treated with reproach if not derision; she had no way of surviving economically, and was usually compelled to board with her kin and help with the household and children. No other \`calling' was open to her.\\"This isn't too far from 1952 when I graduated from high school as valedictorian and was sent to college only as \\"insurance\\" in case something happened to the husband it was assumed I would \`catch' and whose children I would bear. Rich's experience of that time was mine: \\"I had no idea of what I wanted, what I could or could not choose. I only knew that to have a child was to assume adult womanhood.\\"Rich's love for her three sons is clear throughout the book, but she directly faces the powerlessness that women face as mothers in the cultural context of patriarchy. As she says, \\" The woman's body is the terrain on which patriarchy is erected.\\" (Note events in the U.S. Congress as well as around the world if you doubt that.) At the core of feminist issues is the hatred men have for women, which is clearly documented worldwide. Rich suggests that \\"it is the adolescent ego that is still so uncertain of itself that it perceives the female as threatening.\\" She notes that it isn't a matter of chronological age but \\"an aspect of male sexuality, which in a great many (probably a majority) of men, continues into middle life and beyond.\\" She says patriarchy is always trying to \\"kill the dragon\\" in negating women. It is the adolescent aspect of the male who wants woman for emotional sustenance while also fearing castration and death at her hands. Rich says that this fear is the dragon to be slain.Rich says, \\"Few women growing up in patriarchal society can feel mothered enough; the power of our mothers, whatever their love for us and their struggles on our behalf, is too restricted.\\" After all, it is the mother who is expected to teach the female her proper role in patriarchy. The bequest we can give to our daughters (meaning all young women) is the quality of our lives, \\"however embattled and unprotected. Because a woman who can believe in herself, who is a fighter, and who continues to struggle to create livable space around her, is demonstrating to her daughter\\" (to all daughters) \\" that these possibilities exist.\\""},{"Title":"Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution","review":"Book is a good quality, fast shipping. This book is an eye opener for understanding the mentality of the ultra feminist and women who see no reason for child birth. A controversial book that would make some women especially traditional mothers scream. If you want to understand a world of gender questioning, concepts of gender and roles then read this one. Keep this on a shelf. For the men who hate women, this will help you see the difference between real traditional women and feminism that is what some of you men think is about all women whom you see as not subservient."},{"Title":"Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution","review":"Adrienne Rich's book, Of Woman Born, is a book about Rich's own experience of being a mother. She writes from a feminist perspective, and explains how the motherhood institution that is imposed on them through society determines a woman's motherhood experience. At one point in the book, Rich tells a story about a woman who killed and decapitated two of her children in her front yard. When Rich discusses this story with her poetry group, the women all agreed that they felt a direct connection with the woman\`s desperation. Rich wrote that every woman in her poetry group that had children could identify with her. It seems as though all parents have a breaking point when it comes to their children, however it seems highly unlikely that those parents could ever imagine doing what that woman did to their own children. Rich also discusses the hatred that mothers feel towards their child, and the depression she felt throughout raising her three children. The book also seems to be a bit outdated. At one point of the book, Rich writes \\"I had no idea of what I wanted, what I could or could not choose. I only knew that to have a child was to assume adult womanhood.\\" When relating this quote to the 50's, it is very fitting. However, it is not so true for this time period. Women are no longer expected to bear children. Women can now go to college, achieve a degree, and obtain virtually any job a man could get. It is much more accepted now if a woman does not want to have children. There are many women who chose not to have families now a day, but who are still assumed into adult womanhood. She continues to express that her children held her back from being able to do what she wanted to do in life. I know plenty of women who are able to have jobs while also caring for their children. I feel like by Rich saying this, she is stating an untrue generalization that no woman wants to be a stay at home mom, and no woman is able to live her life to the fullest if they have children. These generalizations may be true for some women, but there are plenty of women out there who do not fit into this mold that Rich describes. Rich also writes \\"women have been both mothers and daughters, but have written little on the subject; the vast majority of literacy and visual images of motherhood comes to us filtered through a collective or individual male consciousness.\\" For the time this book was written, Rich was completely right. However, women writers are now as common as men.The one part I did find interesting in the book was when Rich discussed the history of women. She theorizes that women bear the weight of Eve's transgression, since she was the first women offender. She also goes on to talk about how the relationship between sexual acts and pregnancy went unrecognized. Men had an active denial to their paternal role; therefore they believed that women were impregnated by spirits of the dead. I also thought it was interesting when Rich mentioned how Ancient Mid-Eastern tombs were deliberately designed to resemble the body of the mother- with labyrinths and spirals intended to represent her internal anatomy- so that the spirit could be reborn there.I have read a lot of positive reviews for this book, so maybe I do not have the same connection to the author that others have. I am not a mother so there may be some parts of the book I cannot fully relate to and have some bias towards."},{"Title":"Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution","review":"This autobiography reads like the rantings of a woman who just needs to buck up and get over it. YES, motherhood is difficult (HELLOOO), and YES you have to submit your own individual needs, wants, and desires for those of your children. The book revealed to me the utterly selfless love that Rich apparenly doesn't possess. I wonder how her children feel as they read it."},{"Title":"Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution","review":"Adrienne Rich's experience as a mother is what propelled her to write this depressing look at motherhood as an institution and at the the patriarchial society that imposes its restrictions and encourages its oppression. It is her own negative experience as a mother that compells her to condemn the entire history of womanhood and its accomplishments. Did Adrienne Rich ever think that perhaps she is projecting her own experiences onto the lives of the general public? A selfish, unloving mother who felt &quot;depressed&quot; throughout her entire experience raising children is certainly not the one to be writing about the experience of motherhood as the general public sees it. Rather than giving practical advice in terms of empowering women, she emasculates men, choosing this as the best method to raise women. Her suggestions as to how women can overcome their &quot;oppression&quot; are buried somewhere underneath poetic phrases relating to her own miserable experiences as a mother. If her kids, aren't in therapy, they should be!"},{"Title":"Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution","review":"I was forced to read this book in a class recently by the usual suspect, my feminist professor, and was very sad to see that this piece of lesbian hatred of the family was being pushed upon young women in my class at a vulnerable time of their lives. The usual atmosphere in universities now, in which young women are asked either to agree with feminist diatribes of this sort or be labelled weak and a tool of men, was so plainly at work here. I'm older than the others in my class, and a father and husband, and the book was so plainly the product of a neurotic, unhappy person that I was having difficulty understanding why we were reading it. The vast majority of women want families and to be mothers and wives, and they need help to do it better, not to be force-fed this sort of weak broth. When Rich says of her pregnancy and motherhood, &quot;I only knew that I had lived through something which was considered central to the lives of women... a key to the meaning of life; and that I could remember little except anxiety, physical weariness, anger, self-blame, boredom, and divisions within myself,&quot; she admits to something sad, not hoepful, and demeans her children and their worth. Poor, sad, neurotic woman. I think young women would be best served to view this book as something to avoid -- or at least as something to view with pity, and not permit your professors force you to agree with it."},{"Title":"Spectrum Series Word Study and Phonics: Grade 6","review":"This text is adult enough to use with ESL (adult) students with sufficient complexity to be challenging.

The art of being a good listener isn't determined by DNA. Dr. John Lovitt believes anybody can master the skill if they're willing to work at it.In this first of a series of books aimed at teaching people to communicate well, Dr. Lovitt defines what makes a truly good listener: &quot;Listening,&quot; he writes in chapter three, &quot;is when listeners provide verbal and non-verbal responses to understand or match the intended message of the messengers.&quot;True listening, he goes on to explain, requires several processes: listening for content, context and key feelings and listening and observing for non-verbal cues and behavior.Most of us manage to muddle along reasonably well with our standard listening skills. However, says Dr. Lovitt, those who listen for a living need to do better, particularly if their goal is to validate and/or help the messenger.Wittily illustrated by San Antonio, Texas, artist Bill Bristow, WHO'S LISTENING ANYWAY is written in clear, concise language and with an enthusiastic style that makes the lessons it contains relatively painless.

The more they are listened to, the cleaner their attics become. The more they are listened to, the less wounded they are.

Three Worlds is a \\"loose\\" sequel to Anderson's short story, \`Sam Hall' published in the August 1953 edition of Astounding Science fiction. Both cover some aspect of post-WWIII Earth.The Jovian moon, Ganymede is an Earth mining colony settled by many political dissidents. The main character, Mark Fraser, contacts and communicates with an unusual looking alien named Theor who inhabits with his kin a solid layer of Jupiter (with plants, domesticated animals, cities, trees, volcanoes, barbarians, and oceans of various chemicals!).Poul's description of the Nyarrans is particularly hilarious (how to confuse the reader with too many adjectives!). The closest visual approximation I could come with is a six-legged centaur with antennae and gills! The Nyarrans are also particularly interesting because they have three sexes (males, females, and demi-males -- all three are needed to have young) however, Poul Anderson does not explore this dynamic in much detail.The novel concerns, on Ganymede, the arrival of the USS Vega spaceship and its commander, who seek to utilize the natural resources of the moon and its inhabitants to construct nuclear weapons to put down a pro-Democracy rebellion on Earth and reinstall a new dictator President. Mark Fraser leads an insurrection against the invasion.Theor and his fellow Nyarrans, wage war against another group of invaders whose lands on Jupiter have been flooded. Here, Poul Anderson spins a simplistic survival tale in the best pulp tradition complete with vivid descriptions of battles with spears and axes. Theor treks across the surface(s) of Jupiter meeting other strange natives, gigantic beasts of various sorts, and even parachutes with large leaves! Until the very end of the story the only connection with the two concurrent parts of the novel is Fraser's communications with Theor, the Nyarr.Anderson manages, in the end, to connect both stories nicely. As is the case with much early sci-fi, the female characters are short changed. Fraser's wife literally only speaks from the shadows! While Fraser and various other colonists are hiding in the border settlements the women (as a collective group) huddle with their children completely separately from the men! The main female character is a little more interesting -- and surprisingly, a chaste relationship is maintained! However, Poul Anderson has Lorraine perpetuate his own sexist beliefs: \\"But I'm a woman, and untrained for the work, and...I never will.\\"All in all, Three Worlds to Conquer is a delightful romp. I enjoyed the descriptions of life on Jupiter (however, scientifically incorrect they might be) and I genuinely cared for many of the characters. Obviously, in this day and age, a 142 page books hardly seem sufficient -- I definitely wanted the story to continue. However, despite its short length, Anderson manages to construct a well plotted novel with some vivid action, relatively engaging politics, and interesting characters (kind of). Definitely a worthwhile read!"},{"Title":"Three Worlds to Conquer, (Pyramid SF R-994)","review":"I'm a well seasoned in reading Anderson novels, this being my fourteenth.

I tend to read the synopsis AFTER I've read the book because I like to be surprised by the content of the novel... somethings the damn synopses give away everything or promise too much. To further expound:Mark is a contact specialist of sorts who is in contact with an alien race on the surface (!) of Jupiter. Having created a new language between his own tongue and the aliens tongue, Mark is the best at what he does. He is also skeptical of the arrival of battleship USS Vega at the mining base of Ganymede. The admiral spins a lengthy story of how earth government (controlled by the almighty USA of course) had fallen to rebels. The battleship is on the moon for the sake of taking control of its mining facilities in order to process materials for nuclear weapons so that they can oust the rebels with brute strength. Lorraine is a collaborator with intentions of sabotaging the tyrannical hold the admiral holds over the colony. When Mark and Lorraine conspire together, plans for escape and control grow rapidly.In a parallel plot, the alien in contact with Mark is named Theor. His Nyarr clan is becoming close to being invaded by the larger, more brutal and uncivilized Ulunt-Khazul clan. The communicator (a neutrino communicator beaming conversations up to Mark) fails to impress the heathens after Theor fails to contact Mark. Thus begins a sea-battle and land-battle amongst the two clans. When Theor is captured, his relationship with his \\"mind-brother\\" Mark will be called upon for the sake of both individuals.I think Anderson had a great thing going with the Theor plot line and having a human plot in parallel to this only strengthened each plot.Three Worlds to Conquers suffers from one early SF element which plagues other novels but leaves this book without damaging effects: that of the \\"I got a sudden idea\\" syndrome, where crafty plans for escape or retribution are fabricated from thin air, bless the ever-whimsical protagonist capable of this feat! One more minor quirks which you'll come across is the 1960s fixation on the infinite wonders of pharmacopoeia. There's always a pill that'll fix something (effects of gravity, banishment of fatigue, unexpression of emotion, etc.). One last irk is one exclusive to Anderson, himself: he loves to use archaic Middle English or Olde English words throughout his early novels be it in dialogue or narration. Here's a short list of annoying words: behoven, erstwhile, yonder, erelong, belike, lest, beset, nigh and (my favorite) thundersmitten.If you can look past the points above and suspend whatever science knowledge you have about the atmosphere and surface of Jupiter, then you're in a for a excellent action-to-the-last-page novel,easily read in one or two days."},{"Title":"Three Worlds to Conquer, (Pyramid SF R-994)","review":"Science fiction is excellent entertainment and the plots have some times been predictors of events and technical advancements. Yet, in most cases the advance of science has rendered stories technically impossible and some of the \\"predicted\\" technical achievements are absurd in retrospect. When that occurs, the story must be read with a bit of a retro mindset where you must suspend your knowledge of the scientific truth. Also, you must rely on the excitement of the action to keep your mind on the edge of its' pedestal.This book is one where you must do that; the direct action takes place on the surface and moons of Jupiter. Anderson has several species of intelligent beings living on the surface of Jupiter and there are human colonies in the cluster of moons and asteroids that orbit Jupiter. Mark Fraser is a human resident of the colonies and he is in communication contact with Theor, an intelligent being living on the surface of Jupiter. They communicate via a series of clicks and other sounds using a neutrino radio.As always, Earth is undergoing a civil war and a powerful warship arrives at the colonies and the commander assumes control of the government. There is a revolt by the colonists that initially fails. On the surface of Jupiter, Theor's community is also under attack from other intelligent creatures and they too are initially defeated. Both sides must regroup and learn how to counterattack in order to drive away or destroy the invaders.Mark and Theor are in regular contact and through all this, they are able to devise a way they can provide mutual assistance as they battle back against their foes. While science has rendered this plot largely impossible, Anderson does an excellent job in making the story believable if you accept the scientific knowledge of the time that it was written. I find it refreshing to occasionally go back and read science fiction of the forties and fifties. It is a lesson on how things change as well as just a simple and basic joy to read the works of the old masters of science fiction."},{"Title":"The Talmud, The Steinsaltz Edition, Volume 20: Tractate Sanhedrin, Part VI","review":"I do not know if it makes much sense to review a Massekhet of the Gemarah. I will only say that I learned the Masekhet with the Steinsaltz Talmud and that it helped me tremendously. I would especially love reading the Halacha section in which the decisive legal decision would be given on matters in question. I learned this Massekhet by myself, and also in a shiur. I am not the greatest learner in the world, and the Steinetz Talmud helped me better understand matters many times."},{"Title":"Original Intent & the Framers of the Constitution","review":"This contribution to the seemingly endless debate over original intent serves a purpose in demonstrating that what often passes as a jurisprudence of original intent is anything but that. Jaffa effectively shows that the denial of natural law by modern jurists, both conservative and liberal (although fellow conservatives are the target of most criticism in this book), cannot be squared with the views of the Founders. Jaffa's further argument, that the Constitution must be interpreted in light of the words of the Declaration of Independence, is less successful. A problem is that the author focuses so much on one case (the Dred Scott decision) to prove his point that it is difficult to see how natural law thinking would be applied to other, less emotionally-charged cases. Apparently, Jaffa wants judges to read Aristotle, Cicero, Locke and the like and decide cases based on the insights gleaned from therein. It should be said, however, that the inclusion of the three critical essays from fellow professors, and Jaffa's reply to all three, does allow for an expansion of the author's thinking beyond what is presented in the main, introductory essay (although it does mean that there is a good deal of repetition througout the book). As a critique of self-proclaimed originalists, this is a useful work, but it has little in the way of constructive proposals."},{"Title":"Original Intent & the Framers of the Constitution","review":"Though Dr. Jaffa makes a habit of the poor practice of shooting his friends in the back, at times it is the duty of friends--upon being confronted by an enemy of moronic proportions--to come to one another's assistance in light of such great an injustice. The reviewer, or rather backroom scribbler, who had the audacity to rate Dr. Jaffa's book as worthy of only one star, must be a woman or else a madman, for only one of those two would be capable of such an unjustified criticism supported by such weak polemics. Though Dr. Jaffa's book does not take full account of the extent to which Lincoln--and the founders--understood the inherent dangers of equality (as they were seen in practice and elucidated by Tocqueville) it is nonetheless a master stroke of penmanship, philosophy, and history that sheds light on the possibility for practical, yet noble, government that is afforded us under the framework of the constitution. Dr. Jaffa's detractor deserves the penalty afforded by Jefferson to Sodomites--although in this case we'd be cutting off the upper-most organ as well as the lower, thus putting the guillotine to a dual use."},{"Title":"Original Intent & the Framers of the Constitution","review":"This book takes up where its author's personal quest, detailedin its pages, left off. As the author tells it, he made a point offollowing former Attorney General Edwin Meese III around the country to hector him on his understanding of the meaning of the United States Constitution. Whenever Meese simply ignored him, Jaffa says (though not in those words), it was a great rhetorical victory for Jaffa!One might read Jaffa's account and conclude that Meese was simply responding to Jaffa's behavior the way a polite man would. Jaffa's rhetoric in this book also strikes the reader as being aimed below the belt.Following on a private letter that James Madison wrote to Thomas Jefferson well after both of them had retired from public life, Jaffa insists that all of the constitution must be read in the refracted light of the Declaration of Independence. This is a common reading of the Old Left, one that Abraham Lincoln and Mario Cuomo share.Of course, it has no relationship to reality. Neither in the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 nor in the ratifying conventions did people make a point of holding the constitution to the Declaration's standard; indeed, given that the Declaration includes sections upbraiding King George III for trying to provoke slave rebellions in Virginia, one wonders exactly how &quot;Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity&quot; have come to seem to Jaffa, _et al._ to be the Declaration's message.Avoid this book, then, unless you desire to see an exotic brand of &quot;conservatism&quot; in its most virulent strain. Other than that, it's both unreliable and unreadable."},{"Title":"Nice Girls Don't Get...: The Corner Office/Rich","review":"I only rated this a 4 because I like to reserve a 5 for truly outstanding things, but don't get me wrong; this was definitely worth my money.

Both authors were rightly impressed with the great influence he had on the Christian world prior to and during the time of the reformation. I had previously known that Luther and Calvin were the major players in the reformation but hadn't realized that so many characters prepared for it and also tried to temper the violent outcomes. Erasmus stood out for me as an intriguing person that I wanted to learn more about. As a result, I purchased this book to get a sample of his writings.This book of just over 300 pages contains as its major work \\"The Praise of Folly\\". This satirical gem has Folly incarnated as a type of a classical goddess discussing the virtues of folly and using various classical and everyday examples to justify why folly is such a good thing. Fortunately, the compiler has footnotes to explain the classical references to those not familiar with most of them; this helped me a lot.There follows the brilliant anti-war piece entitled \\"The Compliant of Peace\\", where peace is embodied and complains of how he is abused and neglected. Then follows two forewords to his groundbreaking Latin translation of the Greek New Testament, explaining why he did this. I hadn't realized how intense the opposition was. After that we have the hilarious \\"Julius Excluded from Heaven\\"; an imagined conversation between Pope Julius and St. Peter at heavens gate. I can see why it was initially published anonymously.The next section includes four of his Colloquies; very well written and bringing out some good points. Three letters are also included including one defending his Praise of Folly, another describing his travels, and another to a high ranking Bishop. The final section includes six essays of varying interest discussing Erasmus.I loved Erasmus' writing style and though the compilation a very good introduction to his writing. Adam's translation was very clear. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more of Erasmus and sample his writing."},{"Title":"The Praise of Folly and Other Writings (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"This edition has &quot;some&quot; of Erasmus' most influential works; namely, &quot;The Praise of Folly&quot;, the political &quot;Complaint for Peace&quot;, &quot;Forewords to the Latin New Testament&quot;, &quot;Julius Excluded from Heaven&quot;, the &quot;Colloquis&quot;, and excerpts from his finest letters. These works are selected more to understand the humanistic side of Erasmus rather than the scholarly doctrinaire who labored for the peace of christendom. With these selections - entailed by fotenotes, the editor's prefaces, and critcical commentaries - this edition will invariably enhance a more intimate impression of the mind of Erasmus at the dawn of the reformation."},{"Title":"The Praise of Folly and Other Writings (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"The other reviewers have praised Erasmus, and, well, duh. Anyone still in print after 500 years probably had some profound and interesting things to say.But I suspect most people looking at this edition will be doing so in the hope it will contain the variety of secondary materials commonly found in the usually excellent Norton Critical Editions. In that respect I was disappointed with this volume. It does an excellent job of selecting from Erasmus's works, but a poor one, in my opinion, of including secondary literature.I like what is there, I just want more."},{"Title":"The Praise of Folly and Other Writings (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"Erasmus conveys in his writings a deeply principled, heartfelt faith leavened with genuinely funny and often cutting wit. He is a great Rationalist while admitting the workings of the irrational and mystical. His attacks on the excesses of the Church are exactly that, attacks on the excesses but not the Church itself. There is a profound integrity that never slips into a self-righteousness. HIs letter to Martin Dorp is an excellent example. The Praise of Folly is a gem, but is only an introduction to the riches in the other selections.

Of course, Erasmus had been mentioned in my presence often, but never in a direct context. So I pick up this book, hoping to find out what the deal was and what I was missing.My entire view of the middle ages changed practically overnight. Do not miss the fact, people: Erasmus was THE deal. Erasmus makes Luther look like a limp little hothead. Erasmus is Jim Carrey to Voltaire's Carrot Top. Erasmus drows the candle of Aristophanes with a roaring torch. The ultimate critic, the ultimate wit, and the ultimate reason in an age of insanity. Without this fantastic book I may have passed a second 18 years without Erasmus as an inspiration. The pure genius and subtlety of truly the most underappreciated scholar of all time is laid out glowingly. Why did I waste my time with &quot;Mandrake&quot; and &quot;Candide&quot; when &quot;In Praise of Folly&quot; does the same job a thousand times better? Why on earth do we pay attention to Martin Luther, the most incompetant and ridiculous &quot;reformer&quot; of all time, when Erasmus was doing everything twice as good at exactly the same time?Get this book, people.

To understand this book, you should have prior coursework experience in at least several upper division undergraduate courses in mathematical statistics and probability theory. The structure of this book is also that of a typical math book; full of proposition, corollary, lemma, etc, and very limited use of illustrations (e.g., there is no single figure up to chapter 6).I wanted a book with a mathematical sophistication simliar to Durbin's book, but this book is way more than that. On the other hand, I showed this book to a mathematics graduate student and she said this book is perfect for her. So I guess this book is written by a mathematician only for mathematicians."},{"Title":"Hidden Markov Models for Bioinformatics","review":"The book gives outstanding coverage of all that goes into building HMMs - one of the most important tools in genome analysis and structure prediction. It covers the field in extreme depth. More depth, in fact, than needed for building useful HMM systems. It not only presents the forward and backward algorithms leading up to Baum-Welch, it presents all the extras - convergence, etc.This additional depth of coverage may go beyond many readers' needs. It is very helpful, though, for people who need more than the usual algorithms. By giving the background in such detail, a persistent reader can follow to a certain point, then create modifications with a clear idea of where the new algorithm actually comes from.Regarding the current practice of HMM usage, I found it a bit thin. Widely-known tools based on HMMs are mentioned only occasionally and in passing, and HMM-based alignment is discussed only briefly. Well, this book isn't for the tool user. Perhaps more important, I found scant mention of scoring with respect to some background probability model (\\"null\\" model, as it's called here).My one real complaint, and this is truly minor, is the quality of illustration. The line-drawings look like Word pictures - not necessarily a bad thing, if done well. These aren't particularly professional-looking, though, and oddly stretched or squashed in many cases. Still, they're readable enough and make all the needed points.A lesser point, and not the author's fault, is the editorial implication that this book introduces probabilitic models in general. It does not. This is strictly about HMMs, not Bayesian nets, bootstrap techniques, or any of the dozens of other probabilistic models used in bioinformatics. That is not a flaw of the book, just a flaw in how it's represented.If you are dedicated to becoming an expert in HMM construction and application, you must have this book. It's a bit much, though, for people who just want the results that HMMs give."},{"Title":"Hidden Markov Models for Bioinformatics","review":"The field of computational biology has expanded greatly in the last decade, mainly due to the increasing role of bioinformatics in the genome sequencing projects. This book outlines a particular set of algorithms called hidden Markov models, that are used frequently in genetic sequence search routines. The book is primarily for mathematicians who want to move into bioinformatics, but it could be read by a biologist who has a strong mathematical background. The book is detailed at some places, sparse in others, and reads like a literature survey at times, but many references are given, and there are very interesting exercises at the end of each chapter section. In fact it is really imperative that the reader work some of these exercises, as the author proves some of the results in the main body of the text via the exercises.Some of the highlights of the book include: 1. An overview of the probability theory to be used in the book. The material is fairly standard, including a review of continuous and discrete random variables, from the measure-theoretic point of view, i.e the author introduces them via a probability space which is set with its sigma field, and a probability measure on this field. The weight matrix or &quot;profile&quot; as it is sometimes called, is defined, this having many applications in bioinformatics. Bayesian learning is also discussed, and the author introduces what he calls the &quot;missing information principle&quot;, and is fundamental to the probabilistic modeling of biological sequences. Applications of probability theory to DNA analysis are discussed, including shotgun assembly and the distribution of fragment lengths from restriction digests. A collection of interesting exercises is included at the end of the chapter, particularly the one on the null model for pairwise alignments. 2. An introduction to information theory and the relative entropy or &quot;Kullback distance&quot;, the latter of which is used to learn sequence models from data. The author defines the mutual information between two probability distributions and the entropy, and calculates the latter for random DNA. He also proves some of the Shannon source coding theorems, one being the convergence to the entropy for independent, identically distributed random variables. The Kullback distance is then defined, as a distance between probability distributions, with the caution that it is not a metric because of lack of symmetry. 3. The overview of probabilistic learning theory, where 'learning from data' is defined as the process of inferring a general principle from observations of instances. 4. The very detailed treatment of the EM algorithm, including the discussion of a model for fragments with motifs. 5. The discussion of alignment and scoring, especially that of global similarity. Local alignment is treated in the exercises. 6. The discussion of the learning of Markov chains via Bayesian modeling applied to a training sequence via a family of Markov models. Frame dependent Markov chains are discussed in the context of Markovian models for DNA sequences. 7. The discussion of influence diagrams and nonstandard hidden Markov models, in particular the excellent diagrams drawn to illustrate the main properties, and excellent discussion is given of an &quot;HMM with duration&quot; in the context of the functional units of a eukaryotic gene. This is important in the GeneMark:hmm software available. 8. The treatment of motif-based HMM, in particular the discussion of the approximate common substring problem. 9. The discussion of the &quot;quasi-stationary&quot; property of some chains and the connection with the &quot;Yaglom limit&quot;. 10. The treatment of Derin's formula for the smoothing posterior probability of a standard HMM. The author shows in detail that the probability of a finite length emitted sequence conditioned on a state sequence of the HMM depends only on a subsequence of the state sequence. 11. The treatment of the lumping of Markov chains, i.e. the question as to whether a function of a Markov chain is another Markov chain. 12. The very detailed treatment of the Forward-Backward algorithm and the Viterbi algorithm. 13. The discussion of the learning problem via the quasi-log likelihood function for HMM. 14. The discussion of the limit points for the Baum-Welch algorithm. Since the Baum-Welch algorithm deals with iterations of a map, its convergence can be proved by finding the fixed points of this map. These fixed points are in fact the stationary points of the likelihood function and can be related to the convergence of the algorithm via the Zangwill theory of algorithms. Unfortunately the author does not give the details of the Zangwill theory, but instead delegates it to the references (via an exercise). The Zangwill theory can be discussed in the context of nonlinear programming, with generalizations of it occurring in the field of nonlinear functional analysis. It might be interesting to investigate whether the properties of hidden Markov models, especially their rigorous statistical properties, can all be discussed in the context of nonlinear functional analysis."},{"Title":"Hidden Markov Models for Bioinformatics","review":"\\"Hidden Markov Models of Bioinformatics\\" is an excellent exploration of the subject matter: appropriate coverage, well written, and engaging. Hidden Markov Models are a rather broad class of probabilistic models useful for sequential processes. Their use in the modeling and abstraction of motifs in, for example, gene and protein families is a specialization that bears a thorough description, and this book does so very well. This is a book for understanding the theory and core ideas underlying profile HMMs, and if the term Expectation Maximization doesn't sound familiar or interesting to you, this is probably not the book you're looking for. Personally I found it clearer in some ways than the standard reference by Durbin, Eddy, Krogh, and Mitchison, but actually the two complement each other very nicely. If you are interested in constructing an HMM for your favorite protein family you probably want to look at the HMMER or SAM documentation instead; if you want to understand where HMMs come from or how you might architect one, there's probably no better book than this one."},{"Title":"A Short History of China and Southeast Asia: Tribute, Trade and Influence (A Short History of Asia series)","review":"\\"Explored are relations between China and Southeast Asia across two millennia; patterns of diplomacy, commercial networks, and migration; and how these have varied over time.\\"The book's description is what I was seeking, and it delivered on that promise.How did China's view of itself as \\"The Middle Kingdom\\" differ from the understandings of smaller nations with competing neighbors?

Edited by E. Dennis, George Gerbner and Yassen N. Zassoursky. 180 Pages. The International Publishers, First Printed in 1991. Price $ 21.95\\"Beyond the Cold War\\" is a collection of critical and analytical essays on the state of media in the US and USSR region. The amnioticity and tension between the Soviet block of nations and the United States and its allies is viewed by a number of journalists. Psychological and media war, Political maneuvering, war by proxy and fear of mutual annihilation is viewed analytically. Prior to the Cold War, the images of opposite mass media had been objected by the \\"Iron Curtain\\" and aftermath, the blind folded eyes of the both sides were opened. As viewed by one writer, the American image on Russia was based on the concept of the mysteriousness of the Russian soul. He further states that USA helped the USSR to wipe out Tzar's reign.The first writer brings out the way that American media corrected their perspectives before and after the Glasnost. He mainly tries to highlight the American efforts to bring the Cold War to an end. The history of images of both sides is discussed. The images built up were almost imaginary during Cold War period. This essay is well analysed and manured with facts.2nd writer is a pro-Russian. He brings out Russian attributes of the Cold War. He describes availability of the information of US in USSR and visa versa. The 3rd writer too describes an Epoch of the Cold War and post Cold War. His effort to describe the US and USSR relations is successful. He perceives that even during the Cold War, the US-USSR people were better relations in comparison to the other nations, which he derives with valid reasons.Next writer also tries to describe the roles of Soviet and American television during this crucial period, which he perceives as a successful role. Following the next has tried to describe the image of Soviet Union and United States. His effort to emphasize that the Soviet Unionist images is not primitive, but impressive.Following Writers thinking is based on coverage of electronic media of Reagan - Gorbachev summits. Being a pro American, he points out the defensive role of American journalists towards Gorbachev's move, the fear of being called as manipulated by Gorbachev. Comments of this kind point out the liberal thinking of writers.A Chinese writer points out the images of 3 distinct Newspapers. Giving the information, he visualises this movement positively.

I was expecting a kids book but far from it - while not academic or even pretentiously so, it's on par with a PBS episode of \\"American Experience\\" and reminds me of how fun history can be. The historical photo's are excellent, numerous and tightly connected to the text. Highly recommended for anyone interested in RLS, American history and the immigrant experience of the late 19th century. Jim Murphy has written about a dozen books like this including some Newbury award winners, hope to read some more, the language and prose is easy and leaves a strong impression of time and place, very enjoyable."},{"Title":"ACROSS AMERICA ON AN EMIGRANT TRAIN","review":"This was a wonderful over view of the hardships endured by our ancestors as they made their way west.

Particularly the sections on the &quot;international debt crisis&quot; and the negative impact of the IMF and the World Bank on the socialist regimes of Eastern Europe are thougt-provoking and very helpful. In this way, the book prepares the ground for a complicated argument in which long-term/ sytemic factors intermingle with the short-term factors, like Gorbachov's comimg to power in the SU, and presents a very readable and interesting account for the students of this important question of modern European history."},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"An In-depth Look at Florence Littauer's Personality PlusBy Lawrence J. Clark, Ph.D.Personality Plus was the first book I had ever read that was devoted entirely to the study of the four temperaments. I had been introduced to the topic when I attended a CLASSeminar for Christian Leaders, Authors, and Speakers in Houston.Since I had just attended the CLASSeminar before reading Personality Plus, and had taken the personality profile during the seminar, chapters one and two were mostly review. When I first filled out the profile, though, I came out being a combination of \\"Perfect\\" Melancholy and \\"Popular\\" Sanguine. This combination of temperaments, according to the seminar leaders and the book, was highly unlikely, and was probably a result of something called \\"masking.\\" (I will explain this in a future article.) With the help of a good friend who was also attending the seminar (and who happens to be a licensed therapist) I retook the profile after carefully reading the definitions and thinking back to my personality as a child. This time I came out Choleric/Sanguine, which as you will see below, makes much more sense. While reading chapter three of Personality Plus, I recognized that I do have many of the traits of a Popular Sanguine, but that temperament didn't quite describe me totally (if you are lost already, please see my previous article, \\"Introduction to the Personality Corner,\\" at [...].In chapter four, which dealt with the Perfect Melancholy personality type, I saw a few traits that I had picked up or tried to model at various points in my life, but realized that most of these were not natural to my personality, but were instead learned behavior. This is an important distinction. I did see, though, that my dad definitely fit in this category, as did my ex-wife.It was while reading chapter six, which covered the Powerful Choleric, that I really saw myself, or I should say I saw many traits that I was proud of, such as being determined, independent, willing to step in and take charge of almost any situation, and able to persevere against many obstacles that life has thrown in my path. I also saw, though, traits that others have noticed in me that I had been in denial about. Yes, I usually want things my way. Yes, my willingness to lead and take charge can sometimes make me seem bossy and cause me to become frustrated when things are not being done \\"properly\\" (translation \\"properly\\" = MY way). I do realize that I possess these weaknesses, and have worked hard to overcome them, but they still slip out on occasion.The next chapter, which described the Peaceful Phlegmatic personality, was not as interesting to me, because I don't identify with many of those traits. I will say that I avoid conflict and often act as a peacemaker, but that is probably more of a learned behavior, from watching adults fight when I was a child, than an in-born trait. I often tell myself that I wish I had a peaceful life, and enjoying spending time at our family retreat in the mountains, but when I say \\"peace,\\" I don't mean doing nothing and staring at the trees or the sky or my navel. Instead, I mean free to do what I want without distractions. When I am at our retreat, there are no papers to grade, no freeways to get stuck on, and no committee meetings to attend. I do, however, bring boxes full of books to read, several journals and spiral notebooks to write in, guitars and music books to practice with, and a laptop computer to write stories and articles and outlines for class lectures and motivational/inspirational speeches and programs. This is my \\"Powerful Choleric\\" way of relaxing on my vacation--doing all the things I don't have time to do when I am at home!The next four chapters discussed a variety of ways to help people of each personality type to overcome the weaknesses associated with that temperament. I liked the way each chapter was set up with a problem/solutions structure. I was of course most interested in the \\"organizing the Sanguine\\" and \\"toning down the Choleric\\" chapters, and took a lot of the suggestions to heart. In fact, two of the weaknesses I pledged to work on in the Commitment Letter I signed at the end of the CLASSeminar were listed in the Sanguine chapter: lack of organization and a tendency to procrastinate.Part 4 of this book discussed the different blends of personalities. This was important for me, because I found out how the traits associated with my blend of Sanguine and Choleric temperaments have made me who I am and have also contributed to many actions and choices, both positive and negative, that I have taken in my life. Some of these have been good, such as the Choleric tendency to be independent and strong willed, which helped me to go to college and eventually earn a Ph.D., even under extremely adverse circumstances. Some of them, though, such as my Sanguine need for acceptance and approval, caused me to make unwise choices of friends and activities as a teenager.The personal plan to assess my strengths and evaluate my weaknesses found in chapter 13 was also helpful, and I will continue this process for a long time to come. The chapter on how opposites attract each other was helpful in understanding why I chose my first wife (and why she chose me) and also why my lack of understanding of the temperaments caused me to not understand or meet her needs and vice-versa. It also helped me to see that my current (and hopefully last!) marriage is strong because we understand and build upon each other's strengths and weaknesses, and do our best to understand and meet each other's emotional needs. My wife and I also have two \\"Ch\\" words in common: Choleric and, most importantly, Christ.Chapters 15 and 16 helped me to understand my friends and the people I work with, and has especially helped me be more compassionate and more accepting of the different personalities of my co-workers. It has also helped me to have a sense of humor when thinking of some of their actions and statements, and I have begun collecting examples for some personality workshops I will be doing at our school next semester. Hopefully I can help the faculty and staff in my department, as well as employees at other companies and schools where I will be presenting workshops, to get along better after they gain a basic understanding of the personalities.The final chapter, \\"Personality Plus Power Produces Positive People,\\" did a good job of tying everything together. As was the case with the several other Florence and Marita Littauer books I have read, it was very encouraging and uplifting. Over the years, I have read dozens of \\"self-help\\" and motivational books by Stephen Covey, Anthony Robbins, Melody Beatty, Zig Zigler, and others, but what I appreciate about the \\"Littauer Ladies\\" (they probably wouldn't like that term, but oh, well . . .) is that they unapologetically point everything back to scripture and to Jesus' saving and transforming power. This is the \\"X\\" factor that will truly change lives, not just in this world, but for eternity."},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"A very insightful book that helps you to understand your own personality and to accept other people as they are.

No, I really mean it. We need to stop taking ourselves so seriously because if the truth be told, no one else does! I understand myself much better. I have always thought of myself as self confident bordering on arrogance some times, however this book brought an effective balance in my life. Florence's teaching had this &quot;Perfect Melancholy&quot; laughing out loud. My husband said to me several times &quot;nothing can be that funny&quot;. He was wrong and even though I'm now on my second thorough reading, I'm still laughing even though I know what it says. I promise you that you will experience positive change if you apply the knowledge and if you are &quot;really&quot; honest with yourself. It saved my relationship with my 18 year old daughter and have positively impacted the friendships that I have. Most of all, it enhanced an already beautiful relationship with my husband. We are very different as Florence's book helps us to determine and we love every minute of it!This book has so impacted my life that now I am certified to teach the materials and I have seen dramatic changes in both the religious and secular arena. I've taken other &quot;personality&quot; instruments and nothing has &quot;put the finger on that missing piece&quot; as did Personality Plus!I also enjoyed reading this book especially because I didn't need a dictionary to look up words that I didn't know as I read and didn't have to wade thorough &quot;stuffy or aristocratic&quot; language.You must read this book!"},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"After 9.5 years of marriage I finally realized that I, the Popular Sanguine was only getting things done thanks to my Melancholy wife.

The basis is a historical understanding of personality that is very applicable to today. I laughed at myself and saw my strengths and faults clearly. There are 4 basic personalities, combinations of these types bring the total to about 8, I find them easy to remember. One cautionary note: I was not helped by the Christian references to God and the bible, I found them to be unmotivating and annoyingly presumptuous.

I was warned before reading it so was able to ignore the references."},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"Very basic description of the personality types. Besides for holding seminars, etc I don't believe the author has any professional degrees in psychology or related fields so it made me cautious to believe some of the things she was saying (my friend Julie is x personality and did this, so everyone of that personality must be prone to doing this). Also it seems to have been written for a 10 year old and that probably added to my skepticism...The bible quotes everywhere were a little much for me but she's entitled to put her beliefs in her writings."},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"If ever you must read one book, pick your choice between this one or others written by Florence Littauer.While Personality Plus is more \\"textbook\\", this one is more \\"popular\\" reading with stories of people.

The most invaluable information I gleaned from the text was why my son and I clash so often- we're both melancholies, and I see aspects of my personality that I struggle with in him. I now have the tools to work on my weaknesses, and my relationships with others. Thank you, Ms. Littauer, for such an insightful book!"},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"Reviewer Pascal Schoneburg complains, \\"If you're totally new to personality theories and or psychology as a whole, this book may be for you - if you have aquired a knowledge foundation in psychology this book feels almost like an insult.\\" Well, Pascal, I have a master's degree in clinical psychology and I find Littauer's simple, foundational explanations the easiest to explain, illustrate, and understand one's essential personality. Go ahead and work with other systems that give you a possible fit in 16 categories, or 9, or whatever--and see how easily you remember what you've been taught.Over the years the study of innate temperament has been vilified by the \\"nurture\\" camp of \\"nature versus nurture\\" debaters, and by those who believe that Hippocrates and Galen, who introduced and refined the four temperament theory, were unwitting occultists. It only took a couple of thousand years for brain research to reach today's sophistication so that the development of neural pathways is a given and temperament is only argued from the standpoint of how many there are (3? 4? 5?).I think what Pascal is unhappy about is that this treatment of temperament is too simplistic for him. Well, if one is not a psychologist but has a fascination with and love for what makes us the way we are; and if one is a speaker interested in communicating ancient truths with simple and memorable illustrations; and if one desires to help people hold onto a concept instead of discarding it immediately because it's just too complex, then this book is fabulous.

I can't say that it really taught me anything that I didn't already know about myself, but it certainly gave me insight that helped me to understand others a little better. The only thing I didn't care for in this book is the use of religious quotes and references to God sporadically (not to be confused with the author's use of proverbs). I don't have a problem with religion and hope my next statement doesn't offend people, but I would prefer not to have religion quoted to me when reading a book.

Also, you should not start by focusing on understanding the combination temperatments.

For the past ten years, I've been looking for that test and finally found what I was looking for with Florence Littauer's book Personality Plus.Littauer classifies the four primary personality types: Popular Sanguine, Perfect Melancholy, Powerful Choleric and Peaceful Phlegmatic. Most every person fits into one of these personality categories, while some (like me) are near equal parts of two of the personality types.Personality Plus starts off with a quick quiz that will allow you to determine your primary personality. Then the book begins to go through each of the personality types, outlining the strengths and weaknesses and the positives and negatives of each.This isn't just about understanding your own personality but about the personality traits of others. Littauer teaches how to recognize the different personality types in different people and talks about each personality and how they interact with the others. She explains how your personality might be more sensitive to other types when conflict arises.The book provides a fascinating study of the human personalities and is an essential read for any office environment where there is a collection of different personality types. It's also a great read for parents to better understand their kids, though Littauer does have versions of this book targeted specifically for parents (Personality Plus for Parents: Understanding What Makes Your Child Tick) and couples (Personality Plus for Couples: Understanding Yourself and the One You Love)."},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"I read this book years ago and recently found it again.

She describes the four types and their strengths and weaknesses and keeps your attention all the way. I got a lot out of it and am reading it again. I would recommend it to others, because this system is easier than the Myers Briggs Kiersey system."},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"I read this book over 5 years ago after discovering the 4 personality traits and analysing them in a Steiner school context. Everything else I had come across regarding this was dark and heavy. Florence Littauer brings light, balance and laughter to this, previously regarded, heavy subject. I could identify myself and those around me with ease and many smiles! The only down side for me as a non Christian are the bible references. Not that it is 'preached' all the way through by any means. Therefore I would like to recommend this as a must read for everyone.....please, please, please don't be put off (as I would have been) by the reviews given from a Christian context, it is a great, and very enlightening read for all....even us heathens!"},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"Four personality types based on communication style and behavior allows the reader to come to a better understanding of how to deal with others effectively. A brief self-evaluation based on word preferences gets one started in learning what their personality type is and from there learn about oneself as well as others. Understanding self will definitely make a difference in how to deal with others. When an understanding of others' is gained through their personality types and the means of communicating as set forth in the book is used, success is around the corner. It takes time and effort, but has great rewards. I'm still learning, and getting better every day. No hard and fast rules, though. Can't fit anyone into a square box and make them stay there, we're all a composite of the four personality types, however, learning your's (and other's) most prominant type will make a difference."},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"This book helped me see people from a different perspective.

REALLY GREAT!"},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"It is rare that a person with the Sanguine personality type writes a book about this subject, so you get a unique perspective on how they view other people. I found it hysterical that she finds people with the Phlegmatic personality type \\"boring.\\" They are so boring, in fact, she implies that they will fall asleep at nearly a drop of a hat. She also finds people with the Choleric personality type super bossy, and itching to bait you into a verbal argument to prove that they are superior. While the book is repetitive, and none of the claims are supported scientifically, it has a couple of nuggets of useful information that you will find interesting. The most useful to me was the insight she gave on how Sanquines view other people."},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"I read this book, did the personality test and have never laughed so much in all my life. All these years I have often wondered what it was about me that put people off me! and why some people annoyed me and others(not many) I got on with like a house on fire. I am fascinated that people can be catergorised in such a way and it is all so true."},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"I have read this book many times, and give it as a gift of love to others. You will find it fun and easy to read -- but nearly impossible to put down. Understanding why people behave as they do makes human interactions sooo much smoother. I have been interested in human behavior for 30 years, even choosing sociology as a field of study in college, so when I praise this book you can be sure I rate it highly. Best wishes and Good reading! Donna Lan"},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"I love this book!! It is easy to read because the author interjects bits of human relationship stories to illustrate her points, making you feel like you know her and her family by the time you finish each chapter. The personality profile/test is easy to take, especially because she provides definitions of each term as they relate to each category. I couldn't believe how accurate and right-on the descriptions of each of the four temperaments proved to be! I know this book will help me in my personal relationships and my work. Seeing myself through Florence Littauer's eyes is very revealing, and very inexpensive therapy. I am so glad I took the challenge from my Mary Kay director and bought this book.

I would recommend it for almost anyone."},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"I found that this book was great for identifying personality types, but useless after that point. Ms. Littauer several times in the book gives comprehensive advice like &quot;Accentuate the Positives.

This book speaks to the reader at an elementary level, like talking to a child. I found it a bit upsetting and discontinued the book after chapter 1. If you're totally new to personality theories and or psychology as a whole, this book may be for you - if you have aquired a knowledge foundation in psychology this book feels almost like an insult.

The more I read this book and tried to figure out \\"who I was\\" the more confused I became. First, I was part of two personalities which, how kind of her, is allowed. But as I read on I saw parts of me in all four personalities, which means I took the test wrong or that I am \\"masking\\" a personality. What??? Honestly, I have never found it helpful to look deeper and deeper inside of my person or psyche because I find the same person everytime I look. A wretched sinner in need of a Savior. Psychology has never promised me anything accept the confirmation of how messed up I am without Jesus. The bible says that the heart is desperately wicked, who can know it? Yes, I am wicked and sinful but Jesus, my Savior promises me the hope of real change. Behaviorism gets us nowhere!"},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"PERSONALITY PLUS is one of the most enlightening books that I have ever read. Florence Littauer shows how to determine what type of temperament you fall into: Popular Sanguine, Powerful Choleric, Perfect Melancholy, or Peaceful Phlegmatic. Understanding that, we are then shown the strengths and weaknesses that accompany each of them. Littauer then teaches, gently and humorously, how we can improve ourselves and our relationships by simply recognizing and accepting the temperaments (in ourselves and others). For once we understand that the other temperaments are different from us because that is simply how they are built, and not because they wish to annoy us or make things difficult, it changes the way we look at and deal with people. As I read this book it was like a lightbulb popped on in my head--difficult people in my life were suddenly seen in a new light and dark motives I had attributed to them disappeared. And our relationships improved.I highly recommend this book. It will help you in friendships, with family, with romance, and at work. I recommend it even more for those who are in positions of leadership. Understanding yourself and then understanding those around you will radically change your life interactions for the better. FIVE STARS."},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"After getting a little insight into the theory of the different personalities (Choleric, Sanguine, Melancholy and Phlegmatic) I picked up this book on the recommendation of a friend who had read it and also heard Mrs. Littauer on audiotape.After taking the quiz inside the book, I found that I am nearly all Powerful Choleric, with some Popular Sanguine and Perfect Melancholy thrown in for good measure. I was somewhat aghast to find that there is no Peaceful Phlegmatic in my personality (a fact that doesn't surprise anyone who truly knows me!).Florence's book is entertaining, an easy read, and very valuable in it's insight. You won't find 'pigeon holes' in this book, for we are all a combination of multiple types of personalities (as I explained about myself above) but you'll definately gain a better understanding of your strengths and even some of your areas of challenge after reading this book.I liked the flow of the book and the detailed descriptions of each personality type. As I read through the book, I could see parts of people I worked with and have known throughout the years, and it's definately helped my personal interactions with them.Beware, you'll find yourself identifying parts of people's personalities on a constant basis once you read this book, but it's really fun once you get the hang of it. If you are a people person (or even if you are not) this book will become a much-used resource in your library.When working with my image consulting clients, I often recommend they pick up a copy of this book and read it from cover to cover as part of developing their self-image and indeed, discovering more about their true selves. People often deny parts of their personalities, believing there is something 'wrong' or less than desirable about a particular strength that they have.Florence's wonderful book will encourage all who read it to accept their individuality, while understanding more about what makes us the special and terrific creatures that we are."},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"I read this book quite a few years ago but I really enjoyed the updated version. She has so much wisdom about this topic. I teach school and I have my students take this test. It really helps me to understand them and plan accordingly. It has also helped me to understand my kids and husband. I highly recommend it to parents and educators. Very enlightening!"},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"As an abuse survivor I have spent most of my life struggling with my lack of self-esteem. My desire to be a control freak. My desire to be a perfectionist, while at the same time dealing with bouts of depression. This book helped me realize that I'm not mental. I'm merely 1 of 4 basic personalities! I know now that I was a Sanguin turned into a Melencholy. As a Christian I also cherish the fact that much of the author's statements are backed by scripture. Instead of suggesting pills, as many psychiatrists, have suggested, she merely gave me a blueprint of my personality and helped me understand it. This book CAN change/save your life!"},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"My marriage was a mess and I was ready to throw in the towel when my husband and I came across this book. That was 14 years ago. We realized we were sabotaging each other instead of appreciating each other. When my husband (melancholy) would retreat for some quiet time I (choleric) would take it personally and think he didn't want to be around me and was very hurt. I would then emesh in him which drew him away even further. Once we identified our strengths and weaknesses we realized the things we had origionally found attractive in each other were rubbing us the wrong way now. We found that our weaknesses were the other ones strengths and we began complimenting each other instead of resisting. We also saw how this impacted our whole family (4 kids all teenagers at the same time!) and how we could work with them differently. We taught them about the personalities as well which helped them get along better with each other. What a life changing book for us and one that I am grateful for. Bonnie McElwain"},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"This is one of the most helpful books if you want to understand and get along with other people - and anyone can read it. It is hilarious in places and you will see yourself on many pages doing things that come naturally but annoy others. It made me appreciate why my relationship with my brother has always been difficult - I just need to find a way for him to read the book! Perhaps then he will understand that our personality traits move us to act in certain ways and may cause unintentional offence. Armed with this knowledge, we might make a few more allowances for each other. I reckon every teenager needs to read this book - it should be on schools curricula - and maybe we will all get along a little better with each other. A super book."},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"Most books and pop-psychology about personality types are nonsense. There are a million different ways to assess people's personalities. \\"Personality Plus\\", however, sticks out from this sorry group like a sore thumb (I mean that in a good way). The author, Florence Littauer re-packages the ancient Greeks' thinking about personality into a Christian perspective on personalities, personal improvement, and social relationships.The Greeks thought there were essentially only four types of personalities: sanguine (talkative, life-of-the-party), melancholy (introverted, artsy, deep, perfectionist), choleric (workaholic, ambitious, leader), and phlegmatic (go-with-the-flow, nonchalant).Frankly, I've found the wisdom of the ancient Greeks to be far superior to modern methods that seek to categorize every little aspect of your life. Mrs. Littauer, weaving in personal experiences, anecdotes, and her knowledge of the four personalities, has written a wonderful little book on \\"how to understand others by understanding yourself\\". You'll be an expert in no time.She discusses the personalities themselves, their strengths and weaknesses, methods of improving on your strengths and overcoming your weaknesses, relationships among people of various personalities, blended personalities, and more. (Of course, she includes a self-test that you can take to determine your personality.)It is no exaggeration to say that learning about these social dynamics and personal realities can improve your friendships and even save your marriage! This is because you will learn to recognize, accept, and deal with other personalities in a systematic way that you otherwise wouldn't have been taught.I docked the book one star because Mrs. Littauer tends to charicature certain personalities. She will dwell so much on your weaknesses that you'll think to yourself, \\"I'm not THAT bad!\\" Then again, at least she gets her point across.Mrs. Littauer includes a short Bible quote at the end of each chapter, and dedicates a short chapter to the importance of loving Christ, who completes us as persons and who wants to use our unique talents in His Divine Providence. But it is not a book of theology or Scriptural hermeneutics; \\"Personality Plus\\" is constructed in such a way as to be accessible to believers and nonbelievers alike.Indeed, everybody should know about the four personality types. Don't delay!"},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"This book is a powerful tool in helping to both understand others, and get along with others better. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to have more than three friends. It explains how there are four basic &quot;personality temperaments&quot;, and how each temperament interacts with the others. It also discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each temperament, and Florence makes suggestions to each temperament as to what he/she can (should) do about their weaknesses, and is very insightful in that sense. It is also quite healing, as one is forced to realize that the others aren't INTENDING to be abrasive, but seem to be simply because they have a different personality than you. However, this book is also very unbalanced. Although it feigns to be a Christian book, it fails miserably to clarify that some behaviors are simply wrong, no matter what personality type they are coming from. The less mature reader is led to believe that particular behaviors are strictly aspects of people's personalities. There is literally, and absolutely NO acknowledgement of the fact that right is right, and wrong is wrong! In that sense, this book is an absolute, total failure. Parents, in particular, should be aware that the writer will tempt the reader to think that wrong behavior is simply an aspect of a personality. In effect, as I have seen, an immature Christian reader can take the things in this book too much to heart, end up failing to distinguish right from wrong, and ultimately do their children more harm than good; that is, by passing everything off as simply &quot;personality&quot; and failing to teach right from wrong. I say this to caution the reader that yes, this is a very good book, but also very dangerous if the above caution is not noted during and after reading the book. Since this book fails on such an important issue, it only gets a 6."},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"The idea of the four temperaments is one of the theories in human personality. Some people may reject the idea of being generalized for fear of losing their individual uniqueness. But the idea is to acknowledge the advantages of such generalization and at the same time to be aware of variations within the individual categories.And this book tremendously helps us to understand how we are different from others, and how we can understand the differences. Understanding is a bliss.It also provides some suggestions to appreciate our strengths, while also knowing our weaknesses and working on them.A must read for our peace of mind in general. And to save us unnecessary problems arising from personality conflicts."},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"It is not easy to accept psychological advice that appears so simple (especially as a Perfect Melancholy as I am). Yet Florence has taken concepts that in reality are probably much more complex and reduced them to a usable format. This book will make you laugh - mark my words you will believe Florence spent weeks observing you. I'm not convinced that our personality traits are innate (rather than a product of our environment) as Florence argues, but regardless of this, the advice is no less powerful. I made my girlfriend read the book, have passed it on to my brother and his wife and wish I could pass it on to all those I care for. This book is only for those people who will find themselves in relationships or have to interact with people at some time in their lives."},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"This is truly my absolute most favorite book. I can't begin to tell you how many times I've read it myself or gifted it to friends. It is written in a lighthearted and entertaining way that makes it enjoyable to read at night before going to bed. Mrs. Littauer divides the personalities into 4 groups and has a fantastic way of communicating their traits, strengths, and weaknesses. It basically delivers the same message as the Myers-Briggs but without all the complicated E, S, T, I, etc. It provides wonderful insight into your own personality traits and is wonderful at helping you see how and why other people do what they do and say what they say. For example, I am a strong 'melancholy' personality type and like to have things right and in order (even if it's my own sense of order). I literally laughed out loud when she gave an example of her husband, also a melancholy, instructing her on how to put the toilet paper on correctly. She didn't know it could be incorrect. I do the exact same thing, even in public places or other people's homes. I figure if they don't notice it's not on incorrectly, then they won't notice or care that I've corrected it. Hysterical. Also have a friend who can come across as a bit brusk or aggressive. This booked helped both of us see that her desire to get things accomplished can sometimes come across wrong. It's great it helping you tailor your message to the personality type of the recipient. You'll find yourself 'personality typing' all of your friends, etc. It helps explain a lot of the communication problems between people. This book is truly absolutely fantastic! Also, highly recommend 5 Love Languages to go along with it."},{"Title":"Personality Plus: How to Understand Others by Understanding Yourself","review":"This book really helps people understand the other people in their lives.

I'd be inclined to classify this book as a bar reference rather than a food book. Again, the ones I've made have tasted great as mixed drinks. Just don't plan to use these recipes as meal replacers!Most of the ingredients are available in urban areas. The expense per drink is more comparable, again, to mixed alcoholic drinks than the meal replacer type of smoothie.This can be an excellent reference for someone wanting to go beyond daquiris and pina coladas into more exotic bar drinks.

The Chinese parrot. Behind that curtain. The black camel. Charlie Chan carries on","review":"Some may regard the caption as blasphemous considering the enduring appeal of Sherlock and the ongoing organizations devoted to his legend such as The Baker Street Irregulars.But Charlie Chan is, in my humble opinion, every bit as important in the literary world of detectives as Holmes. As author Earl Derr Biggers once wrote \\"sinister and wicked Chinese are old stuff in mystery stories but an amiable Chinese on the side of law and order had never been used.\\" That is, until Biggers first introduced him in 1925 in the classic The House Without A Key (the first of five complete and unabridged cases presented here in this volume first published in 1985 by New Orchard Editions). The story deals with \\"the investigation of the murder of Dan Winterslip ... Chan finds Mr. W had a past which did not bear close scrutiny.\\"Confucius he may not have been, but his sayings have also withstood the test of time, such as \\"bad alibi like dead fish ... cannot stand test of time.\\" The other stories gathered together in this thick volume are The Chinese Parrot (a Chinese cook is stabbed to death, confusion arises from a bullet hole at the scene of the crime and a missing gun), Behind That Curtain (sixteen years separates two murders ... the first in London and now San Francisco ... is this an open and shut case for Chan?), The Black Camel (the \\"set\\" is a deserted part of Waikiki Beach, the victim is a film star brutally stabbed to death), and Charlie Chan Carries On (terror reigns on a round-the-world cruise, a murderer strikes again and again .. on the last lap from Honolulu to San Francisco Chan is detailed to find the killer).Most who remember the character will do so through film characterizations by Werner Oland, Sidney Toler, Roland Winters, and even Peter Ustinov (it's his picture as Chan they use on the dust cover of my copy - why they did that instead of Oland - the best Chan ever - is beyond me). But in any event, this is a book worthy of inclusion in any mystery collection."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Boston","review":"As are almost all lonely planet books, this is a great, GREAT book for covering the metro Boston area. I recommend it as THE book to use, especially if traveling to Boston. It goes into depth on all aspects of Boston culture, down to climate, money scams, and gay and lesbian tourists. Although the book doesn't explain every site on the walking tours, it does give an overall, helpful picture of the tours in general. It also tells about the hot clubs and places to go, with regular updates and good descriptions.However, if you're looking for excursions outsiode of Boston, or are, like me, a new resident of Boston, you may not want to get this book, becauise it focuses on the Boston area. In that case, get Lonely Planet:New England, or a new resident's book. And for a shorter, cheaper version of this book, get Lonely Planet Boston:Condensed.Hope it helps."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Boston","review":"This is a great place to start if you don't know anything about Boston.

The Lonely Planet Guide is by far the worse of those I have seen. The coverage of the city is spotty; large, interesting areas are left out, and when they are covered it's in a really haphazard manner.I get the impression this book was created with the thought that it would be good to fill an empty niche in the Lonely Planet product line, with the underlying thought that a bad book was better than none. Steer clear."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Boston","review":"Hands down, the Lonely Planet guides win marks for layout and style. These are compact, information-packed guides which can be tucked in any pocket or bag as an on-the-go reference. Most other guide books are great arm chair references but completely impractical for traveling on the road.The Lonely Planet Boston does not disappoint. It is glossy, full-color, packed with maps, and has a small footprint. It follows the tried-and-true Lonely Planet format: Facts for the Visitor, followed by Getting There and Getting Around practical information, followed by the sights, places to stay, places to eat, entertainment, and excursions out of the city proper. A mind-boggling amount of information is packed into this guide.The guide opens with the obligatory History section, which is read only by delayed travelers desperate for reading material. The true gems of Boston history and cultural experience are spread throughout the book, as light green sidebars on topics such as The Big Dig, The Emerald Necklace of gardens, facts about the Boston Public Library, and profiles of influential citizens such as Mary Baker Eddy.Activities and sights are organized by neighborhood, which makes planning things to accomplish in a day a bit easier. One great chapter labels Boston \\"America's Walking City\\" and lists dozens of walking routes through the region.

The maps alone are a reason to buy this book and stick it in your pack while you travel. Overall, this book is well worth the price, and if you only buy one book about Boston, it should be this one."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Boston","review":"Ideal for people who wish to travel to Boston or people who live in Boston but want to pretend they are a tourist to impress a lady or deceive an enemy."},{"Title":"Sylvie and Bruno,","review":"When you begin to read this book (together with its second part \\"Sylvie and Bruno Concluded\\"), you must always remember what Lewis Carroll states in the Preface: that the book was written putting together all sorts of bits of writing that the author had skteched and drafted here and there for a long time, trying to find a common thread. So it's an assorted bunch of funny, clever and often deep pages. Even so, you might miss one of the charms of \\"Alice's adventures in Wonderland\\": the spontaneity, the straightforwardness. This is very much the opposite situation: a book that was written slowly, painstakingly constructing the main body of the story.So you can find here almost all dimensions of Carroll's thoughts: humorous nonsense and innumerable puns (including a word as original as \\"Jabberwocky\\" or \\"Boojum\\": \\"Phlizz\\"); logical and mathematical puzzles, including a simple and clever description of a M&ouml;bius strip; tender and lovely stories for children; lots of poetry... And three elements I haven't found neither in the Alice books nor in \\"The Hunting of the Snark\\": solemn religious meditations; the only real presence of death in a Carroll text (as far as I know, not being a Carroll scholar myself) when Sylvie watches a dead hare; and an adult romance.All these aspects are intertwined in a precarious narrative line-- there are almost as many disgressions as there are chapters; but what might seem a flaw in the book can be its main charm. All in all, Carroll found here A METHOD FOR NONSENSE or, as he says, \\"a far clearer idea (...) of the meaning of the word 'chaos'\\".This is certainly not the best book to begin to read Carroll, but it's a pity it's not even half as popular as the Alice books. It's really worth reading it: it's like delving deep into the goldmine of the brain and the heart of a genius."},{"Title":"Sylvie and Bruno,","review":"At first this seems disappointing after Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. But after a while it grows on you. I don't bother to try and follow the story. I just open it at random and read bits of it. There's always an unusual and interesting idea, or some funny dialogue or else a totally off the wall dreamlike image. Also there are some great poems in it. It is admittedly a patchy book. I like Bruno- he's quite like Alice but that baby talk was popular in Victorian times and grates on you now. Lewis Carroll didn't succeed in blending these great elements into a book that's easy to read, and this is why it is less popular. But it is definitely worth getting if you want another glimpse into the mind that wrote Alice. You will find plenty of the same kind of stuff. Also I think Lewis Carroll was a really nice person as this book often cheers me up when I feel low. It is happy and positive."},{"Title":"Sylvie and Bruno,","review":"This is a book I return to now and then, just to recapture that childlike wonder that Carroll masters so well. The contrast of the adorable fairy children and their beautiful little absudities, against the strangeness of the real world of Carroll's time and culture which seems alien to a modern reader, make for a surreal story that still manages to hit its simple theme on the head: love conquers all."},{"Title":"Sylvie and Bruno,","review":"There is *nothing* disappointing about Sylvie and Bruno. It is not anything like Alice.. it surpasses Alice in every way.This book is filled with a goodness that just can't help itself... and while it can be silly at times, and crazy at others, in the end it brings me to tears, every time. It is noble and honest and the characters steal your heart...Not all of life is suffering... and this book is about that. I would really encourage you to pick it up. The first few chapters are a little crazy as you get used to this half-reality half-fantasy style... but it pulls you in so quickly, and will really blow you away.An absolutely wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Sylvie and Bruno,","review":"After reading the Alice books, I never imagined Carroll could write a literary failure. Unfortunately, as the introduction of this book so clearly states, Sylvie and Bruno is a literary failure. Why? Perhaps it's too much of an adult book. Perhaps the confusion of the first few chapters throws off too many impatient readers. These possibilites are certainly plausible. But what a shame! The work itself contains so many instances of wonderment that I can't name them all. Like a true craftsman of storytelling, Carroll masterfully walks the line between dream-like fantasy and all-too-familiar reality, swiveling between these two opposing states of being whenever the urge strikes.One would venture to guess that the narrator is afflicted with Alzheimer's disease. That is, until he actually brings back a tangible souvenir from the dreamworld in the form of a rare Indian flower bouquet, incapable of surviving a lengthy transport to merry old England. Upon participation in this scenario, the open-minded reader begins to question the composition of reality. Are dream worlds filled with magic out there eluding us? Can it be that our steps in the real world are never terribly far from landing on a little fairy? The ponderment of such superstition is indeed rare today, but perhaps it shouldn't be.Yes, extraordinarily deep questions are raised in this strange book where \\"actors\\" do somersaults during dramatizations of Shakespeare and gardeners run around \\"watering\\" plants with watering-cans as barren as the Sahara Desert. As anyone can see, Carroll didn't seem to have any problems coming up with wild stuff to write. I particularly enjoyed the rumor of the crocodile walking on its forehead.I think the one thing Carroll never gets enough credit for is his use of humor. Sylvie and Bruno is quite funny. I couldn't help laughing at Bruno's story of, \\"a Mouse and a Crocodile and a Man and a Goat and a Lion.\\" And the Baron's Embassy chapter is comedy gold. Carroll was truly an enlightened individual. I wish we had more like him today.Carroll was also quite Biblical, and that's evident in this book. While strongly promoting faith in the Bible, he heavily criticizes the practically (I think) defunct method of filling up every Sunday with forced, nonstop preaching, and the far from defunct method of promising financial wealth to people who give. He notes that England's ability to endure such tactics for a whole century while still believing in God is a credit to the goodness of the people there. Unfortunately, a century after the printing of this book, the belief isn't quite as strong as it used to be. Perhaps Carroll's criticisms had some validity.Carroll had the gift of innovation that is so terribly difficult for most people, including myself, to grasp. What extraordinary value his works have! It's a shame Sylvie and Bruno has so much value and yet so little popular appeal. I just wish Carroll could have shortened the story and wrapped it up in one volume.I give it four stars objectively, but I like it much, much better than many books I've given five stars too. Definitely one of my all-time favorites.Oh, and I am pleased to note the following: Carroll writes in the book's introduction that he's very against a technique he calls \\"padding\\" - which was later perfected by producer Robert Lippert in the horribly long film Lost Continent."},{"Title":"Sylvie and Bruno,","review":"The book IS inconsistent. Unlike the brilliant Alice books, there are places where what Carroll is trying to do just doesn't work. But this book is written on a GIGANTIC scale. Carroll tries to take the basis of Alice, and expand it into something of real profundity - something that covers an entire moral and ethical universe. And much of the time, he actually *succeeds* at such an impossible task. There are scenes that are hysterically funny, and scenes that will make you weep. The book is VERY touching, and gives a strong and unforgettable message on the totality, wonder and all-conquering nature of all-conquering love. Sylvie, the fairy-child, is Love Itself, embodied. Despite its spottiness, this book is very, very impressive, and you will want to read it more than once, just to re-experience the good stuff, which is very, very good.&quot;For I think it is Love. For I feel it is Love. For I'm sure it is nothing but Love!&quot;Indeed. And Amen."},{"Title":"Sylvie and Bruno,","review":"This book is terrific. The moves between Outland, Fairyland, and England are VERY confusing at first, but once you get the gist of the work it is a very enjoyable! The way Bruno talks is theonly very annoying part. His oos and other such shortenings (y'reince comes to mind) are very odd, but he is always followed by a correction by his sister Sylvie. All in all, this is an amazing book."},{"Title":"Sylvie and Bruno,","review":"I deleted this selection after reading the first chapter. It was not interesting enough for me to continue reading it."},{"Title":"Sylvie and Bruno,","review":"Lewis Carroll I think revealed quite a bit about his preoccupations in Sylvie and Bruno but only managed a very intermittently interesting narrative. It is puzzling why Carroll felt it necessary to have three parallel worlds, England in the 1880s, Outland and Fairyland when there is hardly anything magical described in any of these three places (leaving aside the issue of tiny fairy children). It probably would have been better to drop the England sections and have put everything into Outland and Fairyland. Carroll was obviously having anxiety in reconciling his relatively orthodox Anglican beliefs with the growing emphasis on scientific thinking. Large sections of the \\"real world England\\" passages are spent in parlor room discussions of free will and the analysis of morality. The sections in Outland and Fairyland are a bit more real in some ways, ironically enough, since they deal with political corruption and oddball but scientifically grounded thoughts. However the Machiavellian characters are disposed of in the end by the most flippant methods as a sudden \\"dust storm\\" suddenly changes their personalities right as they are about to succeed to the rulership of Outland.Also Carroll's well known attitudes toward young girls, however benign in real life, provide a poor narrative grounding for a character such as Sylvie whom the narrator erratically presents as a small fairy child, a 10 year old human child and \\"hidden\\" within the 20 year old Lady Orme of the \\"contemporary\\" English narrative. Unsurprisingly the fairy child version of Sylvie is presented in a totally positive redemptive way to which standard the other two fall short even if to a slight extent.My sense is that Carroll was unsettled by the existential issues raised in his long poem The Hunting of the Snark and was trying to soften and contain them in a more realistic narrative. Sylvie and Bruno is what happens when a brilliant writer tries to pull his punches."},{"Title":"ASSET DEDICATION","review":"This is the best personal investment book for people who are careful with their hard earned money. Asset Dedication principle addresses the needs for emergency funds, steady income and the opportunity to growth your wealth. Most importantly the investors are the one who set the benchmarks and the principle is being put into practice by a growing number of certified personal financial planners.Huxley and Burns support the strategy with extensive research. They provide evidence to show how the asset allocation formulas used by brokerage houses provide inconsistent results at best and on average lag behind portfolio build with asset dedication. They explained clearly why active management usually hurts your investment. And they provide data to show how poorly the main brokerage houses did with their asset allocations during the 1990's.Asset Dedication principle is simple and easy to understand. The book gives options for readers to achieve different financial goals. Best of all, the authors also introduce \\"Critical Path\\" concept for readers to manage their investments to make sure they are on target to reach their goals.Those who want to do more research can visit the website that support the book (they can read more about market timing study and maximum sustainable withdrawals). People can test various scenarios for their own asset dedication strategies. It even has a simply Monte Carlo element.I highly recommend this book to people who want to think for themselves and their families."},{"Title":"ASSET DEDICATION","review":"I have begun using the Asset Dedication principles with my clients. It is easy for uneducated investors to understand the concepts. It provides for them the guareenteed security (using Treasury Bonds) that their income is provided for years ahead. The Asset Dedication website guides me in selecting an efficient bond ladder portfolio for each client's needs.I look forward to using the \\"rolling\\" bond ladder in years ahead when interest rates are hopefully higher to create an even more efficient portfolio.Client used to leave an appointment \\"hoping\\" that their selection of Bonds vs. Stocks proportions was appropriate. Now they walk away saying that they have a certain number of years of income set aside and are therefore comfortable with the volatility of the growth portion of their portfolios. They are comfortable because we have \\"bought time\\" which is an essential ingredient to growth."},{"Title":"ASSET DEDICATION","review":"If you have ever wondered exactly how much or how little science is used in determining the asset allocation formulas that your broker recommends, this book should be revealing. We, the authors, began to get suspicious about the wide spread use of the strategy when different brokers recommended different allocation formulas for the same person. If you went to three different optometrists, you would not expect to get three different prescriptions for your glasses. One of the hallmarks of science is replication of results under identical circumstances.So we read the original academic papers that popularized asset allocation, reviewed its many critics, and used historical comparisons to test asset dedication against asset allocation, with its fixed-formula, rebalancing approach. Asset dedication is an investment strategy that has been used for years by high-end financial professionals who must manage cash flow demands, the same problem retired people face.Lo and behold, the asset dedication strategy beat all asset allocation strategies with less than 80 percent stocks in the majority of decades over a variety of time periods from 2003 back to 1990, 1976, 1947, and 1926 using only US Treasury bonds and index funds. Asset dedication is also a low cost, passive strategy that has no \\"magic formulas.\\" No wonder the pros who have to deal with cash flows prefer it. Asset dedication is to asset allocation what passive index funds are to active mutual funds - cheaper, easier, and better. Its superior performance based on our statistical research compelled us to report the results. That is why we wrote this book.The book describes in detail how asset dedication is designed to deal directly with the investment situation that retired people or those nearing retirement face. It will produce identical recommendations for identical circumstances and creates a designer portfolio customized to each investor's specific individual needs rather than using a one-size-fits-all \\"model portfolio\\" approach.The book also introduces the \\"critical path\\" concept for retirement planning by younger people and is supported by an online web site (www.assetdedication.com). Professional financial planners are now beginning to look to asset dedication as either the next generation of asset allocation or a whole new paradigm in personal investment strategy. It works. The evidence is in the book. See for yourself."},{"Title":"ASSET DEDICATION","review":"Asset Dedication by Dr. Stephen J. Huxley is a must read for anyone contemplating retirement and for those who must manage money during retirement years. This book is written in a style that is easy to understand and grasp, and does not assume that the reader be a major in economics. The book is written in a clear lucid style and provides a very helpful education.What is novel about the book is that it shows for the first time, that it is possible to invest retirement savings in a manner that they meet the unique needs of each retirement situation. In other words, the books does not blindly advocate an asset mix as those found commonly on almost all mutual fund sites.The books advocates setting aside the appropriate mix of investments in high quality Bonds, while at the same time providing exposure to Index Stock Funds. But, there is no set magic ratio like 20/80 or 40/60 for Bonds/Stocks. Instead the book advocates and shows how you can set aside just enough money for income generation while at the same time gaining exposure to the stock market in increments of 3-10 years. The basic idea is to generate income for living expenses while at the same time gaining exposure to the stock market for adequate length of time. The book does not rely on just opinions. There is plenty of hard data and analysis to back up its premises.The calculations provided in the book can also be carried out on the Internet Site for those who would like to play out different scenarios of accumulated savings and interest rates.This book is a must read for anyone seriously contemplating retirement or anyone who is actively managing ones accumulated savings during retirement years. It provides a different working plan and perspective and one that should be reviewed.This book is a must read !"},{"Title":"ASSET DEDICATION","review":"I highly recommend this book! This is one of the top three most thought provoking personal investment books along with Malkiel's Random Walk Down Wall Street and Berstein's Intelligent Asset Allocator. Having spent more time than I care to admit reading too many investment books that neither deliver on their titles' expectations nor present any real new thinking, I believe this book is a breath of fresh air in the investing world.Authors Huxley and Burns cast aside the ambiguity inherent in Asset Allocation Theory and replace it with a practical set of concepts on personal investing. Asset Dedication offers a guide on how to explicitly dedicate asset classes (cash, bonds and stocks) for particular purposes based on each investor's goals. By following the concepts presented, the personal investor can build a solid financial bridge into retirement without giving away their hard-earned savings through too-frequent trading or relying on the sometimes-shady world of annuities.The ideas are straightforward and simple, and the material provides a breakthrough concept for the mainstream investment community. Huxley and Burns are offering us a glimpse into the near-future of personal investing. You will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"ASSET DEDICATION","review":"Asset Dedication strikes a new note in personal financial planning. It makes sense that many brokers try to keep financial planning murky so that uninformed investors will buy their sales pitch and brokers continue to profit from the commissions. No doubt it will raise the hackles of many brokers who rely on investor ignorance to earn their living, and those with a vested interest in the status quo will no doubt take every opportunity to discredit the book. To the public, I urge you to read this book and learn it for yourself before solely relying on \\"professional's\\" advice.Based on the principle of dedicated portfolios, which institutions have used for years, asset dedication provides a rationale for a specific allocation of funds to stocks, bonds and cash based on their time horizon. Enough bonds are purchased to provide a secure income stream over the horizon. For anyone who bothers to read past the first 30 pages, they will find that although a fixed horizon of, say, ten years, is one option, investors would likely be more comfortable with \\"rolling\\" horizons. In a rolling horizon plan, they buy a new bond at the end of each year (or so) to extend the stream of secured income another year (or so) and keep the horizon at a constant ten years. Even more compelling is the fact that when compared to the stale asset allocation formulas, the dedication strategy ends up beating portfolios with 70 percent or less in stocks most of the majority of time (back to 1926).The chapters on the \\"critical path\\" are extremely informative. They explain how a person can monitor their portfolio to make sure it is on track to meet their goals without getting worried about market volatility. The fresh ideas and empirical evidence based on research in this book set it apart from the hundreds of tired asset allocation books that add little to what is already known. This book breaks new ground and may be only the first in a long line of new studies on asset dedication. It deserves its five star rating."},{"Title":"ASSET DEDICATION","review":"Similar to \\"Buckets of Money\\" this books shows that \\"Asset Allocation\\" will not assure your life savings to the end of your life.

Also has links to web site that helps you develop your portfolio."},{"Title":"ASSET DEDICATION","review":"This book contains one of the most original and common sense investing ideas that I've read. The concept is to entirely eliminate bond market risk from your portfolio while protecting your retirement cash flows. Although the assumptions about the stock market risk should be revisited after the last year, the ideas are still equally valid.I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to retire in the next five years. Just keep in mind that this is not meant to be a comprehensive retirement planning book; only a look at how fixed income assets should be used in a retirement portfolio."},{"Title":"ASSET DEDICATION","review":"I was looking through the book section for books on asset allocation and stumbled across this book. This book is a new way to look at asset \\"dedication\\" (can't say allocation, that is taboo in this book) The jist of this book is to define a lump sum goal dollar amount for retirement. You'll use this lump sum in addition to what you think you'll receive annually from Social Security and pension and whatever else. You'll then use this total amount of money to determine an annual amount that you can withdraw and live comfortably with until the grim reaper shows up.For example, you are 45, you have $100,000 saved in your 401K, you retire when you are 65. You determine that when you retire at 65 you'll need $40,000 per year after you receive $20,000 year from Social Security and $12,000 from your pension to live comfortably. You project that you will live until 90 years old. So, to acheive a $40,000 income stream from age 65 until 90, you will need $800,000 in your 401K when you hit 65 (This isn't the actual number, just a very rough estimate). When you hit 65, you'll use whatever portion of the $800,000 you saved to create a T-Bill ladder to ensure that you'll guarantee that $40,000/yr income stream for a predetermined horizon (say 10 years) and then place the remainder of your retirement money in stocks (for a hopefully better return). While you are receiving your bond income plus the principal from the annually maturing T-Bills, your stocks should be making an average of 10 - 12% over the same period. In a rolling horizon scenario, you annually roll the 10 year T-bills while slowly eroding your stock principal as necessary to maintain your desired, predetermined annual income of $40,000. If you did all the numbers right on the initial plan and you croak \\"on time as predicted (90yo in the example)\\" you should end up with zero $$$ or whatever amount you decided to leave for your heirs.I gazed thru the book initially and thought it looked a little dry but the harder I looked at it, I found it was packed with great ideas and approaches to retirement I hadn't thought of such as \\"Once you reach your target retirement amount, don't let greed get the best of you, sell your stocks and take your target retirement amount that you luckily reached and start rolling it in T-Bill ladders\\" For example, if you hit $800,000 goal before age 65, say age 60, keep building your 401K account but lock in your \\"winnings\\" by T-Billing all $800,000 for safety from a market collapse at an inopportune time. Sounds simple but it is effective. There are a bunch of other interesting ideas that I found useful too.This book isn't the holy grail but does have a lot of valuable info.My apologies to the author if I didn't get the mechanics of the system exactly right...."},{"Title":"ASSET DEDICATION","review":"This book is well written and really changes the way you think about asset allocation. The book shows in many ways how the traditional asset allocation model of x % bond funds, y % stock funds may not be the best way to allocate assets. Instead, using some basic math investors should consider a laddered portfolio of bonds so that the stock portion of the investor's portfolio has time to grow. This strategy overcomes the inevitable ups and downs of the stock market by increasing the holding period for the stocks."},{"Title":"ASSET DEDICATION","review":"This book promises nirvana and doesn't quite deliver. It sounds fantastic. Lock in a rock-solid income for ten years, yet still beat a 70/30 portfolio (70% stocks, 30% bonds) time after time. Security and great returns. No wonder a reference to Einstein, new ideas, and 'faced similar resistance' pops up early (the second sentence in fact). It sounds too good to be true, and it is.The method works like this. Decide the return and how many years security you want (say 5% for ten years). Build yourself a bond ladder to deliver this safely (the author is not a fan of buying annuities). Then you can relax and invest what's left over in the S&P500.; It turns out the bonds and cash take around 50% of your portfolio. So straight away there is a 50/50 split. And it gets worse (or better, in rising markets). As the bond ladder unwinds (all the bonds are sold off over the ten years), the equity allocation climbs and climbs, zooming through 90%, 95%, and presumably (the author's a bit coy about this bit) hitting 100% on the witching hour - midnight on 31st December every ten years. And then the whole process repeats again. So on average, over the ten years, nervous pensioners Mr and Mrs Smith actually do have around 75% of their portfolio in stocks. No wonder they are doing well in up markets. And coming back to the stockmarket just once every 10 years to reload their bond ladder does smooth the returns - but now and again things go wrong. In one example the Smiths remaining stocks are worth, in 2000, $1.8million after the ten years are up, but their neighbours who invested a year later, would discover in 2001 that their stocks were worth 33% less. And by 2002 their neighbour's portfolio would have dropped another 35%. These tenth anniversaries are when they are meant to go back and sell half their stocks portfolio to fund the next ten-year annuity. Its when investors are most vulnerable. Get your start year wrong and you will regret it for the rest of your retirement. Dr Huxley's strategy is much more sensitive to market timing, and volatile (anyone got the 1998-2002 figures?), than is immediately apparent.The good news is that most of his clients will have done well - many will have avoided the toxic sting of the S&P; occasionally misbehaving badly because they revisit it so rarely. And they will have slept soundly because they have a \`guarantee'. In essence the Huxley revolution is this \` Invest in a do-it-yourself 10year annuity. Invest ALL the rest in stocks. Repeat every 10 years. Keep fingers crossed'. Einstein it ain't."},{"Title":"Beckett's Dying Words: The Clarendon Lectures 1990 (Clarendon Lectures in English)","review":"Ricks brings an impressively thorough, and necessarily playful, acumen to his very close reading of Beckett. For a critic who has devoted scrutiny to Dylan as well as the canonical heavy-hitting English canon of bards, Ricks comes equipped with his OED and a vastly patient ability to dig into what on the surface, given Beckett's elusive and often skeletal expressions, can be deceptively straightforward utterances.Markedly even among Beckett's legion of exegetes, Ricks takes time to compare the French with the English renderings. and unearths from both versions witty and insightful analyses. His energy rarely flags. He may think a bit too much of his cleverness, I suspect, but this is forgivable when we can learn so much from his recondite schtick. As these apparently originated as 1990 Clarendon lectures at Oxford, Ricks keeps aware of an audience--on the page or in person--who is following, and presumably chuckling at, his remarks. You get the sense of Ricks, as with Beckett, performing his recitals rather than transcribing them for actors or academics.The whole point of death and extinction in Beckett remains an often too little observed topic, and that Ricks stays pretty much on target the whole way through proves an impressive feat. The book takes in, by the way, topics germane to anyone with a general knowledge of Beckett, and is not as limited a concern as the title may suggest. Ricks' infectious interest in puns, allusions, and innuendo makes this a bonus for readers similarly afflicted. Ricks remembers that, as so much in life as well as literature, Beckett is deadly serious as he is uproariously sly.Doomed to lack as encyclopedic a knowledge of the Beckett canon (and who among you reading this could ever attain such a familiarity as Ricks?), still, I enjoyed this work much more than most criticism I've had to peruse, whoever the scholar or subject.

We have had an excellent relationship ever since, and yes, women were intended to have orgasm(s) during intercourse, although some physiologically may need something different. That, I assure you, is not our problem now, and it is directly due to this book. Thank you to the Wheats!"},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"The beginning of the book is fairly dry as it discusses anatomy, but once you get passed that there are exciting tips. My husband learned that I may not have an orgasm every time and it's OK. He also learned that intercourse is not the most pleasurable part for me. I learned ways to help my husband last longer and, in general, how to be more sexually pleasing to him. Great information for brides on pg. 161. If you're engaged, wait until the week before your wedding or you may be too tempted to wait."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"I bought this book and \\"Intimate Issues\\" at the reccomendation of a female friend who said that she wished someone had told her about them before she got married.When I recieved the books I immediately dove into this one, it's an easy read, seperated into chapters so that you can read what intrests you. Technique, STD's, dysfunction, God's purpose for sex, etc. etc. it's not like the stereotypical Christian sex book... Ed Wheat gives the reader a good idea of how exciting and fulfilling sex can be in marriage. There's also a chapter on the honeymoon night and having sex for the fisrt time.This book is esspecially helpful for men who might feel they can't sexually satisfy their wife, there is an extensive section on a \\"cure\\" method for pre-ejaculation and also a section on teaching him the intricacies of a woman's body and how to last longer so that he can please her. Ed feels very strongly that it is a man's job to please his wife... I was happy when my finace borrowed this book from me and claimed he had read the whole thing!"},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"... here's my review:Intended for Pleasure gives a lot of good, basic, explicit advice on both a marital sexual relationship, and the technique of lovemaking itself. It avoids couching the facts in poetic language which is one of its strengths. It also does a good job of addressing myths and wrongheaded attitudes which need to be dispelled. I know that it motivated me to do some self examination of my character. I realized that I had a lot of unhelpful pride that I needed to let go before my wedding night.The main weakness of the book is that the author sometimes fails to fully explain some of the actions he refers to. It's kind of like a Julia Child cookbook where she refers to a complex procedure without ever explaining what it is. In a book like this it's a good idea to be completely descriptive at all times. Once something has been explained, then you can refer to it by a general reference.The illustrations are only marginally helpful. I'm not advocating the inclusion of Hustler type photographs, but something more detailed than line drawings would be more educational.The author also sometimes gets badly sidetracked. For example, he includes the procedure for doing a pap smear in the basic anatomy section. What on Earth would a reader of this book want with that information? I suspect he let his fascination with medicine interefere with his purpose in writing this book.All of that being said, however, this is overall a very good book on the subject. I would recommend it to any Christian couple who is going to be married within a month or so."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"This is the best book I have ever read in regards to marital love and sex. Ed and Gay Wheat have taken and educated, &quot;no-hype&quot;, direct approach to married sexual fulfilment. This is not a book for those seeking anything other then satisfied, commited sexual fulfillment. I encourage every couple to purchase this book before marriage and this would certainly be a great shower gift before the wedding. Parent's this is a wonderful book to help explain all the things you were uncomfortable telling your children all along."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"I purchased this book before my honeymoon in hopes of ithelping my wife and I get the maximun enjoyment out of sex in ourmarrige. The first few chapters are rather dry and cold speaking mostly of anatomy and the like. After that there are some excellent tips to making sex very enjoyable and not discouraging, especially if its your first time. These chapters helped me tremendously in finding out what God intended for sex and pleasing my wife. All the tips he gives in these chapters are very long and tedious. If you think you have these problems prepare yourself for some fun but hard work. Lots of practice sessions with total vulnerability with your partner. And probably with some disappointments. It can be tedious reading but stick with it, it is helpful. Some of the commentary is very clinical and dry, but helpful when you apply it. I really saw the heart of the writers, which is to help and instruct people to have the most fulfilling sex life as possible.

Especially if you have never made love, and you are getting married, it respectfully gives you an overview and important tips to make your first ime with your spouse memorable.

We have however found several severe errors in his teachings.Dr. Wheat takes a very mechanical approach to sexual pleasure in marriage especially for the woman. Even as another man I can see it is too obvious that his very logical and systematic approach to sex is flawed. It is not as simple as if you do step 1, 2, and 3 then orgasm will occur. The female body AND mind are much more complex than this! He also goes into such detail in areas which do not apply (PAP smear?) to the general reader, and fails to mention that there are some very common physical problems many women experience which prevents sexual intercourse on the wedding night - often requiring minor surgery.We found Dr. Wheat's book VERY useful, however it did fall short of giving couples a complete and realistic picture of sex in the Christian marriage. It is definitely worth the money and a book to review many times over the years; however, it should be read with a very open mind and not taken as being the only way for things to be."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"A must read for all married couples, whether you are just newly weds or have been married for 30-40 or 50 years.

I bought this book shortly before my wedding, and it has been a very helpful resource for before AND after! :)"},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"Well balanced views and completeness set this book apart as one of the best in the topic's field. I recommend newly married couples should take it on their honeymoon. A few chapters are useful reading, as preparation, a few weeks before a wedding. They should read a chapter each day of their honeymoon, because the information provided quickly broadens horizons in the realm of intimacy, and it feeds the mind with good discussion topics.My background is very conservative. In my opinion, sexuality must be discussed, but we should do so at appropriate times and with discretion. This book could help young parents who wish to wisely educate their little ones before they get exposed to unwholesome ways to ponder sex. It is also an excellent aid for the pre-marital counselor and the counselor who hopes to help married couples overcome marital struggles.Generally, this type of book is not read aloud to unmarried young people. It is a great reference book for the young married ones and the old-timers. By it, you may gain the ability to answer many difficult questions on the topic of sexuality."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"Intended for Pleasure is a must read for Christian couples preparing for marriage.

He cautioned it should only be read by someone ready to wed."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"I recently bought this book for my fiance and I to read before we get married. It has been very helpful in explaining the sexual relation for the Christian. The book covers sex in a very clear and understandable way without being lewd or crass. Some forms of sexual expression between a husband and wife are not addressed very much. Over all it is a very good book."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"The book isn't an encyclopedia and nowhere claims to be. It's a book written by a Christian doctor that deals with a majority of his common physiological and emotional problems experienced by couples who seek his help. This book helps a wife or husband understand why some things \\"don't work\\" and how the other partner \\"works best\\", both physically and emotionally. It gives a ton of information that most \\"christian counselors\\" would have little to no access to (medical and physiological issues) and has better theology than a majority of the \\"Christian\\" relationship books. It contains dozens of illustrations of how specific problems (like premature ejaculation or female pelvic congestion) lead to couples having dry, or even unbearable sexual experiences for years, and how those situations were turned around by some simple medical information and re-orientation of thinking (usually away from sinful selfishness in the bedroom).As I've read the book in comparison to other \\"Christian\\" books that offer solutions based upon a biblical understanding of marriage and love, it's far and away the best on the issues related to physical intercourse. It talks about marriage and intimacy from a biblical perspective and deals with issues that other books cannot touch.If you're a husband or wife, you NEED to study your spouse and learn about them and yourself. It's your duty that will become your delight, and I recommend this book with little reservation as a guide to understanding the physiological aspects of yourself and your spouse, sexually speaking. I also strongly recommend \\"Sweethearts for a Lifetime\\" and \\"Strengthening your Marriage\\" by Wayne Mack, \\"The Excellent Wife\\" by Martha Peace, \\"The Exemplary Husband\\" by Stuart Scott, \\"Christian Living in the Home\\" and \\"Solving Marriage Problems\\" and \\"The Case of the Hopeless Marriage\\" by Jay Adams, \\"How to Act Right When Your Spouse Acts Wrong\\" by Leslie Vernick, and \\"Each for the Other: Marriage as It's Meant to Be\\" by Bryan Chapell.Enough marriage end in flames because people are clueless about the whole operation. Don't be.The Lord won't excuse a mediocre, sinful marriage because you plead ignorance. Order this and a few other books and invest your mind in the person to whom you pledged your heart before the God who will call you to account for both."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"\\"Intended for Pleasure\\" is a pretty good resource for engaged Christian couples, but it is a little technical/mechanical and dry.

Ed Wheat explains things clearly and thoughtfully for both partners (your wife or husband). I am inspired how there is a section of how to have intimacy during pregnancy. Great book if your a married person or Christian who is confused what Christian intimacy is.I came from a family that sex was abusive and secular. Sex is from God....1 Corinthians 7New International Version (NIV)Concerning Married Life7 Now for the matters you wrote about: &#8220;It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.&#8221; 2 But since sexual immorality is occurring, each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each woman with her own husband. 3 The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. 4 The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife. 5 Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. 6 I say this as a concession, not as a command. 7 I wish that all of you were as I am.

I had never met someone with whom the holy spirit had penetrated so deeply. Three and a half weeks later, we were engaged and incredibly nervous at the thought of physical intimacy. I had grown accustom to celibacy in my thirty seven years of life, but my wife, at 17 was constantly tempted by the flesh. Immediately after her father approved the engagement, she was ready to become physical. I, being the man, knew I had to take a commanding role in dictating how and when we would become physical. I had a difficult time at first, as she was quite eager to begin love making, but I had to resist the urges so strongly coursing through both of our loins. Finally, after a grueling six week engagement, we were wed and we could begin consummating the marriage. Unfortunately, I could tell that I hadn't satisfied her in the least. I tried harder and certain other positions and tricks (after first consulting my preacher of course) and nothing worked. Finally after eleven years of marriage, my ailing father gave us this book that he and mother had been using. Wow! I finally knew what it was to pleasure my wife in a way that was biblically sanctioned. She finally knew the ecstasy of the good lord's blessing in her womanhood. Now when we try for our ninth child, she might actually enjoy it.

It addresses issues head-on in a no non-sense manner."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"The updates are admirable. When are the Christian Marriage/Sex experts going to stop making the main focus of sex about intercourse? Christian wives wait for the first time to make love and almost all are disappointed. The facts are that while women enjoy the closeness and bond of intercourse with their husbands, they do not have orgasms that way! The Wheats, as well as other authors, must address this to save marriages. Orgasm is a God-given pleasure to men and women."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"this book is good for couples married for 20 years or just starting the journy."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"This book is boring and is filled with inapplicable situations for us and just didn't have hardly anything we found to be helpful in preparing us for marriage. I hope that Christians start to really talk about sex honestly and openly to help each other, b/c there are a lot of couples struggling and hurting w/ nowhere to turn except books like this one that just aren't that practical or helpful. In that spirit, I am going to share our story and hopefully it might help someone else out there. My husband and I are Christians...unfortunately we had sex w/ each other in college before we got married, but we repented and stopped and so we were excited about our honeymoon night to say the least. We had this book with us but didn't think we'd need it since we already knew \\"it worked.\\" Well, our wedding night was a disaster in the sex department. It didn't even work! We both panicked. The rest of the honeymoon wasn't great either and I was frantically reading this book for help and we didn't find much b/c sex hurt me very bad and we had no idea why. After months of worrying and our situation only getting worse, I went to a gyno to see if something was wrong. She said that birth control can cause \\"dryness,\\" and sex just doesn't work if you have that problem and it can be so dry that any lubricant isn't going to help...and that was my situation. So I got off birth control, we were prego 2 months later and we started to have wonderful sex. So 6 years and four precious children later, here we are, I will never touch birth control hormones again b/c I believe they are unnatural and horrible for a woman's body and know many wives who feel the exact same way about it. I also know Christian people who have gotten divorces a year or less after getting married b/c sex on birth control simply didn't work, but kids weren't an option. We had no idea. So I don't know what book would have helped us back then, but now we are reading \\"When Two Become One\\" by McCluskey and LOVE it and are about to read \\"A Celebration of Sex\\" by Rosenau...we just need a refresher course and reminder on the purpose of God's creation of sex and some how-to helpfulness b/c we've never had a \\"regular\\" sex life with my being pregnant so much...and we've never had anyone to talk to about our \\"issues.\\" I never would have dreamed that this would be the path our lives would take but I couldn't be more thankful as it's taken the focus off me...at first that was miserable, but now it is so much more rich and fulfilling a life as it's not all about me anymore...which may have been God's purpose all along ;)"},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"I know this is a \\"Christian\\" book but what it has to say about masturbation and homosexuality is inconsistent with healthy human natural desire. If you want a book that conforms to a very narrow view then this one is perfect. If you are looking for equality between the sexes or up to date information about human sexuality then you won't find it in this book. Also the authors stole a lot from Masters and Johnson and do not give them credit. I thought stealing was a sin."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"A dear friend recommended this book to us. Upon receipt I immediately turned to the section on pregnancy and birth control as I am an avid supporter of the protection of the unborn babies in our world. I was HORRIBLY dissapointed at the presentaiton of the material in this section. This is supposed to be a 'Christian' book yet they used terms like 'fertilized egg' instead of baby to explain the way that birth control pills can prevent the implantation of a baby into the womans womb. They even say that if that occured it wouldn't be an abortion of a baby. Any basic sex ed class teaches that fertilization occurs BEFORE the egg reaches the womb; actually occuring in the fallopian tubes. Needless to say I CANNOT recommend this book for any person seeking Biblical teaching on planning a family. \\"Children are a reward from the Lord\\" and \\"Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them\\" Psalms"},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"This book was for my daughter, 26, and her fiancee, 28, who are going to be married this Sept.

It is concise, well-written, easy to read, and I highly recommend it to young (and old) couples. My daughter is pretty innocent and this book makes it clear but not unappealing. Has parts on birth control as well. If you want a book that both presents sex well and from the Christian perspective (within marriage), this is the book for you. I also liked it that it did not have pictures, which I think make a book a little less appealing and prurient."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"In a world where the majority of couples are divorced after only 5 years of marriage, maybe it's time to go against the grain of the male-female territory war and try sex the way it was intended. This book gives you every reason to explore your sexuality with the one person you care about most. Those of you who can't open your minds to new ways of thought about understanding your mate; beware, this book encourages you to explore what MAKING love is all about."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"As an engaged man, I found this book to be lacking in many ways, particularly when compared to LaHaye's \\"The Act of Marriage\\" which is, frankly, the gold standard on the topic. I felt Wheat's book lacked the practical details and substantial insights when compared to LaHaye. Rather than focusing on the act of sex, Wheat devoted a lot of time to the psycho-social issues surrounding the lack of sexual satisfaction within Christendom vs. the practical things that can be done to increase such satisfaction. This book is also, at times, clearly focused on non-Christians or those unsure about their personal faith in Christ. If you're unsure about what God says about sex, marriage, and companionship, this might not be a bad book to read in conjuction with \\"The Sacred Marriage\\" -- the other gold standard on marraige. However, if you're secure in your faith in Christ, this book will come off a somewhat rudimentary and a little preachy.Bottom line: as an enagaged man looking for practical insights secure in his faith/identity in Christ, this book was of little help to me -- hence my lackluster review."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"I find myself applauding the Wheats' heartfelt attempt at creating a book that breaches the subject of sex and sexuality within the conservative, mainline, Christian world. However, their work falls too far short of being informative, balanced, contemporary, and open to deserve any real recognition.First, their understanding of sexuality is about 25 years past date. They need to update their research. They have nothing in the book about oral sex, mutual masturbation, sex/orgasmic response differences among women, and premature ejaculation.Second, they objectify women to the point of sheer domination. The chapter entitled, \\"The Perfect Wife\\" elaborates on why women ought to just \\"lay back and enjoy it.\\" Frankly, I found it sick and disgusting. The authors claim to be a coequal team, but I don't see it in the writing, I don't see it in the information, and I definitely don't see it in their description of sex as a mutually beneficial act. Their response, as a said above, is basically one that encourages men to dominate their wife by demanding sex whenever they please. For example, at one point in the \\"Perfect Wife\\" chapter they say:\\"If you think your husband seems to require a lot more sex than you do, ponder this illustration: If you were in the desert and you were thirsty, you'd think about a glass of water, wouldn't you? But if you're standing by the refrigerator, and there's an opportunity to push the button and get it any time you want to, the need for a drink is not nearly so urgent. Maybe the reason your husband seems never to think of anything besides sex is that he's \\"in the desert\\" and \\"thirsty\\"\\"Sometimes you will be very tired and feeling as sexy as an old sock, but your husband will approach you with desire. Secular therapists say a wife should be able to respond, \\"Sorry, but I'm just not up to it tonight.\\" My own opinion as a Christian wife is that we can depend on the Lord to give us the strength and ability to be as warm and responsive as our husband desires, no matter how tired we are......\\"Most important, a wise wife will not argue. She will keep her husband peaceful and satisfied and happy by gracefully conceding to his wishes, or deferring to his opinions...A husband usually welcomes the thoughtful opinions of his wife...\\"(157-159, Third Ed.)This excerpt pretty much sums up why I HATE this book. It was a gift from a friend before my wife and I got married, and I'm surprised that I haven't burned it in effigy. Women are NOT objects who deserve their own voice, and this book promotes a Christianity that oppresses that voice. So, my conscious would not be clear if I did not give a resoundingly negative review for this book on that merit alone.If you want my advice, go read \\"The Joy of Sex.\\" It has all the medical and psychological facts, and presents an understanding of sexuality that is mutual, equal, and loving."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"This was so bad, i felt compelled to write my first review to encourage people to wave off from buying this book.As a male that is very sexually experienced, but relatively new in my walk with Christ, I read this book at the request of my significant other. I admit that I found the first three chapters on the role of sex in a Christian marriage compelling. After that, the information quickly went into basic anatomy, and a few tired sex clich&eacute;s a lot of pitches for companion books that he and his wife have penned on other relationship subjects, and soon after totally bottomed out. Once it hit bottom, Dr. Wheat starts to dig. I forced myself to speed read thru the remaining and finally had to put the book down in absolute disappointment when I came to the one brief entry on oral sex that basically boiled the act as a 'crutch' for men lacking the self-discipline to use intercourse to bring their mate to orgasm (chapter 15, pg 242). Or that a woman unhappy with the after sex mess 'use a tampon to control the issue' (chapter 15, pg 240).The ONLY reason I gave this book two stars was for the first three chapters. Beyond that, this book has few redeeming qualities. Look at some of the other recommendations in this review thread for some better alternatives."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"Good book, especially for the Newlywed couple who has waited for marriage.Good, frank, practical advice and helpful information in general for both parties.My wife and I felt that Gaye's chapter on \\"the perfect wife\\" seemed a bit out of place, and disagreed with her sort of \\"do whatever you can to please your man\\" kind of attitude. We take it a little more mutually than her chapter seemed to imply. And it didn't seem in line with Ed's views on everything, so it was a tad confusing.As a whole, though.

There is much help in this book for all kinds of things. And better yet from someone with a Christian perspective."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"I commend this book, because unlike many other sex manuals, the authors bring God into the equation. However, there appeared to be a lack of awareness that women are just as sexual as men are. The idea that women should participate in sex just because her husband is in the mood even if she isn't, is an idea that should have died a long time ago. While I agreed that sex toys create responses artificially, I did not agree with the author's view that they should be banned from the bedroom. They talked against oral sex, which is another way for a woman to reach orgasm other than the manual stimulation the authors kept going on about. In fact, it didn't seem much encouragement was given to couples' experimenting with what works for them. The techniques presented in the book are only a few of what is available to married couples. I would recommend this book with hesitation to couples who are virgins, and steer them towards other manuals for further details. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this to any couple who already has the experience."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"I was given this book by my therapist to read.

It was a wedding gift from a friend that meant well. I read all of it, and found only the most basic info of it helpful in any meaningful way. My husband read the first few chapters, and was so turned OFF by what it said that he stopped there, and I can't blame him. Clinical, humorless, and not at all relatable, not to mention all the issues, techniques, etc that was not even addressed by the authors. I gave my copy away.I've since read many, many other books, and can highly recommend \\"Sheet Music\\" (for both genders) by Kevin Leman, \\"The Sexually Confident Wife\\" by Shannon Ethridge for women, and \\"Sex, Romance, and the Glory Of God\\" for men by C.J.

Good information for people of various sex knowledge levels. However, the book was comical at points and seemed a bit old fashioned/impractical. For example, a wife should have dinner on the table and look her best when her husband comes home from work. It also said that couples should not own a TV for the first year of their marriage. Already broke that rule."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"The many reviews I read before purchasing this book are correct: This is a very clinical and sometimes dry book. It's also a fantastic resource.

Ed Wheat is a doctor and that comes out in his technical explanations, which are especially helpful if you are having some problems in your sex life.I would have given it 5-stars (it really is a great book) except I purchased another book as well, Getting your Sex Life Off to a Great start, and I found the other book a bit better in its explanation of the first sexual experience as well as its advice for the honeymoon.If you are preparing for your first experience I recommend buying both books. Each book offers something that the other lacks. If you can only purchase one, I recommend the other, but both are really great resources. We are also reading through Love Life for Every Married Couple and it is important to work on all aspects of your relationship - not just the sexual aspect."},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","review":"Sex is a very important part of marriage and it is very important for both people to be comfortable and to enjoy it.

Then came Grandpa Does Grandma and a couple of other similar books.I was astounded (and inspired!) to see other seniors who wanted great sex lives, too.The common thread in each extraordinary story in this book was sexy seniors who each first made a commitment to become fit. That got my attention, which brought me back to Amazon.com to look for a great exercise program, then I began seeing that a leaner, fitter body opened up an entirely new realization that better strength and flexibility allows you to a greater variety of sexual skills, which brought me to She Comes First.Ed and Gaye Wheat have done a magnificent job in providing one of the best and most concise book I've seen on the subject of sex technique and sexual fulfillment.

This book would be great for anyone with or without past sexual experiences. It has everything in it from the anatomy of men/women, how to get past problems such as premature ejaculation/the inability of a woman to enjoy orgasm, the most enjoyable sexual positions, strategies on getting pregnant, intimacy after children, and enjoying intimacy with one another well into your old age.

It helped me understand some things about men that I had never known. It is a great tool to use for the teenage sex talk and why it is important to wait for marriage both physically and psychologically. In addition, the book discusses ways to make sure that both partners within the marriage enjoy fulfilling sex in the delicate manner so as not to be offensive. It encourages Christians that the act of making love to your spouse is one that God came up with and that it is meant to be a thrilling experience to both husband and wife.

I found the book fascinating: each chapter focuses on one aspect of the theory (e.g., its applicability in the work place, or other candidates for &quot;intelligences&quot; besides the original 7). They're well written and easy to understand, and, although the depth of the discussion varies, I learned something from every chapter. I don't agree with the critics who argue that Gardner is coasting on his reputation: like Ornstein's right brain/left brain theory, the concept of multiple intelligences has taken on a life of its own, so I felt that Gardner's comments on what his theory is (and isn't), and how he views it today, were appropriate. I was especially struck by his discussion of &quot;leader&quot; intelligence: he describes a leader as primarily a good storyteller and communicator, and I found this an extremely enlightening comment on American politics. This is a good general introduction to Gardner's theories, as well as to his current thinking, and I found it stimulating and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences for the 21st Century","review":"Full of interesting but trivial anecdotes, this work finds Gardner obviously in love with himself, and preaching to the converted among followers of his educational theories, which are based on a delineation of mental modes which is idiosyncratic and not in step with recent research. His Frames of Mind some years back was much more significant, and humbler."},{"Title":"Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences for the 21st Century","review":"Howard Gardner offers thought provoking questions in relation to intelligence and how test that measures this factor may not be adequate.The reason for this is that as humans evolve, the system becomes more complex and other aspects of survival are needed.In society throughout the ages, intelligence has always been something that is looked on favorably. However with the knowledge economy in the 21st century, there is a shift now to focus a lot on spatial, verbal and mathematical abilities.This being the case, Colleges have sought after the SAT etc. to gauge a potential student's success in University.That being said, the best predictor of success in College has long been thought by professionals to be the intelligence quotient. It is my opinion that analysis is one factor that would test the hardiness of potential students.This book is refreshing and interesting for it offers insight into the human mind and its operations.I recommend it to anyone interested in the human brain and intelligence."},{"Title":"Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences for the 21st Century","review":"Even though Gardner brings up many good points about multiple intelligences and how they affect everyone, there were some chapters that it seemed that he just keep repeating the same concept over and over again. I truly felt that Gardner made many good points and that he is quite &quot;intelligent.&quot; I agreed and disagreed about some of the intelligences, but in the end, he was able to convince me that maybe there are some things that we don't understand, but still can make sense. Even though I had to read it for a class, it was quite good and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read up more about psychology or the MI theory that Gardner describes through out the book."},{"Title":"Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences for the 21st Century","review":"Before discovering the writings of Howard Gardner I had been exposed to individuals espousing his theories. The concept always struck me as interesting and something I wanted to read more about as I believe the concept of g to be valid but ultimately limiting. These exciting ideas concerning Multiple Intelligences seemed to expand the definition of intelligence outward to include talents and abilities. Now, however, after reading &quot;Intelligence Reframed&quot; I have been cured of my enthusiasm for this theory. Disecting the term &quot;intelligence&quot; until it becomes useless is the order of the day in the MI Theory. Eschewing the psychometric field, Gardner theorizes endlessly while stating that MI is &quot;based wholly on empirical evidence&quot; (pg 85). That evidence seems peripheral at best, completely unrelated at worst. There are definately some interesting thoughts and ideas in this book. Unfortunately they are surrounded by the above mentioned nebulous theorizing and outright egotism (see cover of book). If you want some scientifically sound reappraisals of intelligence check the works of Robert Sternberg. If any cutting edge thinking is to revolutionize the view of intelligence (and thus it's measurement) it might well be Sternberg's Triarchic Theory."},{"Title":"Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences for the 21st Century","review":"Perhaps every good book has some axe to grind. In any case, knowing why it was written often helps more than anything else to understand what a book is about. In this case, the book is supposed to help deflate books like &quot;The Bell Curve,&quot; and Arthur Jensen's seminal &quot;The g Factor,&quot; which together argue that intelligence exists, is sociologically fateful, and highly heritable (i.e., that if everybody had the same genes for it, most of the variation presently observed in intelligence would not exist).This is related to &quot;Herrnstein's syllogism&quot; which says: intelligence significantly determines social status, and is also highly heritable, therefore, under equal opportunity in a free and fair meritocracy, social status will still be significantly heritable. This, of course, is considered politically unacceptible by many if not most Americans today (although Thomas Jefferson apparently accepted it, cf. his &quot;natural aristocracy&quot;), and so Gardner has been warmly received as a foe of it.Gardner's tactic is simple: he denies that intelligence exists, or at least that IQ tests measure intelligence. Instead he postulates &quot;multiple intelligences,&quot; such as &quot;kinesthetic intelligence&quot; (physical/athletic coordination/skill), and &quot;social intelligence&quot; (social grace/ability). Musical talent too gets a re-name, but I forget what it is.So as you can see, all this, while certainly interesting (since all these various talents are certainly interesting to explore and very valuable) basically amounts to what an ordinary person with common sense usually calls a &quot;purely semantic argument.&quot;In other words, Gardner does not show that there is anything wrong with Herrnstein's heresy besides a choice of words. Remove the term &quot;intelligence,&quot; and plug in the term &quot;IQ test score,&quot; and the same politically heretical conclusion follows, thus: IQ test score significantly predicts social status, IQ test score is highly heritable, therefore in a free and fair meritocracy social status will be significantly heritable. Gardner has done nothing to forestall the dreaded heresy. He has, however, allowed people to believe that he does, and thus enjoyed an unearned boost from the forces of political correctness, as other reviews will show.How many legs does a dog have, if you call a tail a leg? Four. Calling a tail a leg doesn't make it one. Neither can calling athletic ability, musical talent, and social grace &quot;multiple intelligences&quot; do anything to change the biological heritability (or lack thereof) of socioeconomic status.The meaning of a word depends on how people actually use it. If most ordinary English speakers call athletic ability, musical talent, and social grace &quot;talents&quot; rather than &quot;intelligences,&quot; then that's what they are. Conversely, if IQ tests do measure what most people do call &quot;intelligence,&quot; then IQ tests measure intelligence. To the extent that these things are true, they're just true by definition.When it comes to the facts behind the words, Gardner's &quot;intelligences&quot; may themselves be just as heritable, if not more so, than traditional IQ test scores, and thus may even add to the expected biological heritability of social class. Gardner's work on the nature of various talents may be interesting, but his reputation as an ally of political correctness is a sham. The only thing politically correct about the MI theory is its capricious abuse of language in the service of an Orwellian attempt to alter reality by changing what things are called.However, if you're just looking for a good book on these various talents, go for it."},{"Title":"Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences for the 21st Century","review":"Intelligent Pictures in our MindsAlmost two decades ago, a Harvard University developmental psychologist, Howard Gardner, wrote Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences, a book he believed he was writing predominantly to enlighten mainstream psychologists, not educators. In that book, he proposed a novel notion: the psychological construct 'intelligence' should be formally measured in more ways than simply through the dry statistical analytical lenses of the widely accepted logical and linguistic IQ-type formalized tests, tests so standardized for most schooling systems. Gardner questioned the classical belief that human beings could have only one 'mode of representation' about the world; instead, he suggested that a more pluralistic viewpoint for measuring mental functioning ought to be addressed - a variety of intelligent ways of thinking.In Frames, Gardner theorized a master list of seven basic intelligences to represent these other modes, including the widely accepted linguistic-verbal and logical-mathematical, and visual-spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, musical-rhythmic, and the two most criticized, interpersonal and intrapersonal. Frames was well received by those in the educational arena and the wider community at large. It was translated into Chinese, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish. It was selected by five book clubs. Frames became Gardner's claim-to-fame.In his second 1999 book, Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences for the 21st Century, the 'father' of the Theory of Multiple Intelligences (MI) once again acquaints his followers with another first-rate book that continues the argument he made in earlier books, that there are multiple forms of intelligences. Although he 'canonizes' two additional intelligences, naturalistic and existential, he feels that what is more important is how people make use of MI to carry out daily tasks prized in the culture. This latter statement was well summarized during a recent interview when Gardner said &quot;The fact that we have the same intelligences means that we can communicate with one another. But the fact that we represent things mentally in numerous symbolic systems to one another means that we are not necessarily going to construe things in the same way or see the same options.&quot;The strength of the book lies in its core, the next three chapter describing and justifying &quot;the ways in which MI theory can be applied to scholastic and &quot;wider world&quot; settings. Gardner's line of reasoning is persuasive, not because of the extensiveness of the information he includes, and his realization that certain mainstream institutions may encounter difficulty implementing his &quot;multiple approaches to understanding&quot;, but because his script, as always, is vibrant and lucid enough to hold our interests more than a monotonous statistical analyses of a psychometric theory of intelligence would, yet firm and advanced enough that he can be taken as a serious thinker rather than as some pop cognitivist.These three chapters outline how others have successfully implemented MI; they detail how the MI model can be easily applied to classroom learning and also infused into the &quot;the wider society.&quot; In fact, all of Chapter 11 comments on MI in the wider world of institutions and business communities. Here, Gardner outlines ways that he has observed MI &quot;at work in children's museums&quot;, including possibilities within art museums, and finally, within the workplace. The book concluded with Chapter 12 where he addresses (somewhat) the question first introduced in Chapter 1: Who Owns Intelligence? While the jury will be out most likely well in the 21st century on this deep and philosophical problem, may it be said, for now, that the &quot;proprietary rights&quot; to intelligences belong to all? Intelligence Reframed is especially important for the way in which it lays out a challenge to the 'psychometric consensus.' More specifically, the book is important for the following four reasons.If there is a weakness in the book, it lies within the opening and closing chapters. Here the book stumbles somewhat in its attempt to address the authentic ownership of intelligence. It is suggested that &quot;intelligence is too important to be left to the intelligence testers&quot;, that the book lay &quot;out a position that challenges the psychometric consensus&quot;, that the book adopt the stance that humans ought to develop a better method of viewing cognitive potential and that what matters more than developing tests to measure intelligences is the practical applications of intelligences. There are some interesting calls for greater human individualization provided in these two chapters. But the details given to intellectual renovators is inconsequential and save for intellectual generalities, is slightly outdated; long-standing MI supporters will find little in these two chapters that they did not already know.Nevertheless, Intelligence Reframed is Howard E. Gardner: it is a delightful and entertaining read and beautifully written by one of the best writers in the field of developmental cognitive science. Dr. Gardner has, once again, provided readers with a significant and well-articulated text that should be widely read and discussed. As with his previous books, detailed reference notes have been conveniently located in a section at the end of the book, so that the flow of the text is continuous. The four appendices (Books and Articles by Howard Gardner, Other Works About The Theory of Multiple Intelligences, Videos, Newsletters, and Miscellany, and Contacts on Multiple Intelligences Theory and its Application) represent a welcomed background for the more interested reader. The 292 pages of the book clearly delineate and reframe the original (1983) picture of his many 'kinds of minds' image. Every chapter title, save one, contains either the word 'intelligence' or 'intelligences' - an indication of the central theme throughout the book - to &quot;challenge the psychometric consensus&quot; by updating the reader with numerous fresh viewpoints from a cognitive developmental standpoint.Like so many of the author's earlier books, Intelligence Reframed ought to have a powerful impact on all who read it because Gardner puts into words a common sense type of message that so many people in psychology, education, and the greater world already know: human beings are very special from each another. They learn in dissimilar kinds of ways, and to treat all of them as if they were the same and call everybody stupid who fails to resemble a certain prototype is simply a misguided assessment."},{"Title":"Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences for the 21st Century","review":"Since there are already five reviews, I just wish to add my endorsement of an excellent and timely book. For those who are not conversant with the MI (multiple intelligences) theory, this is the best updated and succint introduction. We get an understanding of the thinking processes of the author in breaking out of the straitjacket of intelligence defined by traditional I.Q. tests while maintaining stringent criteria in accepting what would come under the concept of intelligence. It is fascinating to see how he tentatively comes down to eight and half intelligences! In view of a whole industry of MI products and materials, quick MI profiles... enthusiasts must first read Chapter 6, &quot;Myths and Realities about Multiple Intelligences&quot;. I personally fully share the ideal of developing understanding and the uniqueness of each person based on individual differences. We are given some clues. There is still an immense challenge in the implementation, esp. in having enough teachers with such competence for schools with large classes of 40 and above."},{"Title":"Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences for the 21st Century","review":"I chose this book by Howard Gardner because I wished to learn about his theory of Multiple Intelligences (MI). This being his most current version of that theory, I thought it would be the most relevant. I was not disappointed. As an elementary teacher-in-training, what I had heard of MI theory made sense to me: that our minds are made up of separate intelligences and each of us is stronger in some than in others. Current MI theory distinguishes 8.5 separate intelligences: logical-mathematical, musical, linguistic, bodily-kinesthetic, spatial, interpersonal, intrapersonal, natural, and the half-intelligence of spiritual. (Gardner feels that the term &quot;spiritual intelligence&quot; is too broad to meet his criteria for human intelligence; hence, he prefers the term &quot;existential intelligence.&quot;)Gardner defines intelligence as &quot;...a biophysiological potential to process information that can be activated in a cultural setting to solve problems or create products that are of value in a culture&quot; (p. 33). He had held these 8.5 &quot;candidate faculties&quot; up against eight criteria derived from biological sciences, logical analysis, developmental psychology, and traditional psychological research (p. 35). He accepted as intelligences those faculties that met the criteria. While I find the criteria to be essential background to MI theory and important evidence upon which Gardner bases his theory, this is not what is important about this book.What is important is that Intelligence Reframed provides an understandable overview of the various historical views of intelligence, including the first IQ tests; discussion of the seven original intelligences identified by the author; the so-called &quot;new&quot; intelligence candidates: spiritual, existential, and naturalist (people with an in-depth understanding of the live environment); contemplation of the possibility of including moral intelligence; and authentic uses for MI theory.While discussing the abstract realm of spirituality, Gardner seems to work out on paper his hesitation to identify spiritual intelligence as a full intelligence. He concludes that existential intelligence, held up to his eight criteria, better fits the bill of human intelligence than does spiritual intelligence. He gets tripped up on the seemingly fluid terms he uses to describe spiritual intelligence, such as religion, mysticism, transcendent, feeling, gift, and higher truth. According to Gardner, those who possess existential intelligence are concerned with questions regarding the human condition such as the meaning of life, love, and death. He is more comfortable with this relatively concrete term, &quot;existential,&quot; than with the term &quot;spiritual.&quot; The author subsequently meanders into the realm of possibly identifying a moral intelligence, finally deciding that it does not fit the definition of intelligence, but it is rather a kind of person one develops into.As I read Gardner's book, I felt as though I was privy to the inner-workings of his mind, beginning with his overview and explanations of each of the intelligences, and his arguments for and against spiritual, existential, and moral intelligences. A chapter of questions and answers allowed me to see even deeper into the author's contemplation on the subject of MI theory. He brings it all to an authentic conclusion as his final chapters discuss putting MI theory to work in the classroom, with an emphasis on individually configured education and curricula designed for in-depth understanding rather than for memorization of a myriad of facts. Gardner discusses assessment of MI through observation and simulations - in other words, assessing students as they do things - rather than, for example, multiple-choice testing. In addition, Gardner considers the benefits of MI theory in the business world and in museums (especially children's museums and art museums).As a future teacher, I am reminded by Gardner of the importance of knowing my students and recognizing their various intelligences. However, I cannot stop there. Once I have such knowledge of my students, I must make use of it as I develop my curricula, my methods of teaching, and the ways in which I assess for understanding. MI theory goes hand-in-hand with social and emotional learning. In order to understand students' social and emotional development, one must recognize them as individuals with varied family, religious, and cultural backgrounds. We must also add to that list the various intelligences that children bring to the classroom. It is our job as teachers to have tools available to recognize and understand these differences, and to respect the diversity of backgrounds and intelligences that exist within each and every child. Gardner's Intelligence Reframed is an informative addition to every teacher's toolbox."},{"Title":"Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences for the 21st Century","review":"In this book, Gardner clears up some of the big mixups of MI theory and does a great job in clarifying questions any student of MI might have. For example, Gardner asserts that each of the 9 intelligences is used only when one is fashioning new products or solving problems. Perhaps the greatest treasure in this book is the introduction of two new intelligences: existential intelligence and naturalist intelligence. This book is also different from other Gardner books I have read in that it seems more &quot;wise&quot;: a good deal of Gardner's 20 years of experience after writing Frames of Mind has been distilled in this new book. I do suggest reading Frames of Mind first, though: you'll probably save yourself some headache by getting a good grasp of MI first. All said, I thought this book was great and suggests even more great things to come from Howard Gardner."},{"Title":"Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences for the 21st Century","review":"I found this a difficult but rewarding book to read. Its basic premise is that \\"intelligence is too important to be left to the intelligence testers.\\" Gardner notes that, during the past half century, many assumptions about the human mind and the human brain have been challenged...in some instances revised. \\"For example, we now understand that the human mind, reflecting the structure of the brain, is composed of modules or faculties. At the same time, in light of scientific and technological changes, the needs and desires of cultures all over the world have undergone equally dramatic shifts.\\" The task Gardner sets for himself, therefore, is to introduce and then explain his theory of multiple intelligences (MI) in juxtaposition with the traditional view of intelligence.After describing the traditional view of intelligence in Chapter 2, he next considers several \\"new candidate intelligences\\" (naturalist, spiritual, existential, and moral). In the remaining chapters, he addresses questions and criticisms about his theory; dispels some of the more prominent myths; explores the relationships among intelligence, creativity, and leadership; suggests how his theory can be applied; discusses the theory in scholastic settings, then in\\"the wider world\\"; and then in the final chapter, explores in greater depth (returning to issues raised in Chapter 1) \\"my answer to the provocative question, \\"Who owns intelligence?'\\"Gardner \\"reframes\\" our understanding of human intelligence by increasing the number and nature of our perspectives on it. That is to say, he creates a wider, deeper, and more diverse frame-of-reference in which certain conclusions which, for many apparently, are controversial. For example, \\"the saga of individual consciousness cannot be reduced to formulas or generalizations.\\" Moreover, \\"no two selves, no two consciousnesses, no two minds are exactly alike.\\" Therefore, \\"Each of is...is situated to make a unique contribution to the world.\\" The challenge for the human race is to discover \\"our deepest common tie -- that we are all joint products of natural and cultural evolution.\\"I am reminded of what Walt Whitman once said: \\"Do I contradict myself? Very well, then, I contradict myself. I am large. I contain multitudes.\\" Gardner seems to be suggesting that, if each human being contains \\"multitudes\\", it is imperative that we cherish as well as recognize such diversity and complexity. Only then can we \\"in a complementary but synergistic way\\" ensure \\"that Nature and Culture survive for future generations.\\" For all of us, Gardner's theory has profound implications. It also suggests substantial benefits if we apply this theory within what is sometimes referred to as \\"The Family of Man.\\""},{"Title":"Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences for the 21st Century","review":"Twenty-one (21) years ago, a Harvard University developmental psychologist, Howard Gardner, wrote quite an interesting book called \\"Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences\\". He thought that he was writing the book to enlighten, in the main, conventional psychologists, not state-funded public school educators such as classroom teachers and school administrators. In that book, he suggested a novel notion: that the psychological construct 'intelligence' should be formally measured in many more cognitive avenues than simply through dry statistical analytical lenses of widely accepted logical/linguistic IQ-type formalized tests, tests standardized for most schooling systems. More precisely, he questioned the mainstream belief that human beings throughout the world could have only a single 'mode of representation' about life; instead, he suggested that a more pluralistic viewpoint for measuring cerebral capacities ought be addressed -- a variety of intelligent ways of thinking.Or to put it another way, Mr. Gardener, suggested that our human intelligences ought to be arranged in a 'vertical' way, as a number of almost different faculties, rather than 'horizontally', as a set of 'g'eneral skills. This viewpoint was in direct contrast to many of the traditional language and logic theorists of that (1983) time who believed (and many continue to do so, today, in 2004) that there was only one kind of general intelligence, or 'g': that we either has a much of it or not that much, and that there was virtually very little that we could be do about that.In Frames, Gardner theorized a master list of seven basic human intelligences to represent these other types of modes, including the widely accepted linguistic - verbal and logical - mathematical, and visual - spatial, bodily - kinesthetic, musical - rhythmic, and the two most criticized but equally important of all of his intelligences, interpersonal and intrapersonal. Frames was well received by those within the educational arena. The book was reprinted numerous times and translated into many languages, including Chinese, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese and Spanish. His work was selected by five (5) major USA book clubs. To this day, it \\"is still his best-known and most influential book\\" (Eberstadt, 1999, p. 7). In other words, Frames has become Gardner's claim-to-fame work.In his second 1999 book, Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences for the 21st Century, Gardner once again acquaints his followers with another first rate book that continues the argument he made in earlier books, that there are multiple forms of intelligences. Although \\"he introduces the possibility of three new intelligences (but canonizes only existential intelligence and naturalist intelligence)\\" (book jacket, inside front cover), Gardner, feels that what is MORE important is how people make use of MI to carry out daily tasks prized in the culture. This latter statement was well summarized during a recent interview when Gardner said \\"The fact that we have the same intelligences means that we can communicate with one another. But the fact that we represent things mentally in numerous symbolic systems to one another means that we are not necessarily going to construe things in the same way or see the same options.\\"Intelligence Reframed, which \\"draws heavily on [four] essays written in the 1990s\\" (p. ix) contains 12 Chapters. In the opening three chapters, comments on the mainstream scientific view of intelligence are reintroducing, including MI theory. These chapters provide important background documentation on the 'psychometric dominance' before MI. In Chapter 3, Gardner redefines intelligence, reviews the eight criteria for intelligence, and clarifies the original seven intelligences. In the next three chapters, he introduces the possibility of four additional candidate intelligences: moral, spiritual, existential, and naturalist, however settling only on the latter two. In Chapters six and seven, questions related to recent myths and issues are discussed. In particular, he \\"responds in lively dialogue to the critiques leveled against\\" MI. The reader is offered a series of well thought out observations on how MI theory has been deciphered and misconstrued. Any relationships between leadership, creativity, and intelligence are discussed in Chapter 8.The strength of Intelligence Reframed lies in its core, the three (3) subsequent chapter describing and justifying \\"the ways in which MI theory can be applied to scholastic and \\"wider world\\" settings. Gardner's line of reasoning is persuasive, not because of the extensiveness of the information he includes, and his realization that certain mainstream institutions may encounter difficulty implementing his \\"multiple approaches to understanding\\", but because his script, as always, is vibrant and lucid enough to hold our interests more than a monotonous statistical analyses of a psychometric theory of intelligence would, yet firm and advanced enough that he can be taken as a serious thinker rather than as some pop cognitivist.These three chapters outline how others have successfully implemented MI; they detail how the MI model can be easily applied to classroom learning and also infused into the \\"the wider society.\\" In fact, all of Chapter 11 comments on MI in the wider world of institutions and business communities. Here, Gardner outlines ways that he has observed MI \\"at work in children's museums\\", including possibilities within art museums, and finally, within the workplace. The book concluded with Chapter 12 where he addresses (somewhat) the question he first introduced in Chapter 1: Who Owns Intelligence? While the jury will be out most likely well in the 21st century on this deep and philosophical problem, may it be said, for now, that the \\"proprietary rights\\" to intelligences belong to all? The book is especially important for the way in which it lays out a challenge to the 'psychometric consensus.' More specifically, I feel that the book is important for the following four (4) reasons.First of all, I continue to believe that this book is important because it refines Gardner's original definition of intelligence: the capacity to solve problems or to fashion products that are valued in one or more cultural settings, to a more cultivated version, intelligence is \\"a bio-psychological potential to process information that can be activated in a cultural setting to solve problems or create products that are of value in a culture\\" (pp. 33-34). Gardner perceives intelligences as \\"potentials - presumably, neural ones - that will or will not be activated, depending upon the values of a particular culture, the opportunities available in that culture, and the personal decisions made by individuals and/or their families, schoolteachers, and others\\" (p. 34). This is a revision of great consequence. By now referring to intelligences as a 'potential', Gardner, at last, brings to everyone's attention a most important distinction, \\"intelligence not as a content\\", but \\"geared to specific contents in the world.\\" To reinforce this point, Gardner elsewhere likens his intelligences to \\"elastics bands\\" that can be stretched beyond those \\"psychometrically intelligent.\\"Second, I think that this book is important because it outlines procedures for assessing MI. This is a most important point because, in previous writings, Gardner has been appropriately attacked for failing to produce assessment instruments for his MI theory. Gardner feels that \\"the classical short-answer examinations\\" are of little use. Instead, he is interested in asking \\"people to do things\\" and to observe their skill level in the task under construction. In this way, he feels that an examiner would be better \\"able to look directly at the skills and capacities\\" so valued in the dominant culture. Now, intelligences could be used \\"to carry out tasks valued by society.\\"In other words, by placing intelligence within the role of \\"human information-processing and product-making capacities\\", Gardner sees ongoing observation as a pragmatic assessment tool. He prefers to assess in 'intelligent-fair' ways, that is, \\"assessing people's successes in carrying out valued tasks that presumably involve certain intelligences.\\" Of prime importance here is a \\"realistic context\\" for observing the skill. To better explain all of this, Gardner sites several examples throughout the book, including the following two. First, one way to assess interpersonal intelligences would be to monitor individuals as they interact in \\"real-life situations where they have to be sensitive to the aspirations and motives of others.\\" Second, the visual-spatial intelligence \\"would be assessed through performances in such activities as navigating an unfamiliar terrain, playing chess, interpreting blueprints, and remembering the arrangements of objects in a recently vacated room.\\"Of greater interest are general pointers that Gardner cautions test developers to consider: making the distinction between one's personal preferences and their capabilities to succeed at the task at hand, the risk of relying solely on linguistic-verbal methods to assess abilities, and the significance of drawing on observations of actual skills, including verification by others who best know that individual. The fact that he has cautioned test developers about such conventional pitfalls is, at last, a step in the right direction for those wishing to develop assessment tools for his intelligences. To demonstrate further that Gardner is in favor of assessment tools to measure his intelligences, he throws out the following suggestions. Ongoing improvement in technology will open up various avenues for computer simulations. For example, to measure one's musical intelligence, a subject could be presented with an unfamiliar tune. The subject could be asked to learn the tune, to implement the tune into a musical performance, or perhaps even to involve a computer simulation package to rearrange its composition. Gardner feels that such an assessment exercise would reveal more about a person's musical skills than would a traditional timed paper-pencil test dealing with the factual knowledge of music.Third, the book is important because Gardner suggests six critical steps that ought to be followed before anyone establishes an MI environment. First, one should learn as much as possible about MI practice, especially MI theory. Some sources for doing this include books, videos, the Internet, including CD-ROMS. Second, interested parties might wish to form study groups and thus learn from others more knowledgeable about MI. Third, one could visit MI schools where the MI model has been in operation for some time, two examples being the Key Learning Center in Indianapolis, Indiana, and the New City School in St. Louis, Missouri. Fourth, much can be learned from attending MI workshops, seminars, and conferences. Fifth, one could join a network of schools that have been active in the MI teaching approach. Finally, Gardner suggests to \\"plan and launch activities, practices, or programs that grow out of immersion in the world of MI theory and approaches.\\"And finally, I believe that this book is important because Gardner comments on a series of 'entry points' that can be used by anyone wishing to introduce MI into a learning center, be it a classroom site, a children's or art museum, or within the greater business community. The entry points range from the narrative, the quantitative/numerical, the logical, to the foundational/existential, aesthetic, hands on, and social. For the narrative learner, Gardner suggests the linguistic-verbal intelligence as an entrance vehicle. Here, subjects could narrate a story around what s/he sees or hears. Those \\"intrigued by numbers and the patterns they make, the various operations that can be performed, and insight into size, ratio, and change\\" may wish to investigate a quantitative/numerical entry point.More to that final reason, Gardner suggests \\"[figuring] out the cost of the materials and how that relates to the selling price. Deductive thinkers might enjoy the logical point of entry as they could \\"share [their] theory about why [an] object is important.\\" And for those \\"attracted to fundamental kinds of questions\\", Gardner suggests the foundational/existential entry point. Content \\"that features balance, harmony, and composition\\" may inspire the aesthetic entry point. For example, Gardner suggests that one could \\"describe the colors and shapes and how they fit together.\\" A hands on entry point may motivate those to activities \\"in which they become fully engaged - where they can build something, manipulate materials, or carry out experiments.\\" Here, Gardner suggests one might design a dance centered on what the viewer saw. And finally, for those 'interpersonal' learners who \\"learn more effectively\\" from group interaction, Gardner suggests the social entry point.I believe that Mr. Gardner has greatly contributed to the body of knowledge on the nature of human intelligence. He is to be commended for how he makes a most difficult psychological construct so simple to comprehend. He has presented his followers with a revised and updated picture of their various minds and its accompanying intelligences. He has reframed the image of intelligences for the forthcoming century, and perhaps, more importantly, has successfully 'stretched' the mainstream 'borders' of intelligence to include disciplines beyond education and psychology, a most welcomed line of attack. With this book, he has accomplished a major step in elevating the discussion of our cerebral smarts to possibly new frontiers. For all of this, we should be truly thankful.If there is a weakness in the book, perhaps it lies within the opening and closing chapters. Here, one could that Gardner perchance stumbles somewhat in his attempt to address the authentic ownership of intelligence. He suggests that \\"intelligence is too important to be left to the intelligence testers\\", that the book lay \\"out a position that challenges the psychometric consensus\\", that the book adopt the stance that humans ought to develop a better method of viewing cognitive potential and that what matters more than developing tests to measure intelligences is the practical applications of intelligences. There are some interesting calls for greater human individualization provided in these two chapters. But the details given to intellectual renovators is inconsequential and save for intellectual generalities, is slightly outdated. Long standing followers of Gardner's writings, this retired classroom teacher and school principal included, will find little in these two chapters that they did not already know.Nevertheless, Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences for the 21st Century, is truly Dr. Howard Earl Gardner, the developmental cognitive scientist, at his very best. It is a delightful and entertaining read and beautifully written by one of the best writers in the field of psychology today. Gardner has, once again, provided us with a significant and well articulated text that should be widely read and discussed. As with most of his previous books, detailed reference notes have been conveniently located in a section at the end of the book, so that the flow of the text remains continuous. The four appendices (Books and Articles by Howard Gardner, Other Works About The Theory of Multiple Intelligences, Videos, Newsletters, and Miscellany, and Contacts on Multiple Intelligences Theory and its Application) represent a welcomed background for the more interested reader.The 292 pages of the book clearly delineate and reframe many of the original (1983) pictures stemming from his many 'kinds of minds' image. Every chapter title, save one, contains either the word 'intelligence' or 'intelligences' - an indication of the central theme of the book - to \\"challenge the psychometric consensus\\" by updating the reader with numerous fresh viewpoints from a cognitive developmental standpoint. And, like so many of his earlier books, Intelligence Reframed ought to have a powerful impact on all who read it because Gardner once again introduces the reader to a common sense message, a message initially generated from Frames: I think [Frames'] attraction had to do with the fact that I was putting into words and giving some scholarly background -- a Harvard imprimatur -- to something so many people in education know: Kids are very different from one another. They learn in very different kinds of ways, and to treat them all as if they're the same and call everybody a dummy who doesn't resemble a certain prototype is wrong.

For twenty years he has allowed his theory to take on a life of its own, as evidenced by a 20 page Appendix B listing works related to MI by others. In this book he attempts to clarify what MI theory is, and what it is not.MI theory is essentially a paradigm through which to &quot;conceptualize human intellect.&quot; Gardner claims that MI theory is &quot;an account of human cognition in its fullness ... a new definition of human nature, cognitively speaking.&quot; The essence of MI theory is not the specific 8.5 intelligences Gardner supports to date, but the eight criteria he developed by which to evaluate potential candidates for &quot;intelligence&quot; status.His convictions are clearly stated. Humans possess multiple, distinct intelligences. These intelligences are a &quot;potential to process information in a cultural setting.&quot; Each individual possesses a unique blend of potentials which can only be activated in response to environmental demands. Therefore, assessment attempts are wrongheaded.With the exception of linguistic and logical-mathematical intelligences, an intelligence can only be tested by watching it in action, that is, problem solving or product creation. This is a sigficant weakness for direct application of MI theory to an educational setting. MI theory requires individualized education without meaningfully comparative assessment tools.In place of comparative and competitve assessment of students, Gardner argues for teaching &quot;understanding.&quot; The intelligences point to &quot;entry points&quot; through which students might engage curricular materials by performance. Instead of evaluating student test-taking skills, observation, critique and improvement of student performances are advocated. In this way Gardner hopes to enhance the overarching goals of education - the &quot;transintellectual capacities&quot; of analogy, synthesis and wisdom.I question the practicality of Gardner's application of MI theory to classroom, while applauding his re-imagining of human nature and our innate potential for lifelong development."},{"Title":"Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences for the 21st Century","review":"Howard Gardner's book Intelligence Reframed is somewhat different in content than I'd expected. It starts out with a discussion of psychometrics, particularly intelligence testing, and introduces the author's own research into intelligence. Then the content changes to education. This abrupt change threw me for a loop until I read more on the author and his interests.Gardner started with an interest in psychology, taking a PhD from Harvard University under the direction of the developmental psychologists Bruner and Erikson. He also did postdoctoral work with the neuropsychologist Geschwind at the Boston Veterans Hospital where his research focused on the nature of intelligence and the development of abilities, and on educational processes. In the 1980s he became involved in educational reform. Currently he is the Hobbs Professor in Cognition and Education at Harvard Graduate School of Education and is Adjunct Professor of Psychology, also at Harvard, and Adjunct Professor of Neurology at the Boston University School of Medicine.The first half of the book made perfect sense to me, especially with the newer data from brain and mind research. Recent experiments with animals and with human volunteers have been conducted to elucidate the function of the different parts of the brain. Earlier information derived anecdotally from brain injured individuals had suggested that the brain may consist of modules that evolved to solve specific types of problems but that interaction of these modules with one another has created a wide variety of emergent properties, the main ones being consciousness and self-awareness. The experimental data seems to support this concept. Gardner has defined a number of &quot;intelligences&quot; that seem to be supported by this data, showing that the concept of a single all inclusive intelligence measurement might not be possible and might skew educational efforts in non-productive ways. With all of this I tend to agree.The character of the information, and Gardner's own personal interests, naturally lead to the topic of education. Although I agree with his points on the failings of some traditional school systems and even the failure of some of those that pay lip service to his MI theories, I'm not sure that I agree with his overall exuberance over the MI approach to education. He notes that traditional educational programs tend to hit for the middle and hope for the best, so to speak, which they do. He also notes that those schools that say they adhere to an MI approach are generally doing business as usual. (Sort of like calling the school custodian an &quot;environmental engineer&quot; because it sounds better.)Still, I'm not sure that Gardner's enthusiasm for the application of the multiple intelligences approach to learning is necessarily justified or even possible in these days of financial retrenchment. Schools are hard put to it to provide the 3-Rs by traditional means. The music, language and art classes that were available even during my own years as a child have been drastically cut back for this reason, and now some schools are faced with increasing classroom size.One of the things I did agree with was his notion that children might benefit from having the same teacher every year with the caveat that changes could readily be made for a better fit of personality between teacher and child. I agree that this might develop a closer mutual understanding between teacher and pupil. However here too, there might be problems. Not all teachers would be able to readily establish such bonds or sustain them over long periods of time. Not all children will maintain the same type of bond with an adult authority figure over the course of their development--as any parent could tell you--and not all teachers are equally adept at all subjects or all methods of teaching any given subject. In short, there would be problems.While I think the author has some valid points with respect to the variety of intelligences and abilities that we all have, and some good intentions with respect to education, I'm not sure that his ideas are very practicable in a real setting."},{"Title":"Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences for the 21st Century","review":"If you haven't read already Gardner this is a great overview of his ideas and discussions around them.

In this one volume we find the abstracts (summaries) of every work Freud published. At the time it was ground-breaking stuff. Having the abstracts of every one of his papers in one volume is a spectacular contribution and a most handy companion and tool for anyone involved in psychiatry - professional and amateur.Psychoanalysis has progressed light years since Freud's day, but it still all goes back to him, his theories and ideas. Freud got people to start thinking of the mind and human behavior in a very different way. Being able to read these summaries allows the reader to decide whether a particular paper by Freud bears further investigation. It's a master work, an incredibly valuable volume, and it should be on the bookshelf of every psychology professional as well as anyone interested in the workings of human behavior.

I am a history buff and ate this up. Daniel Boone experiences real life heart throbbing adventure and was critical to paving the way for Westward expansion.

Quite a paradox considering Boone's contribution to enabling the rush for land that was Western immigration in the late 18th century.Boone's wilderness adventures are simply and clearly presented. There is no doubting this was a brave, resourceful and honest man who never held back when his duty to country, or fellow traveller was called upon.Sadly, I found these accounts were a little \\"flat\\" and uninspiringly related. Also, I would bet that the actual Boone story takes up less than half of the book.

Typical of Hawaii. But it is great! Thanks-"},{"Title":"The Primary Colors: Three Essays","review":"He's one of my favorite writers (recently I reviewed \\"Laura Warholic,\\" his latest novel and \\"Three Wogs,\\" his earliest fiction) but he's certainly sui generis. I have no idea how, especially pre-Internet and pre-search engines, he compiled the thousands of allusions, citations, song lyrics, art works, and trivia that accumulate here to explore blue, yellow, and red. His prose style here, unlike his fiction, may be either more accessible or less cohesive for his readers, but if they've enjoyed his novels, they'll welcome these brief, but densely packed, essays.He raises, of course, many more questions than even he answers. And he knows a lot, such that you'll feel inept by comparison; a common reaction perhaps to encountering his formidably erudite prose. Still, if you want a counterblast to the usual piddle that passes for thought, he'll prove rewarding. As with all his books, it's not to be dashed through, but better savored for its style and contemplated for its observations.Here's a few that struck me. Blue and green often mix in most languages; Theroux wonders if this may be due to a very recent development of our retinal cones that perceive blue. I'm curious if recent genetics can solve this crux. Also, colors enter languages in the same order: first black and white,then red, and then either green or yellow followed by the other. The fifth color separates the third and fourth, resulting in blue. There's no footnotes or sources given, for if there were it'd be equal to the text itself easily. But, I wish I could find out from where Theroux piled up such arcana.On pp. 102-03, for example, he goes in one paragraph from yellow eyes in Frankenstein to a Dickens character, Leon Trotsky about Stalin, Arab boys, a film based on Balzac, Catherine Deneuve's sister, a woman in Walker Percy's \\"The Moviegoer,\\" another in a Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez tale, Sam Spade, and ends with \\"the Alaskan Gray Wolf, staring directly at you.\\"The yellow chapter, compared to the red and blue, appears more bilious and more disturbing, and Theroux seems to share in that color's enigma. (One minor correction on pg. 120: Christo's artistic display of yellow umbrellas \\"on a landscape in California\\" appeared not in 1984 but in October, 1991. Blue ones in Japan were unveiled concurrently.) Still, my favorite sentence is here: \\"And is there not a flow in the streaming tresses of willow trees, in the sweep of their thin xiphoidal leaves blowing in the wind, as delicate as Veronica Lake's aureoline hair?\\" (138-39) Although the blue section appears to solve any question and hundreds more I may have had about that color, I still did not find a direct reference to why the music's so called, except for an implication that depression matches this shade. I had thought there was a connection between the indigo-picking slaves and their hands, stained with the plant, as they played and sang sad music.But, that's not found, and neither is, except again indirectly through Eva P&eacute;ron, any explanation of the association of lipstick with a particular amorous act in ancient Egypt by women who painted their mouths so! I guess we all end this book with our own further suppositions, half-recalled references, and ideas sparked by such a rich abundance of speculation, memory, and information about what we see all around us but rarely, I reckon, record with Theroux's diligence."},{"Title":"The Primary Colors: Three Essays","review":"This book copied whole sections of flying by D'Exupery and was therefore retirted from print."},{"Title":"Rand McNally Alaska Easy to Fold (Laminated) (Easyfinder Maps)","review":"This is a state map, parks and not just streets are listed.The Good:a)Laminated, durable (water-proof) and very tear resistant.b)Printed with bright colors, easy to read.The Bad:a)Printed 2008?

Once again Thomas Covenant returns to the land, which has been ravaged in the wake of the Illearth War. He must finally come to terms with the rape of Lena, with his leprosy and with The Land. Ultimately, the book is about how even a leper can fight off despair -- or can he? If he can redeem his own sorry self, he can redeem The Land. After the high of the Illearth War, the best of the series, the Power that Preserves is more subdued and philosophical, but you will not be disappointed...After you savor the end of the series for about a year, give the second series a shot. It's not as good, but still far superior to the schlock pervading fantasy shelves nowadays."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"Once again, Thomas Covenant returns to the Land. Once again, he struggles with his unbelief, with his conviction that he cannot both believe and survive. He is a leper.When ur-Lord Covenant returns to the Land, he finds that it is palled under the shroud of decay and ill health. Has it come to this, has his unbelief doomed the land he both loves so deeply and at the same instant denies? Can his sheer hate for Lord Foul awaken the latent power of his white-gold ring? These trials surface within \\"The Power that Preserves\\".I cannot stress it enough, this trilogy of novels, \\"The First Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever\\", is one of the pinnacles of fantasy writing. Donaldson has both a mastery of style and voice matched by few authors. His vivid characters grip you and draw you into the Land. They almost force you to feel deep emotion about them. Whether that emotion is love, hate, or in the case of the Unbeliever, sheer frustrated anger tainted with unrelenting sympathy for those in his path, you cannot help but be moved. This series will remain a benchmark against which I judge other novels, and other realities. You owe it to yourself to read this trilogy."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"I found one narrative flaw in this book--the revelation thatthe Land is more likely to be real than merely the product ofCovenant's imagination as demonstrated by scenes of the Lords before Covenant's advent into the Land. Aside from this, the book continues faithfully the tale of the Unbeliever in the Land. The ending, despite superficial cliches, was very good. In fact, given the evidence in the rest of the series, there was no other way to end the story. However, I consider the strong qualities of the book to outweigh the narrtive weaknesses to such an extent I will grant it five stars."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"This book is one of the best entries in what must be considered one of the best Fanstasy series of all time. No other world will stick with you like The Land. Donaldson shares with you a world so beautiful you can scarcely imagine it, then proceeds to tear it apart. The characters breathe for themselves, the choices they face are heart-wrenching, and the protagonist is as non-traditional as it gets. It's dark, and made even more so once you've experienced (in the 1st 2 books) how brightly shined the light that is being extinguished.

Donaldson has created a complex and rich land and populated it with compelling characters and creatures. Covenant is the perfect antidote to the predictable fantasy hero, becoming resolute in his hatred for Foul and growing in character throughout the three books of the first chronicles. Comparable to Tad Williams, Feist and Terry Goodkind, but for me still edges it as the best!"},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"This is the best of the Chronicles. Donaldson continues his modus operandi (action and heart shaking despair, then a final, cleansing burst of glory) to bring us a depressing, tormentuos book who's ending totally blasts away any lingering sadness. The end justifies absolutely anything Donaldson could have inflicted on us along the way ."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"It would seem a monumental task for any writer to match andeven surpass the earlier two volumes in the &quot;Chronicles of ThomasCovenant&quot; trilogy, but this Donaldson has done with his typical flair and touch. This is, quite simply, one of the finest culminating chapters in any fantasy trilogy, with sufficient action to attract even the most hard-headed sword and sorcery buff, enough character development and plot intricacies to entrance the most demanding reader, and enough tragedy, drama, and yes...even hope, to live on in the minds and hearts of those who enter Donaldson's &quot;Land&quot; for years to come. Focusing on the final battle between Lord Foul and Ur-Lord Thomas Covenant, &quot;The Power That Preserves&quot;, like it's preceding volumes, is often stylistically and thematically dark and brooding, yet with a subtle beauty and love of craft unseen in many fantasy authors today. Donaldson is, quite simply, the Heir Apparent to the Fantasy/Science Fiction throne. END"},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"Once again, tortured antihero Thomas Covenant is drawn to the magical Land, kicking and screaming all the way. Trapped in his wish-fulfilment hallucination, poor Tom confronts the end result of his inability to act: without his wild magic, the Land has become a desolate wasteland, where the survivors' only hope is the Unbeliever's ring. Covenant's inability to take sides and believe has brought the Land itself to a leper's desperate state, miserably awaiting death. There is almost nothing left to fight for, and the lesson of Hile Troy's whole-hearted acceptance of the Land's need is plain. Even the Giant Saltheart Foamfollower has become a killer, haplessly treading the path of despite Lord Foul has decreed. Happy endings don't happen to lepers; they also have nothing left to lose. Only a twisted and corroded key could unlock this puzzle, and the racked body and mind of Thomas Covenant has been forged into such a key by the merciless author. Would you die to save your dreams? Be true; you need not fail."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"This is really an excellent book for anyone who enjoys fantasy.

Well ! Covenant proves himself. He is the only person who can still think straight.While everyone is consumed by hate , despair and despite and an urge to slay , Covenant knows the right way to kill Lord Foul.Donaldson strikes out at the world and its beliefs, that experience necessarily breeds despair(read Hemingway for example).He tells us to laugh in the face of the grimmest odds and the most desparate situations.Despite is defeated and the Land is saved.This book must be read by anyone who read the first two.&quot;The Chronicles&quot; is a great book."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"Donaldson brings the 1st Chronicles of Thomas Covenant to a wonderfully written conclusion. The trilogy seemed to get better and better with each installment. Covenant, everyone's favorite depressed, leperous, anti-hero, is one of the finest characters to be developed by any author.

You won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"This is the most breathtaking book I ever read.

This book is full of so much action, emotion, and intrigue to keep any reader hooked. The book starts when the Unbeliever is again summoned to the land, this time by a rather unlikely source. Covenant's mission this time in the Land is simple, destroy Lord Foul.But, how will he accomplish such a thing? Lord Foul has rebuilt his army, and it is even bigger than before. And the army has only one purpose, to destroy everything on the Land. Covenant and some old friends (and enemies) must fight to stop Foul before it is too late. Emotions run high in this final book of The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"Donaldson's trilogy is a uniquely adult fantasy. Like The Lord of the Rings, many of the characters are flat avatars that combine for rapid successions of epic scenes that can be terrifying, uplifting or both. Unlike The Lord of the Rings, however, the characters whom the narration follows are morally complicated, fascinating and, in the case of Thomas Covenant, often descpicable people. It is Donaldson's attention to the moral shadings of his characters that makes his trilogy so worthwhile. The character of Thomas Covenant, horribly unlikeable as he is, has the most complicated and yet consistent moral dynamic of any character portrayed in fantastic fiction. His painstaking evolution, which should often seem cliche, is made fresh by novelty of his situations -- they can be horrific or magical and yet always exist in contrast to his self-proclaimed role of \\"Unbeliever\\". This perfect control of the characters moral identities leads step-by-step to the trilogy's conclusion, making at the same time reasonable and exciting. Many of the elements of Donaldson's trilogy are very traditional, drawing from The Lord of the Rings, Dante and The Bible to name a few, but as with Tolkien's use of myth and tradition, it is the challenging prose that not only brings things to life, but does so in new ways. Donaldson's writing is not for a passive reader -- his usage is both technical and fanciful at the same time. It is the perfect tone for a work of fantasy that I consider to be the best I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"This book should come with a warning on the cover \\"Do Not Read if You Are Suffering From Depression\\". The first 2/3rds of this book is just so bleak and dreary that depressed people may commit suicide just from reading it. The only good thing I can say about the first 2/3rs of the book is that at least Thomas Covenant is not his usually whining self. His attitude has at least improved in this book and he becomes a man of action........problem is that he can't decide what action to take. Although there is plenty of death and small victories for the evil followers of Lord Foul, not much really happens in this book. Revelstone is under siege (boring until the last battle), and the rest of the characters wander around aimlessly getting slaughtered by the evil ones. Thomas Covenant first decides to do battle with Foul, then he decides that is the stupidest thing he could do, then in the end he battles Foul anyhow? The logic of his decisions is never really explained in the book. It almost seemed that the author was trying to decide whether to end the series with 3 books or go for a 4th, and then finally decides to end it quickly.I didn't like the ending. All the death and sacrifice of all the other characters in all the other battles in this book and the other books seemed like a total waste. All that was really needed all along was to put Covenant and Foul together in the same room. Covenant still didn't understand his power, only how to trigger it. All the other death and sacrifice didn't really make sense. Covenant and the Giant basically saved the world by themselves. It seemed that all the other events in this and previous books did nothing to contribute to Covenant's success. The ending was just too easy and too quick."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"One of the things most readers of these books can't stand is that Thomas Covenant is a leper and he won't let that go. I think The Creator chose Covenant and Lord Foul approved. Foul thought someone from this world afflicted with such a disease is just a second away from despair. The Creator believed Covenant was the stronger for his leprosy.Think of the titles Covenant gets in The Land: Ur-Lord, Ringthane, Unbeliever, Ill-Ender, Giantfriend, Earthfriend, Berek and White Gold Wielder.It is possible that HIgh Lord Kevin performed The Ritual of Desecration on the day Covenant got his leprosy. Remember how time moves differently between The Land and here. Hence Mhoram saying to Covenant, \\"You are the white gold.\\"You can say what you want, but it doesn't change this: Lord Foul 0, Covenant 2."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"This was the conclusion to one of the best fantasy trilogies I have ever read. The reader really gets to know the major characters over the course of three books. It's amazing how Donaldson tied them all together at the end (having Saltheart Foamfollower skip book two, and having Elena appear again in book three). The only complaint I have about these books is that I got a little tired about hearing about the main character's problems with leprosy. He was always exclaiming &quot;I'm a leper, don't you understand!&quot; every 10-20 pages or so and in a 1,500 page series it got old pretty quickly. I know the concept was important to the stories but it was a bit overplayed. In terms of what I liked about the book: the story was not entirely action-based, it had a somber tone rather than the typical &quot;happy-go-lucky&quot; tone of most fantasy novels, I liked the fact the main character wasn't able to use his power until the very end of the series.I'm looking forward to reading the other trilogy."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"This is my favourite of the First Chronicles of Thomas Covenant. It is the only one in which Thomas is not released from his leprosy by the healing powers of the Land, and it is the only one where he actually achieves something. Throughout the previous books, I found myself disliking Thomas Covenant because of his wish to turn his back on everything but himself, but in the Third book he is a lot more likeable, particularly due to the fact that he forms a good bond with Saltheart Foamfollower the Giant."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"I'm a great fan of Donaldson's. Even today, 23 years after this book's initial release, as I'm being spoiled by George R. R. Martin, I still look back on this book with amazement. There are chapters in this book, notably Lord Mhoram's Victory, that should receive a special place in a \\"Fantasy Hall of Fame\\", that should be used as templates in high fantasy writing seminars.***SPOILER ALERT***(although the book is 31 years old...)I'd like to offer one argument to those who brand Donaldson as being too dark. Lord Foul was defeated by what? Laughter. Hardly a dreary weapon."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"This is my favourite book/series. It's not your normal fantasy as it's quite dark and doesn't follow the standard formula that most fantasy books do nowadays."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"The final installment of Thomas Covenant's first trilogy is the darkest of the three. Seven years have passed since the second book ended and Covenant returned to his own world. The Land is in a perpetual winter and most of it is under Lord Foul's control. When Thomas Covenant is summoned, once again, to the Land, he's mentally and physically a mess. Heck, EVERYONE is a mess. There is no humor to be found between the covers of this book. However, the story is a gripping, satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.The story focuses on mostly Thomas Covenant and his journey to confront Lord Foul. Two other key characters, Triock who has a deep hatred of Covenant, and High Lord Mhoram, the leader of Revelstone are also given time in the limelight. The author spends ample time delving into these three character's internal struggles about how they don't believe they can measure up to the demands of their tasks. For a fantasy novel, Mr. Donaldson's sure has created very believable people.As like the second book, \\"The Power That Preserves\\" is not a stand-alone book. It is important to read the two prior works; \\"Lord Foul's Bane,\\" and \\"The Illearth War.\\" The reader likely knows Thomas Covenant survives because a second trilogy was written in the early 1980s and a quadrilogy entitled \\"The Final Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\" is currently being written. However, this does not diminish the high-level of entertainment, excitement and suspense of the first trilogy. I will reread the second trilogy next January. Three fiction works in a row seems to be my limit before I get restless and prefer some nonfiction material. Mr. Donaldson's work ranks right up there with \\"Lord of the Rings\\" as solid adult fare."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"Another entertaining read.

As a trilogy author myself (Illiom, Daughter of Prophecy), I know full well the complexity and forethought requred to complete a work of such sweeping magnitude.When I first read the series, back in the early 80s, I found the first three books gripping in the extreme. The tension between Covenant's inner reality and the exquisite beauty of the Land - regardless of questions about its actual reality - played out beautifully in my own psyche, leaving me with a hunger for more, much more.And, of course, Donaldson delivered... but much of the second series did not hold the same magic for me. Of course here, too, there were tracts of poignant beauty and evocative narrative, but somewhere on that interminable sea journey in The One Tree, I lost the plot.I have still been faithfully waiting for the conclusion to the overall story and have read The Runes of the Earth as soon as it came out. I was delighted to discover that my favourite author, who has inspired me in my own writing, has matured gloriously as a writer! So much so that I have been buying (but not yet reading) all of his books in the \\"Last Chronicles\\" series. When I have the complete opus in hand, my plan is to start again with Lord Foul's Bane and read it to its completion, hopefully within the same year!After that accomplishment I intend to leave another review."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"The first time, I read these three books over a weekend--of course that is all I did. These first three books of Thomas Covenant, Lord Foul's Bane, The Illearth War and Power That Preserves remain for me the measure by which all other fantasy is measured (including the later books of Mr. Donaldson.) In 1979 when I asked the author how he had tied up all the characters and plots to produce an ending so worthwhile, he said he wrote the book backward from the ending to the beginning. Thomas Covenant is not an inviting character all the more amazing then is his transformation. The first 50 pages are difficult, but wonders await. After 30 years I am reading them the third time. Donaldson's imagination is staggering. His use of the English language wondrous. Please endure the beginning, the ending is well worth difficulty in the beginning."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"Donaldson does a superb job with his characters in the 3rd novel of his series. The first novel does not explain the meaning of what being a leper means to Thomas Covenant and how it plays in the story.

It just seemed to me that this trilogy could have been reduced to one volume without detracting from either plot or character development. The scenes with Lord Mhoram and Co. were much too long and drawn out (unless you REALLY love battle descriptions), mainly because the people around him were two-dimensional and boring. Covenant was interesting, as were all the ideas playing around him and his connection to the Land and Despite, but unfortunately the writing distanced the reader too much to make Donaldson\`s core intentions clear (anyone know what a 'chiaroscuro' is?--without looking in the dictionary!). The only characters I felt anything for were Covenant and Foamfollower, and at the end of the trilogy I just didn\`t understand what had taken Donaldson so long to say, why the journey had had to be dragged out to such a seemingly lame conclusion. I am allowing for the fact that I might not have understood the whole deep meaning of the trilog! y, and so on and so forth. If this is the case, I wouldn\`t mind someone intelligent explaining their views to me, so be my guest.

This whole series is filled with fantastic philosophical insight leading one to think about matters of life and death, futility and hopefulness, and whether it is all worth it. In that respect, this series is close to being great, classic literature. It just doesn't make it, though, on two counts. One, the characters aren't quite compelling enough to really get one to react to them intellectually, morally, emotionally, etc., even though it is quite exciting that a writer would make the lead character (Covenant) a leper. Secondly, and this is my biggest problem with the series, is that it is simply very poorly written. I read it in high school, I read it in college, I read it in seminary when I was 30. I really wanted to give the series a chance, since my friends liked it so much, and I felt it deserved an attempt at different growth stages in my life. But I never enjoyed reading it, and I won't try anymore. It's not disappointing in the way of a popular mass-market book, because one doesn't expect anything from one of those except unintelligent and hollow entertainment and escapism. Donaldson created a world of amazing creativity and depth, laden with cool places and people and cultures, all quite well thought out - more so than the vast majority of fantasy-lands. The disappointment comes because a book about a leper facing his life, futility, hopelessness, narcissism, and general lack of compassion or interest in himself or anyone else could have been a deep, meaningful exploration forcing one to pause and take stock of one's own life and society (the goal of all true literature). Covenant the character could have been a brilliant (and not clich&eacute;) anti-hero. Donaldson has given us something that could have been that, but he fails to give it to us, and one is left feeling like the sickly parent who has spent the week's food money on snake-oil and finally realized what it really is - a bottle with an empty promise. Unfortunately, the story is simply not written in a compelling way. I didn't care about the characters, the dialogue felt unreal, the prose drones on and on, and I never felt bad setting the book down. In fact I really forced my way to the end of the third book, simply as an act of self-will to see if I could do it. Please note that I am *not* some doofus who thinks a book without constant action is boring - I love Joyce, German writing, Wagner operas and Philip Glass music, so it's not that I can't appreciate long, slow movement. I do like it to be compelling, though. In terms of importance in the fantasy genre, this is a must-have series because it is a foundational, common-knowledge series that all fantasy buffs should be familiar with. So I give it one star, but I tell you to read it anyway."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"You can also read my review of the series in my review of the 1st book. Basically, I just want to restate how un-impressed and how boring this un-inspiring series was. Donaldson focuses so heavily on his writing style and his portrayal of a one-dimensional self-pitying Covenant that he forgot to write a story which would captivate his audience. Instead he writes a very rudimentary, unimaginative, predictable plot with flat unbelievable characters. My suggestion is not to waste your time reading this series as I did."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"Back in the 1970's it was Donaldson and Terry Brooks who proved that an audience for the genre of fantasy existed. It was Donaldson who proved that an author could publish, sell well, and still write something of definitive literary merit. While it is indisputable that Tolkien brought the genre of fantasy into existence it was still widely regarded as something for children (something fantasy fiction still struggles with today) and it is Donaldson who first wrote something that can only be aimed at adults. The Chronicles' influence over the last three decades has been and can be traced to Eddings' Belgariad, Feist's Riftwar Saga, and any of a host of crossover fantasy novels published in the genre. It's only defect and what prevents it from receiving our highest recommendations is the patina of ugliness that Covenant inevitably breeds. It's an irony about the word because it is the ugliness of Covenant that elevates the rather routine plot into something of literary merit but at the same time it will prevent The Chronicles from being the most cherished in people's minds.WHO SHOULD READ:For anyone who has complained that fantasy novels are too lighthearted or too childlike, Donaldson has answered your complaint with a staunch challenge. His Chronicles are a gladiatorial arena where in the pit metaphysics slugs it out not in the pristine abstractions of philosophers but in the blood, sweat, and madness of the arena. It is a terrific blend of pulse-quickening action immersed in carefully constructed philosophy. Any reader versed in philosophical discourse in either free will or ethics will be profoundly moved by Covenant's struggles. At the same time, readers with no taste in philosophy whatsoever who are firmly grounded in a sense of black/white and right/wrong will be equally moved by these books because the battles and action will mean something to them rather than events occurring like so many special effects in some rotten film starring Sylvester Stallone or Jean Claude Van Damme.WHO SHOULD PASS:The reader should beware of the content. It's very popular to accuse George RR Martin of having some kind of monopoly on books where bad things happen to really good (and popular) characters. That's not the case at all: next to Donaldson he is a child. Real crimes are committed and terrible sacrifices are made and it is something that the delicate should avoid. Additionally, many readers have been upset with the dense prose and idealized setting of The Chronicles. This is something that's rather important to what the book is about but that doesn't lessen the irritation that some people feel. If you have knee-jerk (and perhaps unwarranted) reactions to overt echoes of Tolkien or have a severe allergic reactions to similes (Donaldson cannot seem to write without liberal use of simile) then you might seek elsewhere. But really, these books were a groundbreaking event in fantasy publishing and shouldn't be missed.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM"},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"Wow.Just wow.&quot;The Power that Preserves&quot; is amazing. Astonishing. Breathtaking. The sort of fantasy novel that you expect to find once a decade, if it's a particularly good decade. This is the culmination of a story that so big you can barely believe it fits in three books, so intense that it seems amazing that any person could actually have written it. It is a story you will never forget.One portion of the novels follows Lord Morham as he attempts to save the Land from total destruction in a final battle against Lord Foul's forces. The giant reaver Satansfist has Morham and the other wizards and defenders of the Land under siege at the castle of Revelstone. This contest is in amazing piece of virtuoso writing, perfectly melding several great action sequences with intense psychological passages to create something dazzling. I feel perfectly comfortable saying the Donaldson is the only fantasy author who has ever equaled Tolkien in writing battle scenes. The emotional triumph at the conclusion of this one is, well, words just can't describe it.Any lesser author would have devoted an entire book just to that. For Donaldson, however, it's just the prelude to the main event. The main event, it's no spoiler to say, is the final showdown between Thomas Covenant and Lord Foul. And what a showdown it is. When Donaldson started writing this trilogy, the most important decision he made was that his main character would not be a standard fantasy hero. Thomas Covenant, of course, is the most deeply sympathetic and real character ever to appear in any fantasy novel. Having created a person as amazing as this one, of course, poses the problem of how to provide a satisfying conclusion while still remaining true to the character. Probably nobody alive could have pulled it off as well as Donaldson, but then again no one other than Donaldson would ever have attempted a fantasy series this ambitious anyway.So in conclusion, read it, love it, be amazed by it."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"The Power That Preserves is the sequel to The Illearth War and the final novel in the first trilogy about Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever. Just as in the previous two books, Covenant returns to the Land after blacking out in the real world from an injury. Seven years have passed in the Land while only a couple days have transpired for Covenant. He finds the Land in the grip of an unnatural winter brought on by Lord Foul, whose forces have overrun most of the Land and nearly defeated all resistance. The Lords at Revelstone are the only major obstacle left for Foul to defeat, and Foul with his Illearth Stone is much more powerful than they are. Covenant's wild magic is the only hope to turn things around, but he doesn't even know how to unleash it!I gave the previous novel, The Illearth War, a five-star rating. It was excellent fantasy from beginning to end. The sequel is just as good until the ending, which is a tad weaker in comparison. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great ending: explosive, climactic, and quite satisfying. But it doesn't quite &quot;jive&quot; with how Covenant and Lord Foul have been portrayed throughout the series. So it seems a bit contrived or artificial. You'll probably know what I mean when you get there. On the other hand, you may love the ending just as much as most of the other reviewers did. Anyway, though I think the ending is the weakest part of the novel, it's still a fine close to the series and you'll enjoy it. Solid four-star material, which ain't shabby at all! I'd rate it four and a half if that rating were available.The siege against Revelstone by Lord Foul's minions is perhaps the best part of the book. High Lord Mhoram is awesome! The enemy general and his forces truly inspire dread. Covenant's long quest in the south is full of adventure too. You'll finally get to see what's become of Lena, the girl Covenant wronged in the first book. Triock plays a major role, becoming a tragic hero in one of the finest action scenes of the novel. Dead Elena (the High Lord killed in the last book) makes an appearance, though not in the guise you may expect. A couple welcome old friends from past books accompany Covenant on his quest.Characters show more variation in personality than in the previous books, in which most of them seemed like they were cast from the same mold. There are a few quite gory moments in the battles, like one memorable scene where blood is pumping around a knife stuck in somebody's chest (sorry!). Overall, this series consists of the some of the best fantasy I've ever read. It doesn't quite rank up there with the Wheel of Time series (at least the first six books of it), but it succeeds admirably for its relatively short length. Jordan could learn a few pointers from this series, as in how to tie things up neatly.Highly recommended and a must read to wrap up the first trilogy!"},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"Whether for good or ill the end is near--in his second return to the Land Thomas Covenant appears seven years after his last arrival, nearly at the end of the seven times seven years Lord Foul said would be the maximum granted to the Lords. Twice before he has striven to balance his unbelief with the needs of the Land--now it is more important than ever. High Lord Elena's rash act of summoning High Lord Kevin Landwaster broke the Law of Death and granted to Lord Foul powers beyond any he had before weilded.There is still something pure and archetypal about the Land. The Lords devote themselves to life and its growth while the Despiser, Lord Foul surrounds himself with death and corruption. This is no mere consequence of the ages old struggle for dominance of the Land, it is the character of the Land. Donaldson has woven a picture of an epic struggle that is more than just good versus evil.There is nothing straightforward about Thomas Covenant and his journies through the land. Each step forward is painful for the Unbeliever as he causes pain to those around him. However, as he discovers the truth of his unbelief and the white gold's power so too the reader will experience the journey, perhaps on the edge of their seat.This excellent conclusion to The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeleiver isn't formulaic, it isn't predictable and like Hobbes the tiger (Calvin's toy or companion?) we may never know the truth of The Land."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"Time in the Land has made Covenant out of place in any world. The fruits of his actions haunt him, and his search for peace drives him to the brink of death, a thing that would make too many people witout hearts rejoice. Yet, his heart has been cured of leprosy, even if his body is sicker than ever. So, when he has the chance to save a child, he takes the risk of condemning the Land to save her. Then, he is given the chance to rectify his error and is taken to the Land to find it changed. The Bloodguard and Giants are no more, the girl who loved him is old and insane. It's now or never for the Unbeliever to face Lord Foul, but with a heart so filled with lornness, how can he fight despair incarnate?This book is another winner, one that reminds us that hope always lives."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"After the indecision and angst experienced by Thomas Covenant in Lord Foul's Bane and The Illearth War, it is very refreshing to see him (at least partially) resolve his conflict and move to action in this, the conclusion to the first Thomas Covenant trilogy.The action begins when Covenant returns to our world immediately following the events at the conclusion of The Illearth War. Filled with agony over his perceived failures and inaction in the Land (trying not to spoil the plot here), he wanders in suffering through the woods behind his house for a few days, only to be summoned yet again to the Land, where seven years have passed since he was there (time passes differently in the Land than in the &quot;real&quot; world). By this time, the Lords have been reduced to only controlling their fortress of Revelstone, which is beseiged by the forces of Lord Foul, who holds the rest of the Land in his grip. Through several lucky circumstances, both in our world and the Land, Covenant is outside Revelstone and free to act. At first, he is afraid to do anything due to his inner conflicts and the demands of his leprosy, as in the first two books. But, after he sees and experiences the results of Lord Foul's depradations on the Land, he decides to finally take positive action to destroy Lord Foul and attempt to purge his guilt once and for all.As before, Donaldson proves his mastery of characterization in the peoples that Covenant encounters in his adventures. The Lords Trevor, Loerya, and Amatin are all fleshed out fully after their brief introductions in The Illearth War. Also used effectively are a trio of tragic figures from Lord Foul's Bane: the villagers Trell, Triock, and Lena, who is the ultimate focus of most of Covenant's guilt and pain. The Haruchai Bannor, who has some guilt and pain of his own, is present, as is the valorous, guilt-filled, but ultimately heroic Giant, Saltheart Foamfollower. But the most powerful and compelling figure in the whole book is the awesome High Lord Mhoram, whose struggles to defeat the forces of Lord Foul and save Revelstone, while attempting to aid Covenant in any way he can, make this book the page-turner that it is. The battle between Mhoram and the leader of Foul's army is the most epic clash of wills I have read about in a book since Gandalf the Wizard faced down the Lord of the Nazgul at the gates of Minas Tirith. It's that good.While Donaldson leaves vague the question of whether Covenant is actin out of concern for the Land or merely his desire to end what he feels is a guilt-induced halucination, the final confrontation with Lord Foul and the end of Covenant's adventure in the Land (for now) is very satisfying. The trilogy as a whole seems to state that we all carry our personal guilts and burdens over our sins, both of commission and omission. However, as flawed and guilty as we all are, we all have the capablity to overcome our shortcomings and make a difference for good in the world. It's a powerful message that we all need to hear. No fan of fantasy, or great literature in general, should fail to read this trilogy, as well as it's sequel. Donaldson is one of the VERY few writers of fantasy out there whose work will, I feel, evetually stand alongside The Lord of the Rings as monumental literary classics."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"By now, the reader is quite familiar with the deus ex machina conceit of Covenant's entering the Land by losing consciousness in the \`real' world. Tired, angry, increasingly physically/psychologically diseased, and ill equipped for the journey, Covenant nevertheless dares to venture into the heart of darkness and destroy Lord Foul in this, the final addition to the First Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever series.A good portion of the book divides itself into two threads: the siege of Revelstone, led by Foul's top minion, Satansfist; and Covenant's progress towards Foul's Creche. The text skilfully skips from one to another, treading the delicate line of taking the sufficient time to develop each plot, but not lingering too long where we lose our interest in/recollection of the other story. I particularly enjoyed the latter thread; Covenant runs into some rather unique situations and characters, foremost amongst these being the dolorous \`soft people,' the jheherrin. Again, however, as is wont in much of the Covenant story arc, there are many (unintentional?) references to the Lord of the Rings. Here we have the man with a powerful ring that secretly journeys through the evil part of the land, entering a volcanic mountain with the help of an altruistic friend, resulting in a climactic showdown. Perhaps such references are unavoidable, as Tolkien essentially developed the fantasy template that successive authors drew upon.The Power that Preserves unfortunately did not maintain the momentum, excitement, and scope of its predecessor, The Illearth War, which was the best book of the three. The pacing is more plodding and deliberate than the chaotic sequence of events that made the Illearth War such a blast to read. At times, it seems as if Donaldson is running out of steam and holding on for dear life to reach the end. And once the conclusion did arrive, I contentedly closed the book, without any further desire to revisit or reconsider what I read. Although enjoyable, and well written, the Power that Preserves ultimately fails to tap into the seemingly inexhaustible supply of verve and creativity that made its predecessors such bright stars in the fantasy constellation."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"The first trilogy of \\"Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever\\" was Donaldson's initial opus and launched him to immediate consideration of public & critics.One great thing about this trilogy is that it was conceived as a whole and complete work. The other Covenant's trilogies were product of editors, market and public pressure exerted on Donaldson to continue writing adventure using this great scenery.What do I mean with this comment? Well...that reader won't be disappointed with an open end as some time occurs with sagas &series.;Donaldson's proposal is quite risky.The main character is a sick man unable to compromise with the fantastic universe that deploys before him. The reader will certainly not identify with Covenant's sour & bitter personality.Nevertheless a powerful story is constructed over this implausible pillar!\\"The Power That Preserves\\" is the third and closing volume of the trilogy and I strongly recommend reading the first two volumes before start reading this one. It is true that the author provides a two page summary of what happened before, nevertheless The Land scenery & characters is too complex to be understood with that intro only, and the reader risk to get confused and even bored.The tale is as follows: after a second return to our own world, Thomas is recalled to the Land. Yet this time he is able to refuse returning and when he effectively and almost voluntarily returns there is a subtle difference: Covenant is in his own skewed way compromises with the Land.This time a malignant unnatural Winter froze the Land and the soul of its inhabitants. Lord's Keep is under siege. The Giants are annihilated. The Rhiannon are decimated and the Ramen are frenzied. Stonedownors are dispersed and thrown into wilderness. Bloodguard disbanded. Ur-viles, ghouls and wicked Foul's armies are free and destroying everything.From this starting point two main & parallel stories evolve.One line follows the defense of Lord's Keep.The other line follows Covenant and his small band attempting the impossible: reaching Foul's Cr&egrave;che and confronting the Evil one in person.In this third volume of the saga each character will be confronted with its own past acts and their consequences. Each of them should pay the highest price and will reach a point of supreme decision.IMHO this volume is the best in the trilogy. There are not only adventures tales in this book, there are ethical & philosophical issues to be solved by characters and readers!It is great book that may be enjoyed by fantasy fans and general public as well! But remember read Book One and Two first!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"Donaldson keeps on getting better and better. The Power That Preserves is powerfully made with such a fantastic scope of character depth and the Land's diminishing beauty.Thomas Covenant is once again summoned to the Land, still struggling with his hatred, love, and Unbelief. Covenant thinks the Land is but a dream, yet after so much pain and destruction made to the Land, he resolves to journey Lord Foul's Creche and put him down. Meanwhile, Lord Mhoram and his fellow Lords are being sieged by a horrendously larger and much more terrifying host of Lord Foul's creatures, including possibly the most powerful of the Ravers. After Troy's sacrifice, the Warwards's power has been tanked, and the Lords's lore is considerably low in strength. Their only hope is the white gold power of Covenant's paradoxical ring, the power that he STILL does not know how to control.From start to finish, Donaldson engages us in tenser battle sequences, gradual character developments, and the smallest hopes for the Land's survival. The final battle was especially satisfying, leaving me with a hunger for more of Thomas Covenant and his seemingly hopeless adventures."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"The outcast is back for a third time and this time he is pissed.

He has extended his prose into the third novel, THe Power that Preserves. It is impossible not to read the final chapter of this epic work known as the 1st Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever. Characters such as Saltheart and Bannor and Mhoram make this tale multi-dimensional. The Land is in trouble and once again Covenent is called upon. How Covenent cannot answer the call breaks my heart. This is only momentary, because he indeed desides to roll up his sleeves and join in the fight against despair. THere is no better chronicles or trilogies on the face of the planet. Kudos Donaldson! Hooray Stephen R! Covenant for President! Excellent read and worth every minute."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"I read this book years ago and still to this day I remember it vividly.

I really liked this trilogy a lot and felt this book summed things up well. I enjoyed the fact that a number of characters from the past reappeared (Saltheart Foamfollower, Elena, etc) to tie things up. This book/series is different than other fantasy novels I've read because it has a lot of human emotion in it (despair) and also ties in the present day world with the fantasy world. In fact, even at the end of the series you are not quite sure whether the events actually occured to Thomas Covenent. My only complaint about the series is that, although the themes of despair and fear are important to the story the author spends too much time on them. I also got a little sick about hearing all the time how TC was a leper and why didn't everyone else understand that. This seemed to pop up every 10 pages or so. In any case, I recommend this book &amp; the entire 1st Thomas Covenent trilogy wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"The Power That Preserves (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 3)","review":"The 'Power That Preserves' was a wonderful book.

When he returns to the Land he finds that seven years have passed and the Land is in dire straits as Lord Foul has besieged the Lords at Revelstone and the Land is permanently in winter.This is the best of the first trilogy as the various threads are brought together and concluded. As well Covenant has lost almost all his bitterness and has come to terms with the land even if he still does not believe its reality. The parallels between Covenant's health and the well being of the land is most explicit in this book- Lord Foul is the leprosy of the Land and if Covenant can 'cure' the land then Covenant can if not cure his own leprosy at least come to terms with it.

The series really went deep, and engrossed me.I'm not going to go into details on what the book is about. You can read the editorial review, or other people's review. Let's just say that Covenant is back to the land, and he's going to fight the land's archnemesis, Lord Foul the Despiser, face to face.The biggest reason I liked this series was because it was so original. The unusual hero who doesn't believe the existence of the \\"Land\\", and who doesn't know how to use the power that he presumably holds. This unbelief seems to be his strength and weakness; the eye of the paradox.The only thing I didn't like about this book was that Donaldson kept reminding the reader that Covenant is a leper. Covenant also kept repeating \\"Leper, outcast, unclean!\\", and shouted it at just about every character in the book. Even though the repeated phrase made the problem of Covenant more real, it also made the reader frustrated because of his unbelief.All in all, this is a very good book, never minding the minor flaw that Donaldson made. You should really read this book if you are a fantasy reader, or you are going to regret it.P.S. by the way, the second chronicles are just as good as the first one, maybe even better that it.

Through description of hunting a variety of wild birds in the midwestern U.S., author C. Stanley Mason teaches the reader a philospophy of hunting that values wild birds and places; challenges; uncertainty; simplicity and tradition. Nine essays explore hunting ethics, historical changes in land use, government farm subsidies, the decline of some gamebirds, and the place of predators. This is not a detailed how-to book for the beginner. It is a solid contribution to the 21st Century bird hunting literature. I am glad to have had the opportunity to read this book, and I would give it to a friend.We are treated to 179 pages of stories of hunting pheasants, quail, dove, ducks, ruffed grouse, woodcock, turkey and snow geese from Kansas to Iowa, Minnesota and the Dakotas. Most of the hunts focus on one hunter and one dog, but some include friends or whole gangs of hunters. Game preserves are mentioned as venues to train dogs and shoot at birds but not as places to hunt.The wind is portrayed as a sort of riverine spiritual entity, and together with the prairie it forms a unifying theme of the book. Author Mason carefully layers some of the stories, and his eye is sensitive enough to invite us to see grace in faces, settings and actions that seem familiar. The book includes a few simple drawings of gamebirds, a feather, a dog, and a hunter holding a shotgun. There is also a brief foreward by Michael McIntosh, a very well-known hunting writer.The book ranges from laugh-out-loud humorous when describing the follies of hunting companion Walt to tear-renderingly beautiful in a final story that covers life, death and renewal with the familiarity and engagement of a local legend.Occasionally the philosophy wanders a bit, as on page 131, \\"With the geographic expansion of my consciousness has come a heightened sensibility toward the darkness of my world and others, and with this sensibility has come a dying like that of immigrant trees.\\" This is contemporary literature not a collection of the sort of simple hunting tales that could be found in a 1950's hunting magazine."},{"Title":"Voices on the Wind","review":"This is a beautifully written book, even for the non-hunter. Mason really knows how to draw you into his story and he artfully folds in history, biology and philosophy to tell his tales.

Six meditations deal respectively of the hero as: Divinity, Prophet, Poet, Priest, Man of Letters, and King. If this book can't rightly be shelved with philosophy or history, it belongs in Literature with a capital &quot;L,&quot; and Poetry. Carlylye loved the English Language and used it masterfully, energetically, and reverentially, without a trace of the trivial overindulgence of self-conscious and self-absorbed &quot;poets.&quot;"},{"Title":"On Heroes, hero-worship and the heroic in history","review":"Six lectures delivered by Carlyle in 1840. He classifies six kinds of heroes: as Divinity (Wotan, paganism); Prophet (Mohamed); Poet (Dante, Shakespeare); Priest (Luther, Knox); Man of Letters (Johnson, Rousseau, Burns); and Ruler (Cromwell, Napoleon). The trait that defines a hero is: absolute sincerity and firm belief in his principles.In his highly rhetorical lectures, Carlyle highlights and reinforces the role of the individual in the social process, as opposed to the role of the masses. And he did that precisely when the foundations were being laid for the most influential &quot;pro-mass&quot; movement in History: Marxism. The tragedy of Marxism, at least one of them all, is that, when translated into action, the blind masses were also led by &quot;heroes&quot; of the most authocratic sort. Not properly the work of an historian, these lectures are vivid, inflamed and enthusiast. Their uselfuness for our present age is precisely that they remind us of the crucial role significant individuals play in history, to accelerate or slow down (and even reverse) the process of social change, which is usually more gradual, diffused, and diverse."},{"Title":"On Heroes, hero-worship and the heroic in history","review":"This is an extraordinary work, let modern liberal critics say what they will of their 'mass movements' and 'diversity'. Long after they and their productions have bitten the dust, Carlyle will continue to speak to the enlightened few, and perhaps one day, it is to be hoped, to the enlightened many.This work is much more than just a study of various influential men in history. Carlyle has very interesting notions of the historical process itself, the spread of religions and their demise, the importance of \\"true belief\\" in things, as opposed the unbelief that merely follows rituals and procedures. For Carlyle, true belief, is the beginning of morality, all success, all good things in this world; Unbelief, scepticism, the beginning of all corruption, quackery, falsehood.Unbelief, for instance, is at the root of all materialist philosophies, eg Utilitarianism which find human beings to be nothing more than clever, pleasure-seeking bipeds. It is also at the root of all democratic theories: faith in a democratic system means despair of finding an honest man to lead us.Whether one agrees with Carlyle or not in his appraisal of democratic and other systems, one must admit, at least, that very little good is to be gotten from \\"the checking and balancing of greedy knaveries.\\" If we have no honest men in government or in business, but only a bunch of self-interested quacks, then we cannot expect any system, however ingenious, to save us. Even the most skilled architect will not be able to construct a great building, if you give him only hollow, cracked bricks to build it with. Find your honest men, says Carlyle, and get them into the positions of influence; only then will it be well with you."},{"Title":"On Heroes, hero-worship and the heroic in history","review":"There are not many books sold at Amazon.com that were written almost two centuries ago. There might be a few written a few millenniums ago but they are mostly translations. There is something special when one reads the spoken word untranslated. Only in its original form, words have the mysterious effect that let the reader have a special connection with the author.Carlyle was Scottish and lived in England, but he had close relations with the \\"New World\\" and had readers in United States. He had a lifelong friendship with an influential American Philosopher, Ralph Waldo Emerson. At his time, there were not many philosophers who witnessed the industrial revolution but still kept a transcendental and not a materialistic view of the world. In the 19th century, Materialism was in full swing, and the people in the West were mesmerized by the scientific technological advances of the times and running away from God like herds of cattle, just like the way intellectuals of the East did a century later. Carlyle, Emerson, Thoreau and a few others were the only exceptions in the West that still tried to keep what is beyond the \\"apparent\\" in focus or at least in search of it. Bediuzzaman tried to do the same with the voice of Qur'an and called the people to what is beyond the apparent in the face of materialism in the East in the 20th century. One interesting observation I have to point out, is that one common theme among these Western Philosophers; many were all influenced by Emanuel Swedenborg, famous 18th century Swedish PhilosopherIn Heroes and Hero Worship Thomas Carlyle makes an attempt to draw a picture of the development of human intellect by using historical people as coordinates. There are people who has a perspective of history in terms of \\"environment\\" and \\"times\\" and \\"causes\\" while others like Carlyle has the view that human advancement was not continues but discrete and these jumps were mainly due to specific individuals he calls \\"Heroes\\". This is like the wave - particle duality of the \\"nature of light\\". In some phenomenon Light behaves like a wave in others like a particle. One can write a history based on ideas, cultures and mediums in which people lived, or the same history could be written by taking certain individuals and following them and their actions.Writings of many other authors of that time and Carlyle's of course are very perceptive. Carlyle does not really care to be objective on the matter. He has an idea and he wants to tell you that idea and when telling you what that idea is, he uses whatever his hands and mind get hold of. Being so passionate about what you are telling is probably a good thing. But if one overdoes it, one cannot help but show wild swings in appreciation of the historical person in question. If we use the drawing analogy, his historical person becomes no longer a point on the painting but a thread on the brush. But that should not prevent us from benefiting from his writings.Muhammad (PBUH) has a special place in the book under the chapter title \\"Hero as a Prophet\\". In the book Carlyle declares his admiration of Muhammad (PBUH). Carlyle's answers to pointed questions on Islam and Muhammad (PBUH) showed interesting similarities to Bediuzzaman's line of answers to similar questions. ......Considering the fact that while the West and East were at odds and the means of communications were quite inferior to our times, seeing Carlyle having such an open mind to the \\"other\\" puts him in a category of his own with others like Swedenborg, Emerson and Thoreau. I think when we are trying to build bridges between the peoples of the West and the East we should not overlook these early historical representatives of that dialogue, as Bediuzzaman foresees in his writings."},{"Title":"Oswald Bastable and Others","review":"Before magic and fantasy was the rage, there was Edith Nesbit.

Because of this, the book for Year C concentrates primarily on the texts of the gospel of Luke. Before getting into the heart of the texts, Reid presents introductory material on parables, preaching, and the gospel of Luke. Reid states in her introduction, \`In the Synoptic Gospels, Jesus rarely explains his parables. They are meant to be wrestled with by each generation of hearers who allow themselves to be disturbed and challenged by Jesus' subversive stories.'Subversive stories? One of the things that comfortable Christianity has sometimes forgotten is the revolutionary and radical character of Jesus and his teaching in the first century. Perhaps this is because the teachers are so familiar. How does one find new meanings in familiar parables that show up again and again? This is a particularly important question for preachers, and Reid addresses it directly.The term \`parable' can refer to a range of types of speech - it goes beyond the simple moral stories similar to Aesop's fables. As Reid says of the gospel of Luke, it can be considered \`a narrative of the events that have fulfilled among us.' Parables are a significant part of this narrative.Jesus, of course, was not the first to preach or teach in parables. In doing this, he was following an ancient and honoured tradition. This is a tradition that may be continued by modern teachers and preachers. Reid illustrates several ways in which parables serve to carry a message. They provide a way for Jesus to explain his experience of God and holiness without boxing it into academic or dogmatic statements. It helps connect the encounter with the holy with the common people and their daily lives. \`In his parables, Jesus always began with the familiar. The images and situations he painted in his stories were from the fabric of daily life of his audience.'Of course, Jesus' parables were broad and inclusive - nothing was outside the scope of God's realm. While parables began with the familiar, they never lingered there. They served to recast \`common' creation in a new way - the realm of God. Of course, this then begs for interpretation, which is never as straightforward and simple as some preachers would have it seem. \`What catches up with the hearer is that Jesus' parables are usually open-ended; Jesus rarely interpreted these stories for his disciples.... Because they are told in figurative language, the parables are capable of conveying distinct message to different people in diverse circumstances.'Other aspects of parables that are key to their meaning include that they are not neutral, but always have a slant or bias, often toward the more marginal in society. They are a communal endeavour, and not really meant for individualists (something that Western society tends to forget). Parables are short, which makes for easier recollection - they are small like seeds, from which much may grow. Also, the final aspect of parables is similar to that of preaching - they are meant to be heard and lived, not simply forgotten.Understanding how to interpret parables involves several things Reid highlights. They involve understanding the gospels themselves, in their own setting. The nature of the gospels is important - what kind of writing is this, and what is its purpose? Parables fall within gospel literature, so yet another level of understanding is required. Reid gives a quick overview of different modes of interpretation, including allegorical, historical criticism, social science study, linguistic and literary approaches, as well as the new forms of liberation interpretation. Reid is quick to underscore that \`no one method provides the definitive key.' These methods are guides, but ultimately we are all charged with engaging the parables for ourselves and our communities.As this text deals with the gospel of Luke, Reid continues with a chapter looking at the gospel of Luke, from issues of authorship, historical and social setting, documentary transmission and analysis, theological issues and overall purpose. The theological ideas of scripture, prayer, relationships, Christology and spirit vary from gospel to gospel, as do some of the texts of the same stories. Reid states that, \`Luke claims to have investigated everything carefully from the beginning, with the purpose of writing an orderly account in which he wants his hearer to \\"realise the certainty of the teachings you have received\\".'The remainder of the book looks at particular parables, twenty five in all, as they appear sequentially in the liturgical year. There is a chapter devoted to each one. These include parables both in the Sunday lectionary as well as the daily cycle of readings. Each section gives attention to major images, theological themes, narrative devsices, and a helpful list of preaching possibilities. This book does not provide set sermons, nor does it emphasise one theological approach exclusive to others.Overall, this book is a very handy guide to anyone who reads the gospels, who is interested in preaching, or is interested in understanding more about one of the primary teaching/preaching devices of Jesus. Reid writes with clarity, sensitivity and care on her subjects. While she does tend toward a liberal interpretation of scripture, even evangelical and fundamentalists can find inspiration here, given that parables have never been meant to have literal interpretations placed upon them, and the multi-valent character of parables practically begs for as broad a range as possible for study. To that end, Reid has provided a generous bibliography for further research.A joyful finding, indeed."},{"Title":"My First Body Book","review":"I gave this book to my daughter who is 4 because she started asking me all sorts of questions about how the body works.

I wanted to find out what happened to the main characters....but I find I was never truly interested in their outcome. Felicia (the main character) in particular was a naive and simple character that lacked any depth at all.One of the reasons that I didn't like the book was simply the authors style. As one reviewer put it, &quot;Trevor's style is internal and introspective, and has an almost Joycean time perspective&quot;.Well, that is a clever way to put it. Trevor delves into the main characters pasts while trying to keep you interested in the present storyline. This sounds like a great literary feat. However, it is not a style that I care for.It was supposed to be a true page turner, and a psychological thriller. That is why I picked the book up in the first place. I have read many books that keep me glued to the next page, and books that I cannot read alone in the house. But this book is not one of them.If you are looking for a true thriller about a psychotic, try Mary Higgins Clarks, &quot;Loves Music Loves to Dance&quot;... that is a thriller that will keep you reading.

Her meeting of one Mr. Hilditch, the head caterer at one of town?s several factories, brings the poor girl?s already troubled life to a harrowing peril of both the physical and moral sorts.Trevor?s somnambular style glides us through a fallen dreamscape studded with flashbacks in a manner that almost exempts him of the empathetic anguish inflicted upon the reader. Almost. Indeed, Trevor?s national allegory is so grief ridden, so utterly bleak that it is difficult to appreciate the merits of this work. Felicia is so painfully nave that it becomes difficult to sympathize with her even as she is dragged through exhaustive turmoil. The audience?s hope in redemption is dashed like waves against the very shore upon which Felicia lands. So used to such incessant emotional torment is the reader that the climax fails to impress. Trevor leaves us unnecessarily jaded, allowing one final glimmer of hope only to have it washed away in the tide. As such, this reader finds it necessary to give Mr. Trevor a generous four thumbs up (out of a possible ten)."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"The kindest description of this book would be that it is well-written and quite pointless. The plot is paper thin and all the characters (with the possible exception of Mr Hilditch) are either two dimensional or borrowed from other, more superior, works. The much-touted plot twist, when it finally arrives, lacks any irony and seems contrived. William Trevor is best known as a short story writer and this book is essentially a short story padded into a novel. As a well-written, mildly diverting, piece of light entertainment it would have been acceptable, as a prize-winning piece of high literary pretensions, it is not. Dickens, Poe, even Highsmith have succeeded much better in what Trevor seeks to achieve."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"I found the basic idea of the book to be excellent and very true to life, however, I cannot say the same for the characters, Felicia in particular. Beyond her frustration, we are never privy to any of her emotions. What did she think of her plight? Why did she never worry that Johnny, her lover, might reject her? I feel that the author made a mistake by never writing in Felicia's viewpoint during her scenes with Mr. Hilditch. We certainly know many of his feeling and thoughts concerning Felicia, but never, never any of her thoughts about her sinister friend. ...The character of Mr. Hilditch is very well developed, unfortunately more so than the main character. I felt that too much of the book (one quarter) was devoted to Mr. Hilditch's downward spiral. It almost becomes a completely different story.As a previous reviewer mentioned, the author's practice on going back and the forth between past and present was confusing."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"This is an intriguing book of psychological suspense for which its author was the recipient of the 1994 Whitbread Award.

Of course, the expected ensues, and after Johnny has left Ireland and returned to England where he ostensibly works, Felicia is left holding the bag. Her disapproving father suspects Johnny of actually being in the British Army and, thus, a traitor to his own. He also has a few choice words for his daughter, now that she is in the family way, and none of it is flattering. So, Felicia leaves her rural village and her family and goes off in search of Johnny, having nothing more than the vaguest of ideas where he might be.She crosses the Irish Sea and arrives in the English Midlands in the industrial city of Birmingham, as she believes Johnny to be working in a lawn mower factory there. In her search for Johnny, she runs into the portly catering manager for one of the local factories. His name is Joseph Ambrose Hilditch, and he is outwardly a jovial and agreeable man, well-liked by his co-workers and meticulous about his culinary repasts. He lives in solitary splendor in the large house in which he grew up. The house is cluttered with collectibles but well- kept, although decorated in the style of a bygone era. Mr. Hilditch is, indeed, a collector, but his collection is initially far beyond Felicia's imaginings. In fact, Mr. Hilditch has a darker side to him, which is not immediately discernible by the unwary.When Felicia first meets Mr. Hilditch, it is to ask for information, but something about her catches Mr. Hilditch's fancy, and he finds himself keeping Felicia in his crosshairs. When Felicia seemingly unexpectedly runs into Mr. Hilditch again, he directs her to lodgings, and so it begins. As Mr. Hilditch insinuates himself ever so slowly into her life, weaving a fantasy about his own life that is sure to put her mind at ease about him. Felicia begins finding herself ensnared by this ostensibly kind and ever so helpful, avuncular man, and she initially fails to see the darkness that lies at the core of his being.The author begins the book with Felicia's journey to England in search of her lover. Using flashbacks throughout the story, the author fills in Felicia's background and describes the events that have brought her to the point of making this journey. When Mr. Hilditch is introduced to the reader, the author begins to take the reader into the recesses of his mind, allowing the reader to see what Felicia initially fails to see, the duplicity and cunning that is masked by his overt geniality. Like a spider to the fly, Mr. Hilditch begins laying his trap, and so Felicia's journey thrusts her into the belly of the beast.With his carefully cadenced prose, the author explores the darker corners of the human psyche, and in the mind of Mr. Hilditch, it is dark, indeed. As his carefully constructed psychological house of cards begins to fall, there are unspeakable revelations as to what lies at the heart of Mr. Hilditch's predilection, and it is not pretty. The author, in taking the reader into the recesses of the mind of each of the two protagonists, tries to explain how it is that each of these two flawed human beings were able initially to achieve a connection with another, only to find ostensible betrayal. What is decidedly different is the way that they each cope with that betrayal.There is no happily-ever-after ending to this story, which culminates with a conclusion that is quite bleak, robbing the reader of some satisfaction. Fans of Ruth Rendell, however, will very much appreciate the psychological cat and mouse game that is played throughout and will enjoy the author's foray into this genre. As always, the author pens a novel that provides much food for thought on many levels, and the use of the word journey in the title of the book has a much broader meaning within the context of the story.

We know from the beginning that she is on a fruitless task - she has been used, abused and discarded. On her search, she is 'befriended' by a creepy man who portends trouble and worse for Felicia. The book is peopled by religious fanatics, homeless eccentridw who come alive during the night and it is always surprising to recognize the naivity and innocence of Felicia. Despite the horrors and depravity that the book allude to, Trevor never gets into the bloody details that an author such as Stephen King savors. The same monstrosities are here but they are alluded to and left to our imagination, our ability to call forth our own personal monsters and give them literary life."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"With elements of Faulkner's Light in August, young Irish Felicia sets out on a journey to find the father of the baby growing inside her. With the same determination as Faulkner's young woman, she seems convinced the father loves her and did not mean to leave without giving her his address. She soon falls into the clutches of Hilditch, whose dark past is eventually revealed. Rich with imagery of flowers and food, the novel shows Hilditch to be a character who wants to consume everything he can to try to fill the void of his empty life. The novel turns out to be more than a twisted detective type novel as it reveals itself to be an allegory for the relations between the patriarchal, dominating England and the poorer, more desperate Ireland. Felicia's own great grandmother becomes a symbol of Irish pride as she, like the legend of her husband who was a revolutionary, seems to outlive everyone else. Furthermore, it is an interesting and often truthful story about a single pregnant woman making a journey to England for the possibility of an abortion or a way to make money since abortions are illegal in Ireland and jobs are scarce. Written only two years after the X case, where a fourteen year old Irish girl involved the world in her need for an abortion, this novel has more than one major relevancy to today's politics."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"In Felicia's Journey, William Trevor explores an unconventional relationship betwen a young pregnant Irish girl seeking her boyfriend and an established but lonesome man with peculiar and suspect behaviors. To Felicia, Mr. Hilditch becomes a caring fatherly figure who despite the uneasiness that he sometimes produces helps her throughout her search. To Mr. Hilditch, Felicia is a vehicle by which he can relate to an outside world that he has failed at on his own, and only by misdirecting her, can he keep her close enough to buffer his own insecurities. Though Felicia and Mr. Hilditch operate with extremely different motivations, Trevor examines their respective viewpoints based on the despair that fuels both of their troubles. He oscillates between both point of views, uncovering the different sides of fear in Felicia and Mr. Hilditch's relationship. At times, the jumping back and forth can be jarring and distracting, but often it reveals chilling insight into their behavior and creates an unrelenting suspense throughout the story. Trevor has invented a collision between two people from different walks of life, and it is curious that even though their meeting is accidental it may become the determining factor in each of their lives."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"Brilliant Book. This is not about some creepy serial killer or the Bad jack the ripper versus poor girls book. The book has two central characters, both of them with some glaring weaknesses. Felicia with her naive trust and stubborn belief makes one feel that she deserves all that she is getting. But as the book progresses, her character gets better and better with the end leaving you gasping. At the other end, Hilditch's character is very nicely sketched too. As one reviewer said, here is an &quot;evil&quot; without being Wilful.Don't miss it. The prose is exquisite, the suspense is chilling, the ending .. welll.. read it.-Raj"},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"He must be one of the greatest contemporary writers we have. William Trevor is one I most of all have admired for his short stories and essays, but with Felicia\`s Journey he has written a novel with such energy, tension and a well-crafted plot, that it must surely be regarded as one of the absolutely best books of the 1990s. Every time I look back on Felicia\`s Journey I happen to think of Charles Dickens at his best. This book belongs in every literature lovers bookshelf, next to Trevor\`s collected short stories."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"There are only two real characters in this drama, narrated in Trevor's usual spare, sparse style that puts you into the heart of things. There's Felicia, a somewhat plain teenage girl from a depressed industrial town in the Irish Republic. She's the product of a convent school, but only on suffrance because her father tends the convent's gardens. She's inexperienced and naive and when Johnny Lysaght comes along and turns her head, her subsequent pregnancy is no surprise. And there's Mr. Hilditch, a fifty-something catering manager at a factory in the English Midlands, who lives by himself and fancies young girls, though he's very careful &quot;not to shop near home,&quot; as he thinks of it. Felicia runs away from home in search of the absent Johnny, but she finds it's not easy even to survive, much less to locate an errant Irishman, in England. She's a bit suspicious of Hilditch when he tries to help her out, but he arranges things to reduce her options, and Felicia is suddenly in very great danger indeed. Trevor does a terrific job getting inside the head of a pleasant, mild-mannered psychopath, allowing the reader to gradually understand what makes him tick. He won the Whitbread Prize (again) for this novel and he deserved it."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"There's a strong Hitchcock feel to this novel, as well as &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. One can't help but be impressed by William Trevor's delicate handling of his characters, and his superb build-up of suspense. Weaving them together, and constantly holding back information, he depicts a depth portrait of humanity that is at once devastating and real. He questions whether evil people are intrinsically that way, or whether they are shaped by consequence, and emotion. William Trevor is a master in his prose, and the brilliance of the tension never ceases to revolve around the novel."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"Warning: Do not read further if you plan to read the book.&quot;Felicia's Journey&quot; is a downer. While there is nothing intrinsically wrong with this, many &quot;down&quot; books can be uplifting and even illuminating. Think &quot;Sophie's Choice&quot; or &quot;Enemies: A Love Story,&quot; and see what I mean. Though well written, &quot;Felcia's Journey&quot; tells an all too familiar story of two lost characters who come together by chance, and the resulting conseqences. Trevor's style is internal and introspective, and has an almost Joycean time perspective, as we learn things about Felicia's and Mr, Hilditch's pasts right in the midst of the present time situations. This device and Trevor's language is skillfully informative, telling us not only about the cultural ethos of working class Ireland, but the loneliness and isolation leading to the emergence of a psychologically aberrant personality. And to a point the reader can sympathize with both characters. But Trevor also maintains a distance, which may please some, but left too much unanswered. For instance-- how does Felica escape? And just why is it she, of all the girls, who has such a profound effect on Hilditch? And why should it drive him to take his life, and how does he do it? Lastly, will Felicia spend book eternity endlessly jouneying? What is the point? Perhaps I am too outcome conscious, but there was more I wanted to know than was given. &quot;Felicia's Journey&quot; will soon be released as a film. I shall be curious to see how this threadbare text is expanded and dramatized for the screen. Trevor's novel is skillful and stylized, yet manages to miss the mark."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"Psychopathic predator preys on naive, desperate, young woman searching for the boyfriend who deserted her and her unborn child. At first I thought that was pretty much going to be the gist of Felicia's Journey, with perhaps some literary embellishments thrown in to dress it up. After a couple of chapters I began to be drawn in by the way the author was steadily revealing more and more about the two main characters by sharing with us their thoughts and memories. About halfway through I realized I was hooked and that this book was much subtler and deeper than I had first thought. It becomes a steadily more intense study of obsession, delusion, and self-deception, not only of predator but also prey. One aspect of the novel that added interest for me was its depiction of the manners and culture of the English and Irish. In her native Ireland Felicia receives no help or sympathy from anyone,including her family. In England she is constantly subjected to rudeness, contempt or indifference at the hands of salesclerks, policemen and other functionaries whose job it should be to render assistance. The entire environment seems to be alien and hostile. Practically the only kindness shown to Felicia is by street people and the predator, Mr. Hilditch, who despite his sinister intentions, actually shows a certain amount of genuine concern for Felicia's predicament. Though I found the developing story fascinating in its continuing revelation of deeper facets of character, I was prepared for it to end either in a very negative, unsatisfying way, or a positive, unbelievable way. I will only say that I thought the ending was somewhat surprising and unconventional, but some may still find it unsatisfying. More than just a suspense story, this seemed to me also a meditation on the different manifestations or expressions of humanity; the extremes of good and evil, and the mixtures in between; the shattering surprises that may come with self-revelation; and how an awful and austere state of grace can come as a result of loss and suffering. I would have rated it five stars except it seemed to me that in a few places there was a very subtle lack of credibility. But I liked the style of writing, and certainly recommend the book, although it reveals a phase of life not too pleasant to contemplate."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"William Trevor's FELICIA's JOURNEY is a short novel that delivers a great deal. The title character, Felicia, is a teenager from Ireland to whom life has not been kind. When we first meet her she's been laid off from a job in a canning factory, and is keeping house for her not particularly caring widowed father, two older brother and her ancient great grandmother. We learn Felicia has always been considered gawky and has not had much male attention leaving her prime to be seduced by Johnny, a young man from her home town who has immigrated to England but is home on a brief visit to his bitter mother. Not surprisingly Johnny leaves town and Felicia discovers herself pregnant. Desperate but still believing Johnny cares for her Felicia steals money from her great grandmother for fare and other necessities and takes a ferry to England to search for her seducer. It soon becomes obvious to the reader and eventually to Felicia that Johnny has lied to her on several levels. Felicia soon is befriended by the other major character in the novel, Mr. Hilditch, and the suspense/thriller aspect of the novel begins. Horrible as some of the things Mr. Hilditch has done are he is not a character we are without sympathy for especially after we discover some horrors in his own past. Some may say Felicia is somewhat of a blank but we know so much about her family circumstances and training in Ireland that we can pretty much guess what she is thinking and feeling without being explicitly told. This is a dark but expertly crafted read with an unexpected but still unhappy end for the heroine."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"This is an intriguing book of psychological suspense for which its author was the recipient of the 1994 Whitbread Award.

The truly horrifying thing in the mystery is the unknown, for we don't know what is going to happen next. We wonder if a murder is to occur, or if we are about to discover some gut-wrenching fact about the main male character, Mr. Hilditch. The book makes you feel as if something is coming around every corner; so much reading time is spent waiting, anxiously, anticipating the next move. The two characters make quite a pair, one searching desperately for her lover, and essentially her family, and the other, searching for something to replace the family he no longer has. The truly strange thing about Mr. Hilditch is his normalcy. He seems a very nice, hard working, grandfather figure, until we learn of his crimes. Pity seems to be given to Felicia, even though I think she is undeserving of it. It was unintelligent of her to leave home alone, go to another country, and then associate with a strange man she knew nothing about. Although we are probably supposed to feel for this unsuspecting, sweet, innocent girl, I almost felt more sympathy for Mr. Hilditch and for the nightmare of a life he is living. All in all, an interesting mystery that kept me guessing at every turn, but certainly not one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"William Trevor is a master storyteller -- he gives the reader just enough information to know where the story is (probably) going, but not so much that he holds the reader's hand throughout. FELICIA'S JOURNEY is filmic, Hitchcockian: Trevor gives direction to the characters, who take unexpected paths to unexpected ends. The darker sides of Felicia and Mr. Hilditch elude us. Trevor gives us only brief glimpses of them, like figures disappearing around corners when the lights of a car give them away.Mr. Hilditch is one of the most memorable characters I've encountered of late. Like Count Fosco in Wilkie Collins' THE WOMAN IN WHITE, Hilditch appears to be a benign giant, overweight and always eating pastries, a charming man. Inside, however, he's dark. His past haunts him and compels him to act out unspeakable evils so unspeakable that Trevor leaves it up to us to figure out what exactly he has done. Therein lies the suspense: what are this man's crimes, what is the runaway Felicia up against, where are the bodies, if any? We watch, helpless, as Felicia slowly enters Hilditch's trap, wondering how she could possibly escape.The suspense builds steadily throughout, especially as we learn more and more about Mr. Hilditch, as we begin to feel sorry for this tortured soul. FELICIA'S JOURNEY is a little slow, perhaps, but a worthwhile read nonetheless."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"I must admit that I read this book after having seen Atom Egoyan's stunning film version -- and I had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by it.Fortunately, Trevor's work also sticks in the mind. It is an elegant dance between a self-satisfied gourmand who has a taste for young women whose lives are disordered, luring them into his web ever so slowly and cutting off their lives. Felicia is different from the others in one important respect: She has caught they eye of the benign but determined Miss Calligary, a Jamaican street preacher who strives to &quot;gather in&quot; disturbed souls.Many critics have criticized the character of Felicia for being insufficiently realized. She is like Lena Grove from Faulkner's LIGHT IN AUGUST: Without being a developed character in her own right, her pregnant wanderings and confusion set the evil or craven minds of the people around her in motion. Fortunately, it is Felicia who quite unawares sends Miss Calligary and her &quot;Gatherers&quot; after the startled Hilditch.A book well worth reading from an author whose work I would like to explore in greater detail."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"This is an extremely well written thriller that left me in a slight daze by the time I was finished.

She meets Mr. Hilditch who is a mild-mannered, conventional serial killer who befriends lost girls and then murders and disposes of their bodies (this is not explicit -- possibly because Mr. Hilditch seems so inept it's hard to believe he actually could kill someone and dispose of their body without immediately being caught). While extremely well written and accurate, neither of these characters nor their situation are interesting enough to make this a really compelling book. Far more interesting a novel could have been made of Mr. Hilditch's relationship with his mother who turns to him as a lover (when he is presumably an adolescent) and she is no longer attractive enough to find anyone else. An exploration of a relationship like that would have been truly captivating. And Mr. Hilditch wouldn't have needed to murder anyone."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"Clean, spare, perfect prose and flawless psychological portraits. Trevor is one of the great literary writers: he's not showing off like some of the other Brit writers. He has far more negative capability than say Ian McEwan, and is far less ego-driven than say Julian Barnes--and he manages to have driving plot *and* depth of character, an unusual combo in a literary writer, which makes this much more taut than (say) William Maxwell. Each line is rich with reality. Loved every sentence."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"Trevor does an execptional job of captivating the reader and telling the story from the two main characters (Felicia and Hilditch). One cannot help but feel sad after reading this novel. All involved appear to be victims at various times and on various levels. Felicia, the victim of death (her mothers) and a jilted lover and Hilditch. Hilditch a victim of his mother and his need for &quot;friendship&quot;.Trevor will keep you reading and feeling throughout the book. Do not expect to feel good after reading this novel. A great book for a book group discussion."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"In this superb book, Trevor does what he has done in some of his other novels, especially &quot;Other People's Worlds.&quot; Trevor takes the basic elements of what could easily have been a simple thriller, a piece of genre fiction, and elevates it to something much more adult. He should be on the short list for the Nobel Prize."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"I found this book to be a bit difficult to read because of the author's habit of jumping from past to present with no warning at all. I did however find the book to be very exciting and have not been able to get it out of my mind since I finished it.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a suspence and is looking for a change of pace. My only recommendation is to read it slowly to keep from getting confused!"},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"Felicia's journey is an excellent novel. The background to both characters is well developed. Mr. Hilditch in particular becomes more sinister due to his overwhelmingly ordinary appearance. The intimations of his unusual childhood merely suggest that he may be more disturbed than his manner presumes. Mr. Hilditch's interactions with strangers in the presence of Felicia provide the most chilling insight into the purpose of his friendship with her. It is for this reason alone that the film fails so miserably. No reference is made at all to these brief conversations. As for Felicia herself, it must be said that her character is a little limp. There are few convent girls left in Ireland who show such naivety. However she does grow more likeable, but not enough to demonstrate why she should affect Mr. Hilditch so much."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"When I discovered what the story was going to be, I wanted to stop reading--I do not like to be in worlds I do not like. However, I could not stop reading. The language, the way Trevor mixes images like a shuffling deck of cards. The two page description of the abortion was brilliant.I felt I knew Felicia and thus was so disappointed at her ending. The shred of hope put out with the description of her father and his change of heart made me hope for Felicia. Couldn't a shred of hope have been woven into Felicia's coda so that you just knew she would pull out in the time ahead; the Prodigal Daughter would finally go home.I was really disappointed by the summary dismissal of Felicia and began to think it was more the story of Hilditch as his story was resolved whereas Felicia was simply left in a depressing, downward slide."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"The premise is certainly interesting--a pregnant and penniless teenager running away from home to seek out her lover is befriended by a mentally disturbed and dangerous man. And an interesting story is just what Mr. Trevor gave us. But too much of it.This book would have benefited from editing and a cleaner ending. Also, while the character of the villanous Mr. Hilditch was wonderfully developed, Felicia, who we should have cared about the most, was little more than a wisp of a character.This is an entertaining story, but do not expect too much."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"&quot; Felicia's Journey&quot; is a departure for the Irish author in that the plot is driven by suspense more than character.Felicia's character is pretty much unformed. A small town motherless Irish girl, just out of school and newly unemployed, she's trapped in a round of housekeeping and caring for her hundred-year-old great-grandmother. The old lady is famous as the widow of a hero, killed in the &quot;Troubles&quot; a month after their wedding.An ordinary girl, with no particular talents or ambitions, Felicia's keenest awareness is of her lack of prospects. Not that she plans to do anything about it. But then a young man, older than herself and back on a visit from his job in England, flatters her with his ardent attentions. And leaves her pregnant, having &quot;forgotten&quot; to give her his address in the muddle of leavetaking.After several months without a word (but he doesn't have her address either), Felicia takes her great-grandmother's savings and runs off to England, looking for the factory where he told her he worked.The first night, she wakes, and thinks of returning. &quot;If she goes back now she'll wake up again in that bedroom. There'll be another dawn breaking on the same despair, the weariness of getting up when the bell chimes six, another day beginning. The cramped stairs will again be cleaned on Tuesdays, the old woman's sheets cleaned at the weekend. If she goes back now her father's eyes will still accuse, her brothers will threaten revenge. There will be Connie Jo's regret that she married into a family anticipating a shameful birth. There will be interested glances, or hard looks, on the street....Only being together, only their love, can bring redemption: she knows that perfectly.&quot;Mr. Hilditch, a fat catering manager, is among those she asks for directions. He discerns her predicament immediately and is attracted to her friendless, anonymous condition. Surreptitiously he follows her, awaiting his chance to befriend her and add her to his &quot;Memory Lane.&quot;The narrative moves between them. Hilditch plots, remembers happy times with previous girls he &quot;helped,&quot; and finds Felicia's Johnny with ease, keeping the information to himself. He steals Felicia's money to hasten the day she will be utterly dependent upon his largesse.Felicia, innocent but wary, angers Hilditch by escaping him. She falls in with a religious cult but, when it's time to move on, discovers the disappearance of her money. Trevor underscores the terror of homelessness with subtle portraits of the people she meets, their offhand kindness a contrast to the circus of grubbiness, insanity and drug addiction. Sights and sounds loom larger than life. Hilditch becomes a reasonable alternative.Felicia is not a heroic character. Hilditch, pathetic, self-satisfied and crafty, with flashes of viciousness, is the more interesting. His greatest pleasure is sitting with Felicia in one fast-food restaurant after another, eating and imagining the other patrons noticing them, taking him for her lover. The tension builds, however, with a truly repellant scene at an abortion clinic and Felicia's subsequent disintegration.As always, Trevor's prose is both subtle and sharp, with a distinct eye for detail. And the tone is both compassionate and pathological; tension heightens as the characters' shared world grows smaller and darker.If there's any criticism it's the stereotypical psychological root of Hilditch's obsession, a monstrous mother added, it seems, as an afterthought. Nevertheless, a fine, dark novel from a thoughtful, eloquent writer."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"A nowadays story about the chance that separates the living from the dead : a girl (Felicia) becomes homeless, a man (Mr Hilditch) kills himself, religion fails, through the hands of well intentioned people, to be the support and the healing force that people (Felicia, Mr Hilditch) badly need.A book about an immense solitude : on one hand the blind belief in love, or the naivety of a young inexperienced girl, brings her to leave her uncaring family, where she feels out of place, in order to search her short time lover, of whose child she's pregnant. On the other hand Mr Hilditch, his empty regular and \\"not-disturbing-the-neighbours\\" life, desperately seeking comfort and company, but constantly failing to reach out of the ice box of his incapacity to care.Nonetheless, a book that doesn't in the least judge. It doesn't either aim at explaining how things happen. Just tells the story, a story made by the chance, &quot;the chance that separates the living from the dead&quot;."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"He must be one of the greatest contemporary writers we have. William Trevor is one I most of all have admired for his short stories and essays, but with Felicia\`s Journey he has written a novel with such energy, tension and a well-crafted plot, that it must surely be regarded as one of the absolutely best books of the 1990s. Every time I look back on Felicia\`s Journey I happen to think of Charles Dickens at his best. This book belongs in every literature lovers bookshelf, next to Trevor\`s collected short stories."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"While I will readily admit that Trevor has incredible command of the English language, what is even more displayed in Felicia's Journey is the lack of a sympathetic character. The title character-a young, pregnant runaway searching for her baby's father-should have been one with whom you could sympathize. Instead, Trevor's love affair with language never quite manages to include his characters, leading to an unsatisfying reading experience. Couple the lack of emotion with a depressing ending, and you have a book best suited to gathering dust."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"The most disturbing novels about murderers are the ones where the reader inhabits the killer's mind and comes to know and, in a sense, understand him. Such is the case with \`Felicia's Journey', a novel that treads a very fine line between sympathy and disgust for both main characters, Felicia, a young girl looking for the father of her unborn child and Mr. Hilditch, a refined and courteous catering manager, who sets about to befriend her. Her initial innocence and snivelling about her condition, though understandable, is grating, while the friendly and gentle Mr. Hilditch, although we (and Felicia) should know better, is the more interesting and thoughtful character. What's at once troubling and fascinating about the novel is this general lack of sympathy for Felicia and the feeling that Hilditch just \`can't be that bad.' I'm sure Trevor has constructed the narrative this way in order to unsettle the reader, and it works. I can't divulge one of the most intriguing aspects of the novel, other than to say, growing self-awareness is not always a good thing. I'm reminded of Hannibal Lecter, another likable bad boy. However, Lecter is great fantasy while Mr. Hilditch is the much more realistic and believable character. You know he's living just around the corner. This novel is beautifully written and unusual in every sense. I can guarantee the next novel you pick up will read like lead. Best to wait a while, and let Mr. Hilditch swirl around in your head like a fine wine gone vinegar."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"Here he is again, that commander of luminous prose William Trevor. With this, his 13th novel, the master has some surprises in store as his unparalleled accounting weaves a psychological thriller.Felicia, whose appearance is deemed &quot;nun like&quot; is the only daughter of an impoverished Irish gardener. She leaves the home where she cooks, cleans and tends to an elderly grandmother to find the boy she loves, Johnny. Knowing only that he works in a lawn mower factory somewhere in the English Midlands, she embarks on her fateful journey.Unable to locate the factory, let alone Johnny, she is befriended by Mr. Hilditch, a portly catering manager with a penchant for pop tunes from the 50s, a portrait gallery of strangers decorating his walls, and a black past. Mr. Hilditch follows her, assures her dependence upon him by stealing her money, and eventually takes her into his home.Trevor's brilliant narrative skills are showcased as he weaves the story with flashbacks, revelations of his characters' thoughts, and displays of their dreams. As always, he is articulate and compassionate, bringing his shuddery thriller to the zenith of a conclusion."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"This is an intriguing book of psychological suspense for which its author was the recipient of the 1994 Whitbread Award. Written by a master storyteller, it tells the story of two people whose lives interconnect, only to have repercussions for both in the most unexpected ways.Felicia is a seventeen year old motherless and naive Irish girl, who has become intimate with an Irish boy named Johnny. Of course, the expected ensues, and after Johnny has left Ireland and returned to England where he ostensibly works, Felicia is left holding the bag. Her disapproving father suspects Johnny of actually being in the British Army and, thus, a traitor to his own. He also has a few choice words for his daughter, now that she is in the family way, and none of it is flattering. So, Felicia leaves her rural village and her family and goes off in search of Johnny, having nothing more than the vaguest of ideas where he might be.She crosses the Irish Sea and arrives in the English Midlands in the industrial city of Birmingham, as she believes Johnny to be working in a lawn mower factory there. In her search for Johnny, she runs into the portly catering manager for one of the local factories. His name is Joseph Ambrose Hilditch, and he is outwardly a jovial and agreeable man, well-liked by his co-workers and meticulous about his culinary repasts. He lives in solitary splendor in the large house in which he grew up. The house is cluttered with collectibles but well- kept, although decorated in the style of a bygone era. Mr. Hilditch is, indeed, a collector, but his collection is initially far beyond Felicia's imaginings. In fact, Mr. Hilditch has a darker side to him, which is not immediately discernible by the unwary.When Felicia first meets Mr. Hilditch, it is to ask for information, but something about her catches Mr. Hilditch's fancy, and he finds himself keeping Felicia in his crosshairs. When Felicia seemingly unexpectedly runs into Mr. Hilditch again, he directs her to lodgings, and so it begins. As Mr. Hilditch insinuates himself ever so slowly into her life, weaving a fantasy about his own life that is sure to put her mind at ease about him. Felicia begins finding herself ensnared by this ostensibly kind and ever so helpful, avuncular man, and she initially fails to see the darkness that lies at the core of his being.The author begins the book with Felicia's journey to England in search of her lover. Using flashbacks throughout the story, the author fills in Felicia's background and describes the events that have brought her to the point of making this journey. When Mr. Hilditch is introduced to the reader, the author begins to take the reader into the recesses of his mind, allowing the reader to see what Felicia initially fails to see, the duplicity and cunning that is masked by his overt geniality. Like a spider to the fly, Mr. Hilditch begins laying his trap, and so Felicia's journey thrusts her into the belly of the beast.With his carefully cadenced prose, the author explores the darker corners of the human psyche, and in the mind of Mr. Hilditch, it is dark, indeed. As his carefully constructed psychological house of cards begins to fall, there are unspeakable revelations as to what lies at the heart of Mr. Hilditch's predilection, and it is not pretty. The author, in taking the reader into the recesses of the mind of each of the two protagonists, tries to explain how it is that each of these two flawed human beings were able initially to achieve a connection with another, only to find ostensible betrayal. What is decidedly different is the way that they each cope with that betrayal.There is no happily-ever-after ending to this story, which culminates with a conclusion that is quite bleak, robbing the reader of some satisfaction. Fans of Ruth Rendell, however, will very much appreciate the psychological cat and mouse game that is played throughout and will enjoy the author's foray into this genre. As always, the author pens a novel that provides much food for thought on many levels, and the use of the word journey in the title of the book has a much broader meaning within the context of the story. In reading this book, fans will enjoy the elegant, spare prose that they have come to expect from this enormously talented author."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"William Trevor's precise, descriptive prose brings to mind other current authors (Pete Dexter, Tom Wolfe) who enable readers to visualize, as if viewing a film, the details of a scene--from beads of sweat trickling down a character's cheek to the colors in the oil paintings decorating a wall. Treveor uses this admirable technique to great employ in this enigmatic story of the relationship between a predator, a seemingly kindly bachelor, and his prey, a frightened pregnant Irish teen come to England to look for the father. The issue of free will as the Creator envisions it is examined here: the predator, Mr. Hilditch, in his manipulative fashion, carves out a destiny for Felicia (and, unwittingly, himdself) that suggests a control one might ascribe to a Deity. The ending is cryptic and odd; one can take the events and their aftermath in any number of ways and Trevor is of no help in steering one in the proper direction. Perhaps that's a good thing--the ending is far more haunting than the rest of the novel.(The unabridged audiobook I listened to was read by Simon Prebble, not Dermot Crowley. Prebble's interpretation, as well as his vocal characterization, is flawless.)"},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"This book starts with a lot of promise and the writing is excellent--for the first few chapters. However, the character of Felicia undergoes very little development, something I find to be Mr. Trevor's biggest writing mistake. Much more depth could (and should) have been added to the story had we been privy to Felicia's inner thoughts. As it is, she is very flat and one-dimensional with no deep emotions and seems to exist only to further characterize the fascinating Mr. Hilditch.Mr. Hilditch is a very well formed character indeed, almost comical and likable, and does have many thoughts and emotions. This made the book a story about Mr. Hilditch, with Felicia just passing through, really serving no purpose other than to become Mr. Hilditch's current obsession.Based on the title, I would assume the author wanted this to be a story about Felicia. If that is the case, then Mr. Trevor should have had the climax of Felicia's story closer to the end of the book. Instead, the last of the book gives us no clear glimpses of Felicia. As for Felicia's fate, I would have preferred a more solid ending. Symbolism is well and good, but only when used in a symbolic book. When used simply to confuse and surprise, I find it rather annoying. Had the book been titled &quot;Mr. Hilditch&quot; perhaps I would have enjoyed it more and rated it higher."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"I'll start by admitting that I think William Trevor has few if any equals among contemporary writers -- especially considering his works as a whole. He also appears to just keep getting better and better, and 'Felicia's journey' is a great example of that growth.Trevor's writing is simply luminous -- I can think of no better word to decribe it. His characters all come alive in ways that are extremely rare in modern fiction -- as the reader gets deeper and deeper into the novel, the characters are almost grown before our eyes. We know them before we realize it -- but only at the pace that Trevor controls. His powers of decription are so well-honed and subtle that reading his work is almost like seeing things with our own eyes.In 'Felicia's journey', without having any of the characters' emotions or thoughts rammed down our throats, we are intimately aware of their feelings. We can without question feel the uncertainty and trepidation with which Felicia lives her life -- more one step at a time than one day at a time. Her initial reluctance to allow Mr. Hillditch to help her is incredibly real to us. As for Hillditch himself, the evil contained in his character is revealed like peeling the layers of an onion (and I'm not giving anything more away here than the book jacket...no spoilers).The novel is much more satisfying than the film made of it by Canadian director Atom Egoyan. There are aspects of the story here that the film leaves unexplored, and a richness here that is probably untranslatable to the screen, except in the hands of a master director.If you enjoy tasting the work of an author who is a master at his craft, William Trevor is your cup of tea -- and his short stories are, if possible, even more amazing than his novels. This book is a modern masterpiece, without pretentions or avant-garde experimentaion -- it's simply increible writing."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"I was new to William Trevor's work before I bought this book. I was intrigued by the back-cover synopsis, and was encouraged to buy it by my husband, who had read Trevor before and admired his work. Fans of suspense/mystery/crime novels who like their writing smart and literary will really enjoy this book. In a mere 212 pages, Trevor weaves a chilling psychodrama between two intriguing main characters: a pregnant young Irish woman searching the British midlands for her missing boyfriend and a middle-aged Englishman whose appetite for food is only matched by his unhealthy obsession with young runaway women. Trevor's economic descriptions of the scenery already manage to convey the severe depression of these British industrial towns -- a contrast to Felicia's more pastoral, Irish Catholic upbringing -- but not much. If I do have one complaint about the book, it's title is Felicia's Journey, but in the end it focuses more on the male character, Mr. Hilditch, and leaves Felicia's character less defined than I wanted her to be. But this is a small issue. William Trevor is a very fine writer, and this book is such a great introduction to his work, they're even making it into a movie."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"Irish immigration is a topic that has been dealt with to great lengths in contemporary fiction, but by presenting the subject within the detective genre Trevor manages to treat the idea of alienation from a fresh angle. The character of Felicia is on one level a modern extension of the traditional female symbol of Ireland. The story of Ireland in the twentieth century is one of leaving, and Felicia's quest for acceptance, for love away from Ireland is indicative of this history. Yet the character of Mr. Hilditch cannot be simply accepted as representative of Britain with respect to Ireland. Mr. Hilditch is a study in the idea of the facade. His house, his lifestyle, and even the way that he structures his thoughts are not what they originally seem. Similarly, Felicia's own vision of what she expected to happen in England was remarkably different from reality.Trevor's narrative style is divided between the perspectives of Felicia and Mr. Hilditch. I study Irish history, and specifically Irish nationalism, so while reading this novel I was constantly looking for hidden political messages or references to traditional Irish iconography or depictions of the Anglo-Irish dynamic. I found the task daunting, largely because a reduction of the novel to a 'dependent Ireland - dominant Britain' outline seemed deceptively simple, which is yet another reason why I noted that Trevor's novel looks at the situation from a fresh angle. Ultimately, I think that this novel works best simply as a compelling, well-written mystery novel. To attempt to read too much politics into the narrative is to undermine the elegance of Felicia's innocence or desperation of Mr. Hilditch's pathetic attempts to recreate something that never existed in the first place. This novel should be taken at face value, and as such it functions as a hypnotic and often disturbing mystery."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"This book is brilliantly written. And it focuses on the character it's meant to focus on... regardless of the title. What it did for me, (which so few books do) is let me do the work. It let me play psychologist and investigator. It let me analyze the characters. It let me decide who was pitiable, and why, and who was sinister, and why. It let me see the conception, so to speak, of a &quot;lost&quot; soul. Ever wonder.. truly wonder... how the depraved got that way? Or those that reject society and end up rooting through bins for sustenance? What events led to it? It also struck me that how and what one ate, in the book, signified almost how they viewed life and people, whether they were a rejector or a hoarder. Mr. Hilditch, a hoarder, with a house full of objects from his past and other people's pasts, also a hoarder of young girl's souls, kept a stocked cupboard, and ate with great gusto. And Felicia, all her belongings fitting in a couple bags, eats hardly at all, (sp.) and ends up rooting through rubbish bins after &quot;rejecting&quot; her unborn child and basically the whole of society."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"What Alfred Hitchcock did for the disturbed individual incinema, William Trevor does in literature. Although thesubject of the book is basically lurid and troubling, it becomes a springboard for a work of true beauty and com passion in the hands of one of the true masters of the English language. Only William Trevor could write about a character so despicable and get us, the reader, to feel compassion for him. The book is a real pageturner in the Stephen King tradition, yet it is a moving, compelling experience. Treat yourself to this gem of a novel."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"William Trevor's true genius lies within the short story, however, in Felicia's Journey he proves the versatility of his skills. Barely eighteen, the young Irish girl named Felicia discovers she is pregnant after a summer romance with Johnny, a young man from England. Johnny returns to England not knowing of Felicia's condition, and he fails to leave her a way to contact him when he goes. To Johnny the romance with Felicia was a fling, but to Felicia it was real love. Shunned by her family and distraught over how to handle the pregnancy, Felicia takes off to England alone in search of Johnny hoping that he will help her. Lost, frightened, and without money in England, Felicia is befriended by Mr. Hilditch, an overweight man in his fifties who offers to help her. The naive Felicia makes an unknowingly grave mistake by trusting Mr. Hilditch. Although he seems gentle and genuinely concerned, Mr. Hilditch is really a man suffering from psychosis who sees Felicia in a disturbing light.The events that unfold as the &quot;friendship&quot; develops are chilling. Trevor, a master at displaying human behavior, does a fine job at taking the reader into the delusional mind of Mr. Hilditch. Felicia's vulnerabilities and blinded trust will make you want to shake some sense into her. The story provides plenty of twists and a surprising end. Once again, Trevor's rhythmic prose will move you, but this time in a dark and shocking manner."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"Book looks great everything that was promised and arrived in great time too.

To Felicia, Mr. Hilditch becomes a caring fatherly figure who despite the uneasiness that he sometimes produces helps her throughout her search. To Mr. Hilditch, Felicia is a vehicle by which he can relate to an outside world that he has failed at on his own, and only by misdirecting her, can he keep her close enough to buffer his own insecurities. Though Felicia and Mr. Hilditch operate with extremely different motivations, Trevor examines their respective viewpoints based on the despair that fuels both of their troubles. He oscillates between both point of views, uncovering the different sides of fear in Felicia and Mr. Hilditch's relationship. At times, the jumping back and forth can be jarring and distracting, but often it reveals chilling insight into their behavior and creates an unrelenting suspense throughout the story. Trevor has invented a collision between two people from different walks of life, and it is curious that even though their meeting is accidental it may become the determining factor in each of their lives."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"This novel investigates the mystery of the forgotten ones of our modern society, those that wander the streets, seemingly lost. We encounter them in our cities daily and criticize their lack of ability to fit into society. Yet, as William Trevor explores in his novel Felicia's Journey, it is society that is unable to fit into or around these people's lives. In this way, the novel, usually described as Hitchcockian, is also reminiscent of Kafka. Trevor, like Kafka, puts society under a microscope and studies how its inability for flexibility creates outcasts of individuals who previously had a seemingly \`normal' life. This story follows the journey of two characters, whose paths intersect, Felicia and Mr. Hilditch. When Felicia finds herself pregnant, she sets out on a journey that takes her from her home in Ireland to a town in England looking for the father of her baby. She soon encounters Mr. Hilditch, who the reader senses has a mystery of his own which must be uncovered as the plot advances. While he is seemingly a regular caring older man who holds a successful job and maintains an appearance of normality in his life, the crossing of paths of these two characters soon uncovers his hidden life. With the oppositional circumstances of the two characters-Felicia is homeless and friendless in England, and Mr. Hilditch has always lived in the same town and home in which he was raised-Trevor investigates and juxtaposes the circumstances within society that lead to the loss of direction, and even the disheartening loss of soul. Trevor writes a truly thought-provoking novel that illustrates the delicacy of the journey of life."},{"Title":"Felicias Journey","review":"I saw the movie first, and although I found it excrutiatingly slow, I thought the concept was intriguing. When I found the book at a library sale I thought I'd give it a go. The book was even slower than the movie, and both were lacking any umph at the ending to make up for the laboriously snail like pace. If Trevor's writing wasn't so crisp and clear, I would give this book 2 stars.It isn't as though nothing happens at all, there's conflict, resolution, and plot development, but everything that does occur is unwoven so carefully it's hard to care. I couldn't get in touch with Felicia or Mr. Hilditch (I've spelled his name wrong), both character's felt continually held at an arms length from the page. By the end of the book I was rushing through the final pages, not because I was riveted, but because I wanted to hurry up and finish. The climax is made anti-climatic by tedious pacing. The movie took a lot of liberty in embellishing and ignoring certain details, but neither director nor writer spiced the story up enough.Have someone relay the details to you instead, it will probably be creepier.

There is humor and compassion in Trevor's vision of the lonely perp, and and almost Faulkner-like combination of exasperating simple-mindedness and emotional cunning in the victim. To come to an understanding of the human condition is a matter of survival in this novel for Felicia; and a weapon in the hands of Hilditch."},{"Title":"Heart Of Darkness And Other Tales","review":"The word's thrown around a lot, but this is the only case where I've actually been literally haunted by a book. It surfaces in the mind when I don't intend for it to, and its disturbing. I've never been really psychologically messed with by a book like this. I mean, not bad, but I get chills thinking about it. Like someone said, the images are great. The ship firing into the continent is one of those I can't get out of my head. And for those of you who are curious after seeing Apocolypse Now, I think they really messed up the Kurtz character. Its one of, if not the one of, my favorite movies, but he's so overacted and the script never really tells what the horror is. From the movie I got that it was the situation and man's situation, but from the book it is definitely the mind and soul, in my opinion. Any social commentary in the book is secondary to the more philosophical and psychological, here, I feel.I also enjoyed Lord Jim and every one of his other short stories I've read, but none have been as good as Heart of Darkness. I'll probably read Nostromo pretty soon, too. If you want another take on a somewhat similar situation in colonial Africa, check out Journey to the End of the Night by Celine. I didn't so much care for the book as a whole, but that part has stuck with me."},{"Title":"Heart Of Darkness And Other Tales","review":"This book contains four stories: Youth, The Secret Sharer, An Outpost of Progress, and Heart of Darkness. All four are very good stories, and the last 2 are absolutely first-rate.Youth (1902) is a short, somewhat autobiographical account of a voyage to Bankok.The Secret Sharer (1910) is a short story/novella about a young captain who encounters a fugitive on his boat with whom he identifies uncannily.An Outpost of Progress (1896) is a short story about two white men living at an ivory trading station. Conrad said this was his best story, and, from compared to the other 3 stories in this collection, I'd say he's correct, although Heart of Darkness comes close.Heart of Darkness (1910) is a novella about a man who becomes a steamer captain in Africa. A masterful work.The book is $8 at Borders. There one or two printing errors, but they aren't that noticeable. I think they missed a period and added in a few accidental \\"I\\"s. Buy it; its a good collection of Conrad stories, containing both his most famous (Heart of Darkness), and his best (Outpost)."},{"Title":"Heart Of Darkness And Other Tales","review":"Heart of Darkness is, without a doubt, one of the best and most confusing books ever written. It is probably the most discussed book of the 20th century, and an obscene number of academic papers, criticisms and interpretations have been written about it. What does it mean, everyone wants to know. It is so impenetrable, to use one of Marlow's favorite words. Even if you don't want to spend the time figuring out the &quot;message&quot; (if there is one), this is a great novel simply for the characters and the images.Our narrator, Marlow, is a fascinating character in himself, and he always makes me smile with his wit and insight, though he can be a little pretentious. Kurtz is an enigma, a man who has set himself up as a god with unclear motives. He is taken care of my a Russian harlequin, a hilarious idealist who forgives that Kurtz once threatened to kill him (you can't judge a man like that by ordinary standards!) Marlow comes across many others, such as the fat Englishman who cannot stop fainting on their way to see Kurtz. The imagery is evocative and haunting. A group of starving indiginous men are referred to as a &quot;bundle of acute angles.&quot; The scenery is described better than a movie could portray (Apocalypse Now does the jungle no justice.)It's a short book too, so you have no excuse for not reading it!"},{"Title":"Heart Of Darkness And Other Tales","review":"How can an author who did not begin to learn english until he was twenty have such control over the language?

I believe Conrad illustrates the feelings and &quot;the horror&quot; of the time as only a master artist could. If you read the novel, do not do so looking to label it as racist or sexist, but rather look at it as an attempt to bring light upon the oppresion of both non whites and women that was taking place at the time. Is the &quot;heart of darkness&quot; really the African jungle and its people as one might naturally assume, or did Conrad want to ironicly portray the colonist, the white europeans, to be the true savages, the true heart of darkness?

Conrad constructs his novel with many sets of 3, channeling the three parts of Dante's Inferno / The Divine Comedy, and tells it in a \\"chinese box\\" fashion, featuring a set of stories within stories. The novel begins on board the Nellie on the Thames River, with Marlow beginning to tell his own story to his mariner companions. With great attention to the sea, personification of the jungle, and the greater idea of human restraint corresponding to its environment, Marlow recounts his memories of traveling down the Congo River under a Belgian Trading Company and the examples of humanity he encounters there. His prime example is a figure named Kurtz, who, although intelligent, musically gifted, and persuasive, loses all of his restraint along with himself in the heart of the Africa, leaving a lasting image of him being, \\"hollow to the core.\\" Kurtz only realizes the evils and extreme wrongs that took place in Africa at the moment before his death, exclaiming, \\"The horror, the horror!\\" Was he (and/or Conrad) referring to Kurtz's own deeds, the Company's futility and exploitation, or the very subject of Imperialism itself? You can be the judge after reading this intriguing novel.The Kindle book is easy to use and saves your place, as well as allowing you to highlight, bookmark, and makes notes, but the one issue I had was with quick reference to the notes featured at the end of the text. There wasn't a user-friendly way to go back and forth between the notes and the text without losing your place in the book after digging up the correct note that corresponds to the page you're on. They would have been much more useful if this hadn't been so inconvenient."},{"Title":"Heart Of Darkness And Other Tales","review":"I was assigned Heart of Darkness as part of my summer reading regiment for my english class. I usually don't enjoy assigned books because I often try and pay attention to all the details rather than just read it for fun. However, this book, albeit a bit confusing, is definately good. It really gets your brain going as you question your own opinions on imperialism. Plus, it contains explanatory notes in the back, which definately help to understand the context. However, its MAJOR fallacy with THIS exact publication is its shoddy manufacturing. I've had the book only for one month and the pages that Heart of Darkness are on are already falling apart from the binding of the book. And I treated it well - all I have done is placed it in my backpack when traveling to a few places. Overall, the literary piece is good and so are the explanatory notes, but if you can't stand your book falling apart (trust me, it's really annoying), then search elsewhere for a different copy of this book."},{"Title":"Heart Of Darkness And Other Tales","review":"The four tales in this collection are beautifully composed; they are art, not just stories.

As Chinua Achebe points out in his article on Conrad, the man is a \\"bloody racist.\\" I'm sort of confused why we still hold this novel to be one of the greatest of the 20th century when it treats an entire group of people as cultural and social inferiors, whatever Conrad's stance on imperialism may be. He presents Africa as a land of corruption, greed, and destruction-- for white people. The reason why imperialism is bad is because it destorys people, not because it's unethical and assumes that every non-European is an animal. Conrad's language throughout the novel may be superb, but it's not divine. However, just because we shouldn't consider this novel the best English novel of the century doesn't mean it shouldn't be taught. Conrad does provide an interesting cultural study for the pervasiveness of racism in European society, even as the British Empire began to crumble. So, it's a short read and worthwhile if you're intrested in looking at historical accounts of racism and imperialism, but otherwise I wouldn't bother."},{"Title":"Heart Of Darkness And Other Tales","review":"If you gave an infinite number of monkeys an infinite number of typewriters, would they eventually produce the complete works of Shakespeare?

He is a master at presenting a fully realized milieu. Genellan is a fascinating world, and Gier's presentation of technology is detailed and well thought out, a far cry from the magical machinery that appears in much space opera. But what really makes his story work is the characters. There are a lot of them, but he makes them individuals with their own dramatic arcs and I was often moved by their triumphs and tragedies. I still think his aliens are a little too human in their psychology, but when everything else is working so well, I don't care about that anymore. It's a testament to Gier's talent that, even though one of the main draws of this novel is its harrowing depiction of interstellar combat, I liked the characters so much that I almost didn't want it to happen.

Nelson cites recent scientific research on the effects of appreciation on the brain and the heart, and describes how appreciation works to remove resistance while encouraging people to do their very best. Best of all, Nelson includes step-by-step directions for implementing these techniques in ways that have proven to be wildly successful in businesses such as See's Candies, Ryder, and Southwest Airlines.I love the way this book explodes many management myths, and explains why so many corporate appreciation tools such as Employee of the Month programs and customer satisfaction surveys so often prove to be ineffective.

Comics wanted to erase from memory but it somehow surfaces every now and then. \\"Catwoman: Her Sister's Keeper\\" is actually \\"Catwoman: Year One\\" (or the closest we will ever get to a \\"Year One\\" for the feline fatale) as it ties in very closely to Frank Miller's justly-classic \\"Batman: Year One\\". In fact, it more than \\"ties-into\\" that work; entire scenes were lifted from Miller's original and put into this volume. In fact, the present writer/artist seem to have created their story in this volume by wrapping some \\"filler-info\\" around those famous Miller-scenes.As to the notoriety of the work, this volume, like Miller's \\"Batman: Year One\\" gives us a Selina Kyle who works as a prostiture/sexual-dominatrix. But more than that, it ties her to religion (Selina's sister is a Catholic nun) and child-prostitution/abuse in the character of Holly. Furthermore, this tale revives the classic sexual attraction between Batman and Catwoman with a classic kiss shared by the two on the rooftop (a scene stolen by Tim Burton and added to the movie, \\"Batman Returns\\").According to DC Editorial decrees, this work is no longer part of official continuity (after the continuity altering event called \\"Zero Hour\\"). However, DC continuity is a tricky thing and so are Editorial decrees. In recent years, it seems to be back in \\"official continuity\\" as the current Ed Brubaker \\"Catwoman\\" series seems like a direct continuation of this book (Holly and Selina's sister features prominently in Brubaker's run). Therefore, it is an essential read in Catwoman's long legend.Continuity aside, this is really a difficult book to like. The art is choppy at times, and the scenes \\"lifted\\" from Miller's work (originally drawn by David Mazzuchelli) does not help either. In truth, it only adds to the frustration that this work wasn't done by the original Miller-Mazzuchelli team! About the only element in this tale that is half-decent is the introduction of Ted Grant (the Golden Age JSA-er, Wildcat) as Selina Kyle's mentor. The writing is very, very uneven and the pacing is hopeless. Reading it again recently, I felt like I was watching a bootleg, unedited David Lynch movie. After a while, I gave up on the pacing and tried to make as much sense of the story as possible. Honestly, if not for my great love for the characters (Batman and Catwoman), I'd probably give up by the first chapter.My copy is an original first-print tradepaperback with the original painted cover and an excellent foreword by the late Archie Goodwin. Goodwin compares Catwoman to the movie \\"Cat People\\" and talks a little about sexual repression and the need for split-personas. Interesting stuff.This volume is recommended to all Batman/Catwoman historians as well as the new fans just getting in with the Ed Brubaker monthly. It is also recommended as an antidote to purge the poison of the new Warner Bros. \\"Catwoman\\" movie starring Halle Berry. The real Catwoman is in here; NOT in that movie!"},{"Title":"Catwoman: Her Sister's Keeper","review":"This is a great story which shows Catwoman's origin. It is very interesting and probably the best portrayal of Catwoman I've ever read. There is a lot of character development, cameoes from Batman showing scenes from Frank Miller's BATMAN: YEAR ONE and it is full of crooked cops. A must have for all CATWOMAN fanatics."},{"Title":"Catwoman: Her Sister's Keeper","review":"This story takes place concurrently with Batman: Year One but is not on the same level story-wise and art-wise. It actually uses entire pages and panels from Year One to expound on Selina's story during those same events. I felt the story was convoluted and jumped around a bit too much which makes it feel like there are gaps in the narrative; it didn't have a good flow to it. Part of the problem is that the art style and characters are vastly different from Year One, so by inserting those exact panels instead of having this artist redraw them in their own style, it's just jarring. The character models for Selina in particular are VASTLY different, she's practically unrecognizable as being the same character. The story does add a little to her Year One origin as the prostitute with a heart of gold (and a love of it), but not so much that I would list this as an \\"essential\\" Catwoman title for anyone other than her staunchest fans. Overall it's a decent read which did mildly entertain me, but definitely didn't amaze me."},{"Title":"Catwoman: Her Sister's Keeper","review":"Due to the subtle sexual attraction between the villainous Catwoman and Batman, she has always been one of the most interesting of his regular adversaries. There have been several stories of her origin developed over the years, but the one in this book is one of the most interesting.Selina Kyle is a prostitute working under a brutal pimp named Stan. She also has a young co-worker named Holly that is in her early teens. When Stan beats up Selina and leaves her in a garbage-strewn alley, a cynical but kindly cop hands her the number of a man that trains fighters. Street-wise Selina rejects his kind overtures at first but she eventually makes her way to the gym of the man that will indirectly save her life.Selina's sister is also a sister in the religious sense and there are some tense reunions between the two as Selina moves away from the life of prostitution and into one of being a costumed criminal. As she moves down that path she encounters the Batman, as he tries to reason with her untrusting nature while trying to ignore her extremely sensual form.The background of being a seasoned and brutalized prostitute is a hard, yet effective precondition for the development of the Catwoman and her ongoing battle with Batman. It provides her with a hard mental edge, motivation to fight back and the ability to turn on sexual attraction and desire when she needs it to distract her adversaries."},{"Title":"Catwoman: Her Sister's Keeper","review":"It's a very good book, featuring the &quot;firt&quot; and more adult origin of Catwoman (before being spoiled in the zero hour fiasco), linking it to the batman origins also, giving us a chance to see the dark night when he was just a begginer, the book has a dark tone, but it tells a very good story about pain, suffering and vengance, I only dislike the fact that there isn't much about the origin of the custome (first one, with a tail) maybe because of the comic restrictions for the time it was published."},{"Title":"Christian Ethics: Options and Issues","review":"How you determine one's own human behavior? How do you define ethics when one believes the Bible is God's word? How do you write on this topic and keep it under a thousand pages? First the book must be written that incorporates scripture. The book cannot be kept brief if the author tries to include every angle of an argument. This book is a text book, so it does have to present alternative argument. This book does and I understand it does an adequate job of presenting alternative views and why the view is not acceptable to a Christian.This is a Christian Ethics text book, so its focus should be on biblical scripture to determine what is right and and what is wrong. I have never read an alternative Christian Ethics text book. I presume those written for a public University or another secular institution would incorporate quite different type of arguments. These books would use less bible scripture, quote more nonreligious philosophers, maybe some quotes from Christian theologians, but relying more on a buddhist, zen, or Hindu philosophy.Norman Geisler presents ethics from a Christian perspective. He knows there is one true god and that God gives us absolute truth n His Holy Word called the Bible. This not a book on Christian Apologetics, but is a philosophy that comes forth from an author that has written a book on Christian Apologetics. Other authors have written books with the preposition that Christianity is not true and others who argue its arguments do not have any weight. These authors come from a different way of thinking in the Universe.Does this work help the Christian understand Biblical truth? Those who study its content will more equipped to dismiss bad Biblical arguments about human behavior. It will also better place the individual to understand non biblical arguments to not be from God. This should be the purpose of reading this book."},{"Title":"Christian Ethics: Options and Issues","review":"Geisler builds the best straw man models that I have ver seen. He presents a general explanation of each of the models of ethical decision making. The problem is that he makes sure to highlight the weaknesses in all of the models except for Graded Absolutism. There are weaknesses in that model that he didn't deal with. Geisler chooses a pretty good model but doesn't give fair representation to the other models.Geisler does the worse job of applying these models that I have ever seen. He makes a lot of assumptions while writing his book. Geisler cites many numbers and statistics without citing a person. Once again he builds great straw men in his arguments. He doesn't give a fair representation to the opposing opinion.I recommend getting this book, only if you have to."},{"Title":"Christian Ethics: Options and Issues","review":"This book is the most current of Geisler's books on ethics and incorporates many of the points of previous works such as Ethics: Alternatives & Issues, Options in Contemporary Christian Ethics, and The Christian Ethic of Love. The book is, as the title suggests, a presentation of CHRISTIAN ethics, so the Bible is taken as the standard text for discussing certain issues such as homosexuality, abortion, war/civil disobedience, and other similar ethical issues. But scientific and rational arguments are also used in addition to Biblical exposition to reach conclusions.The first part of the book is concerned mainly with approaches to Ethics in general and Christian Ethics in particular. After perusing the field and debunking moral relativism, Geisler concludes that the best ethical position is what he calls \\"Graded Absolutism.\\" This basically means that certain situations require one to decide which of two conflicting absolutes to obey. Geisler is sure to clarify that this is different than Situation Ethics (by Joseph Fletcher and others) which states that the situation determines the rule. On the contrary, the graded nature of absolutes determines which rule to apply in a given situation. Overall, a good read which still has me thinking and referring back to the book."},{"Title":"Christian Ethics: Options and Issues","review":"Geisler writes clearly and logically to:1) Defend Christian ethics against non-Christian ones e.g. might makes right, good = pleasure. This includes showing that Christian ethics is deontological (duty-centred) rather than teleological (end-centred), e.g. utilitarianism. In particular, it is based on God's revelation. He rightly points out that even unbelievers have a law written on their hearts (Rom. 2:14-15), so they have no excuse for neglecting this general revelation. But one weakness is that Geisler insufficiently stresses that Scripture must be the guide for interpreting general revelation and for determining whether one's conscience is right.2) Present a good defence that the Christian position is &quot;graded absolutism&quot;, where moral absolutes exist, but a higher absolute exempts one from following a lower absolute. His gives the ethical dilemma of not telling the truth to save lives, describes how six different views deal with this, presents both pluses and minuses, then analyses them in detail in terms of Scripture to draw his conclusion.3) Analyses hot topics such as abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment, homosexuality and &quot;biomedical issues&quot;. He presents both sides' arguments, usually from science and Scripture, then effectively critiques the view he disagrees with. The arguments seem so effective that there's little I would change even though the book is now 12 years old. So the book is an excellent handbook for all Christians who want to argue effectively about moral issues."},{"Title":"Christian Ethics: Options and Issues","review":"This book is a decent introduction to Christian Ethics. Geisler starts with survey's of various approaches to Christian ethics, and then moves into various ethical issues such as abortion, war, ecology, and other major ethical topics. In each chapter, Geisler reviews what different positions on various topics are: for, against, and somewhere-in-between. He offers Biblical and philosophical criticisms of each surveyed position. The end of each chapter contains some suggested books for further reading.There are some draw backs to this book though. Firstly, this book sometimes seems to read more like a stero manual, especially early on. Secondly, though this book tries to be objective in its survey of various views, Geisler tends to make it very evident what he believes the proper view is, and usually reserves his personal views for the end of each chapter. Thirdly, after the first 8 or 9 chapters or so, I tended to find myself simply skimming the book, as it became pretty easy to anticipate what he was going to say... which made the book rather dry to read. Forthly, I think it would have been nice if Geisler included a chapter on birth control. Finally, I think this book is a little out of date, and probably could use more interaction with more influencial theologians on each side of the various debates.This book makes for a good introduction to Christian ethics, though it is not exactly a page turner. Ideal perhaps for Bible college text- which is why I read it."},{"Title":"Christian Ethics: Options and Issues","review":"This book is divided into two parts, as the title suggests; options and issues. The options section goes through different philosophical frameworks of ethics-situationism, graded absolutism, unqualified absolutism, etc. This was very helpful for me. It gave me a good idea of the most common ways that people think about ethics, as well as the vocabulary to describe them. Of the six options, three (or possibly 2) of them are compatible with a Christian worldview. This makes for an interesting read, as Christians of good faith can come away with different opinions about the best system of ethics.The second part was different issues- abortion, euthanasia, homosexuality, ecology, etc. As is common in all of Geisler's books, he describes the issue, gives the best possible arguments for and against it, and then describes what he believes to be the correct (Christian) understanding. Much of what Norm claims is backed up by scripture.I have a few criticisms. In the Chapter on Biomedical Issues, it seems that Norm approves of sexual impurity with oneself in the context of marriage. I was quite surprised by that. He also mentioned in passing birth control but didn't say too much about it. I would have liked to see an entire chapter devoted to the topic of contraception. This would be interesting from the POV of a Protestant, especially someone so thoughtful as Norm. Contraception is something that so few Protestants ever consider, and I think if they study the issue, they will realize that contraception is at the heart of abortion and the culture of death.All in all, this was a very good book. A few soft spots, but other than those, a great place to learn about ethical worldviews as well as some biblical and philosophical arguments."},{"Title":"Christian Ethics: Options and Issues","review":"Particularly the abortion section,or it seemed to me anyway,as I've gotten in some discussions over that lately. The bit where Dr.Bernard Nathanson(now anti abortion,he was one of the leading proponents in the early movement)admits that the info about &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of women dying in back alley &quot;coat hanger&quot; abortions was a fabrication rather interesting. Looked at the &quot;further reading&quot; section at the end of the chapter and it suggested Nathanson's &quot;Aborting America&quot;,he also has others available from amazon,as does Norma McCorvey(the real life Jane Roe) that should prove interesting."},{"Title":"Christian Ethics: Options and Issues","review":"This was required reading for my Master's course in Christian Ethics. I found the author to be fair-minded and thorough. He did an excellent job of presenting the alternative viewpoints on each topic: abortion, war, capital punishment, etc. But he also introduced me to new concepts such as graded absolutism and situationism (one-norm absolutism). Not being well versed in this subject before hand, this book was easy to read and study. Highly recommended for anyone wishing to gain an appreciation for the opinions of others in the Christian community."},{"Title":"Christian Ethics: Options and Issues","review":"The book exudes Geisler at his best straight to the point and unapologetic on his thoughts."},{"Title":"Christian Ethics: Options and Issues","review":"Read this as a required text in a Christian Ethics class. I was hoping to get an objective view on different Christian ethical viewpoints. What I found Geisler doing was bringing all viewpoints to his own . . .eventually. He attempts to lump everyone into six categories while suggesting that his is really the only plausible one. Still it was a good start for class discussion and is a safe read for those who will still think on their own and not just assimilate the last book they've read as their own personal world view.The book is basically broken down into two parts. The first part outlines the six ethical postions mentioned before. The second part addresses current ethical issues in society; abortion, homosexuality, assisted suicide, separation of church and state, and ecology among others."},{"Title":"Christian Ethics: Options and Issues","review":"Geisler manages to slaughter an entire army of straw-men in this book. I was rather disappointed, as Geisler is usually a very good author. In fact, I even agree with him in choosing graded absolutism over any of the other ethical options he treated. However, in all fairness to the other positions, Geisler simply painted a simplistic picture of each and attacked positions I doubt that many people really hold. Not only that, but he did not give responses other positions would give to arguments made against them, yet for graded absolutism he had many pages responding to criticisms of it. It was simply not a fair overview of different ethical approaches. It would be fine if this were a book about graded absolutism, but it's not a good thing for a book setting out to be an introduction to ethical systems.As to the second half where he gives consideration to specific ethical dilemmas (e.g. abortion, suicide, etc.) he once again fails to give positions he disagrees with a fair hearing. Mind you, I agree with most of Geisler's decisions, so I am not complaining that he did not give my positions a fair hearing. I am complaining that my position did not win fairly in Geisler's book. It was pitted against very simplistic and biased opinions of what other positions believe, and I am frankly quite disappointed in Geisler for putting out such an unfair evaluation of those views.Overall grade: D+"},{"Title":"Christian Ethics: Options and Issues","review":"Book great condition at a great value. Received in a timely manner."},{"Title":"The Biorhythm Kit: Plan for the Ups and Downs in Your Life","review":"This is a mixed bag. On the one hand, the book which comes with the wheel is excellent -- easily the best book on biorhythms I have read. The author goes into great detail enumerating the different patterns one could encounter in a biorhythm chart, something which is extraordinarily helpful.On the other hand, the biorhythm wheel, though fun, very clever indeed and really really simple to use, is nonetheless awkward and &quot;clunky&quot;, and the author's assertion that no good biorhythm software exists is simply . . . outdated. The problem has to do with the wheel's construction. The little tabs don't want to move independently and easily, which makes it difficult to use. The resulting &quot;chart&quot; is not printable and is rather small, and so it is hard to see and read. Plus, if you do a chart for a family or friend, and then want to go back and view your own chart you have to start all over from scratch and recalculate.As I said, Great Idea, but flawed execution. I would recommend the book, but use some of the freeware or shareware available on the net to do the calculations."},{"Title":"The Biorhythm Kit: Plan for the Ups and Downs in Your Life","review":"The book is drafted in an easy to read format and simple to understand graphics.It is an excellent book for beginners and experienced users of biorhythm.I use biorhythms to train since I'm an olympic weightlifter and I want to avoid injuries.This book provides a biorhythm wheel with which you study your three graphs independently of the calendar year you are in.This is a plus since the book I had before took me up to the year 1999 only.Although for me it was little bit awkward,at first,using the wheel,afterwards it became very easy.I congratulate the author Jacyntha Crawley for her good work."},{"Title":"The Biorhythm Kit: Plan for the Ups and Downs in Your Life","review":"This book included a chart for the three basic biorhythms with the clearest explanations of the various combinations. Should be the first read on the subject."},{"Title":"The Biorhythm Kit: Plan for the Ups and Downs in Your Life","review":"I enjoyed the book and learnt a lot while reading it. I also found that being able to calculate biorhythms for myself helped me to believe the information which was placed before me - and also enabled me to go further into the subject - which I peronally find fascinating. After a long search I discovered that the author has a website... and that she responds reasonably quickly to individual queries....I hope she writes more books in due course."},{"Title":"The Biorhythm Kit: Plan for the Ups and Downs in Your Life","review":"The book came in great condition,but there is no biorhythm wheel to look up the days readings,so the book is useless.. I've written,requesting a wheel be sent to me,but have received no reply..Not impressed in the slightest."},{"Title":"The Biorhythm Kit: Plan for the Ups and Downs in Your Life","review":"Biorhythm theory was a silly pseudoscientific fad of the 1960s and 1970s. It has been the subject of over 100 scientific studies and the results are clear: Biorhythm theory is totally invalid. People belive in it because of selective memory and other cogitive illusions."},{"Title":"Parents on trial; why kids go wrong or right,","review":"Maybe the worst book I've ever read, and I used to work as a volunteer with Teen Challenge, and still support them. But Wilkinson totally did not understand this issue. He dealt with scores of troubled teens and came to the conclusion that their parents were to blame. He did not take into consideration personal responsibility. We are accountable for our decisions. Parents can teach morality, but can't make their kids moral. They can take them to church, but can't make their kids believe. They can warn about the dangers of drugs, sex, alcohol, but can't stop their kids from harmful lifestyles. They can encourage mature decisions, but ultimately kids have to make their own decisions.It is my understanding that supposedly Wilkinson admitted that he should have not written this book. Parenting is tough. I've been to war, and I've had kids, and war was easier. But I am not responsible for my children's choices. This is a dreadful book, and I suspect some who've read it may have decided to not have children. What would Wilkinson say about the parents who prayed, taught their kids to be responsible, yet the kids still turned out bad? Even in the Bible there are plenty of examples of good parents whose kids didn't do well.If everything is the fault of parents, then parents of troubled teens should blame THEIR parents...in other words, no one is to blame. This is absurd. Parents do the best they can, some don't do a great job, but even kids whose parents were neglectful often turn out OK. The reason is individual choice."},{"Title":"Salvaged","review":"An uncompromising masterwork of free verse, uncompromising with any abridgement or oppression of the totality of human experience. Gestalt in its vision, modernistic in its themes, dreamlike in its contours, SALVAGED has the stuff of greatness. What could, in some manner, be called 'maximalist' poetry, it reads like a text written on the warm sea of life itself. Take a deep breath and plunge into it; it will thaw your dot-com frozen blood."},{"Title":"Queering the Pitch : The New Gay and Lesbian Musicology","review":"Queering the Pitch is the first anthology to be published in the new field of queer musicology (although it does draw from works like Solie's &quot;Musicology and Difference&quot; collection.)The quality of the fourteen essays here varies greatly. Some, like Philip Brett's &quot;Musicality, Essentialism, and the Closet&quot; are absolutely earthshaking-provacative, well-written, and inspiring. Other essays seem a bit out of place, and show how much work their needs to be done in this field. It occasionally feels as if the editors had to scrape around to find enough material for the collection.The three editors, all well-known musicologists, are to be commended for this effort. The book is already something of a classic, and has certainly helped to legitimitize this field of inquiry."},{"Title":"Queering the Pitch : The New Gay and Lesbian Musicology","review":"I love this book. The style is approachable and dynamic, and the ideas are still exciting ten years after the book was published. The authors cover a wide range of topics both historical and contemporary and come from different theoretical stand points. The articles not only focus on composition and performance but also on listenership and the gendered power relationships involved in that. As a first year postgraduate student involved in gay and lesbian studies of music I found this book inspirational and invigorating because of the high quality of scholarship involved. Queering the Pitch is a much more interesting read than several more recent collections of queer musicology because of the strength of the ideas involved but especially energetic and transparent writing styles which avoid the stogyness that musicology can often suffer from."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"I now have all of the FBI series to date and am hoping for more.

KEEP THEM COMING."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"I like the series. A friend suggested these books. At some point in most of the books (so far) the story has too many conflicts.I may continue to read because they are easy."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"I had to suspend too much belief too often--for the plot and the romance. And I rarely have a problem with that and usually enjoy over-the-top. It was also anti-liberal, almost racist or perhaps \\"just\\" insensitive, and relentlessly preached death penalty. The suspense was there, even if it got a bit melodramatic at times.

Chosen for her special talents by special agent Dillion Savich, she is assigned to his division in Washington DC. Thus Coulter's famous crime fighter team is born.When a vicious murder in Boston that hints of her sister's killing, Sherlock runs off to investigate and the action begins. Coulter gives us a well-written novel that keeps you turning pages with every suspenseful and twisted moment of the action filled story."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"This book made for decent light reading, despite some unrealistic plot elements and dialogue. I just had to ignore the whole \\"super computer that magically helps solve crimes\\" issue by simply reminding myself that this was written in 1997. It still was a suspenseful little page-turner, but not the best I've read.The real reason why I'm writing this review is to express my annoyance at Ms. Coulter's depiction of African-Americans. I recall a handful of black characters in the book. One is Isabelle, the live-in housekeeper/cook for the Sherlock family (a very rich white household), one is Ms. Lily, the owner of a night club, one is Marvin, the intimidating but sweet bouncer at the club who calls every female \\"Chicky\\", one is a cab driver, one is a homeless drug addict, and two are cops (one of whom is also a temporary school janitor). Not all of the character portrayals are offensive. Sometimes the characters are simply described as \\"black\\" for descriptive purposes (even though no other ethnic groups are referred to in this manner). There was just something about the author's characterizations that began to irritate me a bit. Maybe it was the author's need to repeatedly describe characters as \\"black\\". For example, the taxi driver (a very minor character) is referred to as being \\"black\\" no less than three times. Some of Ms. Coulter's specific descriptions are borderline offensive. Marvin is described as being \\"surprisingly gentle\\" (p. 231), Ms. Lily is described as a \\"super-endowed black lady\\" (p. 169), the cab driver is described as giving a \\"huge, white-toothed smile\\" (p. 293), and Isabelle is described as having \\"ample breasts\\" (p. 238). I also recall one of the FBI cases in the book involving a \\"couple black guys killing Asian people in Alabama and Mississippi\\" (p. 164). Perhaps the author could be a little more tactful in the future. An author can still be descriptive of diverse characters without being offensive or stereotypical. I myself am not African-American, so I can only imagine how all this could come across to someone who was."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"Even though this actually the second book in the series I read it first. I was hooked from page 1. I think the characters of Savich and Sherlock have great chemistry. So glad they show up in all future books. You don't have to read them in order I didn't but if you prefer it you can. These books were probably what got me hooked on mysteries. If you're looking for War and Peace this isn't the book for you. If you are looking for a good book for a quiet weekend at home I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"O.K. story. Not very good writing. Very suprised at how popular this book is and how many people recommend it. Primary characters not developed very well. Secondary characters seem to be better developed. I felt like I knew Lacey's mother better than Lacey at the end of the book and the mother isn't mentioned very often. I wasn't dissapointed the book was ending which is a big indicator to me of how good it is."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"Kudos to Catherine Coulter! No doubt, this book is a keeper and a great reread time and time again. Personally, The Maze makes my all time favorite top 5 list and is Coulter's BEST WORK TO DATE!"},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"I loved Catherine Coutler's The Maze; I finished it in one day because it was a book I couldn't put down. I have read Coulter's other books, but I definitely think that she should write more suspense. Coulter uniquely integrated her murder plot with bits of humor, making her &quot;edge of the seat&quot; novel interesting and funny at the same time. I also liked the incorporation of romance as a subplot, but Coulter was careful to not make too much use of it less she run the risk of taking away from her murder plot. Also, it has been my experience that, in FBI or police murder mysteries, the author arbitrarily presents additional &quot;cases&quot; that never get resolved and you close the book wondering what happened to them. But, Coulter made sure that any &quot;case&quot; she mentioned was solved. My only critical remark is that I didn't like how Coulter tried to make a story out of the main character's parents. They were characters that didn't provide much to the overall story--or it could be because of the way Coulter used them.I have already suggested this book to one friend and will continue to pass it along because it was so exceptional! I am looking forward to the next Catherine Coulter suspense novel"},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"If I were giving awards for the worst book I have read in many years, The Maze would easily win. The plot is unbelievable, the characters shallow and mean, the dialog childish and the romance sappy. The one redeeming feature is the encouragement this book must give to aspiring writers. Surely, if Catherine Coulter can make a living writing this badly, anyone can. Judging from the number of four and five star ratings given this book, there is a good market for bad writing!"},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"Seven years ago, Lacey Sherlock's sister was brutally murdered in a maze of horrors. Since that time Lacey has devoted herself to finding the murderer, quipped by the media as the String murderer. After finishing college and receiving her Master's degree in Criminal Psychology, she immediately applies and is accepted into the FBI program. Finding the job of profiling to much to handle, she is routed to the Criminal Apprehension Unit, whose director, Dillon Savich has developed a unique computer program to capture serial killers. Dillon is an intelligent man who senses that Lacey has deep secrets. And as Lacey secretly uses the Predictive Analogue Programs to find the String Murder, Dillon must join in her crusade to eliminate the killer, before Lacey becomes the next victim..What a great novel!!! I enjoyed the suspense, character development and budding relationship between Lacey and Dillon. My only gripes with the book were with the secondary characters and the unanswered questions. For example, did we really have to have Hannah's character, the bitter and obsessed ex-girlfriend?? Alright, so it is done in every romance novel, but it is time that female authors move beyond this predictable character . The flow of the book would not have been interrupted or slowed if Hannah's character had been deleted. Ms. Coulter's attempts to introduce secondary characters to paint a convincing line of suspects were successful in some areas (Douglas and Candice) . However, extensively including Sherlock's parents in the story was confusing. There were also many questions left unanswered, such as Douglas's relationship with Lacey's mother, which was hinted at but never explained. How did Lacey's sister meet the murderer?But the saving grace of this book, and maybe the reason why so many people enjoyed it, was the relationship between Lacey and Dillon. I enjoyed reading through their debates and even smiled at some of their attempts at humor. In this novel, intelligence wasn't just tallied as a positive attribute and then never mentioned (or more importantly, demonstrated) again. You have a real sense that you are dealing with intellectual persons instead of cardboard personas with a \\"Hey, I'm smart\\" button. Great job!! On top of that, kudos to any author that can write an intelligent, confident female character without making her into a &quot;B&quot;. I can't wait to read more by the author."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"Wow, I could not put this book down!!

I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to try something sinfully good."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"Why did I ever finish this book? I have to agree with the reviewer from CA - the dialog was so adolescent, I was embarrassed I was reading it. The continual unrealistic character building of potential suspects was, frankly, unbelievable. Subplots were never resolved. I often felt I was reading the writings of a teenage author. For example, the cheering and high-fives by the police and FBI following the killing of 2 men, which had just brutalized 2 women, was juvenile. After the shooting of one man in the 'back of the neck', blood pouring out of his nose and mouth, the victim continued to carry on several paragraphs of perfectly coherent conversation, with better grammer and vocabulary than he displayed through-out the book. I have to say this was one of the most disappointing of Coulter's books I have read."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"Coulter gets high marks for this book. The instant chemistry between Savich and Sherlock is enough reason to read this book. However the suspense and danger surrounding the maze creates thrill and excitement. I had such a hard time putting this book down that I stayed up all night to read it. Coulter began the FBI series with The Cove, which was a good book, but the Maze is the definite front runner. The characters of Savich and Sherlock are so likeable that they make appearances in her following FBI series. I was actually disappointed that they were moved to secondary characters because these agents definitely deserve the spotlight. This is a definite buy, and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"I love catherine coulter. I have read all of her books and this one is great.

I loved Lacey, she was definately not your typical romance heroine which was nice because too often they are breathtakingly beautiful women who walk around and have men fall at their feet. Also, Lacey was extremly smart and was a good match for Dillon. Some of their intellectual battles were very entertaining. Although Lacey was obsessed with her sister's death, she didn't let it crontrol her every move. Dillon was the perfect match for her. They were very similar, and that's what made it seem like they were being drawn together. The mystery and suspense seemed to be shoving the love story out though. I wanted more of a romance, but it turned out to be more of a thriller then anything else. The only reason that I didn't give this book five stars (it was extremly good in the uniquness of storyline and the lines that moved you to the end of your seat) was because the climax in the plot seemed to occure towards the begining of the book rather then at the end.

After an impressive drill/test, Dillion asks the department to assign Lacey to his force. Fortunately for her, this would allow her to track her sisters killer on the side. While all this is going on, the killer strikes again in Boston, her brother-in-law seems to be falling for her, Dillions ex who also works in the same department send her the evil jealous eye, and her family seems to be looney as ever with her insane mother hinting at her father trying to kill her. Not to mention falling in love for the first time since her sisters death...This book was a page turner, really well paced and kept me guessing til the end. However, the romance btw Lacey and Dillion didnt seem all that hot to be honest. They went from being totally professional to being in bed one night to talking about marriage, er yea... it just didnt seem all that real, the romance between these two seemed forced, more like an after thought.Don;t read this book expecting great romance, you'll get disappointed... but since the suspense/mystery is so great you wont even care. Overall its time and money well spent!"},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"Are you ready for a thriller that introduces many serial killers and shows you a side of the FBI that you normally don't see? Then grab The Maze and hold on tight. It will have you gripping the edge of your seat and cheering for Lacey Sherlock, an FBI agent, as she tracks down her sister's killer with the help of her boss, Dillon Savich. It is a full blown thriller, with a hint of romance, that leads you around by the scruff of your neck. This is a nice added addition to Coulter's &quot;FBI&quot; series. I am looking forward to seeing Sherlock and Dillion in The Target. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"Dillon is a dream...he sings, whips up pesto, makes the laptop dance, captures homocidal maniacs. Lacey is his soul mate, a heroine who's not afraid to act as serial killer bait. The romance was top-notch, the suspense edge-of-your-seat. The Toaster killings were amazingly scary. I only hope Coulter brings Savich and Sherlock back in more interesting stories than The Target and The Edge, because both were disappointing."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"I have very little time to sit down and read, so I've learned that books on tape work for me. I am on my fourth round of listening to this wonderful book. Not because it's difficult to follow but, because it's so wonderfully written. It has everything I look for in a book murder, suspence, mystery, romance, surprise.Lacey Sherlock is so spirited, bright and independent. Dillon Savitch is tough but sensitive. Both are a wonderful combination together.Surely Catherine Coulter can't stop here! I hope she continues to write more books with these two FBI characters and their friends, family and co-workers. I want to know what happens, no I have to know what happens with their professional and personal lives.Please Catherine Coulter write many more books on these two wonderful, believable characters."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"For the past seven years, Lacey Sherlock has had one reason to live - catch the String Killer, a serial killer who murdered her beloved sister, Belinda. Lacey has dedicated her life to attaining her objective. To accomplish her quest, Lacey joins the FBI and graduates high enough in her class at Quantico to be selected for the Criminal Apprehension Unit, run by Dillon Savich.Lacey quickly demonstrates that she has the ability to become an outstanding agent. While off-duty she searches for any clues to the identity of the String Killer. Dillon comprehends what is new star pupil is doing, but decides to let her continue in a more official capacity because she seems to have a lead to the killer's identity. Her work, including suing herself as a lure to the murderer, leads to the arrest of Merlin Jones. However, Merlin denies killing Lacey's sibling and there are clear cracks in the evidence that proves the suspect is a murderer, but may not be the String Killer, leaving Lacey in a quandary as to what to do next.THE MAZE is a great romantic suspense that lifts readers to the highest levels of the atmosphere. The obsessive Lacey plays true as she struggles between what once appeared to be the fulfillment of her quest and the holes in the evidence. Dillon, a computer whiz, is the ideal boss for an intrepid female. Catherine Coulter renowned for her historical romances, deserves best seller status with this fabulous action thriller."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"This was one of the first books that I have read by Catherine Coulter and it was the catalyst for my love of all of her books. The story was amazing and the characters seemed very believable (but as I have yet to meet any FBI angents I simply don't know). Her way with words and the scenes which she paints bring the story alive and throughout the book you find yourself rooting for Sherlock and Savich (the heroine and hero) in all that they are doing. It is my fondest wish that she continue with her amazing writing and that she continues to come out with these amazing books."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"I don't usually like reading romance specific books. I enjoy books where characters develop a romance as a result of a mystery. So I must say I truly enjoyed reading the Maze. I enjoyed the characters of Dillon and Sherlock so much that I went and purchased the Target, just because they were in the book. I will be reading the Target shortly. Then I searched the bookstore for The Cove which I also plan to read. I really hope that Ms. Coulter will bring the characters of Dillon and Sherlock back sometime in the near future.

When I found out that he had a book of his own, I was excited. What I really liked about this book is how Lacey and Dillon fell in love slowly. I also liked how Ms. Coulter gave details. I also found humor in this book, a rare thing. I thought her parents were hilarious. What I didn't like was there was hardly any actual romance going on. I also didn't like the backstory with Lacey and her sister, Belinda. What kind of sister does that to her sister. All in all, I really liked this book and looking forward to &quot;The Target&quot;."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"Catherine Coulter does it again. What a enthralling book. Lacey Sherlock is driven to find the man who killed her sister. What better way to do that than to join the FBI. There she meets Dillon Savich who brings her into his computer forensic team. She is right where she needs to be in order to find out about the String Killer. During this time, Sherlock and Savich are becoming closer by working out together at the gym and working on the same cases. Finally, after seven years, the killer strikes again. She recognizes his m.o. immediately and rushes to Boston to capture him. Unfortunately, she does not tell Savich what she is doing and then the fun begins. He is furious that she has not told him of her past. After several days, he decides to let her pursue the case, but only with him as her partner. Many twists and turns follow to make you wonder if the string killer really did it.Was it the jealous husband? Was it her judgemental father? Her crazy mother? This book will keep you guessing until the end. Sherlock and Savich are a lot fun and their love story is wonderful. Also, if you read the first book in this series, The Cove, then look for James and Sally Quinlan."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"I was able to finish this book, but not without cringingcountless times at the utterly horrible dialogue! I am not sure whatthe author was trying to accomplish with the mind-numbing, juvenile banter between the characters, but I was embarrassed for her throughout the book. These characters are supposed to be members of the FBI and yet they sound like adolescents for the most part. Conversations consist mostly of disjointed thoughts without any description of the speaker's mannerisms. For a book that starts with an introduction praising the editors for their work, I can only wonder, what was anyone involved in this book thinking! For a good romantic thriller, check out Kay Hooper's After Caroline. The people sound realistic in this book.Another gripe, how the heck was Sherlock able to get into the FBI in the first place?

Unfortunately, for her, it will probably be my last. The story line intrigued me because I like thrillers and mysteries. However, this book was so poorly written, I can't believe it was ever edited! The characters are childish and/or brutish, the dialogue is juvenile (do FBI agents really speak this way?), and I can't believe the FBI wouldn't know a candidate's sister was murdered by a serial killer!

Now Lacey is an FBI agent determined to use her access to find the perpetrator. But when she offers herself up as bait, the String Killer has a surprise for her....The Maze was my first venture into the so-called \\"romantic suspense\\" genre. I had not originally intended to take this trip down a previously untraveled road, but I found the audiobook on a table of free stuff at work and decided it would be an experiment that was relatively free of risk.My low expectations led to a pleasant surprise. I had feared that The Maze would be basically a romance novel with suspense overtones, but Coulter actually does a fine job capturing all the nuances I've come to expect from the serial-killer subgenre (if not the explicit violence a horror fan like myself would anticipate).Of course, given the target audience, Lacey's relationship with her boss Dillon Savich instantly turns into antagonistic flirting (which everyone recognizes but them) and quickly progresses beyond that (albeit with unrealistic speed). But that is a minor quibble, and the existence of sequels featuring the pair told me that would happen, anyway. The Maze is actually quite suspenseful and fast-paced and kept me guessing to the end. And that's all I was looking for."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"I happened to buy the Kindle combo of The Maze and The Cove. Now, The Cove was terrible, so this book comes off a little better in comparison.The thing that bothered me most (besides the plot holes, lack of suspense, and telegraphed ending) was the dialogue. The characters speak in short, unrelated sentences that come off as stilted and lame. Every character speaks that way. I don't really know why the author writes dialogue that way.Anyway, save your money. There are much better mysteries out there."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"Remember Dillion Savich from The Cove?

Great action, great suspense, characters that make you want to tear your hair out one minute and laugh the next.

And though I did cringe through the love scenes and stupid conversations, I was interested enough in the meat of the story to plough through it. And it was worth it.

I don't know how anyone of you that read this book actually managed to give the book 5 stars. It was horribly written. The book actually starts off really good, which is how you get trapped into reading the rest of it in the first place. As the book goes it starts to make no sense at all. Too many things just don't add up. Too many questions are left unanswered. Like did Douglas and Lacy's mother have an affair? If not then why in the world did Ms. Coulter write that part in, where he goes into her hospital room and display the show of tender affection that he did??? HELP ME OUT WITH THAT ONE PLEASE. I also have some other strong issues concerning this book but I don't want to give away the plot and reveal the very stupid ending for anyone that just has to read this book.I've decided to stick with her historical writings and when I'm in need of suspense writings I will look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"In the first book, The Cove, I ignored the one or two references to &quot;liberal judges&quot; and read on. In this book, however, there were too many to ignore.

Yet in both these stories, the female victom is suffering from repressed memories from her youth which drives her behavior and we are led to sympathize with her.

Lacey reminds me a lot of Clarice Starling in this book. I admire her dedication and her passion for her job. I don't approve of her going off on her own to get her sister's killer though,that was dumb,and Dillion was kind and understanding and patient in helping her. I do wonder how Lacey got into the FBI with this need to help catch her sister's killer though,shouldn't someone in security doing the screening seen that and had a duscreet word with Lacey about it?

Did you kill Belinda?&quot; &quot;Why should I tell you anything?&quot; &quot;So I can judge which of you is a better man, Marlin, you or your daddy. I can't really know until you tell me about Belinda. Did you kill her?&quot; This is one of the many quotes that show the tension and suspense that flows throughout the whole novel. The Maze was one of those books that you can't put down. It grabs your attention and doesn't let go of it until you have completed the novel. Catherine Coulter is a best-selling author of romance novels, and four contemporary suspense novels. The Maze is a riveting book that is packed with action and spine-tingling romantic suspense that helps to reveal the theme to the reader. Catherine Coulter's novel, The Maze, was jammed packed with themes, but the one I feel was most evident was the theme that sometimes horrible events and experiences will occur, but eventually they will lead to GREAT things. Rather than jamming the theme into the last few pages, Coulter had the theme running throughout the entire novel. This theme was clearly seen throughout the novel because the reader continually saw how Lacey Sherlock had suffered a great deal ever since her older sister died. She was faced with terrible nightmares for as long as seven years, and was forced to live in a world, which she felt was always out to get her. Eventually, after seven years of torture and nightmares, the brutal death of her sister led her to discover that her real passion and love was working in the FBI. It also led her to meet someone who she would fall in love with. I would give this novel four and a half stars because I didn't want to put the book down. I found myself wanting to read at every possible moment just to find out what was going to happen. For anyone who loves reading, or maybe even hates reading, you will definitely love this book.

I'm amazed at the number of 5-star reviews this book garnered, since I could've written the dialogue from this book when I was a sophomore in high school.To give just one example (out of dozens of possibilities), when an agent on the CAU is caught leaking information to the press, her confrontation with her superior read more like a fight behind the bleachers during homecoming than anything you would expect from professionals. Would said agent really be simply reassigned? Wouldn't the superior have something a little more cutting to say about the lapse than the comebacks that were about as snappy as \\"Oh, yeah?\\"? I found myself rolling my eyes so often I'm surprised they didn't stick that way.In short, the plot had promise, but the immature writing brings this book down in quality to the point that it's hard to believe an author of Coulter's stature actually wrote it.

It has to be the most imaginative one (but only by a little) Sherlock and Savich are a great couple and you have to wonder what kind of mind would come up with that plot and how to pull off everything so it was believeable for the most part. The Maze, as logic would have it is about a criminal who ingeniusly uses mazes as his calling card. Not only did this book keep me on the edge of my seat but it kept me turing pages faster and faster to see what would happen next. I also finished the book with such a happy and warm feeling. If you have to be up early the next morning DO NOT start this book just before bed. I can guarantee you will still be up reading when the sun comes up. I was!!!

When they reached the center, instead of being set free, he would punish the woman by multiple stab wounds and then cut out her tongue.

It is a good thing I read this one first! I did not like the other two at all, but from the moment I started reading The Maze I was hooked. It is an incredibley good book and second in my list of favorites only to Jeffery Deaver's The Bone Collector. I liked Sherlock a lot, she is probably my favorite female character. However, it was Savich that made the book remarkable. You can't help but fall in love with Savich, with his karate and his country-western-singing and his easyness with Sherlock. Not to mention his dreamy blue eyes.. LOL Savich is in fact so memorable that I am going to name my Siamese cat after him when I get it. You have to admit, also, that Dillon is a great name. I like Catherine Coulter's style of writing in this book, it is unusual but good. The novel is very suspenseful and has a climatic ending. The tension between Savich and Sherlock as their relationship developes from work to friendship to love is intense. I loved this book, and I just wish the other two were as good..."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"This embarrasingly adolescent book has absolutely no redeeming virtues, and I would recomend fans of the genre to look elsewhere: to James Patterson, Martin Cruz Smith, or Patricia Cornwell.Although the book is supposed to be set in Washington, DC, the city is unrecognizable. Compared to Patterson, who salts his Alex Cross books with details that reflect knowledge of and affection for the city, Coulter seems to have never visited DC, or even bothered looking at a map of the city.Worse, her characters are disconnected from the world the rest of us live in. One of the two main characters openly engages in what can only be called sexual harrassment towards the other main character, but the other characters watch this with approval, as does Coulter herself.Naming this new organization within the FBI the \\"Criminal Apprehension Unit\\" is another example of Coulter's laziness. What, exactly, does she think the rest of the FBI does, if not apprehend criminals? Another lazy shortcut is the \\"magic computer\\" that is the chief investigative asset of this \\"Criminal Apprehension Unit\\". While computers are indispensible to the modern investigator, Coulter doesn't bother including them in ways that make sense. She pays no attention to their real capabilities.In short, this book is terrible, with amateurish style, unbelievable characters, and a ridiculous plot. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"The Maze (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"My mother got this book out of the library for me.

The suspense kept me on the edge of my seat, to use a hackneyed phrase. :) I adored Savich &amp; Sherlock, they have become two of my favorite characters &amp; I hope Coulter continues to develop them in future books. I was pleased to see them return in &quot;The Target&quot;. Catherine, your thrillers are AMAZING, please keep them coming!

The characters never came to life, parts of the plot were totally unbelievable and the ending was &quot;telegraphed&quot; from the beginning. I kept checking the coyright to make sure Catherine Coulter was the author. The dialog consistently reminded me of an episode of Dragnet, even the love scenes.This is more a diatribe against the &quot;liberal&quot; media, defense attorneys and giving someone accused of a crime any civil rights than a novel. In this novel, everything is black and white, there are no subtleties. Female characters are never civil to each other, let alone friendly or supportive. The female characters in this book are either sluts, crazy, jealous, antagonistic or some combination of the above - except for the heroine, who is, of course, almost a virgin. The male characters are not much better, although a few do manage to be supportive of the heroine.I found several items unbelievable but none so much as the fact that a daughter of a well-known judge was murdered by a serial killer and, when her sister applies to the FBI 7 years later, the investigatioin does not turn up this fact.

The reader is treated to one of her nightmares at the start of the book and it is scary. We come to the present and find Sherlock and partner MacDougal climbing a rope as part of their final physical tests.From this exercise and a scenario in the FBI's \\"Hogan's Alley\\", we can see Lacey Sherlock's grit and determination. Lacey meets up with Dillon Savich, head of the Criminal Apprehension Unit, as he poses as the villain in the Hogan's Alley scenario. He admires her \\"never say die\\" attitude as he bests her again and again until her partner tosses her a weapon and she \\"shoots\\" him -- red paint all over his shirt and tie now.Lacey is excited to be asked to join Savich's unit as while she had wanted to be a Profiler she found that it was just too intense an gory for her. Savich's unit uses computer databasing and modelling -- programs Savich wrote -- to help find patterns and similarities to other crimes to catch criminals that have crossed state lines. The CAU as it is called is asked in by local law enforcement or go in on their own when the crimes become national.Lacey is lucky enough to accompany Savich as his partner is with his wife who is giving birth and go to Chicago to apprehend the killer know as \\"The Toaster.\\" The process that went into figure out who The Toaster is has been thought out and detailed very well in this plot line. Lacey also gets to see that Savich is not a glory hound and that he helps the locals come to the same conclusions he did so that they get the notoriety.However, after a seven year hiatus, the String Killer strikes again this time in Boston and Lacey is off and running. Her single mindedness and persistence are both frustrating and worthy of admiration to Savich as he works to get to the bottom of her focus.I found this to be a scary story with many suspects including her half-sister's widower, and more!!

Adams served for six years as President of the Union Pacific Railroad before its 1890 bankruptcy and acquired the reputation of a reformer, which White finds mostly undeserved. In reading White's book, I had the impression that there was more to Adams than White wanted to admit.Charles Francis Adams (1835 -- 1915) was the great grandson of John Adams and the grandson of John Quincy Adams. His father and namesake was the United States Ambassador to Great Britain during the Civil War and played a pivotal role in keeping Britain out of the conflict and in maintaining peace. Charles Francis Adams was also a strong presidential contender in his own right. Adams' younger brother Henry became famous as a historian and of the author of his own autobiography, \\"The Education of Henry Adams\\".Charles Francis Adams, Jr. was faced with the pressure of living up to his famous forbearers, and it showed. The pressure is apparent throughout his Autobiography which he wrote in 1913 for the Massachusetts Historical Society of which he had long served as president. The autobiography was published in 1916 following Adams' death together with a lengthy Memorial Address delivered by Henry Cabot Lodge.Although it has fallen into obscurity, perhaps due to the inevitable comparison with his brother's great book, Charles Adams' Autobiography is worth knowing. Adams tries honestly to reflect on his own life. In part, Adams appears as the curmudgeonly class-conscious son of privilege portrayed in Richard White's study of the transcontinentals, but Adams is more. Adams reflects on his shortcomings as well as on his undoubted achievements and offers what he sees to be the sense of and result of his long life. Discussing the high accomplishments and Puritanical, driven characters of his two presidential ancestors and of his father, Adams concludes that he got more pleasure and enjoyment from life than did his forbearers. He concludes a lengthy discussion of this matter: \\"In other directions also, I have perhaps, accomplished nothing considerable, compared with what my three immediate ancestors accomplished; but on the other hand, I have done some things better than they ever did; and, what is more and most of all, I have had a much better time in life -- got more enjoyment out of it. In this respect I woould not change with any of them.\\"Adams' Autobiography has many of the components of a modern coming of age story as the author reflects throughout on what he wanted to do with his life and on his search for a calling. The book is in five chapters which describe, respectively, Adams early years and education through Harvard, his legal career and his observations of politics following the election of Lincoln, Adams' experiences in Washington, D.C. in 1861 before his father became Ambassador to Britain, Adams' Civil War experiences, in which he rose to the rank of Colonel, and finally, his lengthy and varied life following the Civil War. Each of these chapters are highly interesting and have a great deal to say about Adams and his era. It is valuable to hear Adams discuss his father who, when Adams was a child, took him fishing for one day while begrudging the time because it took him away from matters of importance. Adams discusses his unsuccessful legal career in which he labored for some years in a profession for which he was unsuited and which he hated. Adams discusses Civil War Washington and his reactions to people he knew including William Seward, Charles Sumner, and Andrew Johnson.The Civil War and Harvard were the formative influences on Adams' life. The central portions of the Autobiography describe Adams' decision to enlist while most of the rest of his family was in Britain. The War, Adams writes, helped give him a sense of purpose. It gave him a sense of independence and comradeship and of nature all of which he lacked in his upbringing. Subsequent experiences and reading taught Adams about Darwinism and severely modified his Puritanism and religious beliefs. These experiences also taught him about his calling as a historian and as a writer.Adams became a successful businessman in his work as a railroad executive and in other endeavors. He lived, as he acknowledged, as busy and varied life in which he combined his business interests with his scholarly interests. He felt, with some justification, that he had spread himself too thin. The Autobiography expresses his wish to earn a vast sum of money in business and then leave it to Harvard to encourage the growth of education and wisdom,Unfortunately, the Autobiography has long been out of print. I am reading a copy of the 1916 edition and I can't vouch of the accuracy of the offprint which I am reviewing. It is worth knowing about Charles Francis Adams' Autobiography and the insights it offers into himself and into the Civil War Era and Gilded Age. The book will be of most value to readers with a serious interest in these periods of American history.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was originally published as Alice's Adventures Under Ground.

Lewis Carroll has an unique writing style; it is unlike anything that I have read before. His use of words give a sharp image in the reader's head, just like as if they were actually there. He uses excellent imagery. His descriptions on every single character were great,and that was one thing that I enjoyed. An example of his descriptions is in the beginning of chapter six, when Alice sees a footman in front of a house. Carroll describes the footman &quot;with a found face, and large eyes like a frog&quot;. He is one of the few authors that take the time to describe the supplementary characters. The main character is , of course, Alice. She is very adventurous, and this is seen throughout the book. Anything that she sees that is new, she will try it. In the very beginning of her adventures, she sees a potion that is laying around, and in hopes of getting into the garden that she saw earlier, she drank some of it, just because it said &quot;drink me&quot;. The potion made her very small, which eventually became an adventure within itself. Another example was when she went to play croquet with the queen. They played croquet with hedgehogs as balls and flamingoes as sticks. Alice didn't care what the adventure was, as long as she was a part of it.She also didn't hesitate to express her opinions. When the queen was executing everyone in her path, Alice spoke up about what she was doing. People who like adventurous characters would like Alice. The theme of this book to me is if you see something new, you should try it just for the fun of doing something new. It is shown by Alice's different adventures, like what I mentioned in the previous paragraphs. I didn't really get the plot of this story. I thought that it was to get to the garden that she saw in the beginning of the book. I think that I didn't get it because Carroll jumped from one adventure without finishing the previous one. That is one of the reasons why I gave this book three stars out of five. I didn't like this story, partially because it was fantasy. I just read it to try something different. I would recommend this book to readers who like reading fantasy and who like to use their imaginations while reading. I don't know why it is a big children's classic, but I didn't like when I was in elementary school and I still don't like it in high school. This book will most likely never become one of my favorite classics. Overall, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; wasn't very effective to me."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"It's amazing that many people have never read this book. After all, it's virtually impossible to find an American unfamiliar with the story, the characters, and the instantly recognizable illustrations. Yet, in truth, plenty of adults have never plowed through the brilliant but dated prose contained within the pages of Alice In Wonderland. And most of those never will because it is perceived as a children's tale and a book that they needn't bother with since they already know the basic story. This is a mistake.Alice In Wonderland is a unique and clever book. The fact that interest in it has survived so long is testament to its quality. The bizarre characters, which visually and playfully appeal to children, converse in clever riddles and political subtext that go over their heads and talk directly to more intellectual adults. This is a ground-breaking work, so completely off-the-wall that it's hard to imagine it having been published so many decades ago.Through The Looking Glass is Carroll's return to Wonderland, a special treat for readers disappointed by Alice In Wonderland's premature ending. The fun and mystery continue and improve in this second volume with the classic and irony-filled chess game.Chess-playing cards, hookah-smoking mushroom dwellers, shape-changing elixirs, and disappearing cats. This is an adult fable. Carroll invites us into his dream, and we share his fantastic experience through the clarity of a writer's genius.

I wanted to be able to read the wonderful poems, like The Walrus and the Carpenter.

Have you ever imagined crawling through a rabbit hole, falling down a well, and ending up in, well... Wonderland. You portably haven't, but now you are. If you now want to know, then you should read Alice in wonderland by Louise Carroll.Alice lets her curiosity get the best of her so she finds herself falling down a long, black hole. She follows the rabbit because she heard it say \\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\\" After she hits the bottom of the well she finds all of these doors that she soon finds out are all locked. After she went around trying all of the doors she found a three-legged table in the middle of the floor with a small gold key on it. The key was to small to fit any of the doors and she starts to wonder how she is going to get out of her. She then finds a curtain, that's where she finds the door that the key fits. Once she opens the door she sees a beautiful garden but she is too large to fit in the door. Alice then finds a bottle marked \\"Drink Me\\" and when she drink it she shrinks. When she shrinks she noticed that she left the key on the table, which now she is too small to get. Then she finds cookies that says, \\"Eat Me\\" so of course Alice being as curiosity that she is she ate it. The cookie made her larger then what she was before. It made her so large that she got stuck. She started to cry, which made her shrink once again. She cried so much that it caused a river of tears. Then she is able to go into the small door, which then starts the whole adventure.Alice meets a lot of wonderful creatures and people during her adventure. She meets a caterpillar that gives her advice. She also meets the Duchess who has the Cheshire cat. The Cheshire cat told Alice to go visit the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse. Alice also meets the Queen of Hearts. If you would like to know what happens to this to alice in her crazy adventure then you should read Alice in wonderland."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"The famous clasic kept me reading for hours.

The experience itself is like a dream, or more probably also like a drug induced high, and the story is infinitely fascinating.

It has adventure, love, fantasy, and a lot of fantastic nonsense. Every page is exciting and mysterious with a bewildering twist. Lewis Carrol exceeds on making a childerns story into a fantastic novel for all ages. He has great imagination that he uses in his puns, riddles, and characters to make nonsense into complete thoughts and morals. Alice is a creative little girl who seems to find adventure around every corner. Everybody in Wonderland is just as creative as Alice; they all seem to be intelligent and fully spirited. This novel is something no one wants to pass by. Personally, I suggest this book becomes a classic everyone should have to read. Many things in this book capture a moment, like this qoute,&quot;The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the Hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. &quot;Who are you?&quot; said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, &quot;I-I hardly know, sir, just at present - at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times sice then.&quot; Another quote that stood out and will help choose this as your next book to read is from the cat. &quot;In that directoin,&quot; The Cat said, waving its paw around, &quot;lives a Hatter: and THAT direction,&quot; waving the other paw, &quot;lives teh March Hare. Visit either you like: They're both mad.&quot; &quot;But I dont want to go amoung mad people,&quot; Alice replied. &quot;oh, you can't help that,&quot; said the Cat.&quot;we're all mad here. I am mad, You are mad.&quot;"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"These books work on so many different levels. My youngest child says she likes them because they are the only books that really give a feeling of how life is to children. Even though they are 150 years old they still seem relevant. (I think maybe that means that Lewis Carroll did not fancy little girls, instead he IDENTIFIED with them). I could keep reading these books through my childhood and teenage and adult years and always find something new. I learned the poetry off by heart and so did my partner (before we met each other) (Lewis Carroll also wrote many more poems and the funny ones are just as good as the ones in these books) The puzzles and contradictions in Alice are fun. And there is a magical feeling of &quot;anything could happen&quot;. To me that never got scary because Alice always coped fine. I too prefer Through the Looking Glss(like another reviewer did) not just for the poems but the whole idea of everything being back to front. These are tremendous books! If you like formal logic then L. Carroll's &quot;Symbolic Logic&quot; is crazy and amusing but also interesting and so are his Tangled Tales about maths. These are not so well known."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Personally, I was disappointed with these books.

The characters are mostly animals with different personalities and can talk, so the characters were okay, but to me they could have been improved on. By this I mean they could have come to life more. Some animals were the white rabbit and the cat like in the disney movie. The overall theme of the book is for Alice(the main character)to get out of Wonderland. On her way home, she meets very strange characters and gets into trouble. One event I found interesting is when she meets the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. Their first encounter was interesting but it was when they met again that I thought was good. Another event is near the end with the Queen of Hearts. To find out what actually occurred pick up the book and read it. Alice is a young girl who wishes there were more things in life and one day when she was out side with her sister she spots this white rabbit with a coat on and a pocket watch. She starts to follow it. She followed it through a rabbit hole and as she hit a soft spot on the ground Alice falls into a hole.

And perhaps it's folly to even try.I grew up with a hard backed copy of Alice in Wonderland and remember going through the pages countless times, gazing at the magnificent pictures--especially the Jabberwock--and giggling at the poetry. \\"Father William\\" and \\"The Walrus and the Carpenter\\" still occupy parts of my brain as snatches and shards that want to pop out at awkward moments.That battle worn, orange backed book, handed down I'm pretty sure from my Dad, and read by him with equal enthusiasm when he was a kid, is long gone, and now that I'm armed with a Kindle I downloaded a copy to enjoy a fine book from my youth. If it's true that you can't go home again, it's even more true that some books will never let you back in. This is one of them.I'm not sure if the fantastic lives of fantasy and fiction that play out daily as hard news have diluted our ability to plunge unrestrained into a book like Alice in Wonderland, or if the book refuses to give up its virtues a second time for a plainer reason: despite its monolithic stature in the pantheon of classics, it was originally written, and still remains, a children's story. Pick it up and expect something more, and you may be disappointed.The prose still snaps and crackles like a bowl of fresh cereal, and the imaginary images still effortlessly dance across your mind's eye, but something's missing, whether in the book or the reader you'll have to judge for yourself.

But that is not the case here. The Disney movie version is based on a combination of both books. I think this is important to mention, as it will hardly be like the movie version we all know.I love the movie (both the 1951 Disney classic and the new Tim Burton version) and figured I would love the book as well, but this book screwed with me. I have always had a vivid imagination, but never non-sensical imagination. That is exactly what Mr. Carroll had when he wrote this book. The book does, however, contain many of the beloved movie characters- the caterpillar, the white rabbit, Queen of Hearts, Mad Hatter, Dormouse, and of course, the Cheshire cat.Overall, the two stories amused me and kept me entertained, but I would not read them again.

What's interesting about this book is that there are several smaller stories strewn throughout. The Mock Turle's Story and The Walrus and The Carpenter are two examples. But, behind this book, there are also elements from Carroll's personal life. It has recently become known about this man that he did indeed dabble with opium from time to time, and that he did fancy the company of young girls, which all conveniently fit into this masterpiece of his. I'm not attacking Lewis Carroll's credibility as an author, I'm merely pointing out how an author's personal life can have a strong influence on his/her work. These factors have not hindered Carroll's work, but in a striking way have perhaps helped to make his work that much more realistic. He incorporated elements of which he was very familiar, and it made this book all the better. On a different subject, the illustrations by Tenniel are simply astounding! His use of light and shadow seem to make these characters come to life!

She cried then, but for the first time since his death, she cried tears of joy. It was a special moment in my life, and I have Carroll to thank for that.It's a story that should be read to or by everyone at some point. With the film adaptations that are coming out recently, it's sad to think that most people who see them have only seen other film or cartoon adaptations. Always go back to the source. This version is wonderful for the young or the old, as it's LARGE PRINT. I really can't say enough good things about this book.

Being that as it is, I will attempt to do this work justice. Lewis Carroll wrote this book for young adults, though it is familiar to young children because of the Disney movie. In actuality, the book may be too scary or difficult to understand for small children.This particular edition contains Alice's \\"Adventures in Wonderland\\" and its sequel \\"Through the Looking Glass\\". These stranges worlds reveal a somewhat spoiled young girl in her explorations of a strange world. Yet Alice might not appear so strange if the characters of these worlds were not so strange. Wonderland being the better of the two stories shows slightly more direction. But like any dream, the story often digresses into the bizarre. As Alice meets each new character, many having no apparent relation to the previous, readers can be frustrated by the lack of cohesiveness. Nothing really ties either story together aside from the return to reality in both stories.Carroll referred to this as a \\"book of nonsense\\". By his own admission, he seems to imply that there is nothing profound about this book. It is merely the musings of a sleeping child.

Also, because they are junior editions they don't have introductions, give author backgrounds, etc. - although I don't believe any of the IJL editions are abridged except for The Three Musketeers."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Another favourite book from childhood is Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (or Alice in Wonderland as it's sometimes called) by Lewis Carroll.The novel was written in 1865 and tells the story of Alice, a young girl who falls down a rabbit hole and into a fantasy world called Wonderland. Once there she comes across a myriad of different characters, all of them anthropomorphic creatures.The tale plays with logic and for this reason has been considered an adult book just as much as a child's book. It's considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre (literature that uses sensical and nonsensical elements to defy language conventions or logical reasoning). Pink Floyd (one of my favourite bands) also famously uses literary nonsense in their song lyrics. The effect of nonsense is often caused by an excess of meaning, rather than a lack of it. Words are left for interpretation and there are usually little messages and meanings hidden and buried within cryptic sentences and paragraphs.For these reasons, the novel has been enormously influential in the creation of the fantasy genre which is known for its use of literary nonsense in the narrative course and structure of those books.The novel is broken up into 12 chapters and each focuses on a different adventure that Alice stumbles upon. Among them is the actual falling down into the rabbit hole and coming across various objects such as a bottle with the words \`drink me' written on it.Alice goes through many body transformations - she shrinks, she grows tall, and she shrinks again. She meets a white rabbit (the one she was chasing to end up in the hole), a lizard, a caterpillar and a frog (all with reminiscent human traits). She also meets a grinning Cheshire Cat before becoming a guest at a mad tea party where she becomes insulted by the Hatter who keeps throwing rhymes and riddles at her that she can't interpret or understand. This causes her to leave in a huff exclaiming that it's the stupidest tea party she had ever been to.After leaving the tea party she comes across a garden where she finds three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because the Queen of Hearts hates white roses. Alice meets the King and Queen (with the Queen screeching \\"Off with your head!\\") to Alice's amusement and is ordered to play a game of croquet with them. The game quickly descends into chaos and Alice meets the Cheshire Cat once again. The Queen wants the cat beheaded but because his whole body basically is his head, this proves impossible.The cat's owner is a duchess and at Alice's request she is brought to the garden party. After this, Alice attends a trial whereby the Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals and throughout the proceedings Alice starts to grow larger. The Queen orders that she must leave and Alice starts to dispute with her causing a commotion which has all the cards tumbling in and around her face.The novel ends with Alice's sister waking her up on the riverbank for tea and brushing leaves from her face (instead of cards). Alice jumps up and wanders off leaving her sister sitting there to imagine all the things that had happened.The novel is famous for its many character allusions. Alice is based on a real girl called Alice Liddell whom Lewis met during a summer when he was rowing in a boat with his friend and his three young daughters. He told them a story that featured a girl called Alice who goes looking for an adventure. The members of the boating party show up in Chapter 3 where the Dormouse tells a story about three little sisters named Elsie, Lacie and Tillie. These are meant to be the Liddell sisters and it's interesting to note that Lacie is actually an anagram of Alice...The relationship between Alice Liddell and Lewis Carroll has caused much sinister controversy over the years. Many biographers have thought that perhaps Lewis was romantically or sexually attracted to the young girl. There has never been any direct proof though and many have also just put it down to a mere fondness for the child. So fond were Carroll's affections for the girl that he even gave Alice the original handwritten manuscript of the story with the inscription \\"A Christmas gift to a dear child in memory of a summer's day\\".Some say he may have even bordered on obsession with her, particularly with his excessive references to her in his later story Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There where there were several direct links between the two girls. There is also an acrostic poem at the end of the novel which spells out Liddell's full name when reading downwards. Although a little strange, it is hard to judge what Carroll's thinking was at the time and without reading between the lines, it truly is a beautiful poem. I'll record it in a separate post after I complete this one.As well as a paradox take on words, Carroll was also a genius with numbers and many mathematical references and concepts were portrayed within the story. In various chapters Alice uses multiplication and subtraction to try to analyse her situations and make sense of her surroundings. It is suggested that in logic and mathematics there is an inverse relationship, and this is something for which Carroll had an in depth knowledge of.Reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland for what it is makes for great reading. But it's only when you start delving deeper and recognising the hidden clues and mysteries that the story contains that the meaning of the novel will take on a whole new form and lead you to explore the story's deeper context.Read more of my book reviews at Storybook Love Affair - [...]"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I am extremely disappointed in online version of this book.

Honestly, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the pink flamingo's paint faded off when I touched it and that bothered me because I like to keep my books in pristine condition. Especially if I have only read them once. However, it was a great buy."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"This was an amazing book! The author's colorful ideas and characters give the reader a sense of wonder as he takes the reader through the many wild adventures of Alice. Lewis Carrol writes in great detail as he describes how Alice jumped down the rabbit hole, struggled with her ever changing size, took care of a baby that turned into a pig, had tea with a mad hatter, and played croquet with a queen. It was easy to relate to Alice and her curiosity and imagination. She longed for an adventure, and that longing is inside of all of us somewhere. It's nice to read a story about someone who actually dares to take the steps into potential danger that we all turn away from daily for fear of the unknown. I am a victim of this fear, but this book made me want to take hold of that childish curiosity and jump into some crazy adventure. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is one of the most beloved children's classics. It has been adapted into numerous cartoons, films and plays over the years, and it has become an important backdrop of the World culture. It is a brilliant and zany fairy tale that remains fresh and engaging well over a century after it had been written. This is in large part thanks to the unforgettable and unique characters that are as famous (if not more) as Alice herself: the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the \\"Mad\\" Hatter, the Queen of Hearts and many more. They are among the most idiosyncratic characters in all of literature. However, the aspects of the book that I found the most fascinating were the clever use of language, the numerous puns, and the plays on the difference between the literal and actual meanings of different expressions and saying. It was very amusing to read these, and realize how clever and verbal this book actually is. The book made me reflect again on so many aspects of the world that I take for granted, and it made me feel like a child exploring and learning about various objects, ideas and relations for the first time. This alone makes this book worth reading and rereading, and I expect to come to it many times again."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Obviously Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass are 2 literary classics, so I'm not reviewing those...But this particular book has put EVERYTHING having to do with Alice and her adventures under 1 cover. Not only do you get both the beloved stories, you also get the ORIGINAL \\"Alice's Adventures Underground\\" which Alice in Wonderland was based on. It is also notated throughout the book, with the explanations of each notation categorized in the back by Book:Chapter:Notation #.The thing that, for me, makes this particular pressing stand out, is not just that everything is all neatly bound together, but I absolutely ADORE the stylish new COVER! In fact, I love ALL the new Penguin Classics series of re-bound classic novels."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"The Modern Library edition is a nice choice for the adult reader, featuring all the wonderful original illustrations (by British political cartoonist John Tenniel), a thoughtful forward by A.S. Byatt, and just enough notes and commentary to provide some additional historical and cultural context.Lewis Carroll was an imaginitive genius and has created some of the most unforgettable and timeless characters with this work - the Mad Hatter, Tweedledee & Tweedledum, the hookah-smoking Caterpiller, the perpetually late White Rabbit - and the absurd situations Alice finds herself in are poignant and amusing at the same time.However, one thing I did not realize coming back to these stories for the first time as an adult was just how largely character and situation-driven these stories are. Carroll moves rather disjointedly from one nonsensical scenario to the next, paying very little attention to a cohesive narrative thread. Indeed the world of Alice is best experienced as a whole, when the menagerie of characters can come to life, but these stories could just as easily be read out of order or taken out piece by piece. The creative work doesn't suffer a bit because of this, but readers should not come to these books expecting a novelistic experience.These are creatures to love, lines to savor, and the most curious things to consider."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I couldn't put it down, man. I checked this book out at the local library and read through the opening 130 pages in one sitting until I was falling asleep at three in the morning. Lewis Carroll's classic tale of adventure and fantasy \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is one of the best books I've ever read.The story is about a little girl, Alice, who falls into a very deep rabbit hole, seemingly straight to the middle of the earth! Her adventures once she lands are as wonderfully imagined as any in the history of literature. Her encounters with the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the King and Queen of Hearts, the Duchess, The Mock Turtle, The Gryphon, and The Wise Old Caterpillar are as fun and as pure and as well intended as any characters I've ever read a writer write.The story behind how Alice in Wonderland came to be is equally interesting, and one worth reading up on. That Carroll wrote it without any pretension to selling it, or for money, or even to publish it, is truly one of the remarkable stories of world literature. His motives were pure, and (at least to me) this is one of the reasons why this book is so dear and so readable.I highly recommend \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" to readers young and old and can only say that I look forward to reading \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" next! A marvelous, wonderful book, as fun as any book I've ever read.Yours,Stacey"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"My mom first read this book to me when I was seven years old. Because I was only in first or second grade, Alice in Wonderland scared the heck out of me. I remember parts were pretty horrific and confusing. I kind of hated it. It was like Stephen King for a first grader- which, if you ever go to a website on Lewis Carroll, shouldn't surprise anyone because Carroll had loads of problems and was pretty much tripped out while writing this (I think).Now that I'm older, I decided to re-read Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. While reading it, it's hard to decide whether this is just a load of imaginative creativity, or a metaphor of something deeper that is true in society today, or true in the 1800's. Well, I guess you can read it either way- but there is definitely some deep stuff in here. Many poems will stop and make you think, and as the story progresses you can't help but feel like you are Alice (which is pretty amazing, because this isn't like Lord of the Rings or anything, it's basically a fairy tale on drugs).Definitely, definitely, definitely do not hesitate to pick this book up and read. Another review said it was disturbing- well, in some ways it really is. But the characters and the plot line (or lack of!) keep you interested and keeps you reading. AIW and TTLG are must-haves in anyone interested in fantasy/sci-fi, along with Chronicles of Narnia and other great classics."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"This is a review of the physical book published by Tribeca Books, not the stories about Alice written by Lewis Carroll. The book itself is not worth your money. The text and margins are very small and do not seem well centered on the page. The font is simple and ugly. The spine of the book is completely white and doesn't have the title of the book or author listed. It may be superficial, but how do you recognize this book on a bookshelf? Overall, the book is very cheap and thrown together. Get a nicer version that also has the original illustrations by John Tenniel."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Unfortunately, this Kindle version is missing almost all of the illustrations, which are an integral part of the book. And the poetry is not formatted correctly and is in red on my iPad Kindle.Through the Looking Glass [Kindle Edition] by BLTC is the one you want."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"One think that frustrates me is when Amazon reviews ignore the medium that the stories are presented in. My review is about this specific Hallmark Edition book.It's difficult to find a nice hardcover version of both stories complete with the original illustrations. the illustrations are either poor quality, or are reduced in number. This book doesn't use them at all, so if that's important to you, look elsewhere. Instead it includes beautiful photographs of the scenes from the NBC TV movie. In my opinion this is better than the original, but it lacks the historical signifigance.In my opinion, get this book. It has the stories you want and the photos are very pleasing to look at. This book is bound nicely and will make a great addition to any library or collection."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass are probably some of the most famous children's books in the English anguage. There are two ends to the spectrum of interpreting them.On the one end, the books are seen as wonderful and innocent entertainment mainly for kids but also suitable for adults. It is innovative and chaotic and performs puns and wordplay on the English language as well as concepts. They are accompanied by great quality illustrations and have a sense of fun and adventure about them.On the other end, the books are seen as elaborate allegories. Everything is symbolic. The tales are reminiscent of an LSD induced fantasy. Everything is Freudian and academic and open to postmodern interpretation and of course there's the disturbing question of Carrol's supposed obsession with little girls.Having read - and loved - the books, I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Yes, they seem to be oriented primarily for children but that doesn't mean adults can't get anything more than nostalgia out of them. Yes they are rich in some symbolism but it is unwise to overanalyse and read too much extraneous ideas into them.Highly recommended to be read as what they are - the product of an amazing mind, which saw the world of children as the ground in which to sow ideas both fun and profound. All the semi-philosophical talks, nonsense poems, fantastical creatures combine to make an unforgettable work."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"I am a teenager, but I live in France and am not completely fluent in English yet. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was one of the first English novels I read, and I loved it. I went on to read Through the Looking Glass and loved it just as much. I think that it is a perfect book to read to children. The language was clear enough for me to understand, and I am not a native English speaker, so it would be easy for a child to understand. But even as a young adult, I loved the funny story and the funny people who were in the books. I recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"This review is not about the book itself, but about the $0.99 Kindle edition.

That's not the case here, so watch out."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass","review":"This edition is missing a line!
