Long-distance airlines compete to offer first-class sleeping experiences and hotels recommend exclusive suites where you are never disturbed. Luxury is a rapidly changing global industry that makes the headlines daily in our newspapers and on the internet. More than ever, luxury is a pervasive presence in the cultural and economic life of the West - and increasingly too in the emerging super-economies of Asia and Latin America. Yet luxury is hardly a new phenomenon. Today's obsession with luxury brands and services is just one of the many manifestations that luxury has assumed. In the middle ages and the Renaissance, for example, luxury was linked to notions of magnificence and courtly splendour. In the eighteenth century luxury was at the centre of philosophical debates over its role in shaping people's desires and oiling the wheels of commerce. And it continues to morph today, with the growth of the global super-rich and increasing wealth polarization. From palaces to penthouses, from couture fashion to lavish jewellery, from handbags to red wine, from fast cars to easy money, Peter McNeil and Giorgio Riello present the first ever global history of luxury, from the Romans to the twenty-first century: a sparkling and ever-changing story of extravagance, excess, novelty, and indulgence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EsowDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CAT OF MANY TAILS","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qJ1utAEACAAJ&dq=CAT+OF+MANY+TAILS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Score!","description":"Provides leaders with a simple strategy to improve the performance of their teams through the calculating of  priorities,   who  and  relationships  and by increasing that total, realize more value, impact, earnings and overall success.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RgKPDQAAQBAJ&dq=Score!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CWSP Certified Wireless Security Professional Official Study Guide (Exam PW0-200)","description":"Including step-by-step exercises; chapter self-tests; and more than 150 practice questions; this guide offers complete coverage of all the objectives for the vendor-neutral wireless network certification and focuses on the technologies behind the brands. --","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C12TwgEACAAJ&dq=CWSP+Certified+Wireless+Security+Professional+Official+Study+Guide+(Exam+PW0-200)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don Whillans: Portrait of a Mountaineer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nBm4OAAACAAJ&dq=Don+Whillans:+Portrait+of+a+Mountaineer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nichols' Chilton Labor Guide Manual 2000 : 1981-00 Domestic Cars, Light Trucks, Vans & Suvs; 1981-99 Import Cars, Light Trucks, Vans & Suvs) (Chilton's Labor Guide Manual, 1981-2000)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lifecraft: The Art of Meaning in the Everyday","description":"The Art of Meaning in the Everyday A joyous book on the art of finding meaning in daily life.

With respect to architecture, the analysis of material aesthetics leads to a new understanding of the performance, imitation and transformation of surfaces, including the social meaning of such strategies. In the case of objects, surface treatments are equally important. However, object form (a specific design category), which can enter into tension with materiality, comes into particular focus. Only when materials are shaped do their various qualities emerge, and these qualities are, to a greater or lesser extent, transferred to objects.

Is such an existential equilibrium realistic or even desirable? Condemning our cultural obsession with cheerfulness and  positive thinking,  Mari Ruti calls for a resurrection of character that honors our more eccentric frequencies, arguing that sometimes the most tormented and anxiety-ridden life can also be the most rewarding. Ruti critiques our current search for personal meaning and the pragmatic attempt to normalize human beings  unruly and idiosyncratic natures. Exposing the tragic banality of a happy life commonly lived, she instead emphasizes the advantages of a lopsided life rich in passion and fortitude. Ruti shows what counts is not our ability to evade existential uncertainty but to meet adversity in such a way that we do not become irrevocably broken. We are in danger of losing the capacity to cope with complexity, ambiguity, melancholia, disorientation, and disappointment, leaving us feeling less  real,  less connected, and unable to metabolize a full range of emotions. Heeding the call of our character may mean acknowledging the marginalized, chaotic aspects of our being, for they carry a great deal of creative energy.

Mary Odem looks at these moral reform movements from a national perspective, but she also undertakes a detailed analysis of court records to explore the local enforcement of regulatory legislation in Alameda and Los Angeles Counties in California. From these legal proceedings emerge overlapping and often contradictory views of middle-class female reformers, court and law enforcement officials, working-class teenage girls, and working-class parents. Odem traces two distinct stages of moral reform. The first began in 1885 with the movement to raise the age of consent in statutory rape laws as a means of protecting young women from predatory men. By the turn of the century, however, reformers had come to view sexually active women not as victims but as delinquents, and they called for special police, juvenile courts, and reformatories to control wayward girls. Rejecting a simple hierarchical model of class control, Odem reveals a complex network of struggles and negotiations among reformers, officials, teenage girls and their families. She also addresses the paradoxical consequences of reform by demonstrating that the protective measures advocated by middle-class women often resulted in coercive and discriminatory policies toward working-class girls.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W2A3CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","description":"Contains an excerpt of author's Roll of thunder, hear my cry.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PiJhDQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Road+to+Memphis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","description":"Ronald Kessler s explosive bestseller, The FBI, brought down FBI Director William S.

Harriet Brown did. To satisfy her curiosity, she spent an entire year observing Red Caboose, a center in Madison, Wisconsin. This engaging and thought-provoking book is the story of that year. In her beautifully written personal account, journalist and mother Brown takes us behind the scenes at a day-care center that works. At Red Caboose, one of the oldest independent centers in the country, we meet teachers who have worked with young children for more than twenty years. We watch the child-care union and parents struggle to negotiate a contract without ripping apart the fabric of trust and love that holds the Red Caboose community together. We look at the center s finances, to see what keeps Red Caboose going at a time when other good centers are disappearing. Best of all, we get to know the children, families, and teachers of Red Caboose their struggles, their sorrows, their triumphs. Started twenty-five years ago by a group of idealistic parents, the center has not only survived but thrived through some pretty tough times. In the world of day care, Red Caboose is a special place, a model for what child care in this country could and should be: not just babysitting, not just a service to working parents, but a benefit for children, families, teachers, and the community at large. Brown sets her rich and engaging stories in the greater political and social context of our time. Why is so much child care bad? Why should working Americans worry about the link between welfare reform and child care? What can we learn from the history of child care? This book is a must-read for parents, educators, and anyone who enjoys first-rate writing and dead-on insight into the lives of our youngest children and those who care for them.  [Brown s] writing is beautiful and her scholarship sound. Students considering day-care careers, day-care professionals, and concerned parents will gain insight by reading this provocative book, as will anyone who cares about the future of young children in this country.  Choice  I admire enormously the ambition of this book its eagle-eyed witness and engrossing detail, plus the social importance of the project. I wish there were in the world more books like it.  Lorrie Moore, author of Who Will Run the Frog Hospital?  The Good-bye Window is a fascinating peek into the secret world of children. With the poignancy of Anne LaMott, and the reportorial grace of Tracy Kidder, Harriet Brown has written a terrific and worthwhile book.  Meg Wolitzer, author of This Is Your Life  Harriet Brown s well-told story of the Red Caboose child-care center should be read by teachers and parents, but also by every legislator and politician in the land. Only a writer as good as Ms. Brown could display the dramatic complexities of a school community in which the youngest members enter crawling and emerge a few years later as articulate, empathetic, and well-socialized individuals, ready for the  real world.

During The Second World War he headed the United States espionage system in China. When that global conflict came to a peaceful conclusion, Clark turned his relentless energy towards exploring the most dangerous and inaccessible places on the globe. Case in point was his decision to lead a mounted expedition of Torgut tribesmen into Tibet! The official reason for Clark s decision to invade this mountainous kingdom on horseback in 1949 was his decision to prepare an impregnable base for General Ma Pa-fang, a violently anti-communist Moslem general. Yet romantic adventure ran deep in Clark, which helps to explain why he was journeying through one of the world's least known and most forbidding regions in the center of Asia. He was also eager to find and measure a mysterious mountain in the Amne Machin range rumored to be higher than Mount Everest. The only problem was that the sacred mountain was guarded by the fearsome Ngolok tribesmen. The Marching Wind is the panoramic story of Clark s mounted exploration in the remote and savage heart of Asia, a place where adventure, danger, and intrigue were the daily backdrop to wild tribesman and equestrian exploits. Amply illustrated with Clark s photographs, as well as maps he drew in Tibet, this rediscovered classic was originally published soon before the author s death from injuries he received while exploring the Amazon rainforest.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=chU_PQAACAAJ&dq=The+Marching+Wind+(Equestrian+Travel+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jacob's Ladder:: Wisdom for the Heart's Ascent (Jacob the Baker Series)","description":"Jacob's Ladder is a small book filled with wonderfully big ideas. Noah benShea returns with his beloved and wise Jacob to the internationally bestselling Jacob the Baker series. Here truly is wisdom for the heart's ascent. Jacob is a baker and a sage who once wrote little notes to himself in an effort to help him make sense of life. A humble man, he lived anonymously in quiet reflection--until one of his notes was acitdentally baked into a loaf of bread. When the secret of Jacob's truth and kindness were discovered, people flocked to him with the questions, great and small, troubling their souls. The village children came after school to sit on the flour sacks and hear his stories. All of this attention made it impossible for Jacob to live his quiet life and forced him from his community. But Jacob's destiny as a gentle teacher would not be denied. Now, Jacob has returned home, and something stirring in his heart now leads him down an altogether new path: fatherhood. In Jacob's Ladder a dusty boy arrives at Jacob's door, note in hand, waiting. It is the dying wish of an old friend that Jacob take in this orphan, Jonah--to teach him, to guide him--until the day Jonah is ready to sit at the Council of Sages. In this sometimes difficult and enlightening adventure of the heart, Jacob discovers that \\"a teacher loves teaching. A father teaches love. Teaching I know. Loving, I'm learning.\\" Jacob's Ladder is a book that you can open on any page and be rewarded. Jacob speaks to all of us, and we are wiser for listening. He is a sage of the heart. Wisdom, parables, aphorisms, and wonderful stories lead us up Jacob's Ladder. Join Jacob and young Jonah as they together seek to understand their place in life. This charming and deceptively simple story is rich with spirited characters, enriching new themes and valuable insights. \\"The most important things in life aren't things,\\" says Jacob, who teaches about the importance of love and forgiveness, responsibility and the subtle depths of parenting, growing older and becoming young, spirituality and work, loss and laughter, and so much more. Jacob's Ladder is a heartwarming, moving fable; Jacob friends--new and old--will love this new chapter in his life.

Condemning these transformations, Britain's male writers looked longingly to an idealized past. Its women writers, however, were not so pessimistic about the future.

Zlotnick also examines the poetry and fiction produced by working-class men and women.

It is working toward the possibility of greater wholeness. We will never experience healing until we can come to love our unlovable places, for they, too, ask love of us. How is it that good people do bad things? Why is our personal story and our societal history so bloody, so repetitive, so injurious to self and others? How do we make sense of the discrepancies between who we think we are or who we show to the outside world versus our everyday behaviors? Why are otherwise ordinary people driven to addictions and compulsions, whether alcohol, drugs, food, shopping, infidelity, or the Internet? Why are interpersonal relationships so often filled with strife? Exploring Jung s concept of the Shadow the unconscious parts of our self that contradict the image of the self we hope to project--Why Good People Do Bad Things guides you through all the ways in which many of our seemingly unexplainable behaviors are manifestations of the Shadow. In addition to its presence in our personal lives, Hollis looks at the larger picture of the Shadow at work in our culture from organized religion to the suffering and injustice that abounds in our modern world. Accepting and examining the Shadow as part of one s self, Hollis suggests, is the first step toward wholeness. Revealing a new way of understanding our darker selves, Hollis offers wisdom to help you to acquire a more conscious conduct of your life and bring a new level of awareness to your daily actions and choices.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PUzYWfbf-qkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Evan taubenfeld.

As Cary Nelson shows, it is not only our image of the past but also our sense of the present and future that changes when we recover these revolutionary memories. Making a forceful case for political poetry as poetry, Nelson brings to bear his extraordinary knowledge of American poets, radical movements, and social struggles in order to bring out an undervalued strength in a literature often left at the canon's edge. Focused in part of the red decade of the 1930s, Revolutionary Memory revitalizes biographical criticism for writers on the margin and shows us for the first time how progressive poets fused their work into a powerful chorus of political voices. Richly detailed and beautifully illustrated with period engravings and woodcuts, Revolutionary Memory brings that chorus dramatically to life and set a cultural agenda for future work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6fpSAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peanuts Every Sunday","description":"America's most beloved comic strip, Peanuts, is now a major motion picture produced by Blue Sky Studios.

Since World War II, a group of scientists has been attempting to understand the human nervous system and to build computer systems that emulate the brain's abilities. Many of the early workers in this field of neural networks came from cybernetics; others came from neuroscience, physics, electrical engineering, mathematics, psychology, even economics. In this collection of interviews, those who helped to shape the field share their childhood memories, their influences, how they became interested in neural networks, and what they see as its future. The subjects tell stories that have been told, referred to, whispered about, and imagined throughout the history of the field. Together, the interviews form a Rashomon-like web of reality. Some of the mythic people responsible for the foundations of modern brain theory and cybernetics, such as Norbert Wiener, Warren McCulloch, and Frank Rosenblatt, appear prominently in the recollections. The interviewees agree about some things and disagree about more. Together, they tell the story of how science is actually done, including the false starts, and the Darwinian struggle for jobs, resources, and reputation. Although some of the interviews contain technical material, there is no actual mathematics in the book. Contributors James A.

For four decades, beginning in the '30s, The Three Stooges were kings of the box office-first in a series of legendary comic shorts for Columbia and later in a string of successful feature films. In all, they made over 200 films! Half a century later, the act is still knocking them dead. Demand for The Three Stooges is so strong that their films can currently be seen every day of the week on cable TV-bringing the manic comic genius of Moe, Larry, and Curly to a whole new generation of delighted fans. These two new books pair vintage black and white photos from The Three Stooges's incredible film archive with short and snappy text that celebrates fathers and birthdays. \\"Why, I Oughta . . .\\" is an encouraging little reminder that getting older doesn't have to be so painful. (\\"Even if some of us aren't as curly as we used to be\\"), and Pop, You're \\"Poifect\\" pays tribute to dear old dad. Written to be given as a gift to dad, it offers an apology for the trials kids put parents through (\\"I know that there were nights when I kept you awake with worry, and days I probably made you pull out your hair in frustration-especially grade card days.\\") and words of thanks (\\"So thanks for all the times you've bailed me out-not literally, of course-not yet\\"). The words work in perfect tandem with the slapstick shots of The Three Stooges in action-and the net result is two books sure to delight Stooges fans new and old.

They move quickly into residences, jobs, and lifestyles that provide little opportunity with fellow migrants, yet they continue to see themselves as a distinctive community within contemporary American society. In Life Lines Bacon chronicles the creation of a community--Indian-born parents and their children living in the Chicago metropolitan area--bound by neither geographic proximity, nor institutional ties, and explores the processes through which ethnic identity is transmitted to the next generation. Bacon's study centers upon the engrossing portraits of five immigrant families, each one a complex tapestry woven from the distinctive voices of its family members. Both extensive field work among community organizations and analyses of ethnic media help Bacon expose the complicated interplay between the private social interactions of family life and the stylized rhetoric of \\"Indianness\\" that permeates public life. This inventive analysis suggests that the process of assimilation which these families undergo parallels the assimilation process experienced by anyone who conceives of him or herself as a member of a distinctive community in search of a place in American society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7vtieTLJG7UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Abortion: A Dialogue","description":"\\"The issues she takes on are crucial -- not solely the subject areas of reproductive rights and law, or public policy lenses and judicial impact in women's and children's lives, but also the more difficult and fundamental questions of how these 'hot topics' can be approached so as to make the most of the good will of all and the force of free discussion for social learning.... she brings a strong, evolving and distinctive perspective to the discussion.\\" -- Emily Fowler Hartigan In Abortion and Dialogue, Ruth Colker argues that the state falsely views the woman and the fetus as having conflicting needs when it intervenes in decisions regarding preganancies. Colker's feminist-theological perspective on reproductive health issues encourages both pro-choice and pro-life advocates to consider how the value of life is implicated in discussions of reproduction. Colker argues that theology can contribute to our understanding if we apply the concepts of love, compassion, and wisdom to problems identified by feminist theory and to actual concrete situations: the impact of abortion regulations on poor female adolescents; the judicial treatment of abortion regulations; state intervention into women's decision-making during pregnancies carried to term. Colker concludes by examining effective and respectful family-planning strategies that truly help women in making reproductive choices.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uVD9TdluiR0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The POEMS OF WB YEATS NEW EDITION","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lise Meitner and the Dawn of the Nuclear Age","description":"This biography of Lise Meitner (1878-1968), the Austrian Jewish female physicist at the heart of the discovery of nuclear fission, also looks at major developments in physics during her life. Meitner was a colleague and friend of many giants of 20th century physics: Max Planck, her Berlin mentor, Einstein, von Laue, Marie Curie, Chadwick, Pauli and Bohr. She was the first woman to earn a Ph.D. in physics at the University of Vienna, a pioneer in the research of radioactive processes and, together with her nephew Otto Robert Frisch, an interpreter of the process of nuclear fission in 1938. Yet at the end of World War II, her colleague of thirty years, radiochemist Otto Hahn alone was awarded the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the  discovery  of nuclear fission   a discovery based on years of research in which Meitner was directly involved before her secret 1938 escape from Nazi Germany to Sweden.  A story of one of the half dozen most remarkable women of the 20th century.    John Archibald Wheeler, Princeton University  Patricia Rife s biography truly brings Meitner to life, both as a scientist and as a woman... Rife weaves Meitner s personal struggles into the social and political fabric of her times. For example, the story of Meitner s early career is told against the backdrop of the development of the new physics, with plentiful illumination of the limited prospects for women scientists in the German-speaking world during the early twentieth century. When Meitner's story enters the Nazi era   including her escape from Germany   it is as riveting as the best novel.    Catherine Westfall,Technology and Culture  A well-written, thorough, readable and engrossing work.    Gary Goldstein, Peace and Change: a Journal of Peace Research  Rife has produced an exciting book, which reads like a novel and she gives justice to Meitner s life full of science and human stories... [The] book is a beautiful tribute to an outstanding scientist; it has a lot to teach us about our world; and it is a great read. I warmly recommend it to everyone interested in science and in history.    Structural Chemistry  Lise Meitner comes to life as author Rife skillfully weaves social, political, and scientific events into a well-researched and documented work. Lists of Meitner s awards and publications and an extensive bibliography complete this excellent book.    Association of Women in Science Magazine  The dramatic tale of the discovery of nuclear fission on the eve of WWII... not just a story of ideas... but also of the social and intellectual milieu in which these ideas were developed. It is also the story of how a shy, self-effacing young woman, through talent and hard work, became a world-class scientist... Rife tells this story very well.    The Antioch Review  The particular merit of Rife s biography of Austrian physicist Meitner is that it places her life and work within the historical context... It is comprehensive, generally clearly written... and appropriate for undergraduate students. Just enough science is included as to make clear the significance of her work...

But the true saga of her life has never been fully told. Now, drawing on unpublished manuscripts, letters, diaries, and land and financial records, Caroline Fraser the editor of the Library of America edition of the Little House series masterfully fills in the gaps in Wilder s biography. Revealing the grown-up story behind the most influential childhood epic of pioneer life, she also chronicles Wilder's tumultuous relationship with her journalist daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, setting the record straight regarding charges of ghostwriting that have swirled around the books. The Little House books, for all the hardships they describe, are paeans to the pioneer spirit, portraying it as triumphant against all odds. But Wilder s real life was harder and grittier than that, a story of relentless struggle, rootlessness, and poverty. It was only in her sixties, after losing nearly everything in the Great Depression, that she turned to children s books, recasting her hardscrabble childhood as a celebratory vision of homesteading and achieving fame and fortune in the process, in one of the most astonishing rags-to-riches episodes in American letters. Spanning nearly a century of epochal change, from the Indian Wars to the Dust Bowl, Wilder s dramatic life provides a unique perspective on American history and our national mythology of self-reliance. With fresh insights and new discoveries, Prairie Fires reveals the complex woman whose classic stories grip us to this day.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yoq9DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Who's Afraid of Web Page Design?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kBksswEACAAJ&dq=Who%27s+Afraid+of+Web+Page+Design%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ashes and Diamonds (European Classics)","description":"Originally published: Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern University Press, 1991.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pSWxqJl_lWUC&dq=Ashes+and+Diamonds+(European+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Collecting Lladro : Price & Identification Guide","description":"This full-color price and identification guide covers all aspects of the elegant, hand-crafted fine porcelain, from identifying fakes to evaluating secondary market pricing. 350+ full-color photos.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i4lwzGtvTC0C&dq=Collecting+Lladro+:+Price&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brief Therapy Homework Planner","description":"In an era of brief therapy, the time between sessions is an important component of the treatment process.

Beyond Second City","description":"On both sides of the stage improv-comedy's popularity has increased exponentially throughout the 1980s and '90s and into the new millennium. Presto! An original song is created out of thin air. With nothing but a suggestion from the audience, daring young improvisers working without a net or a script create hilarious characters, sketches, and songs. Thrilled by the danger, the immediacy, and the virtuosity of improv-comedy, spectators laugh and cheer. American improv-comedy burst onto the scene in the 1950s with Chicago's the Compass Players (best known for the brilliant comedy duo Mike Nichols and Elaine May) and the Second City, which launched the careers of many popular comedians, including Gilda Radner, John Belushi, and Mike Myers. Chicago continues to be a mecca for young performers who travel from faraway places to study improv. At the same time, the techniques of Chicago improv have infiltrated classrooms, workshops, rehearsals, and comedy clubs across North and South America, Europe, Australia, and Japan. Improv's influence is increasingly evident in contemporary films and in interactive entertainment on the internet. Drawing on the experiences of working improvisers, Whose Improv Is It Anyway? provides a never-before-published account of developments beyond Second City's mainstream approach to the genre. This fascinating history chronicles the origins of \\"the Harold,\\" a sophisticated new \\"long-form\\" style of improv developed in the '80s at ImprovOlympic and details the importance and pitfalls of ComedySports. Here also is a backstage glimpse at the Annoyance Theatre, best known on the national scene for its production of The Real Live Brady Bunch. Readers will get the scoop on the recent work of players who, feeling excluded by early improv's \\"white guys in ties,\\" created such independent groups as the Free Associates and the African American troupe Oui Be Negroes. There is far more to the art of improv than may be suggested by the sketches on Saturday Night Live or the games on Whose Line Is It Anyway? This history, an insider's look at the evolution of improv-comedy in Chicago, reveals the struggles, the laughter, and the ideals of mutual support, freedom, and openness that have inspired many performers. It explores the power games, the gender inequities, and the racial tensions that can emerge in improvised performance, and it shares the techniques and strategies veteran players use to combat these problems. Improv art is revealed to be an art of compromise, a fragile negotiation between the poles of process and product. The result, as shown here, can be exciting, shimmering, magical, and not exclusively the property of any troupe or actor.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=onsUEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Mobiles","description":"Discover pajaki, one of the hottest interior trends in recent years Polish artist Karolina Merska's richly ornamented, reimagined pajaki mobiles have caught the attention of design shows and interiors magazines across the world.

These five essays, together here for the first time in a single volume, offer radically differing points of view; they provide the best sustained discussion of these philosophical issues available anywhere.

This edition includes all charts, tables, and footnotes originally published In \\"The Coming Prince\\" but the charts and tables have been reformatted making them easier to read and understand.

The Bible was written by ancient Hebrews whose culture and language was very different from our own and must be read and interpreted through their eyes. When we define the names of God using our culture and language we lose the Hebraic meanings behind the original Hebrew names of God. Consequently the true nature and character of God is hidden behind the veil of time and culture. By understanding the various names of God through the vocabulary and language of the ancient Hebrews, the nature and character of God is revealed to us in a new light. The prophet Zechariah described the character of God with the words \\"sh'mo ehhad\\" translated as His Name is One (Zechariah 14:9). This phrase beautifully describes the character of God from a Hebraic perspective that is lost to us through translation and unfamiliarity with ancient Hebrew culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oT_1sTk3IzcC&dq=His+Name+is+One&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I'm Wendy Blair, Not a Chair!","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iZtqAAAACAAJ&dq=I%27m+Wendy+Blair,+Not+a+Chair!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dangerous Relationships: How To Identify And Respond To The Seven Warning Signs Of A Troubled Relationship","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The NexStar User's Guide (Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series)","description":"Michael Swanson s online discussions with literally thousands of NexStar owners made it clear that there was a desperate need for a book such as this  one that provides a complete, detailed guide to buying, using and maintaining NexStar telescopes.

Sheler draws upon years of investigation and in-depth interviews to tackle such controversial subjects as the recent Jesus Seminar, modern biblical archaeology, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the mysterious Bible codes. This solid exploration into some of the thorniest aspects of current debates about the Bible and religion concludes with a message of reassurance about historical accuracy, validity, and integrity of the Scriptures. Sheler's bold but balanced investigation discloses a Bible still worthy of belief in a modern age. In this authoritative book, renowned U.S. News & World Report religion writer Jeffrey L. Sheler sifts through the claims and counterclaims of contemporary biblical studies. After carefully investigating the full spectrum of cutting-edge research and conflicting reports, he challenges the popular perception that the credibility of the Bible has been seriously undermined by critical scholarship. Rather, he concludes that the weight of the historical evidence upholds the essential truth of Exodus, the Gospel accounts of Jesus, and other vital elements of the Bible. The author draws extensively from his own interviews with leading Bible experts and on-site reports from Israel and Egypt in his examination of scholarship's hot-button issues, including: Dramatic archaeological discoveries that both affirm and challenge the history in the Bible. The controversial quest for the historical Jesus and its sometimes flawed arguments and skeptical assumptions regarding the reliability of the Gospels. The amazing revelations of the Dead Sea Scrolls and other ancient texts that profoundly influence our understanding of the Bible. The mysterious phenomenon of The Bible Code and why there may be far less to its doomsday prophesies than meets the eye. Sheler's considerable experience as a leading religion journalist enables him to get to the heart of the issues without the jargon. Written in clear, compelling prose, Is the Bible True? Presents a sophisticated analysis informed by important scholarly work in lucid, accessible terms.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zC-2gWuc_ykC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Making of a Writer","description":"Joan Lowery Nixon is the acclaimed author of more than a hundred books for young readers.

Most people might simply view the book as a dry cataloging of a banal subject; Shapton, however, saw beauty in the technical details and was inspired to create her own interpretation of The Native Trees of Canada. Shapton distills each image into its simplest form, using vivid colors in lush ink and house paint. She takes the otherwise complex objects of trees, pinecones, and seeds and strips them down into bold, almost abstract shapes and colors: the water birch is represented as two pulsating red bulbs contrasted against a gray backdrop; the eastern white pine is represented by a close-up of its cone against a radiant summer sky.

What guiding intelligence weaves the threads of our individual biographies? What hauntings of the invisible world invigorate, animate, and direct the multiple narratives of daily life? In Hauntings, James Hollis considers how we are all governed by the presence of invisible forms-spirits, ghosts, ancestral and parental influences, inner voices, dreams, impulses, untold stories, complexes, synchronicities, and mysteries-which move through us, and through history. He offers a way to understand them psychologically, examining the persistence of the past in influencing our present, conscious lives and noting that engagement with mystery is what life asks of each of us. From such engagements, a deeper, more thoughtful, more considered life may come. James Hollis, PhD, is a co-founder of the C. G.

Most military thinkers in the years leading up to World War II saw the airplane as an afterthought. But a small band of idealistic strategists, the \\"Bomber Mafia,\\" asked: What if precision bombing could cripple the enemy and make war far less lethal? In contrast, the bombing of Tokyo on the deadliest night of the war was the brainchild of General Curtis LeMay, whose brutal pragmatism and scorched-earth tactics in Japan cost thousands of civilian lives, but may have spared even more by averting a planned US invasion. In The Bomber Mafia, Gladwell asks, \\"Was it worth it?\\" Things might have gone differently had LeMay's predecessor, General Haywood Hansell, remained in charge. Hansell believed in precision bombing, but when he and Curtis LeMay squared off for a leadership handover in the jungles of Guam, LeMay emerged victorious, leading to the darkest night of World War II. The Bomber Mafia is a riveting tale of persistence, innovation, and the incalculable wages of war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BeWjzgEACAAJ&dq=Bomber&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"U.S. Regulation of the International Securities And Derivatives Markets: United States Regulation of the International Securities And Derivatives Markets (2 Volume Set)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yPE9AQAAIAAJ&dq=U.S.+Regulation+of+the+International+Securities+And+Derivatives+Markets:+United+States+Regulation+of+the+International+Securities+And+Derivatives+Markets+(2+Volume+Set)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roberts Rules Of Writing: 101 Unconventional Lessons Every Writer Needs to Know","description":"The 101 Rules You Need to Know *but no one has ever told you You already have a million writing books.

We were all feeling the same fear, heartsickness, worry, and sadness, but due to the nature of the virus, it was hard to connect. I connect through cooking, and I noticed that s what many others were doing as well. We took to the kitchen to share something of ourselves and cooking became the discipline, diversion, and devotion that got us through.  You may think you know Rachael Ray after decades of TV appearances and dozens of books, but 2020 changed us all and it changed her, too her life and her direction. During the early months of the pandemic in upstate New York, far away from her New York City television studio, Rachael Ray and her husband, John, went to work in their home kitchen hosting the only cooking show on broadcast TV. At her kitchen counter, with the help of her iPhone cameraman (John), Rachael produced more than 125 meals everything from humble dishes composed of simple pantry items (One-Pot Chickpea Pasta or Stupid Good, Silly Easy Sausage Tray Bake) to more complex recipes that satisfy a craving or celebrate a moment (Porcini and Greens Risotto or Moroccan Chicken Tagine). This Must Be the Place captures the words, recipes, and images that will forever shape this time for Rachael and her family, offering readers inspiration to rethink and rebuild what home means to them now.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hckTEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Phantom Shark (Rick Brant Science-Adventure Story)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cXNpGQAACAAJ&dq=The+Phantom+Shark+(Rick+Brant+Science-Adventure+Story)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT: Complete Study Package (Examkrackers)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bRVajwEACAAJ&dq=Examkrackers+MCAT:+Complete+Study+Package+(Examkrackers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strong Room, The","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=02oMAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Buick: A complete history (An Automobile quarterly library series book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=25YQAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Buick:+A+complete+history+(An+Automobile+quarterly+library+series+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tough Talk about Fat!: How to Reach and Maintain Your Ideal Weight","description":"Your guide to a slim-trim future!The only book you'll ever need for lifelong weight control!

It is one of the most detailed and plausible and fascinating projections in all of science fiction. Now, in The Omega Expedition, it takes us into another millennium, and is complete. The Omega Expedition is a philosophical novel, a sequel to The Fountains of Youth. It is the extraordinary life history of Adam Zimmerman, developer of the technology of emortality. The main part of the narrative describes his long-delayed awakening into the 35th century, a time of true immortals. His exotic hosts--inhabitants of a microworld in the outer solar system--have recruited various interested parties to help with the resurrection project, one of whom (inevitably) is the famous historian of death, the immortal Mortimer Gray, who is exceedingly anxious to gain what insight he can into the vagaries of the mortal mind.

The new uplifting book from Matt Haig, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Midnight Library, for anyone in search of hope, looking for a path to a more meaningful life, or in need of a little encouragement. Named by The Washington Post as one of the best feel-good books of 2021.  It is a strange paradox, that many of the clearest, most comforting life lessons are learnt while we are at our lowest. But then we never think about food more than when we are hungry and we never think about life rafts more than when we are thrown overboard.  THE COMFORT BOOK is Haig s life raft: it s a collection of notes, lists, and stories written over a span of several years that originally served as gentle reminders to Haig s future self that things are not always as dark as they may seem. Incorporating a diverse array of sources from across the world, history, science, and his own experiences, Haig offers warmth and reassurance, reminding us to slow down and appreciate the beauty and unpredictability of existence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hwEGEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quick Tips: The Guide to Golf's Best Shots (Quick Series Guide)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q7MdNgAACAAJ&dq=Quick+Tips:+The+Guide+to+Golf%27s+Best+Shots+(Quick+Series+Guide)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The peasant of the Garonne: an old layman questions himself about the present time","description":"At eighty-five, Jacques Maritain, the most distinguished Catholic philosopher of the twentieth century, has written what he offers as his last book, and it turns out to be a shocker. The peasant, as Maritain calls himself in the title, is a man who calls a spade a spade; and a storm of controversy descended immediately on the book's publication in France, as both Right and Left reeled from the force of Maritain's criticism.The Peasant of the Garonne is a sharp attack on the new philosophy, hoping to cool off the fever for change that Maritain believes is imperiling the church's traditional spirituality and even the substance of doctrine. There is sardonic humor in his treatment of Teilhardians, phenomenologists, existentialists, new-style biblical critics, and clerical Freudians, but Maritain is deeply serious in warning that their capitulation to fashioniable trends represents a kind of kneeling before the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1ylNAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grave Instinct","description":"Belated justice can be the most satisfying.

Studies show that up to 95 per cent of all horses have some form of foot imbalance which will predispose them to injury. Common problems that can be attributed to faulty foot balance include: bad backs; bruised heels; hoof cracks; shortened stride/stumbling; arthritis; navicular disease/syndrome; chip fractures; sheared heels; and degenerative diseases. The book describes how good basic farriery, particularly through paying attention to foot balance, can be used to maintain and even enhance performance and soundness in the horse. It explains how to check the horse's medio-lateral balance with the aid of a T-square, as well as how to assess the hoof/pastern axis and what to look for when picking up the foot. The authors also discuss the connection between poor feet and bad backs, and show how skilled farriery can give horses with less-than-perfect conformation the best chance to stay sound.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HWVWAAAAYAAJ&dq=No+Foot,+No+Horse:+Foot+Balance,+the+Key+to+Soundness+and+Performance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Drug-impaired professionals","description":"Drawing on more than 120 personal interveiws with addicted physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, attorneys, and airline pilots and those who treat them, Professor of Biobehavioral Sciences Robert Coombs gives us a startling picture of drug abuse among \\"pedestal professionals\\" unveiling a problem that affects nearly every family in America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5MP8gXv87OoC&dq=Drug-impaired+professionals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tibetan Buddhism from the Ground Up: A Practical Approach for Modern Life","description":"As long as our minds are dominated by the conditions of the external world, we are bound to remain in a state of dissatisfaction, always vulnerable to grief and fear.

It was one of the basic categories by which the rabbis perceived the new phenomenon of Christianity and one of the central issues over which Judaism and Christianity separated. Segal reconstructs the development of the heresy through prudent dating of the stages of the rabbinic traditions. The basic heresy involved interpreting scripture to say that a principal angelic or hypostatic manifestation in heaven was equivalent to God. The earliest heretics believed in two complementary powers in heaven, while later heretics believed in two opposing powers in heaven. Segal stresses the importance of perceiving the relevance of rabbinic material for solving traditional problems of New Testament and gnostic scholarship, and at the same time maintains the necessity of reading those literatures for dating rabbinic material. Please note that \\"Two Powers in Heaven\\" was previously published by Brill in hardback, ISBN 90 04 05453 7 (no longer available).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LRzCB9xSRFsC&dq=Two+Powers+in+Heaven:+Early+Rabbinic+Reports+About+Christianity+and+Gnosticism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Galaxies","description":"This extensively illustrated book presents the astrophysics of galaxies since their beginnings in the early Universe.

Fresh from a summer job working with explosives in the chemistry department of an ordnance plant, Hull was drafted in 1943, after his freshman year in college. Unlike other accounts written by scientists and historians of that era, Hull's narrative offers a realistic picture of the dangerous and messy job that GIs and civilian powder men were asked to do. Life in the workshops where bomb components were constructed was very different from life in the offices where they were designed. Hull's description of his postwar work supporting the Bikini Atoll tests in the Pacific and the early concerns about the effects of a hydrogen bomb explosion illuminate the Dark Age of nuclear weaponry. John Hull's handsome illustrations show technicians and scientists at work and bring the story to life. \\"Rider of the Pale Horse adds valuably to the total record of the most important technological development of the twentieth century.\\"--Richard Rhodes, author of The Making of the Atom Bomb \\"Hull gives a bottom-up view as seen by a foot-soldier. His account of the grubby details of the project is illuminated by his later view of its historical repercussions and bears new witness to a turning-point of history.\\"--Freeman Dyson, author of Disturbing the Universe","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ddOhAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nervous Water: A Brady Coyne Novel (Brady Coyne Novels)","description":"In one of the finest novels yet in Tapply's long-running series, Nervous Water explores the previously hidden past of his much beloved character, Boston attorney Brady Coyne.

Having received a diagnosis of terminal cancer, Moze is looking to mend fences with his only daughter. But the daughter seems to have simply disappeared, leaving no clues or hints as to her whereabouts. As Brady tackles the seemingly impossible task of finding his cousin - a case that looks less and less like a simple missing person case - it becomes clear that whatever is going on now is related to a dark, undiscussed episode in his family's past: the brutal, still unsolved murder of another of Brady's uncles.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EvryPfApyyAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Thai Amulet (Archaeological Mysteries, No. 7)","description":"The discovery of a 25,000-year-old archaeological treasure, a rekindled romance, and a suspicious suicide send Toronto antiques dealer Lara McClintoch on a quest to the city of Budapest.

The detailed evidence assembled here shows that eighteenth-century Americans almost never invoked this principle. Although Thomas Jefferson and others retrospectively claimed that the First Amendment separated church and state, separation became part of American constitutional law only much later. Hamburger shows that separation became a constitutional freedom largely through fear and prejudice. Jefferson supported separation out of hostility to the Federalist clergy of New England. Nativist Protestants (ranging from nineteenth-century Know Nothings to twentieth-century members of the K.K.K.) adopted the principle of separation to restrict the role of Catholics in public life. Gradually, these Protestants were joined by theologically liberal, anti-Christian secularists, who hoped that separation would limit Christianity and all other distinct religions. Eventually, a wide range of men and women called for separation. Almost all of these Americans feared ecclesiastical authority, particularly that of the Catholic Church, and, in response to their fears, they increasingly perceived religious liberty to require a separation of church from state. American religious liberty was thus redefined and even transformed. In the process, the First Amendment was often used as an instrument of intolerance and discrimination.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q6Axd76IE1UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marvel Comics Presents #18 : Cyclops, Black Panther, She-Hulk, & Willie Lumpkin (Marvel Comic Book 1989)","description":"Wolverine stumbles into trouble in Madripoor as he tries to find out why an aquaintance of his was killed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bLNTKAAACAAJ&dq=Marvel+Comics+Presents&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life","description":"Classic of travel and adventure literature in which the author drew upon his experiences in the South Seas to tell of a stranded sailor's attempts to escape an idyllic but stultifying world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yemvDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary Poetry","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sJLxzQEACAAJ&dq=The+Norton+Anthology+of+Modern+and+Contemporary+Poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Being There: Putting Brain, Body, and World Together Again","description":"Brain, body, and world are united in a complex dance of circular causation and extended computational activity.

I hesitated. This was a bigger question than usually got asked at these post-match debriefs. 'I suppose the honest answer would be,' I said, still accessing the last pieces of required data from a jumbled mind, 'meeting my soul mate, and finding an idyllic house abroad somewhere.' Inspired by breathtaking views and romantic dreams of finding love in the mountains, Tony Hawks impulsively buys a house in the French Pyrenees. Here, he plans to finally fulfil his childhood fantasy of mastering the piano, untroubled by the problems of the world. In reality, the chaotic story of Tony's hopelessly ill-conceived house purchase reads like the definitive guide to how not to buy a house in France. It finds him flirting with the removal business in a disastrous attempt to transport his piano to France in a dodgy white van; foolishly electing to build a swimming pool himself; and expanding his relationship repertoire when he starts co-habiting, not with an exquisite French beauty, but with a middle-aged builder from West London. As Tony and his friends haplessly attempt to fit into village life, they learn more about themselves and each other than they ever imagined.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nKeK8zdpPTkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"enemy in the promised land: an egyptian woman's journey into israel","description":"Provides a view of Israel through Arab eyes based on the author's three-year-long stay in Israel and discusses the problems and probabilities of peace.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m0eAP7jlMssC&dq=enemy+in+the+promised+land:+an+egyptian+woman%27s+journey+into+israel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Window to the World","description":"Megan Diamond retreats back into her shell when tragedy strikes, taking her best friend Jen away from her, but as the years pass, Megan learns that it is better to risk getting hurt by those she loves than to close her heart off forever.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AsHShti0q0kC&dq=A+Window+to+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marker","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gQcczgEACAAJ&dq=Marker&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Violence: Our Deadly Epidemic and Its Causes","description":"An eye-opening, revisionist analysis of the social and psychological roots of violence argues that violence should be approached as a problem in public health and preventative medicine, rather than one of biological or moral origins, and that shame is the common denominator that links violent perpetrators.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xn-4AAAAIAAJ&dq=Violence:+Our+Deadly+Epidemic+and+Its+Causes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"RV 1960 Hand Size Giant Print Reference Bible (Black Imitation Leather) (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_Rs2AAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Releasing His Glory!","description":"Dr. Munroe surgically removes the religious rhetoric out of this most-oft-used word -- glory -- replacing it with words that will draw you into the powerful Presence of the Lord.

Most accounts of Protagoras rely on the somewhat hostile reports of Plato and Aristotle. By focusing on Protagoras's own surviving words, this study corrects many long-standing misinterpretations and presents significant facts: Protagoras was a first-rate philosophical thinker who positively influenced the theories of Plato and Aristotle, and Protagoras pioneered the study of language and was the first theorist of rhetoric. In addition to illustrating valuable methods of translating and reading fifth-century B.C.E. Greek passages, the book marshals evidence for the important philological conclusion that the Greek word translated as rhetoric was a coinage by Plato in the early fourth century. In this second edition, Edward Schiappa reassesses the philosophical and pedagogical contributions of Protagoras. Schiappa argues that traditional accounts of Protagoras are hampered by mistaken assumptions about the Sophists and the teaching of the art of rhetoric in the fifth century. He shows that, contrary to tradition, the so-called Older Sophists investigated and taught the skills of logos, which is closer to modern conceptions of critical reasoning than of persuasive oratory. Schiappa also offers interpretations for each of Protagoras's major surviving fragments and examines Protagoras's contributions to the theory and practice of Greek education, politics, and philosophy. In a new afterword Schiappa addresses historiographical issues that have occupied scholars in rhetorical studies over the past ten years, and throughout the study he provides references to scholarship from the last decade that has refined his views on Protagoras and other Sophists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aADQBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cooking Spanish (Thunder Bay Cooking)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ohio Salt","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wwHHzQEACAAJ&dq=Ohio+Salt&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","description":"What determines whether complex life will arise on a planet, or even any life at all?

When Christmas Eve comes to Elm Creek Manor, the tenor of the holiday is far from certain. Sylvia Bergstrom Compson, the Master Quilter, has her own reasons for preferring a quiet, even subdued, Christmas. Her young friend Sarah McClure, however, takes the opposite view and decides to deck the halls brightly. As she explores the trunks packed with Bergstrom family decorations that haven't been touched in more than fifty years, Sarah discovers a curious Christmas quilt. Begun in seasonal fabrics and patterns, the quilt remains unfinished. Sylvia reveals that the handiwork spans several generations and a quartet of Bergstrom quilters her great aunt, her mother, her sister, and herself. As she examines the array of quilt blocks each family member contributed but never completed, memories of Christmases past emerge. At Elm Creek Manor, Christmas began as a celebration of simple virtues joy and hope buoyed by the spirit of giving. As each successive generation of Bergstroms lived through its unique trials the antebellum era, the Great Depression, World War II tradition offered sustenance even during the most difficult times. For Sylvia, who is coping with the modern problem of family dispersed, estranged, or even forgotten, reconciliation with her personal history may prove as elusive as piecing the Christmas Quilt. Elm Creek Manor is full of secrets, from a Christmas tree with unusual properties to the sublime Bergstrom strudel recipe. Sylvia's tales at first seem to inform her family legacy but ultimately illuminate far more, from the importance of women's art to its place in commemorating our shared experience, at Christmastime and in every season.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7KmujotBUwwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Algebra 1","description":"From the first day your students begin to learn the vocabulary of algebra until the day they take final exams and standardized tests, these programs strengthen student understanding and provide the tools students need to succeed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hLLZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Algebra+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vampire Winter","description":"For vampire Blaine Kettridge, the cold, dark nuclear winter is the beginning of a new life--he can hunt and feed whenever he pleases, because it is always night","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Dj9AOgAACAAJ&dq=Vampire+Winter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Awakenings","description":"Describes the author's work with institutionalized patients at Mount Carmel Hospital and the dramatic effects of the drug L-DOPA on twenty patients suffering from encephalitic Parkinsonism","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yqI-27clD2YC&dq=Awakenings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette; the portrait of an average woman","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8qtRPgAACAAJ&dq=Marie+Antoinette%3B+the+portrait+of+an+average+woman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Penny Plain [Hardcover] by O.

This book explores this major change in the literary representation of women in Mexico. Mar a Elena de Vald s enters into a selective and hard-hitting examination of literary representation in its social context and a contestatory engagement of both the literary text and its place in the social reality of Mexico. Some of the topics she considers are Carlos Fuentes and the subversion of the social codes for women; the poetic ties between Sor Juana In s de la Cruz and Octavio Paz; questions of female identity in the writings of Rosario Castellanos, Luisa Josefina Hern ndez, Mar a Luisa Puga, and Elena Poniatowska; the Chicana writing of Sandra Cisneros; and the postmodern celebration without reprobation of being a woman in Laura Esquivel's Like Water for Chocolate.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BTMXTzxk2ZYC&dq=The+Shattered+Mirror:+Representations+of+Women+in+Mexican+Literature+(Texas+Pan+American+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Awake to a Perfect Day: My Experience With Christian Science","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i77SAAAAMAAJ&dq=Awake+to+a+Perfect+Day:+My+Experience+With+Christian+Science&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death's Deal","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"User's Guide to Natural Remedies for Depression: Learn about Safe and Natural Treatments to Uplift Your Mood and Conquer Depression (Basic Health Publications User's Guide)","description":"Simple, self-help advice for the millions of people who suffer from chronic depression, and the millions more who have to cope with \\"down days\\".

Raised, however, with a generation of south Louisianans taught to act Middle American rather than Acadian, Bedell attempts in his poetry to recapture a culture. The poems in At the Bonehouse record the successes and failures of his search to discover what shaped him. Through his narrative poetry, Bedell provides an accurate representation of the landscape of the region and makes sense of its culture and people. His poems reflect the images and experiences common to Acadiana-saltwater marshes and cypress swamps; cleaning redfish, hunting teal, listening to the broken tones in an old oil-field worker's voice-making the region and its inhabitants accessible to a wider audience and at the same time bringing him closer to understanding himself and his heritage. For the Boy in Bayou Blue Who Spoke in Tongues When he was twelve, he made the national news to his parents' delight and filled the pews of the Living Word with gaggles of girls and tourists eager to hear the sermon he's planned for a Current Affair. His long, curly hair and sparkly eyes glowed when he's share his witness with the congregation. He'd shout and swoon and lash his tongue while rows fell out rolling in ecstasy around his raised pulpit. It pleased the deacons when the crazed, fainting crowds filled their baskets with money, but no one wondered when his eyes rolled a funny white back into his head as if he were reading from cards inside his skull, or if the Spirit would come and improvise the whole show for him while his mouth spewed syllables like phlegm.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d3IgAQAAIAAJ&dq=At+the+Bonehouse:+Poems+by+Jack+Bedell+(Texas+Review+Southern+and+Southwestern+Poetry+Breakthrough+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Banks Mysteries)","description":"Inspector Alan Banks heads to London after receiving a disturbing call from his estranged brother, while back in Eastvale, detective Annie Cabbot's investigation of a young woman's death uncovers a connection to someone close to Annie.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=roB-kmtyVOYC&dq=Strange+Affair:+A+Novel+of+Suspense+(Inspector+Banks+Mysteries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sioux Country: A History of Indian-White Relations : A Custom Textbook","description":"A new addition to the Culture and Customs of Native Peoples in America series, this book examines the traditions and contemporary culture of the Sioux Indians. * Presents a chronological history that accurately describes the events that have shaped and influence Sioux society today * Provides an annotated bibliography of current print and nonprint sources appropriate for student research","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8VKfyoDsupUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dead Won't Hurt You: A True Story","description":"In a true and terrifying story, one woman shares her hair-raising tale of a lifetime stalked by menacing, otherworldly presences and ghostly visions in her grandmothers home in New Waterford, Ohio.

The book deals with events which brought the author into this blight. It was the hour of Germany s deepest humiliation, when Napolean has dismembered the old German Empire and French soldiers occupied almost the whole of Germony. The books narrates how Hitler was arrested with several of his comrades and imprisoned in the fortress of Landsberg on the river Lech. During this period only the author wrote the first volume of MEIN KAMPF. The Second volume of MEIN KAMPF was written after release of Hitler from prison and it was published after the French had left the Ruhr, the tramp of the invading armies still echoed in German ears and the terrible ravages had plunged the country into a state of social and economic Chaos. The beauty of the book is, MEIN KAMPF is an historical document which bears the emprint of its own time. Moreover, Hitler has declared that his acts and  public statements  constitute a partial revision of his book and are to be taken as such.

It is a real, a serious and a long-standing issue. The number of girls entering and staying in computing education is still woefully low. Women are still not present at the centre of power where decisions are made determining how electronic equipment will develop. They are in reality mere users. Women in science and technology have always been pushed into the background by means of all sorts of ruses. The stories of how women scientists have suffered the same indignities since the 17th century: gender pay gaps, ridicule, sexist comments and being silenced make fascinating and relevant reading. And all this remains true in computing. RIGHTING THE WRONG looks again at the foundations of computing: mathematics, engineering and, arguably, science and shows how the masculinity of these still pervades computing education and the industry. This pervasiveness lays the groundwork for so much of the on-line abuse girls and women suffer. By drawing attention to the distant and more recent past Frances encourages readers to become more aware of what continues to this day; she urges them to challenge new developments and not to put up any longer with being silenced.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4AJUEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The psychoanalysis of war","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ASV0QgAACAAJ&dq=The+psychoanalysis+of+war&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Textbook of Polymer Science","description":"This Third Edition of the classic, best-selling polymer science textbook surveys theory and practice of all major phases of polymer science, engineering, and technology, including polymerization, solution theory, fractionation and molecular-weight measurement, solid-state properties, structure-property relationships, and the preparation, fabrication and properties of commercially-important plastics, fibers, and elastomers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kGnyDwAAQBAJ&dq=Textbook+of+Polymer+Science&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The origin of Paul's religion, (The James Sprunt lectures delivered at Union theological seminary in Virginia)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VZs5AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Washington : Character in Time : The US Presidents","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Still Here","description":"More than thirty years ago, an entire generation sought a new way of life, looking for fulfillment and meaning in a way no one had before.

Dear reader (unbeliever or believer), This book was born out of one of Bethel Holiness Pentecostal Apostolic Ministries' Bible studies (School of Purpose and Promise). As we studied the very relevant topic \\"the future,\\" this was given to me as teacher at the closing of the year 2019 for the new year 2020. You see, we had just completed a study called \\"hope for the future,\\" which also depicts the end-time, signs of the Lord's second coming, the antichrist reign, etc., and so as customary, I sought the Lord's direction as to what should be our next lesson. I was divinely instructed and felt compelled with these words: \\"stay on the topic as it is relevant to the times.\\" I obeyed and structured the lesson accordingly for 2020. Then came the virus that took over the world and threw the globe in chaos--COVID-19. The future--this topic speaks to both the future of the saved or believers and the damned or unbelievers. We got to a portion in the lesson that outlined heaven as the final dwelling place of the saints under the subhead \\"Heaven A Safe Deposit for Treasures/Investments.\\" Our guided scriptures led us to Luke, chapter 12, verses 15-34, where the Lord told the parable of the rich fool who had no investments for heaven and his unpreparedness for an eternity in heaven. The Lord further reminded his little flock (verse 32) not to be anxious over the cares of this world, life's luxuries, pleasures, and riches--or even basic needs. One who worries, he says, about these things is a person of little faith. He continued to counsel and instructed the little flock as he told them, \\"Fear not, it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom\\" (verse 32). Hence, as we observed these unprecedented times (COVID-19) where people everywhere are worried, filled with anxiety, fatigue from job loss, death, the basic needs of life, and the future in many aspects, we got stuck at verse 32, \\"Fear not, little flock,\\" and started exploring some of the \\"fear nots\\" in the scriptures. Be encouraged! Be empowered! Be enriched in faith and confidence that has for you a great recompense of reward as you overcome and live in victory, boldness, and God's precious love for you as you explore and apply these practical tips for triumph and positive changes in your life. \\"Repent and be baptized everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and all that are afar off, even as the Lord our God shall call.\\" Acts 2:38-39.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hb5bEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Country Living Crafting Vintage Style: Charming Projects for Home & Garden","description":"Presents a guide to creating decorative accessories for home and garden using remnant fabrics and other household items, with illustrated directions for each project.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TDm4wAEACAAJ&dq=Country+Living+Crafting+Vintage+Style:+Charming+Projects+for+Home&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clarita's Cocina: Great Traditional Recipes from a Spanish Kitchen","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1vmmmwEACAAJ&dq=Clarita%27s+Cocina:+Great+Traditional+Recipes+from+a+Spanish+Kitchen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Candy Apple Red (Jane Kelly Mysteries)","description":"A bartender-turned-process server chases after a missing suspect in this  fun, frantic, sexy murder mystery  (Lisa Jackson, #1 New York Times-bestselling author of You Betrayed Me).

The authors show the contribution that psychology can make to our understanding of the merger phenomena - how it affects organizational performance, and how it affects the managers and employees involved. Mergers, Acquisitions and Strategic Alliances is intended as a guide to successful organizational marriage. Great emphasis is placed on the issue of cultural compatibility as it concerns partner selection, integration practices and venture outcomes. The book also focuses on cross-national mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures. With the increasing economic activity within the European Union and between the unions of other countries, there is a need to know more about the corporate and national cultures in these strategic alliances. The authors have drawn upon an extensive body of research based on recent cases in a wide cross section of industries across Europe. The book is unique in showing the actual effect mergers and acquisitions have on people, and consequently on the performance of the 'new' organization. It will be particularly relevant for decision makers - those who are involved in planning and implementing a large organizational change, and those responsible for ensuring successful integration afterwards. It would also be extremely useful for postgraduate management students, personnel executives and management consultants.

The twenty-five-year-old was a recent graduate of Yale and a confirmed East Coast intellectual. Winthrop didn t let his education handicap him however. Instead he set out to ride horses and canoes across some of the most remote portions of the early United States. The resultant book, Saddle and Canoe, is a vibrant picture of frontier life in the Pacific Northwest and covers the author s travels along the Straits of Juan De Fuca, on Vancouver Island, across the Naches Pass, and on to The Dalles, in Oregon Territory. Throughout his journey Winthrop spent much of his time among both pioneers and Indians, whose picturesque descriptions are found within the pages of this historic travel account. Never one to hold back his opinions, the Yankee traveler thus regales the reader with personal observations and blunt honesty on a host of topics, people and places. Illustrated with drawings of the period, Saddle and Canoe also contains a vocabulary of the Chinook Indian language which Winthrop used during the course of this historic journey. A treasure to read, the book will be of interest to students of both the horse and history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pU1ePQAACAAJ&dq=Saddle+and+Canoe:+An+Early+19th+Century+Ride+Through+the+Pacific+North-West+(Equestrian+Travel+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forgotten Armies: The Fall of British Asia, 1941-1945","description":"In the early stages of the Second World War, the vast crescent of British-ruled territories stretching from India to Singapore appeared as a massive Allied asset. It provided scores of soldiers and great quantities of raw materials and helped present a seemingly impregnable global defense against the Axis. Yet, within a few weeks in 1941-42, a Japanese invasion had destroyed all this, sweeping suddenly and decisively through south and southeast Asia to the Indian frontier, and provoking the extraordinary revolutionary struggles which would mark the beginning of the end of British dominion in the East and the rise of today's Asian world. More than a military history, this gripping account of groundbreaking battles and guerrilla campaigns creates a panoramic view of British Asia as it was ravaged by warfare, nationalist insurgency, disease, and famine. It breathes life into the armies of soldiers, civilians, laborers, businessmen, comfort women, doctors, and nurses who confronted the daily brutalities of a combat zone which extended from metropolitan cities to remote jungles, from tropical plantations to the Himalayas. Drawing upon a vast range of Indian, Burmese, Chinese, and Malay as well as British, American, and Japanese voices, the authors make vivid one of the central dramas of the twentieth century: the birth of modern south and southeast Asia and the death of British rule.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qXH9xGCWjYUC&dq=Forgotten+Armies:+The+Fall+of+British+Asia,+1941-1945&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Romantic Revolution In America 1800-1860","description":"The development of literature between 1800 and 1860 in the United States was heavily influenced by two wars. The War of 1812 hastened the development of nineteenth-century ideals, and the Civil War uprooted certain growths of those vigorous years. The half century between these dramatic episodes was a period of extravagant vigor, the final outcome being the emergence of a new middle class. Parrington argues that America was becoming a new world with undreamed potential. This new era was no longer content with the ways of a founding generation. The older America of colonial days had been static, rationalistic, inclined to pessimism, and fearful of innovation. During the years between the Peace of Paris (1763) and the end of the War of 1812, older America was dying. The America that emerged, which is the focal point of this volume, was a shifting, restless world, eager to better itself, bent on finding easier roads to wealth than the plodding path of natural increase. The culture of this period also changed. Formal biographies written in this period often gave way to eulogy; it was believed that a writer was under obligation to speak well of the dead. Consequently, scarcely a single commentary of the times can be trusted, and the critic is reduced to patching together his account out of scanty odds and ends. A new introduction by Bruce Brown highlights the life of Vernon Louis Parrington and explains the importance of this second volume in the Pulitzer Prize-winning study.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d_BbtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Romantic+Revolution+In+America+1800-1860&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Governing the Hearth: Law and the Family in Nineteenth-Century America","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a_qVvwEACAAJ&dq=Governing+the+Hearth:+Law+and+the+Family+in+Nineteenth-Century+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strange Eating Habits of Sea Creatures (Ocean World Library)","description":"Examines the eating habits of several sea creatures, pointing out their interdependence on each other.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1DGsqrPQtTYC&dq=Strange+Eating+Habits+of+Sea+Creatures+(Ocean+World+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Egypt to Mesopotamia: A Study of Predynastic Trade Routes (Studies in Nautical Archaeology)","description":"In From Egypt to Mesopotamia, Samuel Mark ferrets out the two possible trade routes between these two vastly different cultures.

Having researched more than sixty contemporary drill regulations, and as many other documents of the period, the author is able to provide a full record of the tactics of manoeuvre in the Napoleonic era. Whereas the original sources are difficult to understand (including those written in English) and poorly illustrated, Imperial Bayonets is a model of clarity and contains more than ninety illustrations of manoeuvres. The system of warfare between 1792 and 1815 was unique in many respects, and formed the basis for the evolution of warfare in the years to come.

It is interesting, however, to compare the fictional world of the mystery sleuth with the world in which readers live. Of course, mystery readers do not share one simplistic world. They live in urban, suburban, and rural areas, as do the female heroines in the books they read.

Nigel Kennell refutes the popular notion that classical Spartan education was a conservative amalgam of \\"primitive\\" customs not found elsewhere in Greece. He argues instead that later political and cultural movements made the system appear to be more distinctive than it actually had been, as a means of asserting Sparta's claim to be a unique society. Using epigraphical, literary, and archaeological evidence, Kennell describes the development of all aspects of Spartan education, including the age-grade system and physical contests that were integral to the system. He shows that Spartan education reached its apogee in the early Roman Empire, when Spartans sought to distinguish themselves from other Greeks. He attributes many of the changes instituted later in the period to one person--the philosopher Sphaerus the Borysthenite, who was an adviser to the revolutionary king Cleomenes III in the third century B.C.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LPQAIsQGTj8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Portable DBA: SQL Server","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Boswell on the Grand Tour: Germany and Switzerland 1764.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3lUGAQAAIAAJ&dq=Boswell+on+the+Grand+Tour:+Germany+and+Switzerland+1764.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fortune made his sword: A novel (A Dell book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PTiyIVkCwJgC&dq=Fortune+made+his+sword:+A+novel+(A+Dell+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jonesborough, the first century of Tennessee's first town (Publication - Tennessee State Planning Commission)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f_k7XvoY_icC&dq=Jonesborough,+the+first+century+of+Tennessee%27s+first+town+(Publication+-+Tennessee+State+Planning+Commission)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Going Straight: An Ex-convict/Psychologist Tells Why and How","description":"A roadmap from the gutters of society to respectability and success. For those seeking a straight life, it describes what they must change about themselves, and the hazards they must avoid. For anyone interested in crime, punishment, and rehabilitation, it provides an unprecedented look into the minds of offenders. Bluntly acknowledges the existence of unfairness and hypocrisy in society, but not with bitterness or self-pity. Rather it puts these in perspective and shows how the individual offender CAN change and build a respectable life, in spite of the barriers and pitfalls. The author has seen criminal justice and corrections all the way from the cold floor of a solitary cell to the courtroom as an expert witness. Without mincing words and with a touch of humor, he turns this experience to the service of both the offender and society as a whole. (Personal note: Today is November 28, 2010, so GOING STRAIGHT... has been available for almost ten years. I've received numerous letters and emails from readers, telling how they've used it to help themselves and others. Not a single one has told me that he or she considered it a waste of time and money. Whatever your own situation, whether you're in a cell sweating out a parole hearing, or a corrections officer, or teacher, or you care for someone trapped in a criminal lifestyle, or an activist pushing for more rehabilitation-oriented corrections, or interested for any other reason, I sincerely hope you also find this book helpful. My main interest is not the royalties -- they just help offset SOME of the cost of my websites and other rehabilitation efforts.

It served as a basis for future muckraking journalism by exposing the slums to New York City's upper and middle class. How The Other Half Lives quickly became a landmark in the annals of social reform. Riis documented the filth, disease, exploitation, and overcrowding that characterized the experience of more than one million immigrants. He helped push tenement reform to the front of New York's political agenda, and prompted then-Police Commissioner Theodore Roosevelt to close down the police-run poor houses. Roosevelt later called Riis \\"the most useful citizen of New York\\". Riis's idea inspired Jack London to write a similar expos  on London's East End, called People of the Abyss.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4ouDQgAACAAJ&dq=How+the+Other+Half+Lives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Society Medals: An Identification Guide","description":"The book various groups & individuals have been awaiting for a hundred years & more!

Called Din  Bi' lta', The People's School, in recognition of its status as the first American Indian community-controlled school, Rough Rock was the first to teach in the Native language and to produce a body of quality children's literature by and about Navajo people. These innovations have positioned the school as a leader in American Indian and bilingual/bicultural education and have enabled school participants to wield considerable influence on national policy. This book is a critical life history of this singular school and community. McCarty's account grows out of 20 years of ethnographic work by the author with the Din  (Navajo) community of Rough Rock. The story is told primarily through written text, but also through the striking black-and-white images of photographer Fred Bia, a member of the Rough Rock community. Unlike most accounts of Indigenous schooling, this study involves the active participation of Navajo community members. Their oral testimony and that of other leaders in Indigenous/Navajo education frame and texture the account. Informed by critical theories of education, this book is not just the story of a single school and community. It is also an inquiry into the larger struggle for self-determination by Indigenous and other minoritized communities, raising issues of identity, voice, and community empowerment. A Place To Be Navajo asks whether school can be a place where children learn, question, and grow in an environment that values and builds upon who they are. The author argues that the questions Rough Rock raises, and the responses they summon, implicate us all.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ArGPAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Capitalism, the unknown ideal","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Gun Valkyrie (Prima's Official Strategy Guide)","description":"The whole world is counting on you ?

A population explosion, a communications revolution, mass literacy, secularisation, urbanisation, Imperialism - these were just a few of the many ways in which the lives of Europeans of every class were dramatically changed. It was the centurywhen most of the ideologies of the modern world - liberalism, conservatism, nationalism, socialism, and racism - came of age.

The most rewarding thing about making bread is that the process of learning never ends. Every day is a new study . . . the possibilities are infinite.  from the Introduction More than a decade ago, Chad Robertson s country levain recipe taught a generation of bread bakers to replicate the creamy crumb, crackly crust, and unparalleled flavor of his world-famous Tartine bread. His was the recipe that launched hundreds of thousands of sourdough starters and attracted a stream of understudies to Tartine from across the globe. Now, in Bread Book, Robertson and Tartine s director of bread, Jennifer Latham, explain how high-quality, sustainable, locally sourced grain and flours respond to hydration and fermentation to make great bread even better. Experienced bakers and novices will find Robertson s and Latham s primers on grain, flour, sourdough starter, leaven, discard starter, and factoring dough formulas refreshingly easy to understand and use. With sixteen brilliant formulas for naturally leavened doughs including country bread (now reengineered), rustic baguettes, flatbreads, rolls, pizza, and vegan and gluten-free loaves, plus tortillas, crackers, and fermented pasta made with discarded sourdough starter Bread Book is the wild-yeast baker  s flight plan for a voyage into the future of exceptional bread.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kk4REAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stick Kid","description":"A stick figure boy grows up, eventually leaving home and starting a stick family of his own.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YyxaAAAAYAAJ&dq=Stick+Kid&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Playing on Words: A Guide to Luciano Berio's Sinfonia (Royal Musical Association Monographs) (Royal Musical Association Monographs)","description":"Luciano Berio's Sinfonia (1968) marked a return by the composer to orchestral writing after a gap of six years.

Although many native sources, often in translations with scholarly annotations. became available in the twentieth century, the corpus of this material was scattered and uncoordinated. Burr Cartwright Brundage has utilized these sources to produce a consecutive narrative that portrays direction and purpose in the evolution of the Aztec empire. A Rain of Darts is the first one-volume history of the Mexica, historically the most important of the Aztec peoples. The focus of the narrative is on the political state produced by the Mexica during their stormy history. The eleven Mexica reigns that preceded the Spanish Conquest are investigated, their triumphs and errors explained, and the lives of their great leaders illuminated where the sources allow. The narrative opens with the first appearance of the Mexica out of the arid north; it details their aimless wandering, the founding of the city of Mexico in the waters of Lake Tezcoco, their desperate struggle for independence (successfully achieved in 1428), and the flourishing of the new state and its curiously structured empire. This history concludes with an analysis of the character of Moteuczoma II, and investigates the final sickness of the Mexican state. Cortez and his small army of Spaniards are seen here for the first time in historical literature through the eyes of the people they conquered. The Mexica Aztecs remain at the center of the narrative. The Mexica were unable to build a tightly knit empire because of the elitist, international warrior class and its peculiar cult of war and sacrifice. To the Mexica, warfare and bloodshed were sacraments; the teuctli or knightly warrior was the priest of this cult. to which he was as loyal as to the state. In this lay the uniqueness of the Mexican state and the seeds of its tragic end in 1521.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HptBCwAAQBAJ&dq=A+Rain+of+Darts%3B+The+Mexican+Aztecs:+The+Mexican+Aztecs+(Texas+Pan-American+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"That Perception Thing!","description":"How successful you are at coping with change will determine how fully alive and productive you are.

This edition includes far-reaching suggestions for research that could increase the impact that classroom teaching has on actual learning. Like the original edition, this book offers exciting new research about the mind and the brain that provides answers to a number of compelling questions. When do infants begin to learn? How do experts learn and how is this different from non-experts? What can teachers and schools do-with curricula, classroom settings, and teaching methods--to help children learn most effectively? New evidence from many branches of science has significantly added to our understanding of what it means to know, from the neural processes that occur during learning to the influence of culture on what people see and absorb. How People Learn examines these findings and their implications for what we teach, how we teach it, and how we assess what our children learn. The book uses exemplary teaching to illustrate how approaches based on what we now know result in in-depth learning. This new knowledge calls into question concepts and practices firmly entrenched in our current education system. Topics include: How learning actually changes the physical structure of the brain. How existing knowledge affects what people notice and how they learn. What the thought processes of experts tell us about how to teach. The amazing learning potential of infants. The relationship of classroom learning and everyday settings of community and workplace. Learning needs and opportunities for teachers. A realistic look at the role of technology in education.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XjZeI8MndBQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Otello in Full Score (Dover Vocal Scores)","description":"(Unlocking the Masters). Giuseppe Verdi's career forms one of the loveliest arcs in musical history. The passion of his works resonates universally, while the sophistication of his middle and late operas satisfies demanding ears and tastes. In Verdi: The Operas and Choral Works , Victor Lederer surveys every one of the master's 28 operas and his greatest choral pieces, showing Verdi's growth as a musical dramatist he would revolutionize the hidebound conventions of 19th-century Italian opera and his single-minded pursuit of dramatic truth. After describing the chaotic milieu in which Verdi learned his craft, the book provides act-by-act analyses of the early masterpieces Nabucco , Ernani , and Macbeth . The neglected operas from the composer's self-described \\"years in the galleys\\" are covered together. Lederer then takes readers through the magnificent sequence of Verdi operas from Luisa Miller onward, including the fine but underrated Stiffelio . Each of the late operas Don Carlo , Aida , and Otello and Falstaff , the twin Shakespearean masterworks that crown Verdi's oeuvre is discussed at length in its own chapter. Lederer also examines Verdi's monumental Requiem along with the choral Quattro pezzi sacri , Verdi's sublime final achievement. The book comes with audio of musical selections representing highlights from throughout Verdi's long, remarkable career.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TOm3BQAAQBAJ&dq=Otello+in+Full+Score+(Dover+Vocal+Scores)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chilton's Import Car Service Manual: 1997-2001 (Chilton's Import Auto Service Manual, 2001)","description":"Complete coverage of repair procedures for imported vehicles is offered, from drive train to chassis and all associated components.

He is called a bootlicker and a toady to the army system, which he is, and all the men in his platoon find him disgusting. Yancey's upset of well-planned military maneuvers by overseeing a party that becomes an orgy and by spinning a laundry unit askew are some the novel's funniest moments.

As the economy plummeted, employers cut wages and laid off workers, while simultaneously attempting to wrest more work from those who remained employed. In mills, mines, and factories workers organized and resisted, striking for higher wages, improved working conditions, and the right to bargain collectively. As workers walked the picket line or sat down on the shop floor, they could be heard singing. This book examines the songs they sang at three different strikes- the Gastonia, North Carolina, textile mill strike (1929), Harlan County, Kentucky, coal mining strike (1931-32), and Flint, Michigan, automobile sit-down strike (1936-37). Whether in the Carolina Piedmont, the Kentucky hills, or the streets of Michigan, the workers' songs were decidedly class-conscious. All show the workers' understanding of the necessity of solidarity and collective action. In Flint the strikers sang: The trouble in our homestead Was brought about this way When a dashing corporation Had the audacity to say You must all renounce your union And forswear your liberties, And we'll offer you a chance To live and die in slavery. As a shared experience, the singing of songs not only sent the message of collective action but also provided the very means by which the message was communicated and promoted. Singing was a communal experience, whether on picket lines, at union rallies, or on shop floors. By providing the psychological space for striking workers to speak their minds, singing nurtured a sense of community and class consciousness. When strikers retold the events of their strike, as they did in songs, they spread and preserved their common history and further strengthened the bonds among themselves. In the strike songs the roles of gender were pronounced and vivid. Wives and mothers sang out of their concerns for home, family, and children. Men sang in the name of worker loyalty and brotherhood, championing male solidarity and comaraderie. Informed by the new social history, this critical examination of strike songs from three different industries in three different regions gives voice to a group too often deemed as inarticulate. This study, the only book-length examination of this subject, tells history \\"from the bottom up\\" and furthers an understanding of worker culture during the tumultuous Depression years.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GHpwgYoexwkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paint Shop Pro 5 for Windows (Visual QuickStart Guide)","description":"A guide to the image editing and processing program explains how to manipulate images for documents, files, and Web pages","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bgAkuQ7JCxsC&dq=Paint+Shop+Pro+5+for+Windows+(Visual+QuickStart+Guide)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trial of Marshal Petain","description":"On the smoldering afternoon of July 23, 1945, in the imposing First Chamber of the Palais de Justice in Paris, in the presence of lawyers, politicians, leaders of the Resistance, and guards with submachine guns, Marshal P tain went on trial for his life and the honor of France.

Part Two","description":"The Plantation of Ulster by Scots in the 17th century meant the migration and settlement of thousands of Scots in Ireland during that period. Most settlers were from the Scottish Lowlands, but some were Highlanders. Although Presbyterians were in the majority, a sizable minority were Episcopalians and a few Roman Catholics. Although most settled in Ulster, a number settled further south, including in Dublin. The emphasis of Scottish emigration changed in the 18th century, from destinations such as Ireland and the Netherlands, to North America and the Caribbean. This century also saw the rise of emigration from Ireland, notably the Scots-Irish to America. The consolidation is designed to meet the requirements of family historians, genealogists, and academics as it identifies what is available to researchers and where it is located. Many of the entries are based on primary sources. The references identify the publication, volume and folio number, or the archive, and the documentary details. Research was based in sources in the National Records of Scotland, the National Library of Scotland, the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, the National Archives of the U.K., and the University of St. Andrews.

Following the development of scientific ideas about these dramatic events, Macdougall traces the lives of many of the brilliant and intriguing characters who have contributed to the evolving understanding of how ice ages come about. As it explains how the great Pleistocene Ice Age has shaped the earth's landscape and influenced the course of human evolution, Frozen Earth also provides a fascinating look at how science is done, how the excitement of discovery drives scientists to explore and investigate, and how timing and chance play a part in the acceptance of new scientific ideas. Macdougall describes the awesome power of cataclysmic floods that marked the melting of the glaciers of the Pleistocene Ice Age. He probes the chilling evidence for \\"Snowball Earth,\\" an episode far back in the earth's past that may have seen our planet encased in ice from pole to pole. He discusses the accumulating evidence from deep-sea sediment cores, as well as ice cores from Greenland and the Antarctic, that suggests fast-changing ice age climates may have directly impacted the evolution of our species and the course of human migration and civilization. Frozen Earth also chronicles how the concept of the ice age has gripped the imagination of scientists for almost two centuries. It offers an absorbing consideration of how current studies of Pleistocene climate may help us understand earth's future climate changes, including the question of when the next glacial interval will occur.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NzLSYrLGU_8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flowers for My Friend (Little Books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2wuhJhnEhT8C&dq=Flowers+for+My+Friend+(Little+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scotland (Countries)","description":"More than 350 full-color photographs and a lively text provide a fascinating survey of the Scottish style of home design, capturing the richly diverse traditions, history, and culture that have shaped Scotland's stylistic innovations. 20,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JT5QAAAAMAAJ&dq=Scotland+(Countries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A piano for Mrs. Cimino","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"American Popular Music: A Multicultural History","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Smart Guide to Healing Foods","description":"The Sensible Sourcebook!

It was heralded as \\"a marvel of invention . . . a virtuoso performance\\" (The New York Times Book Review) and a \\"novel [that] stands with the best that our nation has produced as literature\\" (Los Angeles Times Book Review). Now Peter Matthiessen brings us the second novel in his Watson trilogy, a project that has been nearly twenty years in the writing. A story of epic scope and ambition, Lost Man's River confronts the primal relationship between a dangerous father and his desperate sons and the ways in which his death has shaped their lives. Lucius Watson is obsessed with learning the truth about his father. Who was E. J. Watson? Was he a devoted family man, an inspired farmer, a man of progress and vision? Or was he a cold-blooded murderer and amoral opportunist? Were his neighbors driven to kill him out of fear? Or was it envy? And if Watson was a killer, should the neighbors fear the obsessed Lucius when he returns to live among them and ask questions? The characters in this tale are men and women molded by the harsh elements of the Florida Everglades--an isolated breed, descendants of renegades and pioneers, who have only their grit, instinct, and tradition to wield against the obliterating forces of twentieth-century progress: Speck Daniels, moonshiner and alligator poacher turned gunrunner; Sally Brown, who struggles to escape the racism and shame of her local family; R. B. Collins, known as Chicken, crippled by drink and rage, who is the custodian of Watson secrets; Watson Dyer, the unacknowledged namesake with designs on the remote Watson homestead hidden in the wild rivers; and Henry Short, a black man and unwilling member of the group of armed island men who awaited E. J. Watson in the silent twilight. Only a storyteller of Peter Matthiessen's dazzling artistry could capture the beauty and strangeness of life on this lawless frontier while probing deeply into its underlying tragedy: the brutal destruction of the land in the name of progress, and the racism that infects the heart of New World history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bkiUTisWrO8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My flute","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wz57AAAAMAAJ&dq=My+flute&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CCNP 2.0 : Routing","description":"Trust the best-selling Official Cert Guide series from Cisco Press to help you learn, prepare, and practice for exam success.

On a train from Budapest to Vienna, Jesse, a young American student, at the end of a romance and his European trip, meets Celine, a young French woman. They are immediately attracted. Despite knowing this may be the only time they will see each other, in the next few hours in the city of Vienna, they share everything and promise to meet again. Nearly a decade later, Jesse, now a novelist on a publicity tour, sees Celine in a bookstore in Paris. Again their time is short, and they spend it reestablishing the connection they experienced on their first meeting. Romantic, poignant, understated, and often profound, these two screenplays are sure to become classics in their own right.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qlWQwcZ_v6UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Courtesans and fishcakes : the consuming passions of classical Athens","description":"As any reader of the Symposium knows, the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates conversed over lavish banquets, kept watch on who was eating too much fish, and imbibed liberally without ever getting drunk. In other words, James Davidson writes, he reflected the culture of ancient Greece in which he lived, a culture of passions and pleasures, of food, drink, and sex before and in concert with politics and principles. Athenians, the richest and most powerful of the Greeks, were as skilled at consuming as their playwrights were at devising tragedies. Weaving together Greek texts, critical theory, and witty anecdotes, this compelling and accessible study teaches the reader a great deal, not only about the banquets and temptations of ancient Athens, but also about how to read Greek comedy and history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R4aktr4K10UC&dq=Courtesans+and+fishcakes+:+the+consuming+passions+of+classical+Athens&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beetle and Lady Bug","description":"\\"Explains how your garden can be a thriving, balanced community that gives more to your landscape than it takes.\\"  Douglas W.

An essential tool for individuals, organizations, and communities of all sizes to jump-start dialogue on racism and bias and to transform well-intentioned statements on diversity into concrete actions from a leading Harvard social psychologist. FINALIST FOR THE FINANCIAL TIMES AND MCKINSEY BUSINESS BOOK OF THE YEAR AWARD ? LONGLISTED FOR THE PORCHLIGHT BUSINESS BOOK AWARD  Livingston has made the important and challenging task of addressing systemic racism within an organization approachable and achievable.  Alex Timm, co-founder and CEO, Root Insurance Company How can I become part of the solution? In the wake of the social unrest of 2020 and growing calls for racial justice, many business leaders and ordinary citizens are asking that very question. This book provides a compass for all those seeking to begin the work of anti-racism. In The Conversation, Robert Livingston addresses three simple but profound questions: What is racism? Why should everyone be more concerned about it? What can we do to eradicate it? For some, the existence of systemic racism against Black people is hard to accept because it violates the notion that the world is fair and just. But the rigid racial hierarchy created by slavery did not collapse after it was abolished, nor did it end with the civil rights era. Whether it s the composition of a company s leadership team or the composition of one s neighborhood, these racial divides and disparities continue to show up in every facet of society. For Livingston, the difference between a solvable problem and a solved problem is knowledge, investment, and determination. And the goal of making organizations more diverse, equitable, and inclusive is within our capability. Livingston s lifework is showing people how to turn difficult conversations about race into productive instances of real change. For decades he has translated science into practice for numerous organizations, including Airbnb, Deloitte, Microsoft, Under Armour, L Oreal, and JPMorgan Chase. In The Conversation, Livingston distills this knowledge and experience into an eye-opening immersion in the science of racism and bias. Drawing on examples from pop culture and his own life experience, Livingston, with clarity and wit, explores the root causes of racism, the factors that explain why some people care about it and others do not, and the most promising paths toward profound and sustainable progress, all while inviting readers to challenge their assumptions. Social change requires social exchange. Founded on principles of psychology, sociology, management, and behavioral economics, The Conversation is a road map for uprooting entrenched biases and sharing candid, fact-based perspectives on race that will lead to increased awareness, empathy, and action.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JdvtDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Filipinos: Forgotten Asian Americans: A Pictorial Essay","description":"Detailed description of the history of Filipino-Americans in the United States in photo-format.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kmsaAQAAIAAJ&dq=Filipinos:+Forgotten+Asian+Americans:+A+Pictorial+Essay&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Much Ado about Nothing (Arden Shakespeare Second)","description":"The Arden Shakespeare is the established edition of Shakespeare's work.

Its honors and lineage are a narrative to the dedication and sacrifice of Marines and Sailors that, woven together, chronicles this most distinguished combat division of the United States Marine Corps. This second edition closes the gap in the written history of the division and updates the landmark work begun by my predecessor Brigadier General Frederick Lopez. Its story begins with the division's activation for war in 1943, looks at the Reserve issues in the 1950 s and 1960's, follows the reactivation and organization for war after Vietnam and combat in Southwest Asia. This work ends in 2000 with the 4th Marine Division, a proud and powerful contributor to the Total Force and a critical link in America's warfighting capability for the 21st century.

Secretive Green Berets trained to hunt down terrorists are assigned to seduce ruthless authoritarian regimes. Pimply young soldiers taught to seize airstrips instead play mayor, detective, and social worker in a gung-ho but ill-fated attempt to rebuild a nation after the fighting stops. The Mission is a boots-on-the-ground account of America's growing dependence on our military to manage world affairs, describing a clash of culture and purpose through the eyes of soldiers and officers themselves. With unparalleled access to all levels of the military, Dana Priest traveled to eighteen countries including Uzbekistan, Colombia, Kosovo, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Afghanistan talking to generals, admirals, Special Forces A-teams, and infantry troops.

It did not arrive in Europe until winter 1944/45, but then fought hard in the harsh mountainous terrain of Northern Italy. The division was special in a number of ways. Its personnel were selected for physical fitness and experience in winter sports, mountaineering, and hunting, unlike the rest of the infantry. It was highly trained in mountain and winter warfare, including the use of skis and snowshoes, while its organization, field clothing, and some personal equipment also differed from that of the usual infantry division. The division made extensive use of pack-mules, and its reconnaissance unit was horse-mounted, conducting the last horse-mounted charge in US history in April 1945.

Now, once again, Daniel Goleman has written a groundbreaking synthesis of the latest findings in biology and brain science, revealing that we are  wired to connect  and the surprisingly deep impact of our relationships on every aspect of our lives. Far more than we are consciously aware, our daily encounters with parents, spouses, bosses, and even strangers shape our brains and affect cells throughout our bodies down to the level of our genes for good or ill. In Social Intelligence, Daniel Goleman explores an emerging new science with startling implications for our interpersonal world. Its most fundamental discovery: we are designed for sociability, constantly engaged in a  neural ballet  that connects us brain to brain with those around us. Our reactions to others, and theirs to us, have a far-reaching biological impact, sending out cascades of hormones that regulate everything from our hearts to our immune systems, making good relationships act like vitamins and bad relationships like poisons. We can  catch  other people s emotions the way we catch a cold, and the consequences of isolation or relentless social stress can be life-shortening. Goleman explains the surprising accuracy of first impressions, the basis of charisma and emotional power, the complexity of sexual attraction, and how we detect lies. He describes the  dark side  of social intelligence, from narcissism to Machiavellianism and psychopathy. He also reveals our astonishing capacity for  mindsight,  as well as the tragedy of those, like autistic children, whose mindsight is impaired. Is there a way to raise our children to be happy? What is the basis of a nourishing marriage? How can business leaders and teachers inspire the best in those they lead and teach? How can groups divided by prejudice and hatred come to live together in peace? The answers to these questions may not be as elusive as we once thought. And Goleman delivers his most heartening news with powerful conviction: we humans have a built-in bias toward empathy, cooperation, and altruismprovided we develop the social intelligence to nurture these capacities in ourselves and others.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mEKCDGXHVmMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lizard Woman","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Why do Islam and Muslims Honor Jesus (known as Christ) and Mary?: Why do Islam and Muslims Honor Jesus (known as Christ) and Mary?","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Calculus with Analytic Geometry","description":"The ninth edition of this college-level calculus textbook features end-of-chapter review questions, practice exercises, and applications and examples.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R8dvOfA_3XAC&dq=Calculus+with+Analytic+Geometry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Literary L.A.: Expanded From the Original Classic and Featuring the Coffeehouse Scene Then and Now","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dawn: A Charleston Legend","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"DONNING INTERNATIONAL ENCYCLOPEDIC PSYCHIC DICTIONARY, THE","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fNAJtAEACAAJ&dq=DONNING+INTERNATIONAL+ENCYCLOPEDIC+PSYCHIC+DICTIONARY,+THE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lost New York in Old Postcards","description":"Wish You Were Here!

To answer these questions, celebrated philosopher and journalist Bernard-Henri L vy spent a year traveling throughout the country in the footsteps of another great Frenchman, Alexis de Tocqueville, whose Democracy in America remains the most influential book ever written about our country. The result is American Vertigo, a fascinating, wholly fresh look at a country we sometimes only think we know. From Rikers Island to Chicago mega-churches, from Muslim communities in Detroit to an Amish enclave in Iowa, L vy investigates issues at the heart of our democracy: the special nature of American patriotism, the coexistence of freedom and religion (including the religion of baseball), the prison system, the  return of ideology  and the health of our political institutions, and much more. He revisits and updates Tocqueville s most important beliefs, such as the dangers posed by  the tyranny of the majority,  explores what Europe and America have to learn from each other, and interprets what he sees with a novelist s eye and a philosopher s depth. Through powerful interview-based portraits across the spectrum of the American people, from prison guards to clergymen, from Norman Mailer to Barack Obama, from Sharon Stone to Richard Holbrooke, L vy fills his book with a tapestry of American voicessome wise, some shocking. Both the grandeur and the hellish dimensions of American life are unflinchingly explored. And big themes emerge throughout, from the crucial choices America faces today to the underlying reality that, unlike the  Old World,  America remains the fulfillment of the world s desire to worship, earn, and live as one wishesa place, despite all, where inclusion remains not just an ideal but an actual practice. At a time when Americans are anxious about how the world perceives them and, indeed, keen to make sense of themselves, a brilliant and sympathetic foreign observer has arrived to help us begin a new conversation about the meaning of America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vaIdVh8wTrYC&dq=American+Vertigo:+Traveling+America+in+the+Footsteps+of+Tocqueville&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the certified township of Kingston, Pennsylvania, 1769 to 1929;: Together with a short account of the fourteenth commonwealth, (Pennsylvania county and regional histories.

While genuine issues, such as ethics in business, are buried in it, this book is a witty, acerbic hatchet job on the phenomenon of management: What managers do and why?

But his life takes a dramatic turn, when he encounters a group of committed Christians, who soberly inform him that Jesus is coming soon! They enroll at Riverstent Bible College. Its an exciting time, as leading Bible teachers have predicted that Jesus will return to Rapture his Church within one generation of the 1948 formation of the State of Israel. Popular movies further inflame this passion, as the eager students study Apologetics and Biblical Archaeology; aberrant theologies such as the Death-of-God movement; and even conflicting interpretations of the End Times. An activist spirit develops within evangelicalism, culminating in the so-called Christian Right, as the evangelical world is rocked in the aftermath of the televangelist scandals. Confronted by world views such as Calvinism and Christian Reconstruction, the characters passionately debate controversies such as Biblical Inerrancy and the age of the cosmos, in addition to challenging evangelicals who deny traditional doctrines such as that of endless punishment in Hell, or who promote an Open (yet limited) concept of God himself. As society evolves, so does evangelicalism: seeker sensitive megachurches appear, while Postmodernism and the Emergent Church become realities. Theologians wrestle with the question of divorce and remarriage, and the role of women in the church, as well as the divisive issue of homosexuality. As they struggle with lifes realities, they ultimately must also respond to nonchristians who are alienated, indifferent, or engaged in active opposition to Christianity, while searching for the meaning of Christian faith in the modern world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EuTKMIojxekC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Releasing children to literature (A Yearling book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HutitQAACAAJ&dq=Releasing+children+to+literature+(A+Yearling+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","description":"When she is turned into a super-modelesque super-fighting machine, Tally, a former ugly, is ordered to keep the uglies down and the pretties stupid in a carefully engineered world of perfection where she refuses to play by the rules.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0NtJEAAAQBAJ&dq=Specials+(Uglies+Trilogy,+Book+3)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gaud: The Man and His Work","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vHaASTJaci4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Decent Cup Of Tea","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EqLyPQAACAAJ&dq=A+Decent+Cup+Of+Tea&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ballad of Dred Scott: A Story of Slavery a Fight for Freedom, the Universe,the Great Creator, And a Hero","description":"* This book is printed on demand.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o0TuPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Ballad+of+Dred+Scott:+A+Story+of+Slavery+a+Fight+for+Freedom,+the+Universe,the+Great+Creator,+And+a+Hero&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enduring Visions: Women's Artistic Heritage Around the World","description":"Everywhere, women have captured their unique vision and experiences in art.

Kevin Mumford chronicles the role of vice districts in New York and Chicago as crucibles for the shaping of racial categories and racial inequalities. Focusing on Chicago's South Side and Levee districts, and Greenwich Village and Harlem in New York at the height of the Progressive era, Mumford traces the connections between the Great Migration, the commercialization of leisure, and the politics of reform and urban renewal. Interzones is the first book to examine in depth the combined effects on American culture of two major transformations: the migration north of southern blacks and the emergence of a new public consumer culture. Mumford writes an important chapter in Progressive-era history from the perspectives of its most marginalized and dispossessed citizens. Recreating the mixed-race underworlds of brothels and dance halls, and charting the history of a black-white sexual subculture, Mumford shows how fluid race relations were in these \\"interzones.\\" From Jack Johnson and the \\"white slavery\\" scare of the 1910's to the growth of a vital gay subculture and the phenomenon of white slumming, he explores in provocative detail the connections between political reforms and public culture, racial prejudice and sexual taboo, the hardening of the color line and the geography of modern inner cities. The complicated links between race and sex, and reform and reaction, are vividly displayed in Mumford's look at a singular moment in the settling of American culture and society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2deazgEACAAJ&dq=Interzones&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Headwind","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"WEAVER ON STRATEGY","description":"Describes the art of managing, from tactics to motivating players","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SoPgwAEACAAJ&dq=WEAVER+ON+STRATEGY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mad King","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Threads from a Coat of Many Colors: Poems on Genesis","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8eP_wAEACAAJ&dq=Threads+from+a+Coat+of+Many+Colors:+Poems+on+Genesis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fallway","description":"Sent into battle against the alien intruders inhabiting the asteroid she calls home, Jahnel, a human adopted by her present family, discovers that the aliens she has been taught to hate are human.

In The Power of Thetis, Laura M. Slatkin makes us aware of another compositional resource, just as crucial to our understanding of the meaning of Homeric epic. Slatkin shows how, through the selection and combination of mythic motifs, Homer interprets mythological traditions and locates his characters within them by allusion or oblique reference. The figure of Thetis, the mother of Achilles, provides an especially revealing example of the way in which such mythological resonance contributes a wider context and meaning to the epic's central themes. Slatkin teaches us to listen for what is unspoken as well as spoken in the poetry of Homer, and thereby confronts us with the larger questions of the function of epic and its boundaries as a genre.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j7Ubgir2Dd4C&dq=The+Power+of+Thetis:+Allusion+and+Interpretation+in+the+Iliad&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aratos of Sicyon,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QaE5AQAAIAAJ&dq=Aratos+of+Sicyon,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meg and the Disappearing Diamonds","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Woodlands; for profit and pleasure,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qckyAAAAMAAJ&dq=Woodlands%3B+for+profit+and+pleasure,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Behind the Label: Inequality in the Los Angeles Apparel Industry","description":"In a study crucial to our understanding of American social inequality, Edna Bonacich and Richard Appelbaum investigate the return of sweatshops to the apparel industry, especially in Los Angeles. The \\"new\\" sweatshops, they say, need to be understood in terms of the decline in the American welfare state and its strong unions and the rise in global and flexible production. Apparel manufacturers now have the incentive to move production to wherever low-wage labor can be found, while maintaining arm's-length contractual relations that protect them from responsibility. The flight of the industry has led to a huge rise in apparel imports to the United States and to a decline in employment. Los Angeles, however, remains a puzzling exception in that its industry employment has continued to grow, to the point where L.A. is the largest center of apparel production in the nation. Not only the availability of low-wage immigrant (often undocumented) workers but also the focus on moderately priced, fashion-sensitive women's wear makes this possible. Behind the Label examines the players in the L.A. apparel industry, including manufacturers, retailers, contractors, and workers, evaluating the maldistribution of wealth and power. The authors explore government and union efforts to eradicate sweatshops while limiting the flight to Mexico and elsewhere, and they conclude with a description of the growing antisweatshop movement.

They may represent current times with some level of reality or shape their settings to suit an agenda. There are audiences for both realism and escapism in the mystery novel. It is interesting, however, to compare the fictional world of the mystery sleuth with the world in which readers live. Of course, mystery readers do not share one simplistic world. They live in urban, suburban, and rural areas, as do the female heroines in the books they read. They may choose a book because it has a familiar background or because it takes them to places they long to visit. Readers may be rich or poor; young or old; conservative or liberal. So are the heroines. What incredible choices there are today in mystery series! This three-volume encyclopedia of women characters in the mystery novel is like a gigantic menu. Like a menu, the descriptions of the items that are provided are subjective. Volume 3 of Mystery Women as currently updated adds an additional 42 sleuths to the 500 plus who were covered in the initial Volume 3. These are more recently discovered sleuths who were introduced during the period from January 1, 1990 to December 31, 1999. This more than doubles the number of sleuths introduced in the 1980s (298 of whom were covered in Volume 2) and easily exceeded the 347 series (and some outstanding individuals) described in Volume 1, which covered a 130-year period from 1860-1979.

And the king whose despotic power was felt over its entire extent was an old gray wolf. Old Lobo, or the king, as the Mexicans called him, was the gigantic leader of a remarkable pack of gray wolves, that had ravaged the Currumpaw Valley for a number of years. All the shepherds and ranchmen knew him well, and, wherever he appeared with his trusty band, terror reigned supreme among the cattle, and wrath and despair among their owners. Old Lobo was a giant among wolves, and was cunning and strong in proportion to his size. His voice at night was well-known and easily distinguished from that of any of his fellows. An ordinary wolf might howl half the night about the herdsman's bivouac without attracting more than a passing notice, but when the deep roar of the old king came booming down the canon, the watcher bestirred himself and prepared to learn in the morning that fresh and serious inroads had been made among the herds.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DigqAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ice Mask","description":"A yarn of friendship and of human endeavour When Guy Edwardes returns from a single-handed yachting voyage to the Arctic he is a changed man.

These failures resulted from three defects present in the primary torpedo of the day, the Mark XIV. These defects were a tendency to run deeper than the set depth, the frequent premature detonation of the Mark 6 magnetic influence exploder, and the failure of the contact exploder when hitting a target at the textbook ninety-degree angle. Ironically, despite using a completely independent design, the Germans experienced the same three defects. The Germans, however, fixed their defects in six months, while it took the Americans twenty-two months. Much of the delay on the American side resulted from the denial of senior leaders in the operational forces and in the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd) that the torpedo itself was defective. Instead, they blamed crews for poor marksmanship or lack of training. In the end, however, the submarine force itself overcame the bureaucratic inertia and correctly identified and fixed the three problems on their own, proving once again the industry of the average American soldier or sailor.

Much of the delay on the American side resulted from the denial of senior leaders in the operational forces and in the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd) that the torpedo itself was defective. Instead, they blamed crews for poor marksmanship or lack of training. In the end, however, the submarine force itself overcame the bureaucratic inertia and correctly identified and fixed the three problems on their own, proving once again the industry of the average American soldier or sailor. Contrary to the interpretations of most submarine historians, this book concludes that BuOrd did not sit idly by while torpedoes failed on patrol after patrol. BuOrd acknowledged problems from early in the war, but their processes and their tunnel vision prevented them from realizing that the weapon sent to the fleet was grossly defective. One of World War II's forgotten heroes, Admiral Lockwood drove the process for finding and fixing the three major defects. This is first book that deals exclusively with the torpedo problem, building its case out of original research from the archives of the Bureau of Ordnance, the Chief of Naval Operations, Vice Admiral Lockwood's personal correspondence, and records from the British Admiralty at the National Archives of the United Kingdom. These sources are complemented by correspondence and interviews with men who actually participated in the events.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tJFxDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Titanic: Women and Children First","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Jazper","description":"While watching a house for five menacing moths, Jaz, an industrious young bug, teaches himself how to transform into various other things and then must use this talent to save himself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LBXhAAAAMAAJ&dq=Jazper&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Love You Sun / I Love You Moon: Te amo Sol / Te amo Luna (Spanish Edition)","description":"Small children discover the world around them and declare their relationship to all the wonders in that world.

Why did she leave and what did she do for twenty years out of the spotlight before returning to television? This is her funny and inspiring memoir of fame, heartache, resilience--and the reboot of a lifetime . . . When Kimmy Gibbler burst into the Tanners' home on Full House in 1987, audiences immediately connected with the confident and quirky pre-teen character, played by ten-year-old actress Andrea Barber. During an eight-season run on one of the most popular series of the '80s and '90s, Andrea came of age in front of millions. But she was as far removed from her character as a girl can get. The introverted young star was plagued with self-doubt, insecurities, and debilitating anxieties that left her questioning her identity after the show's cancelation. Andrea wouldn't return to the public eye until 2016, for Fuller House. So what happened in those intervening decades that Andrea jokingly calls \\"the lost years\\"? For starters, Andrea never stopped working. But it was on a series of life-changing transitions: earning a college degree, then a Master's, building a career in international education, getting married, and starting a family. She also faced some unforeseeable transitions: navigating a sudden divorce after nearly twelve years of marriage, and second-guessing her capabilities as a single mother. But it was her devastating bout with post-partum anxiety and depression that derailed Andrea's life--and became a crucial turning point. Full Circle is a raw, refreshingly honest look into the life of a celebrity who has never been fully comfortable in the spotlight. Here Andrea shares her deeply personal struggles with mental health in a way she has never done before. She opens up about fighting her way back and finding solace--while finding herself--all before her life came full circle with her costars and lifelong friends on Fuller House. Sharing her journey from child star, to champion of mental health, and back to stardom, Andrea writes in a way that feels like catching up with an old friend. You'll laugh, reminisce, and finally get to know the woman behind the zany next door neighbor.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=chUAEAAAQBAJ&dq=Full+Circle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sewing Shut My Eyes (Black Ice Books.)","description":"A selection of short stories set in a future where America has become a channel-surfing nation, where pain has become home theatre and, with so many channels, watching TV beats sex.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BPeC2798LjYC&dq=Sewing+Shut+My+Eyes+(Black+Ice+Books.)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A treatise on the cavalry and saddle horse: With remarks on racing and leaping, observations on breeding, &c.; &c.; &c;","description":"Excerpt from A Treatise on the Cavalry and Saddle Horse: With Remarks on Racing and Leaping, Observations on Breeding, &C. &C. &C I am convinced that any production that may tend to promote the interests of the country at large, and more especially of that department over which you preside with so much vigilance, energy, and discretion, will receive your cordial support and encouragement.

Drawing on exclusive access to J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and a tightly bonded team of bankers known on Wall Street as the  Morgan Mafia,  as well as in-depth interviews with dozens of other key players, including Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, Tett brings to life in gripping detail how the Morgan team s bold ideas for a whole new kind of financial alchemy helped to ignite a revolution in banking, and how that revolution escalated wildly out of control. The deeply reported and lively narrative takes readers behind the scenes, to the inner sanctums of elite finance and to the secretive reaches of what came to be known as the  shadow banking  world. The story begins with the intense Morgan brainstorming session in 1994 beside a pool in Boca Raton, where the team cooked up a dazzling new idea for the exotic financial product known as credit derivatives. That idea would rip around the banking world, catapult Morgan to the top of the turbocharged derivatives trade, and fuel an extraordinary banking boom that seemed to have unleashed banks from ages-old constraints of risk. But when the Morgan team s derivatives dream collided with the housing boom, and was perverted through hubris, delusion, and sheer greed by titans of banking that included Citigroup, UBS, Deutsche Bank, and the thundering herd at Merrill Lynch even as J.P. Morgan itself stayed well away from the risky concoctions others were peddling catastrophe followed. Tett s access to Dimon and the J.P. Morgan leaders who so skillfully steered their bank away from the wild excesses of others sheds invaluable light not only on the untold story of how they engineered their bank s escape from carnage but also on how possible it was for the larger banking world, regulators, and rating agencies to have spotted, and heeded, the terrible risks of a meltdown. A tale of blistering brilliance and willfully blind ambition, Fool s Gold is both a rare journey deep inside the arcane and wildly competitive world of high finance and a vital contribution to understanding how the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression was perpetrated.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9aQOCMEI7m8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Technology: A Manager's Guide [Paperback]","description":"This book addresses the issues facing the growth of object technology and to provide a glimpse into the future of this evolving paradigm.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=07cmAAAAMAAJ&dq=Object-Oriented+Technology:+A+Manager%27s+Guide+%5BPaperback%5D&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Parting of the Ways: Between Christianity and Judaism and Their Significance for the Character of Christianity","description":"A unique study of the development of Christianity's divergence from Judaism that is most relevant to today's students of multi-faith societies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6w4QAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Parting+of+the+Ways:+Between+Christianity+and+Judaism+and+Their+Significance+for+the+Character+of+Christianity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A New Century Chinese-English Dictionary (Smaller Print Edition) (Chinese and English Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Lean Communications Provider: Surviving the Shakeout through Service Management Excellence","description":"Written by two of the world's foremost authorities on service management, this hands-on book gives you a front-row seat to one of the most significant business transformations in history.

Howard created more than the greatest action hero of the twentieth century he also launched a genre that came to be known as sword and sorcery. But Conan wasn t the first archetypal adventurer to spring from Howard s fertile imagination.  He was . . . a strange blending of Puritan and Cavalier, with a touch of the ancient philosopher, and more than a touch of the pagan. . . . A hunger in his soul drove him on and on, an urge to right all wrongs, protect all weaker things. . . . Wayward and restless as the wind, he was consistent in only one respect he was true to his ideals of justice and right. Such was Solomon Kane.  Collected in this volume, lavishly illustrated by award-winning artist Gary Gianni, are all of the stories and poems that make up the thrilling saga of the dour and deadly Puritan, Solomon Kane. Together they constitute a sprawling epic of weird fantasy adventure that stretches from sixteenth-century England to remote African jungles where no white man has set foot. Here are shudder-inducing tales of vengeful ghosts and bloodthirsty demons, of dark sorceries wielded by evil men and women, all opposed by a grim avenger armed with a fanatic s faith and a warrior s savage heart. This edition also features exclusive story fragments, a biography of Howard by scholar Rusty Burke, and  In Memoriam,  H. P. Lovecraft s moving tribute to his friend and fellow literary genius.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BXiWzLY3OLsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rolling Stones (Ace SF #73440)","description":"Wonder where to dive into Heinlein's justly famous adventure novels This is the place!

Kevin Mumford chronicles the role of vice districts in New York and Chicago as crucibles for the shaping of racial categories and racial inequalities. Focusing on Chicago's South Side and Levee districts, and Greenwich Village and Harlem in New York at the height of the Progressive era, Mumford traces the connections between the Great Migration, the commercialization of leisure, and the politics of reform and urban renewal. Interzones is the first book to examine in depth the combined effects on American culture of two major transformations: the migration north of southern blacks and the emergence of a new public consumer culture. Mumford writes an important chapter in Progressive-era history from the perspectives of its most marginalized and dispossessed citizens. Recreating the mixed-race underworlds of brothels and dance halls, and charting the history of a black-white sexual subculture, Mumford shows how fluid race relations were in these \\"interzones.\\" From Jack Johnson and the \\"white slavery\\" scare of the 1910's to the growth of a vital gay subculture and the phenomenon of white slumming, he explores in provocative detail the connections between political reforms and public culture, racial prejudice and sexual taboo, the hardening of the color line and the geography of modern inner cities. The complicated links between race and sex, and reform and reaction, are vividly displayed in Mumford's look at a singular moment in the settling of American culture and society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2deazgEACAAJ&dq=Interzones:+Black/White+Sex+Districts+in+Chicago+and+New+York+in+the+Early+Twentieth+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Overnight Sensation: The Story of the Raspberries","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TML3AAAACAAJ&dq=Overnight+Sensation:+The+Story+of+the+Raspberries&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Democracy and social ethics (The Citizen's library of economics, politics, and sociology)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hnQSAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Handy Concordance of the Septuagint: Giving Various Readings from Codices Vaticanus, Alexandrinus, Sinaiticus, and Ephraemi","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1xJbAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Racial Attitudes in America: Trends and Interpretations, Revised Edition","description":"This new edition brings fully up-to-date a book widely praised for its clear and objective presentation of changes in American racial attitudes during the second half of the twentieth century.

Beginning in 1956, road trips across the American Southwest furnished a conceptual trove of themes and motifs that he mined throughout his career. The everyday landscapes of the West, especially as experienced from the automobile gas stations, billboards, building facades, parking lots, and long stretches of roadway are the primary motifs of his often deadpan and instantly recognizable paintings and works on paper, as well as his influential artist books such as Twentysix Gasoline Stations and All the Buildings on the Sunset Strip. His iconic word images declaring Adios, Rodeo, Wheels over Indian Trails, and Honey . . . I Twisted through More Damn Traffic to Get Here further underscore a contemporary Western sensibility. Ruscha s interest in what the real West has become and Hollywood s version of it plays out across his oeuvre. The cinematic sources of his subject matter can be seen in his silhouette pictures, which often appear to be grainy stills from old Hollywood movies. They feature images of the contemporary West, such as parking lots and swimming pools, but also of its historical past: covered wagons, buffalo, teepees, and howling coyotes. Featuring essays by Karin Breuer and D.J. Waldie, plus a fascinating interview with the artist conducted by Kerry Brougher, this stunning catalogue, produced in close collaboration with the Ruscha studio, offers the first full exploration of the painter s lifelong fascination with the romantic concept and modern reality of the evolving American West.

Psmith, Journalist is the third of Wodehouse s Psmith novels, and is a marked departure from the author s usual settings and themes. It presents a very strong social justice theme with direct, harsh condemnation of exploitation, corruption, racism, and inequality in early-twentieth century America, and its themes continue to resonate with readers a century later.

From the beginning of photography it has attracted photographers, many of whom have imitated the forms and postures portrayed by painters. There are a few moments when a photographer has abandoned derivative styles and allowed the viewer to see the body in completely new manner. This occured in America in the work of Edward Weston and in Britain in the work of Bill Brandt. It now occurs in the photographs of Lee Friedlander. ver the last fifteen years, Friedlander has been working with a number of models to create his own way of seeing and photographing the female nude. Little of this work has ever appeared. The photographs are both highly intimate and coolly detached. The frequently surprising perspectives are balanced by the mundane backdrops of ordinary life, the real domestic interiors of the models. his book is published on the occasion of an exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, and confirms Friedlander's stature as one of the greatest photographers of his generation. He appears to have taken a primary theme of Western art and re-invented it.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1-vGQgAACAAJ&dq=Nudes:+Indexxi+(Photography)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BIONIC eTeamwork","description":"The age of co-located teams is past, our teammates aren't down the hall they're across the globe.

The first five chapters are purely mathematical in nature and make extensive use of the column vector notation and scaled cofactors. They contain a number of important relations involving derivatives which prove beyond a doubt that the theory of determinants has emerged from the confines of classical algebra into the brighter world of analysis. Chapter 6 is devoted to the verifications of the known determinantal solutions of several nonlinear equations which arise in three branches of mathematical physics, namely lattice, soliton and relativity theory. The solutions are verified by applying theorems established in earlier chapters, and the book ends with an extensive bibliography and index. Several contributions have never been published before.

Basing his work on available congressional records and administrative reports, Beard concludes that FDR's image as a neutral, peace-loving leader was a smokescreen, behind which he planned for war against Germany and Japan even well before the attack on Pearl Harbor.Beard contends that the distinction between aiding allies in Europe like Great Britain and maintaining strict neutrality with respect to nations like Germany and Japan was untenable. Beard does not argue that all nations were alike, or that some did and others did not merit American support, but rather that Roosevelt chose to aid Great Britain secretly and unconstitutionally rather than making the case to the American public. President Roosevelt shifted from a policy of neutrality to one of armed intervention, but he did so without surrendering the appearance, the fiction of neutrality. This core argument makes the work no less explosive in 2003 than it was when first issued in 1948.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YG9QDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shoot for the Star","description":"In 1914 France, a British soldier writes to his mother about the strange events of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, when German and Allied soldiers met on neutral ground to share songs, food, and fun.

In today's pluralistic, postsecular world, universal values are dismissed as mere matters of private opinion, and the question of what constitutes flourishing life--for ourselves, our neighbors, and the planet as a whole--is neglected in our universities, our churches, and our culture at large. Although we increasingly have technology to do almost anything, we have little sense of what is truly worth accomplishing. In this provocative new contribution to public theology, world-renowned theologian Miroslav Volf (named \\"America's New Public Intellectual\\" by Scot McKnight on his Jesus Creed blog) and Matthew Croasmun explain that the intellectual tools needed to rescue us from our present malaise and meet our new cultural challenge are the tools of theology. A renewal of theology is crucial to help us articulate compelling visions of the good life, find our way through the maze of contested questions of value, and answer the fundamental question of what makes life worth living.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Uzk4zgEACAAJ&dq=For+the+life+of+the+world&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sanitary City: Urban Infrastructure in America from Colonial Times to the Present (Creating the North American Landscape)","description":"The authors examines water supply and waste disposal in U.S. cities from Colonial times to the present day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cYUoAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Sanitary+City:+Urban+Infrastructure+in+America+from+Colonial+Times+to+the+Present+(Creating+the+North+American+Landscape)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Psychology of Christian Personality","description":"Interpretation of the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount in terms of psychology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C0caAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Psychology+of+Christian+Personality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Science Shams & Bible Bloopers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mLpfAAAAIAAJ&dq=Science+Shams&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PHENOMENAL WOMAN.","description":"A collection of beloved poems about women from the iconic Maya Angelou These four poems,  Phenomenal Woman,   Still I Rise,   Weekend Glory,  and  Our Grandmothers,  are among the most remembered and acclaimed of Maya Angelou's poems.

Jay, however, is simply not content to hide like a mole in a hole and drags Den out of his backyard and into a world of mischief and mishaps. From homemade bombs (created from the only product a dog manufactures) to talking parrots, Den and Jay stuff a lifetime's worth of adventures into their seventh grade year.Unfortunately for Russell  or perhaps for Den and Jay  every misdeed by the two friends lands squarely on Russell's head (not unlike those homemade bombs).

One of the leading scholars of ancient thought, Benardete here reflects on both the people he knew and the topics that fascinated him throughout his career in a series of candid, freewheeling conversations with Robert Berman, Ronna Burger, and Michael Davis. The first part of the book discloses vignettes about fellow students, colleagues, and acquaintances of Benardete's who later became major figures in the academic and intellectual life of twentieth-century America. We glimpse the student days of Allan Bloom, Stanley Rosen, George Steiner, and we discover the life of the mind as lived by well-known scholars such as David Grene, Jacob Klein, and Benardete's mentor Leo Strauss. We also encounter a number of other learned, devoted, and sometimes eccentric luminaries, including T.S. Eliot, James Baldwin, Werner Jaeger, John Davidson Beazley, and Willard Quine. In the book's second part, Benardete reflects on his own intellectual growth and on his ever-evolving understanding of the texts and ideas he spent a lifetime studying. Revisiting some of his recurrent themes among them eros and the beautiful, the city and the law, and the gods and the human soul Benardete shares his views on thinkers such as Plato, Homer, and Heidegger, as well as the relations between philosophy and science and between Christianity and ancient Roman thought. Engaging and informative, Encounters and Reflections brings Benardete's thought to life to enlighten and inspire a new generation of thinkers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NhiVf2hr5fIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Imperial Alibis: Rationalizing U.S. Intervention After the Cold War","description":"\\"Lucidly argued and carefully documented, Stephen Shalom's study of the pretexts for intervention is an invaluable guide to the recent past and unlikely future\\".--Noam Chomsky, author of \\"Necessary Illusions\\".

Yardley was chief of the first peacetime cryptanalytic organization in the United States, the ancestor of today's National Security Agency. Funded by the U.S. Army and the Department of State and working out of New York, his small and highly secret unit succeeded in breaking the diplomatic codes of several nations, including Japan. The decrypts played a critical role in U.S. diplomacy. Despite its extraordinary successes, the Black Chamber, as it came to known, was disbanded in 1929. President Hoover's new Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson refused to continue its funding with the now-famous comment, \\"Gentlemen do not read other people's mail.\\" In 1931 a disappointed Yardley caused a sensation when he published this book and revealed to the world exactly what his agency had done with the secret and illegal cooperation of nearly the entire American cable industry. These revelations and Yardley's right to publish them set into motion a conflict that continues to this day: the right to freedom of expression versus national security.

One of the targets happened to be the White House Chief of Staff. But that wasn't the reason Sean Drummond was called in on the case. Newly enlisted in a CIA cell called the Office of Special Projects, the former Army lawyer was informed that the murders were just a warning. The killer had left a note: \\"You can't stop us. There will be others, and the President will be history in the next two days.\\" The clock is ticking.

At Tannenberg in 1914 their brilliance on the battlefield annihilated one Russian army completely, and drove a second from German territory in disarray. They repeated these feats time and again on the Eastern Front, and when Falkenhayn resigned as Chief of the Great General Staff in 1916 (partly through the pair's intriguing against him), Hindenburg was the natural choice to take over. where literally everything was geared towards helping the war effort, their influence reached into all parts of German life: not only the army but the economy, industry, the transport systems, and the production and distribution of food. Their power was such that they were able to force the resignation of three successive Chancellors and several government ministers. They meddled in foreign policy and affairs of state with such frequency that it was impossible for anyone of note to hold office without their approval. By the end of the First World War, Germany was effectively a military dictatorship. his concise but incredibly comprehensive history of the war, John Lee shows how Hindenburg and Ludendorff rose to power, and how their iron grip on the nation very soon brought Germany to the brink of starvation, with riots and industrial strikes reaching epidemic proportions. He also shows how their Prussian values not only contributed to Germany's downfall, but paved the way for an even more devastating war 20 years later.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_ZR9QgAACAAJ&dq=Warlords:+Hindenburg+and+Ludendorff+(Great+Commanders+S.)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silence and Solitude: Inspirations for Meditation and Spiritual Growth","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xdZFAAAACAAJ&dq=Silence+and+Solitude:+Inspirations+for+Meditation+and+Spiritual+Growth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Watsons Apology","description":"A novel of marital bickering and murder based on a historical case in Victorian England, from the bestselling author of The Birthday Boys. In the winter of 1884, John Selby Watson, a clergyman and headmaster living in London, writes a series of love letters including a marriage proposal to a woman he met only briefly at a social gathering many years before. Though Anne Armstrong does not remember Watson, she is desperate to escape poverty and the miserable life she shares with her sister in a moldy Dublin boarding house. So she accepts. Despite the abrupt circumstances of their engagement and Anne s initial distaste for her betrothed several years of happy marriage follow. But Watson soon becomes entrenched in his studies of classical literature, leaving his wife feeling alienated and dejected. Trivial disputes agitate the couple s domestic life with increasing frequency a letter goes missing, the page of a book gets stained until the bickering erupts into full-blown abuse and, during a night of drinking, their toxic environment reaches its destructive climax. Based on a real nineteenth-century murder case, Watson s Apology is a speculative novel about the complex psychological motivations that underlie a seemingly straightforward domestic tragedy. Using dark irony and twisted humor, award-winning British author Beryl Bainbridge reveals the terror that resides in the banal, and the suspense that can be found in the mysteries of the mind and heart.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hs3xDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Approaches to Teaching Dickens' David Copperfield (Approaches to Teaching Masterpieces of World Literature)","description":"Now at seventy-three volumes, this popular MLA series (ISSN 1059-1133) addresses a broad range of literary texts.

It explores the relation of the social and the spatial in the context of critical urban themes: community and anonymity; social difference and spatial divisions; politics and public space; gentrification and urban renewal; gender and sexuality; subjectivity and space; experience and everyday practice in the city. The text adopts an international and interdisciplinary approach, drawing on a range of debates on cities and urban life. It brings together classic perspectives in urban sociology and social theory with the analysis of contemporary urban problems and issues. Rather than viewing the urban simply as a backdrop for more general social processes, the discussion looks at how social and spatial relations shape different versions of the city: as a place of social interaction and of solitude; as a site of difference and segregation; as a space of politics and power; as a landscape of economic and cultural distinction; as a realm of everyday experience and freedom. Similarly, it examines how core social categories - such as class, culture, gender, sexuality and community - are shaped and reproduced in urban contexts. Linking debates in urban studies to wider concerns within social theory and analysis, this accessible text will appeal to undergraduate and postgraduate students in urban sociology, social and cultural geography, urban and cultural studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oXA7Ut7nrVwC&dq=London:+The+Lives+of+the+City+(Granta,+65,+Spring+1999)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Loving in Time of War","description":"The Internationally Bestselling Author of The English Wife  Beautifully epic, romantic & rich in detail  #1 & USA Today bestseller Lorna Cook  Sweeping and evocative  Rosanna Ley Three sisters The Great War The end of innocence...","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yw86EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just One Look","description":"A young woman s escalating obsession with a seemingly perfect man leads her down a dangerous path in this  delicious and marvelously controlled  (The New York Times Book Review) novel of suspense.

After suffering an epic tumble down the corporate ladder, Cassie finds the only way she can pay her bills is to take a thankless temp job reviewing correspondence for a large-scale fraud suit. The daily drudgery amplifies all that her life is lacking love, friends, stability and leaves her with too much time on her hands, which she spends fixating on the mistakes that brought her to this point. While sorting through a relentless deluge of emails, something catches her eye: the tender (and totally private) exchanges between a partner at the firm, Forest Watts, and his enchanting wife, Annabelle. Cassie knows she shouldn t read them. But it s just one look. And once that door opens, she finds she can t look away. Every day, twenty floors below Forest s corner office, Cassie dissects their emails from her dingy workstation. A few clicks of her mouse and she can see every adoring word they write to each other. By peeking into their apparently perfect life, Cassie finds renewed purpose and happiness, reveling in their penchant for vintage wines, morning juice presses, and lavish dinner parties thrown in their stately Westchester home.

As time passed, however, he had to ask himself: Was he acting unwillingly? Though repelled by Murrell's cold-blooded ambitions, he was captivated by the man.When at last Stewart undertook to demolish Murrell's blueprint for revolution, he was torn between his duty to society and his own muddled emotions. Was he serving justice or playing Judas? Even after he had risked his life to bring Murrell before the law, his fellow citizens could not decide who the villain was, Murrell or Stewart. The denouement of this extraordinary segment of history takes some startling twists, and inspires speculation about the faint line between good and evil.From fragments of historical fact and the few fairly reliable legends that exist, Gary Jennings has fashioned a gripping novel, filled with menace and leavened with humor and romance. No two men could have been more unlike than the sophisticated Murrell and the unworldly Stewart. But these characters really lived, and really did the things they do here.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MWVHNwAACAAJ&dq=Sow+the+Seeds+of+Hemp+1ST+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Srimad Bhagavad Gita: With text in Sanskrit, transliteration, English translation, and brief introduction to each chapter","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PDXfNwAACAAJ&dq=Srimad+Bhagavad+Gita:+With+text+in+Sanskrit,+transliteration,+English+translation,+and+brief+introduction+to+each+chapter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Why Draw a Landscape?","description":"Cultural Writing.

As he says,  I honestly can t see why everybody who isn t a child, everybody who s theoretically old enough to have understood what death means, doesn t spend all his time thinking about it. It s a pretty arresting thought.  He also happens to own and run a country inn that is haunted. The Green Man opens as Maurice s father drops dead (had he seen something in the room?) and continues as friends and family convene for the funeral. Maurice s problems are many and increasing: How to deal with his own declining health? How to reach out to a teenage daughter who watches TV all the time? How to get his best friend s wife in the sack? How to find another drink? (And another.) And then there is always death. The Green Man is a ghost story that hits a live nerve, a very black comedy with an uncannily happy ending: in other words, Kingsley Amis at his best.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w1YASDar-qwC&dq=THE+GREEN+MAN&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Liu Tsung-y&#252;an and Intellectual Change in T'ang China, 773-819 (Cambridge Studies in Chinese History, Literature and Institutions)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=REYXtAEACAAJ&dq=Liu+Tsung-y&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Royal flush,: The story of Minette, (The Golden library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=leZzzgEACAAJ&dq=Royal+flush,:+The+story+of+Minette,+(The+Golden+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Miracle of Metaphysical Healing","description":"Case histories support the author's simple system for activating the healing powers within oneself for improved health","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7puk9_Hd0ogC&dq=The+Miracle+of+Metaphysical+Healing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Nursery","description":"KILLING EVE MEETS MICK HERRON IN THIS GRIPPING AND WITTY PAGE-TURNER ABOUT HAVING IT ALL, KEEPING IT ALL AND SURVIVING IT ALL.

The spectres which haunt these Irish ghost stories include massacred Spanish sailors, a silver-robed woman who plies her guests with poison, a mutilated pedlar, a benign but icy embrace, and the devil himself. They are drawn from the rich and varied literary tradition of a culture long enchanted bythings supernatural, a land where ghosts and ghost-seers are common.

It has achieved considerable currency in the social sciences through the very different work of Bourdieu in France, and James Coleman and Robert Putnam in the States, and has been taken up within politics and sociology as a means of explaining the decline of social cohesion and community values in many Western societies. This concise introduction, the only one currently available, explains the theoretical underpinning of the subject, the empirical work that has been done to explore its operation, and the effect that it has had on policy-making particularly within such international governmental bodies as the World Bank and the European Commission. With genuine cross-disciplinary appeal, this exceptional book will be of great interest to students of sociology, politics and social policy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sAzOkEgSRj0C&dq=Social+Capital+(Key+Ideas)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cognitive Models of Memory (Studies in Cognition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Steal Away to Freedom","description":"Thomas Johnson and Charles Spurgeon lived worlds apart.

Sasson argues that the significance of our national pre-occupation with the issue depends on how it is constructed or \\"framed\\" in the mass media and in everyday conversation. Drawing on the methodology for analyzing issue frames in political discourse developed by William Gamson (who has contributed a foreword to this book), Sasson identifies the five interpretative frames that comprise the crime debate: Faulty System, Social Breakdown, Blocked Opportunities, Media Violence, and Racist System. Tracking the performances of these frames in twenty small group discussions among black and white urbanites, and in a sample of newspaper columns, he demonstrates that the two \\"generally conservative\\" frames, Faulty System and Social Breakdown, are by far the most prominent. He explains their prominence in the group discussions through a careful analysis of the ideational resources (popular wisdom, personal experience, media discourse) used by the participants. Sasson's empirical findings lead him to conclude that the American preoccupation with crime will generate recurrent demands for a more expansive and punitive criminal justice system and new support for conservative politicians and their causes. Apart from its contribution to the understanding of the civic role of crime and of the politics of crime control, Crime Talk also advances a methodology for framing popular discourse, and a theoretical perspective on how ordinary citizens make sense of social problems. A study at the intersections of criminology and political sociology, it will capture the attention of a wide range of social scientists, as well as instructors in courses on social problems, the mass media and research methodology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Vmfae_yBkHMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The allegory of love;: A study in medieval tradition,","description":"A classic study of the allegorical power of love in literature, traced through the medieval and Renaissance periods.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3R1aAQAAQBAJ&dq=The+allegory+of+love%3B:+A+study+in+medieval+tradition,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"War With the Newts","description":"Originally written in 1936, two years before Capek's death and three years before the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia, War with the Newts is considered by many to be Capek's greatest book.

Freedom and faith were intertwined. America, as a foreign observer once put it, is a nation with the soul of a church.

What emerges is our shared destiny.

As with \\"black boxes, \\" their success may be gauged by their relative invisibility -- and this was the indirect goal of the objects that Julian Yates considers here: the portrait miniature, the relic, the privy (flush toilet), the printed text, and the priest-hole (a secret hiding place for Catholic priests in Protestant England). Because each of these contrivances was prone to error, misuse, and sometimes catastrophic failure, they become in Yates's analysis an occasion for recasting the history of the English Renaissance as object lessons -- \\"knowing from the point of view of the known.\\" It is through such lapses -- the texts and stories generated to explain away a relic that is too easily faked, a miniature that is too curiously real, the stench of a failing privy, a book that persistently sheds its pages, or the presence of so much \\"papist trash\\" in an ostensibly reformed England -- that Yates recovers the silent work of \\"things\\" in cultural production. Drawing object lessons from failing technological devices, Error, Misuse, Failure plumbs the foundations of Renaissance culture in England, recovering a curious language of mistakes, dirt, and parasitism that associates the failures of these \\"things\\" with the figures of Rome, Catholicism, and Sodom. Yates offers a mode of historical inquiry rooted in material culture, sensitive to the way humans induct nonhumans (animals, plants, and manufactured things) into their communities. Historically, the book offers a new set of stories about the rise of printing, the development of domestic architecture, and England's Catholic community -- stories that remind readers of the ways in whichattending to the history of nonhumans requires a radical rethinking of historical landmarks and boundaries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K2EOf7JN68IC&dq=Error,+Misuse,+Failure:+Object+Lessons+From+The+English+Renaissance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Linear Estimation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T4oGCrPWvcQC&dq=Linear+Estimation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Christmas Spirit","description":"In the same feel-good style of I Got the Rhythm, this exuberant picture book explores the joys of the holiday season, once again illustrated by award-winning artist Frank Morrison.

Abandoned by Ted Hughes, Sylvia found companionship and care in the home of Becker and her husband, who helped care for the estranged couple's two small children while Sylvia tried to rest. In clear-eyed recollections unclouded by the intervening decades, Becker describes the events of Sylvia's final days and suicide: her physical and emotional state, her grief over Hughes's infidelity, her mysterious meeting with an unknown companion the night before her suicide, and the harsh aftermath of her funeral.

Their contributions reflect not only widely divergent political orientations and value systems, but also three distinct domains of inquiry into human motivation and behavior -- social scientific, psychodynamic (or psychoanalytical), and clinical practice. Each of these three domains is privy to important evidence and insights that need to transcend epistemological and methodological boundaries if understanding of the subject is to improve dramatically. In keeping with this notion, the editors asked the authors to go beyond a summary of findings, and lend additional distinction to the book by applying the \\"binoculars\\" of their particular perspective and offering suggestions as to the implications of their findings. One of the goals of the conference that resulted in this book was consensus building in the area of media and family. From examining the findings and insights of a diverse group of scholars, it seems that consensus building in several areas is a distinct possibility. Addressing the concerns of educators about the influence of the mass media of communication -- entertainment programs in particular -- on children and the welfare of the nuclear family, this volume projects directions for superior programming, especially for educational television. The influence of sex and violence on children and adults is given much attention, and the development of moral judgment and sexual expectations, among other things, is explored. The critical analysis of media effects includes examination of positive contributions of the media, such as the search for missing children and exemplary educational programs.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0XT_AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strategic Nonviolent Conflict: The Dynamics of People Power in the Twentieth Century","description":"Nonviolent action, well planned and implemented, is shown in this lucid, timely, and compelling work to effect dramatic outcomes against opponents utilizing violence. Ackerman and Kruegler recognize that not all nonviolent efforts meet with success, and they are careful to stress that a nonviolent approach involves great risks as well as opportunities. It is the effectiveness of the strategies employed which will determine whether or not those using nonviolent means can prevail against opponents who rely on violence in pursuit of objectives. Twelve strategic principles are established in this book which serve as a conceptual foundation to enhance the prospects of success in nonviolent campaigns. The authors also develop six twentieth-century examples of nonviolent action from the early Russian Revolution of 1904-1906 through the Solidarity movement in 1980-1981. Each campaign narrative constitutes a fascinating reading experience and illustrates common themes, strategies, and important aspects of behavior on the part of major participants in nonviolent encounters. This is a singularly important book. It offers more than a mere plea for nonviolence. Ackerman and Kruegler introduce their work by noting the surprising extent to which nonviolent sanctions are currently employed to pressure adversaries in the international political arena. They go onto provide hard lessons based on important, and often painful, historical efforts; principles to govern the choice and implementation of strategies when nonviolent action is the determined response; and insightful analysis to guide assessment and policy. A work which will focus analysis, inform decision-making, stimulate policy consideration, and invigorate research, this volume will well serve professionals and students in international relations and numerous related fields.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qGWDAAAAMAAJ&dq=Strategic+Nonviolent+Conflict:+The+Dynamics+of+People+Power+in+the+Twentieth+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Resolving Conflict Once and for All : A Practical How-To Guide to Mediating Disputes","description":"Resolving Conflict Once and For All is a practical, how-to guide to mediating disputes for managers, supervisors, attorneys, therapists, educators...anyone who is called upon to resolve conflict.

One of our most brilliant and original management thinkers, Mintzberg concludes that the term is an oxymoron -- that strategy cannot be planned because planning is about analysis and strategy is about synthesis. That is why, he asserts, the process has failed so often and so dramatically. Mintzberg traces the origins and history of strategic planning through its prominence and subsequent fall. He argues that we must reconceive the process by which strategies are created -- by emphasizing informal learning and personal vision -- and the roles that can be played by planners. Mintzberg proposes new and unusual definitions of planning and strategy, and examines in novel and insightful ways the various models of strategic planning and the evidence of why they failed. Reviewing the so-called \\"pitfalls\\" of planning, he shows how the process itself can destroy commitment, narrow a company's vision, discourage change, and breed an atmosphere of politics. In a harsh critique of many sacred cows, he describes three basic fallacies of the process -- that discontinuities can be predicted, that strategists can be detached from the operations of the organization, and that the process of strategy-making itself can be formalized. Mintzberg devotes a substantial section to the new role for planning, plans, and planners, not inside the strategy-making process, but in support of it, providing some of its inputs and sometimes programming its outputs as well as encouraging strategic thinking in general. This book is required reading for anyone in an organization who is influenced by the planning or the strategy-making processes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WNqVnAEACAAJ&dq=Rise+and+Fall+of+Strategic+Planning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Call: Pediatrics (On Call Series)","description":"Ideal for any on-call professional, resident, or medical student, this popular reference covers the common problems you'll encounter while on call without direct supervision in the hospital.

The first building block comprises analytical skills and structures needed for handling the basic notions of limits and continuity in a simple concrete setting while the second component involves conducting analysis in higher dimensions and more abstract spaces. Largely self-contained, the book begins with the fundamental axioms of the real number system and gradually develops the core of real analysis. The first few chapters present the essentials needed for analysis, including the concepts of sets, relations, and functions. The following chapters cover the theory of calculus on the real line, exploring limits, convergence tests, several functions such as monotonic and continuous, power series, and theorems like mean value, Taylor's, and Darboux's. The final chapters focus on more advanced theory, in particular, the Lebesgue theory of measure and integration. Requiring only basic knowledge of elementary calculus, this textbook presents the necessary material for a first course in real analysis. Developed by experts who teach such courses, it is ideal for undergraduate students in mathematics and related disciplines, such as engineering, statistics, computer science, and physics, to understand the foundations of real analysis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ecBHb5Hqrm0C&dq=Elements+of+Real+Analysis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Check-Cashing and Money Transfer Services","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FdJwGwAACAAJ&dq=Check-Cashing+and+Money+Transfer+Services&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 8 #3: The Long Way Home Part Three (Dark Horse Comics)","description":"Series creator Joss Whedon brought Buffy the Vampire Slayer back to life with this comics-only follow-up to Season 7 of the television show.

Reviews of unwritten novels, prefaces to fraudulent books, narratives of dictionary entries, and one interminable sentence, all written in a style as strewn with landmines as everyday speech. In \\"Samuel Beckett's Middlemarch\\" a scholar undertakes to reconstruct the deceased author's reputation after the discovery of a thousand page realist novel among Beckett's posthumous papers. The novel, about an idealistic young Englishwoman in a nineteenth-century village, is heralded by some as Beckett's broadest parody, decried by others as Beckett's dementia, but in the imaginary interval between modernity and tradition the scholar locates another Beckett of whom only Middlemarch can make an end. The spirit of Wittgenstein hovers low over these literary pratfalls where materiality proves the most artificial of abstractions and what goes without saying always leaves somebody up in the air. In \\"Knott Unbound\\" an office worker suspected of murder recalls feeling a pain but can't otherwise account for his time. \\"That the missing time should be missing from his life seemed, if you thought about it, the merest of accidents, like bad genes or rich parents, and the thought that Knott's well-being rested on nothing surer, nothing but the likelihood that his every second would follow the preceding with no break, all this struck him as fantastically irrational. How did humans abide it? But the world was a slave to such prejudices.\\" In these fabrications reminiscent of Stein, Borges, and Sorrentino, Berry unsettles the grounds of narrating. In \\"Mimesis\\" a semi-literate surveyor struggles against metaphysical abandonment in a Florida swamp; in \\"Torture!\\" an anthropologist leaves his lifelong study of cruelty mysteriously unwritten; and in \\"A Theory of Fiction\\" a ruined man finds revenge in misrepresenting every injustice he's ever suffered. Nothing seems the matter. Everything appears to be wrong. From first word to last, these are fictions of impossible everydayness, where the telling of what's happening proves the unlikeliest feat of all.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k1ubLCnYQwkC&dq=Dictionary+of+Modern+Anguish&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Battle of Scary Creek: Military Operations in the Kanawha Valley, April-July 1861","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CY05AAAACAAJ&dq=The+Battle+of+Scary+Creek:+Military+Operations+in+the+Kanawha+Valley,+April-July+1861&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Joy of Gay Sex","description":"For a new century and a new generation of readers comes a fully revised and expanded edition of a classic guide to gay sex, love, and life.

On the basis of extensive interviews with patients and doctors, as well as day-to-day investigative fieldwork in residency programs, private psychiatric hospitals, and state hospitals, Luhrmann shows us how psychiatrists are trained, how they develop their particular way of seeing and listening to their patients, what makes a psychiatrist successful, and how the enormous ambiguities in the field affect its practitioners and patients. How do psychiatrists learn to do what they do? What is it like for psychiatrists to deal with people who are in emotional extremity? How does the choice between drug therapy and talk therapy, each of which requires very different skills, affect the way psychiatrists understand their patients? Boldly and with sharp insight, Luhrmann takes the reader into the world of young doctors in training. At a time when mood-altering drugs have revolutionized the treatment of the mentally ill and HMOs are forcing caregivers to take the pharmacological route, Luhrmann places us at the heart of the struggle -- do we treat people's brains or their minds? -- and allows us to see exactly what is at stake.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a9rt1N0AuXoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Night Of The Bilingual Telemarketers: A Baldo Collection","description":"The lead character of Baldo, Baldo Bermudez, is a 15-year-old Latino teen with visions of creating the perfect low rider and being popular with the girls. Meanwhile, the strip's creators, Hector Cantu and Carlos Castellanos, began the strip in 2000 with dreams of creating a comic rooted in Latin American heritage that would have wide appeal and soar in popularity. Judging by the pieces of car in the driveway and yet another dateless weekend for Baldo, it's fair to say Hector and Carlos are having all the luck, and Baldo's readers are having all the laughs. Night of the Bilingual Telemarketers is a compilation of strips from the increasingly popular comic's second year. When it launched in April 2000, the strip appeared in nearly 100 papers. Only three other strips in Universal Press Syndicate history had a larger circulation when they began, and all went on to have stellar careers: For Better or For Worse, Calvin & Hobbes, and The Boondocks. Baldo is primed to follow in those successful footsteps. The strip centers around Baldo and his humorous observations on teenage life in school and with family. On the home front is Baldo's relationship with his single-parent dad, his younger sister and budding political activist Gracie, and his live-in Old World aunt Carmen.Cantu and Castellanos know firsthand the experience of growing up within two cultures. Consequently, Baldo's daily adventures challenge him to balance his mainstream sensibilities with his Latino heritage. The result is the humorous mix of teenage silliness rooted in reality found in Night of the Bilingual Telemarketers, a book that will delight readers of all ages and cultures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HbjRQt5DRlIC&dq=Night+Of+The+Bilingual+Telemarketers:+A+Baldo+Collection&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mixed beasts: Rhymes and pictures","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YYoWAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Show and Sell Your Crafts","description":"With over 400,000 sellers on Etsy, how can you make YOUR shop stand out and increase your sales?

The true horror was that the vast majority of the populace was happy, content, and believed that what their government was doing was right. \\" That quote introduces what Britain's \\"Numberwatch\\" has called, \\"the most astonishing political saga since the rise of Adolph Hitler.\\" Dissecting Antismokers Brains examines the psychology and motivations that drive antismoking advocates while also analyzing their general abuse of language and science. The combination offers readers a solid foundation for understanding modern efforts to ban, tax, and harass smokers into nonexistence. Published in 2004, Brains remains ahead of its time with a startling freshness in its ideas and theories. The propaganda methods exposed here in their early development have grown and are being used even more intensively in the ads, press releases, and guidebooks of antismoking advocacy groups today. The modern stonewalling techniques examined in the author s follow-up volume, TobakkoNacht The Antismoking Endgame are shown in their birthing forms in his early communications with advocates and the callous abuse of our love for children continues to be exploited as ads show evil wisps of smoke seeking out open windows to attack babies in their nurseries. McFadden's warnings of future campaigns to deny jobs and medical care to smokers, to extend smoking bans to apartments and outdoor spaces, and to apply similar conditioning/nudging techniques to the control of alcohol and fast foods have proven far too true. For those seeking an in-depth but comfortably readable examination of the foundations of the antismoking movement, this book is essential. Its focus on the combination of psychology, propaganda analysis, and the misuse of science makes it a solid volume for college courses in the areas of social change, scientific ethics, political manipulation, and the use and limits of governmental control over citizen behavior. At the same time, its meticulous deconstruction of the basic scientific and statistical arguments fueling government-imposed smoking bans makes it accessible to anyone who's ever wondered how smoking has moved to being regularly presented as both an antisocial and even immoral character trait. Dissecting Antismokers' Brains remains an indispensable volume for anyone disturbed by, wishing to understand, or wanting to fight the growth of governmental control over personal life choices and behaviors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=628_AAAACAAJ&dq=Dissecting+Antismokers%27+Brains&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mia Hamm: On the Field with...

These drawings were the first pictorial representations of a man on horseback created in the New World. Horses spread rapidly throughout South America and ultimately wild hordes invaded Texas and California. The era of the American cowboy was born. Since that time, the cowboy and his horse have inspired thousands of remarkable works of art. In a magnificent pictorial survey, Ed Ainsworth shows the various ways in which this folk hero has been depicted in painting and sculpture, from the arrival of the Spaniards in the New World to the present. Steeped in the legend and nostalgia that have always surrounded the American cowboy, [this book] tells the complete history of cowboy art and artists--a story as romantic and exciting as the rugged conquests of the cowboys themselves. The artists lured West to paint the visual history of that region in the 19th and early 20th centuries were a restless, spirited breed. Many were cowpunchers and bronco busters; they were courageous men dedicated to a life of adventure. Every important artist of the West is covered in this survey: Charlie Russell and Frederic Remington, most critics' choice for the two greatest painters of the cowboy and Western range scene; Frank Reaugh, dubbed the 'Rembrandt of the Longhorns'; Charles Schreyvogel, whose paintings won special commendation from President Theodore Roosevelt; Olaf Seltzer, who ruined his eyes painting more than l00 miniatures--only 5? x 6?--that are prized by collectors throughout the world; and many, many other noteworthy painters and sculptors. In a fascinating chapter devoted to 'Will James,' Mr. Ainsworth clears up many of the mysteries surrounding this 'Lone Cowboy.' The author also examines the work of the top cowboy artists of today--among them: Peter Hurd, Ken Ralston, Burt Procter, Olaf Wieghorst (who did the painting on the front jacket of this book), Joe De Yong, and Melvin C. Warren (whose paintings have been bought by President Johnson and Governor John Connally of Texas). A chapter entitled 'Cowpunchers in Cartoons' takes a look at Western artists who gained their primary fame as cartoonists--J.R. Williams ('Out Our Way'), Vic Forsythe ('Way Out West'), and Fred Harmon, Jr. ('Red Ryder'). A volume that will be treasured by Western buffs and art lovers alike, The Cowboy in Art is sumptuously illustrated with 250 illustrations in black-and-white and I6 pages in full color.\\"--Dust jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t7ifAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+cowboy+in+art&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird (Cliffs Notes)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nSKanQAACAAJ&dq=Lee%27s+To+Kill+A+Mockingbird+(Cliffs+Notes)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How Students Learn: Reforming Schools Through Learner-Centered Eduction","description":"In How Students Learn: Reforming Schools Through Learner-Centered Education, leaders in the psychological and educational communities suggest that successful school reform must not only uphold standards but also must recognize students' differences and unique learning styles.

Red Rising thrilled readers and announced the presence of a talented new author. Golden Son changed the game and took the story of Darrow to the next level. Now comes the exhilarating next chapter in the Red Rising Saga: Morning Star. ITW THRILLER AWARD FINALIST ?  [Brown s] achievement is in creating an uncomfortably familiar world of flaw, fear, and promise.  Entertainment Weekly Darrow would have lived in peace, but his enemies brought him war. The Gold overlords demanded his obedience, hanged his wife, and enslaved his people. But Darrow is determined to fight back. Risking everything to transform himself and breach Gold society, Darrow has battled to survive the cutthroat rivalries that breed Society s mightiest warriors, climbed the ranks, and waited patiently to unleash the revolution that will tear the hierarchy apart from within. Finally, the time has come. But devotion to honor and hunger for vengeance run deep on both sides. Darrow and his comrades-in-arms face powerful enemies without scruple or mercy. Among them are some Darrow once considered friends. To win, Darrow will need to inspire those shackled in darkness to break their chains, unmake the world their cruel masters have built, and claim a destiny too long denied and too glorious to surrender.

Until now, they have been written about in general terms. Scottish Exodus breaks new ground by taking particular emigrants, drawn from the once-powerful Clan MacLeod, and discovering what happened to them and their families. These people became, among other things, French aristocrats, Polish resistance fighters, Texan ranchers, New Zealand shepherds, Australian goldminers, Aboriginal and African-American activists, Canadian mounted policemen and Confederate rebels. One nineteenth-century MacLeod even went so far as to swap his Gaelic for Arabic and his Christianity for Islam before settling down comfortably in Cairo. This gripping account of Scotland's worldwide diaspora is based on unpublished documents, letters and family histories. It is also based on the author's travels in the company of today's MacLeods - some of them still in Scotland, others further afield. Scottish Exodus is a tale of disastrous voyages, famine and dispossession, the hazards of pioneering on faraway frontiers. But it is also the moving story of how people separated from Scotland by hundreds of years and thousands of miles continue to identify with the small country where their journeyings began.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NpgpmFCbT40C&dq=Scottish+Exodus:+Travels+Among+a+Worldwide+Clan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Dancing Star: Inspirations to Guide and Heal","description":"For guidance during challenging times, A Dancing Star offers gems of wisdom from an array of celebrated figures, including Alice Baily, M.

Empire of the Summer Moon spans two astonishing stories. The first traces the rise and fall of the Comanches, the most powerful Indian tribe in American history. The second entails one of the most remarkable narratives ever to come out of the Old West: the epic saga of the pioneer woman Cynthia Ann Parker and her mixed-blood son Quanah, who became the last and greatest chief of the Comanches. Although readers may be more familiar with the tribal names Apache and Sioux, it was in fact the legendary fighting ability of the Comanches that determined when the American West opened up. Comanche boys became adept bareback riders by age six; full Comanche braves were considered the best horsemen who ever rode. They were so masterful at war and so skillful with their arrows and lances that they stopped the northern drive of colonial Spain from Mexico and halted the French expansion westward from Louisiana. White settlers arriving in Texas from the eastern United States were surprised to find the frontier being rolled backward by Comanches incensed by the invasion of their tribal lands. The war with the Comanches lasted four decades, in effect holding up the development of the new American nation. Gwynne s exhilarating account delivers a sweeping narrative that encompasses Spanish colonialism, the Civil War, the destruction of the buffalo herds, and the arrival of the railroads, and the amazing story of Cynthia Ann Parker and her son Quanah a historical feast for anyone interested in how the United States came into being. Hailed by critics, S. C. Gwynne s account of these events is meticulously researched, intellectually provocative, and, above all, thrillingly told. Empire of the Summer Moon announces him as a major new writer of American history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m6VWBwMAox4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Portugee Phillips and the fighting Sioux (The American adventure series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6KfdzgEACAAJ&dq=Portugee+Phillips+and+the+fighting+Sioux+(The+American+adventure+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ready . . .

Opus Dei (literally  the work of God ) is an international association of Catholics often labeled as conservative who seek personal Christian perfection and strive to implement Christian ideals in their jobs and in society as a whole. Founded in Spain in 1928, it now has 84,000 members (1,600 of whom are priests) in eighty countries. But far from running bingo nights at local parishes, Opus Dei has become a center of controversy and suspicion both within and outside the Church. It has been accused of promoting a right-wing political agenda and of cultlike practices, aggressive recruiting, brainwashing new recruits, and isolating members from their families. Its notoriety escalated with the publication of the runaway bestseller The Da Vinci Code (Opus Dei plays an important and sinister role in the novel) and with the previous pope s much-debated canonization of its founder (often linked with Francisco Franco s facist regime) and the discovery that convicted FBI spy Robert Hanson was a member of Opus Dei. With the expert eye of a longtime trusted observer of the Vatican and the skill of an investigative reporter intent on uncovering closely guarded secrets, John Allen finally separates the myths from the facts in Opus Dei. Granted unlimited access to the prelate who heads the organization and to Opus Dei centers throughout the world, Allen draws on a wealth of interviews with current members, as well as with highly critical ex-members, to create an unprecedented portrait of the activities, practices, and intentions behind its veil of secrecy. Allen reveals the remarkable power that Opus Dei commands in shaping Vatican policy and presents a detailed look at the full extent of its network, which includes people in key positions in politics, banking, academia, and other influential arenas. He even describes the arcane rituals including self-flagellation performed to preserve and promote a spiritual tradition strange and unsettling to modern sensibilities. For years, Opus Dei has been the subject of conspiracy theories and dark, uninformed speculation. Opus Dei sets the record straight.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a-vGpdlGed0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Visitor from the sea","description":"A heavy storm brings a strange dog to the Maine island where a little girl lives with her family.

The university's response was to develop a course offering challenging material -- readings requiring serious attention -- along with a method of reading and rereading that helped students learn to read and think critically and respond in writing. That course proved enormously successful, and its materials and methods were published as Ways of Reading. Often imitated -- but never duplicated -- Ways of Reading has for over twenty years profoundly influenced the teaching of writing. It continues to offer students and instructors a uniquely exciting and challenging approach to first-year composition, integrating reading, writing, and critical thinking with an unparalleled selection of readings and editorial features. Ways of Reading helps students develop the necessary intellectual skills for college-level academic work while engaging them in conversations with key academic and cultural texts. It bridges the gap between contemporary critical theory and composition so that instructors can connect their own scholarly work with their teaching. Adopted and readopted from coast to coast in a wide variety of schools, hundreds of instructors and thousands of students confirm that it works.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dDDMwAEACAAJ&dq=Ways+of+Reading:+An+Anthology+for+Writers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal)","description":"A shake of the dark head, a shudder in the shoulders. Another tiny splash on the linoleum floor. Husband murdered, and now her daughter too. The Inuit, it is said, have forty different words for snow. Never mind about snow, Cardinal mused, what people really need is forty words for sorrow. Grief. Heartbreak. Desolation. There were not enough, not for this childless mother in her empty house. [Forty Words for Sorrow, page 42] The mutilated body of a young girl has been discovered in an abandoned mine shaft on the desolate Lake Nipissing island of Windigo. Missing since September, Katie Pine has finally been found, encased in a block of ice as if preserved in amber. The intense police investigation when she first disappeared had gone nowhere, and Detective John Cardinal went from solving murders to investigating burglaries and petty crimes. But now all bets are off. Cardinal is back on the case; this time with a new partner. Lise Delorme, a sexy and passionate former internal investigator, makes Cardinal uneasy. With a guilty conscience to fuel his suspicion, Cardinal wonders if Delorme isn t there to investigate him. And his suspicions are well founded. Delmore has made a deal with the devil: in order to leave SIU for good, she must gain Cardinal s trust and then betray it. There are allegations of corruption on the force, and Cardinal s  extracurricular  activities during a counterfeiting investigation are being called into question. Delorme is convinced that Cardinal is innocent of any wrongdoing and even when her investigation calls his integrity into question, she is reluctant to believe it. When Cardinal makes the gruesome discovery of the bodies of two more missing teenagers, he doesn t spend time worrying about his suspicions concerning Delorme. His focus is on a more sinister concerna serial killer hiding somewhere in this quiet northern town. That concern becomes laced with urgency when Karen Steen, a young woman from Guelph, arrives to speak to Cardinal about her missing boyfriend, Keith London. Cardinal begins to believe that Keith is the fourth young person to disappear in Algonquin Bay. But unlike the other victims, he believes that Keith may still be alive. The question now becomes, what is the connection between the three dead and one missing teenager?

At a place called Adobe Walls they dug blocks from the sod and built their center of operations After operating for only a few months, the post was attacked one sultry June morning by angry members of several Plains Indian tribes, whose physical and cultural survival depending on the great bison herd that were rapidly shrinking before the white men s guns. Initially defeated, that attacking Indians retreated. But the defenders also retreated leaving the deserted post to be burned by Indians intent on erasing all traces of the white man s presence. Nonetheless, tracing did remain, and in the ashes and dirt were buried minute details of the hide men s lives and the battle that so suddenly changed them. A little more than a century later white men again dug into the sod at Adobe Walls. The nineteenth-century men dug for profits, but the modern hunters sere looking for the natural time capsule inadvertently left by those earlier adventurers. The authors of this book, a historian and an archeologists, have dug into the sod and into far-flung archives to sift reality form the long-romanticized story of Adobe Walls, its residents, and the Indians who so fiercely resented their presence.

Here is a land of eternally snow-capped mountains and sweeping valleys. A land as eerie and forbidding as the landscape of some distant moon, its people all but forgotten by the rest of the world. Their lives are a struggle -- the alpine soil metes out sustenance grudgingly, and long winters threaten to banish the warmth of life forever. Yet these lives yield untold riches. As if the splendid isolation and sheer altitude of the hidden Himalayas bring them closer to the gods, the people of this land are possessed of a spirituality few Westerners will ever know. Kelly's extraordinary photographs are accompanied by Dunham's evocative and lyrical account of life as the people of Humla conceive it: a cycle of fall, winter, spring, and summer. In a world made easy, accessible, and all too familiar by supersonic travel, television, and communication at the click of a mouse, here is an enlightening glimpse into the lives of a virtually untouched people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0KBkPgAACAAJ&dq=The+Hidden+Himalayas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Only by the Grace of God: The Story of Sharon Dixon","description":"This story will both enlighten you and make you stand in even greater awe of a mighty God.

After the fall of Napoleon, European diplomats gathered in a festive Vienna with the task of restoring stability following the French Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. The central figures at the Congress of Vienna were the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, Viscount Castlereagh and the Foreign Minister of Austria Klemens Wenzel von Mettern Metternich. Castlereagh was primarily concerned with maintaining balanced powers, while Metternich based his diplomacy on the idea of legitimacy that is, establishing and working with governments that citizens accept without force. The peace they brokered lasted until the outbreak of World War I. Through trenchant analysis of the history and forces that create stability, A World Restored gives insight into how to create long-lasting geopolitical peace-lessons that Kissinger saw as applicable to the period immediately following World War II, when he was writing this book. But the lessons don t stop there. Like all good insights, the book s wisdom transcends any single political period. Kissinger s understanding of coalitions and balance of power can be applied to personal and professional situations, such as dealing with a tyrannical boss or co-worker or formulating business or organizational tactics. Regardless of his ideology, Henry Kissinger has had an important impact on modern politics and few would dispute his brilliance as a strategist. For anyone interested in Western history, the tactics of diplomacy, or political strategy, this volume will provide deep understanding of a pivotal time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FRokDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chloroform: The Quest for Oblivion","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Piper's Handbook","description":"Music Sales America","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qjJgAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Piper%27s+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hamden (CT) (Images of America)","description":"Sail into New Haven Harbor and trek toward the beautiful form of the Sleeping Giant to discover Hamden, a picturesque gem nestled in the rolling hills of Connecticut.

I could make Victorian crochet doilies, knitted mittens, scarfs, some articles of clothing called fascinators, and even socks and knickerbockers, but what about rugs? It is only later that I found out that according to the Victorians rug making was not considered to be a genteel occupation, which could be indulged in by the daughters and wives of gentlemen. These languishing ladies would sit in front of the embroidery frame, plying a needle, while dining of strawberries and cream, no doubt, while rug making was done by people of lower social strata. Nevertheless, we are fortunate that we have stopped thinking of such idiotic considerations in order to make rugs. So this book is going to tell you all about the art of rug making, and you are going to let your creativity loose in making these amazingly beautiful items for your home.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tKGRCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Synopsis of American History","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Codgerspace","description":"When every machine ceases to function and begins to search for non-human species of higher intelligence, an alien threat to humans and machines threatens the universe.

In this book, David Delaney explores the historical intersections of race, place, and the law. Drawing on court cases spanning more than a century, he examines the moves and countermoves of attorneys and judges who participated in the geopolitics of slavery and emancipation; in the development of Jim Crow segregation, which effectively created apartheid laws in many cities; and in debates over the \\"doctrine of changed conditions,\\" which challenged the legality of restrictive covenants and private contracts designed to exclude people of color from white neighborhoods. This historical investigation yields new insights into the patterns of segregation that persist in American society today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=meWGAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Friend Jesus","description":"Presents a retelling of the Gospel, emphasizing how Jesus can be a friend and Savior.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v-fWAgAAQBAJ&dq=My+Friend+Jesus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss","description":"\\"The experience of loss does not have to be the defining moment of our lives\\", writes Gerald Sittser. \\"Instead, the defining moment can be our response to the loss.

At stake is control of the world's fastest-growing industry: communications. The contestants are Hollywood studios, television networks, and cable, telephone, computer, publishing, and consumer-electronics companies. All are vying to collect a toll on the information superhighway. And as they jockey for control, they tread on volatile ground, as one fixation after another (cable, interactive TV) is dumped in favor of the next (satellite, the Internet). There is no better account of this turmoil than the one provided here by Ken Auletta, bestselling author of Three Blind Mice (\\"the best book ever written on network television\\"*) and Greed and Glory on Wall Street, who for five years has brilliantly tracked the communications industry for The New Yorker. Auletta's access to the principal players is unparalleled (six days with Rupert Murdoch, summit meetings with John Malone), and his grasp of the issues--from boardroom politics to regulatory and technological pressures--is unmatched by any other journalist. In this riveting collection of his best pieces Auletta takes the reader on a behind-the-scenes tour of such companies as Disney, Viacom, Microsoft, Time Warner, and Telecommunications, Inc., and keenly chronicles the vanities and visions of the new Highwaymen--Rupert Murdoch, Ted Turner, Michael Eisner, Sumner Redstone, Bill Gates, and more. Just as Three Blind Mice was heralded as \\"the new bible of the broadcasting business,\\" The Highwaymen will be received as an indispensable guide to the future of this explosive new world. * Frank Stanton, former president of CBS","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mqwdwyYa3hEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kurt Hahn's Schools and Legacy","description":"The impact that one of this century's most creative educators had on nearly 4 million girls and boys is chronicled here. For over 75 years up to this present day, Hahn's schools have enrolled students world-wide including such notables as England's Prince Charles and Prince Philip. Though it is his famous Outward Bound program that has received such international recognition, Hahn's tenets of teaching formulated so many years ago still are proving valid today. Surviving in the wilderness and surviving in a complex society requires similar basic character traits. The author, himself a Hahn's school alumnus, presents the life of his subject in an intriguing manner. The book will hopefully shed more light on a man about whom even many of his current students know so little. And Mr. Flavin can be even more illuminating via a telephone interview. His observations are insightful, witty and poignant in recalling the life of Kurt Hahn.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y5LcPQAACAAJ&dq=Kurt+Hahn%27s+Schools+and+Legacy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating","description":"The author of The Pentagon's New Map presents methods by which the world can achieve the promising future described in his previous book, outlining short-term pathways for governments, institutions, and individuals while placing a focus on the particular challenges of specific international hotspots.
