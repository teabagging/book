Carrie goes to the city from the country and proceeds to work her way up in life. Hurstwood begins in a good position yet makes a tragic choice to end up down in life. The strongest survive in the city, and Dreiser's characters are all trying to survive.

Much like Dubus' House of Sand and Fog, we find a story in which the dilemma(s) are wholly interesting, but the characters are impossible to sympathize with, Carrie especially. Okay, I'll admit, I had a pang of feeling for Hurstwood toward the end, but even he is too much of a horse's ass to take seriously. Every character's favorite phrase is \\"I don't know,\\" and it is true. None of them have any clue. It's all about surfaces/appearances. This is what the characters live for. They are all shallow and pathetic...and somehow, Dreiser still manages to deliver a good read---you know what they say about a train wreck... The fact of the matter is, the characters have no substance; they care too much about getting ahead to think about consequences. I once read that this novel was a favorite of F. Scott Fitzgerald (my all time favorite author). AFter having finished it, and comparing it to some of Fitzgerald's own shallow, self-absorbed characters, I can see why.This is a book that you will love to hate, at least as far as the main \\"players\\" are concerned.

I think the main theme of this book is greed. The characters will do anything for money even jeopardize their relationships. The main character, Carrie, even leaves her family to go find money. She moves to Chicago to find work, which will end up being wealth for her. During this time large cities such as Chicago were places of great economic growth. They were full of factories. A fair amount of unwed women were working in these dirty factories to make around $6 a week. This money was just enough for food, rent, and maybe some odds and end stuff but definitely not enough for a young woman to be happy.During this time, and like today, people are judged by how much money they have. People will stare and know if you are of a lower class than them or of a higher and then they envy you. Your clothes play a big role in distinguishing between the different classes of wealth. Carrie hated her life as being in the poor class and wanted bigger and better things for herself and she knew the only way for that was with money.She gets in with two guys and we know she is just in it for the money. They are using her for her body and she is using them for their money. Both are forms of prostitution. They take care of the bills and by that then they own her and can do whatever they want. She is always acting. She is never a \\"genuine\\" character. She knows what kind of woman these high risers like and that's what she portrays herself as.Her acting continues throughout her life and never ends. She is used for her beauty and never for anything else. I think we as the readers know more about her life and what she is doing to it rather than she does. Even at the end of the story she doesn't know what her life means. She is lonely and doesn't understand why.This book is good but can drag on at times. The middle is a little dreary but perks up at the end. I enjoyed reading it especially with it being a historical fiction. Dreiser does a great job showing what life was really like at the turn of the century. The great moral of the story to me is that wanting is fine but if it interferes with the rest of your life is not worth wanting."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Sister Carrie is a lovely book. It tells a rather profound story--placed specifically in its time, which was of course the 'Modern Day' for the time it was written. As a result a book that was once a critical document of patterns of behavior of some of the author's contemporaries has become, for better or worse, an important historical chronical of the dangers of selfishness and uninhibited personal ambition. Oh, the story is no longer anything unfamiliar, but the grounding and the character studies make this book very affecting and, true to the ideals of its unfortunate literary designation of 'Naturalism' (a meaningless term which limits instead of explains a readers' expectation, much in the way that science-fiction or horror classify something as not necessisarily what it in fact is), this is a very believable and realistic story.The writing itself, as other readers and critics throughout the past one hundred years or so have repeated when attempting to find fault with Sister Carrie, isn't the most impressive thing about the book. However, in its defense, the cut and dry, occasionally pasted on moments of philosophical conversation and the rugged and perhaps at times inconsistant speech patterns of the various characters somehow, for me, created an even more believable picture, zoning in on those people who attempt to speak both above and beneath their social class and educational backgrounds for either personal gain or in a futile effort to 'fit in'.A wonderful book, because of its flaws, in fact, that reads like a quick-paced and absorbing tale always on the verge of tragedy. That tension, that what-will-happen-next feeling pervades throughout the book and concludes by providing quite an impact indeed."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"After reading a few Edith Wharton novels and becoming interested in late Victorian literature, I found Sister Carrie and decided to buy it based on the reviews here - I'm so glad I did.This is a truly fascinating story of the decline of one person and the ascent of another. I guess the fact that after 100+ years it is still so riveting is the reason it's a classic. This is by far the best book I've read recently.I guess if I were to offer one complaint, it would be the amount of theorizing and postulating that Dreiser does concerning human nature - it bogs the story down a bit at times, but this is a minor annoyance for me. It's one of the few books that I know I'll read again.

I ordered it when I thought I was ordering another and it was delivered to my door. Since it was recommended for a creative writing class, I figured I might as well read it since I love a long, epic novel. Little did I know what I was getting into.Carrie reads abruptly Brittish at first, with all the proper nouns and pronouns making it seem, straight away, like a snobbish and bourgoise book. Once I got past the first few pages, however, I was at once intrigued and secretly invited to hear, not read, the tale of an original fem fatale.As I read, I could actually hear the dialog and ambience of the era, horse-drawn carriages, the buzz of a cafes, restaurants and lodges. And, of course, the rather brutish brother-in-law whom Carrie encounters as an adversary when she moves to Chicago in the late 1800's.The novel was the first for author, Theodore Dreiser, who later went on the write, \\"An American Tragedy\\", in 1925 a novel that brought universal acclaim.\\"Carrie\\" reads with the striking atmosphere of a completely different set of rules and behavior standards and though, the language is a little outdated, it still tells the story of a young woman's plight of constant rejection during a time of very strict ideals set on single and married women. Her's is a fairy tale of seeming immediate acceptance with dreadful undertones of ownership and emotional abuse.I'm incredibly challenged with the style and verbose writing of Mr. Dreiser and confident that a movie is sure to be in the works. A great read!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"When I finished reading Theodore Dreiser's 1900 novel, \\"Sister Carrie,\\" I wrote in the margin, \\"We live in a depressing fiasco of a country.\\" This is to detract nothing from Dreiser's novel - it's just that the problems Dreiser outlines in \\"Sister Carrie\\" are problems, material and epistemological, that remain with us, unabated, over a century later. If contemporary novels like Wharton's \\"The Age of Innocence,\\" Woolf's \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" and Butler's \\"The Way of All Flesh\\" signal the end of the Victorian era, Dreiser's \\"Sister Carrie\\" certainly foreshadows the preoccupations of the 20th century. Dreiser's narrator has a detachment and yet a cynicism which inflects the story of a young girl from rural Wisconsin trying to find happiness in Chicago and New York.\\"Sister Carrie\\" begins as the eponymous heroine, Caroline Meeber, hurtles forth on a train from Waukesha, Wisconsin, to her sister in Chicago. Ostensibly, she is going to find a menial job and support herself under the protection of her sister and her sister's husband. On the train, she meets a young salesman, Charles Drouet, who is captivated by her. Arriving in the growing metropolis, Carrie has a world of difficulty adjusting to the drudgery of working and living with her joyless relatives. As the novel gets underway, with industry too consumptive of her individuality and her ideals, Carrie is swept off by Drouet, becoming his mistress, and leaving her sister. Through her association with Drouet, and subsequently, his friend, the respected resort manager, George Hurstwood, Carrie struggless to negotiate her ambitions and desires in the context of these two promising, but unfulfilling relationships.One thing permanently at the forefront of Dreiser's novel is money - how one gets it, who has it, what they do with it, and all the complications and frustrations that come from having too much or barely enough to survive. Dreiser opens up to us a world of widely varied economic circumstances, from the utterly abject homeless, to the 'scab' day-laborers during a public transit strike, to factory-girls, to resort managers, business owners, and seemingly everything in between. He also underscores the perceptible, and growing, disparity between subsistence and success, between respectability and celebrity. The differences that Carrie and Hurstwood, in their adventures together in Montreal and New York, perceive between getting by and really living, are some of the most excruciatingly rendered and pathos-riddled passages in the novel.The understated sexual relationships in the novel, and Carrie's status through most of the novel as a kept-woman/mistress, first to Drouet, then to Hurstwood, was of course shocking to the novel's first readers. However, as there is nothing explicit in the novel, we must read beneath the surface, seeing the novel's relationships, as both the narrator and Carrie see them - as means to an end, to fiscal comfort and social respectability. Also in these relationships, we can gauge the dynamics of gender relations in the first years of the 20th century - the narrator's insistence throughout the novel on \\"how women are\\" or references to individual characters as \\"types\\" of universal categories. Through all of this, we come to suspect the narrator, and must learn to judge Carrie and her escapades with those she encounters (Mrs. Vance, Lola Osborne, Robert Ames) on how Carrie herself might view them.Despite the wholeheartedly depressing tone of the novel as a whole, I think one positive, though qualified, means of redemption Dreiser leaves us with is the possibly transformative effects of journalistic and artistic production. Reading is something the characters in the novel do a lot of, and here too, there is a distinction drawn between what we can get from the written word. Dreiser seems to imply throughout the novel that through the word, written and performative, some greater relationship can be established between people - that something truly apocalyptic can be brought about by reading the right books or seeing the right plays. This is one of Dreiser's great achievements as far as I am concerned - \\"Sister Carrie,\\" if we can read beyond the devastating hopelessness of it all, is a work that desperately wants us to connect with those around us, especially since Dreiser's own characters seem fundamentally unable to do so."},{"Title":"Frank Lloyd Wright's Seth Peterson Cottage: Rescuing a Lost Masterwork","review":"the book is just great!!!

Rather, he rejects their extravagant claims to have successfully explained \\"The Way the Mind Works,\\" to quote the title of a recent book by Steve Pinker, who is one of the leading evangelists for cognitive psychology and evolutionary psych.Fodor's central complaint against evolutionary psychology is quite simple. Anyone who claims to offer an evolutionary explanation for the wings of birds can start with a great deal of solid knowledge about how bird's wings are in fact constructed, about how wings make flight possible given the laws of aerodynamics, etc.But no one in fact yet possesses the equivalent information for the brain and the mind.We do not yet know how the neurons are connected and in what manner they function so as to produce thought. More basically, we do not understand what \\"mind\\" really is from the viewpoint of the underlying physics of the brain (see, e.g., David Chalmers' \\"The Conscious Mind\\" or Colin McGinn's \\"The Mysterious Flame\\").Fodor also has more specific objections. He is highly concerned with the issue of \\"abduction,\\" the ability to make global judgments of simplicity, relevance, etc. over a broad intellectual domain. Fodor believes that humans are very good at this, but that the current \\"modular\\" approach pursued by cognitive scientists and evolutionary psychologists cannot explain how humans could be good at this.I'm not sure human judgment is as powerful as Fodor believes, but he is correct that modular systems have difficulty making broad global judgments.In his final chapter, Fodor directly addresses the issue of evolution, arguing that, for a feature to be the product of natural selection, it must be built up by a small number of steps. Using the example of the giraffe's neck, he argues, \\"Make the giraffe's neck just a little longer and you correspondingly increase, by just a little, the animal's ability to reach the fruit at the top of the tree; so it's plausible, to that extent, that selction stretched giraffe's necks bit by bit.\\"This example is somewhat misleading: there is no reason in principle why a single mutation could not have created huge giraffe necks in one fell swoop and natural selection then stepped in to preserve the mutation.But Fodor is correct that such a \\"saltationist\\" explanation is not available to evolutionary psychology. The plethora of specialized mental modules favored by evolutionary psychologists (a language module, a \\"cheater detection module,\\" a face-recognition module, a theory-of-mind module, to name only a few) are supposed to be carefully honed adaptations exquisitely polished by natural selection to serve human needs in the \\"ancestral environment\\" (the Paleolithic). Just as a complex organ such as the eye could not realistically be created in one single fortuitous mutation, so neither could these complex mental \\"organs\\" hypothesized by evolutionary psych.But why does Fodor reject a gradual, multifaceted evolution of these hypothetical mental \\"organs\\"? He does not say, but there is a fairly powerful argument from the human genome project. We only have about 30,000 genes; most of these are shared with lower mammals and many with non-vertebrates and even non-animals. There just are not that many genes left which distinguish us from mice.A change in a relatively small number of regulatory genes can bring dramatic changes in development -- our much larger brain, for example. But to actually create a number of new specialized \\"organs,\\" not possessed by mice or cows places much greater demands on the genome. It's doubtful we have enough genes to handle it.The evolutionary psych response, as made in Pinker's \\"The Blank Slate,\\" to this argument is in essence that since these mental modules _do_ exist, our genes _must_ be able to produce the modules. That of course assumes what is to be proven, i.e., that the human mind is based on evolutionarily-derived specialized mental modules.Fodor completely demolishes the claim that the unity of science demands that evolutionary psychology be true. The degree to which the science of evolution is relevant to the science of psychology is, he rightly argues, an empirical matter, just as (to use his example) it is an empirical matter whether \\"the theory of lunar geography constrains the theory of cellular mitosis.\\" Not every science has to be relevant to every other science.Fodor also shreds what he calls \\"neo-Darwinist anti-intellectualism,\\" the view (he is quoting from Patricia Churchland) that \\"looked at from an evolutionary point of view, the principal function of nervous systems is to get the body parts where they should be in order that the organism may survive...Truth, whatever that is, definitely takes the hindmost.\\"Fodor counters that for humans \\"a cognitive system that is specialized for the fixation of true beliefs interacts with a conative system that is specialized to figure out how to get what one wants from the world that the beliefs are true of...\\" or, in simple English, humans engage in \\"rational actions predicated on true beliefs.\\"We are designed to pursue both truth and our own well-being -- there is no contradiction here. Not action instead of truth, but action based on truth.Despite the brief length and Fodor's engaging style, this book is not easy reading. But it does raise questions which, if not adequately answered by Fodor's opponents, cast grave doubts on the grandiose claims of contemporary apostles of cognitive science and evolutionary psychology."},{"Title":"The Mind Doesn't Work That Way: The Scope and Limits of Computational Psychology","review":"Fodor is one of our greatest living philosophers. He has laid out groundbreaking theories on the philosophy of mind and language. This book is a bit of a departure, in that he is less interested in theory-building than in theory-destruction. You might think that the result would be rather dreary -- who wants to hear someone harping on other people's mistakes all of the time? -- but in fact the book is very engaging.Fodor argues that while &quot;computational&quot; models of the mind (roughly, theories that the mind is just a computer) may be able to explain how the mind's modules work, they fail to explain how the mind's central processor works. (If the theory of modules and central processors is unfamiliar to you, then you MUST first read Fodor's excellent book &quot;The Modularity of Mind&quot; in order to understand &quot;The Mind Doesn't Work That Way.&quot;) The primary problem, as Fodor sees it, is that central processors are general-problem solvers (or, more accurately, general-interest learners). They work with large databases of beliefs and are bombarded by immense amounts of information. If the mind were like a computer, it would experience the problem of &quot;combinatorial explosion&quot; as it tried to analyze all of this information, that problem being that with so many sentences in the language of thought, there would be far too many calculations to perform over these sentences in anything like a reasonable amount of time. Put another way, if you think your computer is slow loading Windows 2000, just wait until it had to load and analyze the entire database of a person's beliefs AND chew gum at the same time.Although the problem of combinatorial explosion is the driving problem in the book, Fodor addresses many other interesting topics in his typically witty and insightful way. He gives glancing blows to connectionism, Darwinian approaches to psychology, the theory of heuristics, and more.As always, Fodor presents many forceful and ingenious arguments, and even when I disagree with him (as I often do), I always walk away from his books understanding difficult issues more clearly and having a profound respect for his penetrating intellect.This book is not a good introduction to Fodor's work or to philosophy of mind, but for those with some grasp of both, I highly recommend &quot;The Mind Doesn't Work That Way.&quot; If only he had come up with a better title...."},{"Title":"The Mind Doesn't Work That Way: The Scope and Limits of Computational Psychology","review":"Putting its concision (~100 pages) and extremely attractive presentation to one side, *The Mind Doesn't Work That Way* is actually Jerry Fodor's most ambitious effort to date and (grant protectors aside) the reigning champ of cogsci critiques.

Asking how we learn, remember, know, and use information is akin to asking what it means to be human, what it means to be conscious. Unfortunately, the language used in this book hides the elegance of the arguments cognitive scientists have thus far put forth. Generally, I found Fodor's language to be unnecessarily flowery and complex. As an example, after reading 20 pages of chapter 1 and part of chapter 2, I found that the author used an average of 1.4 Latin phrases per page - many of them fairly esoteric. In my opinion, this excessively complex writing style occludes the important points of the text, rendering them much less powerful. I would refer readers to articles in &quot;A Companion to Cognitive Science,&quot; to writings by Keith Holyoak and Arthur Markman, and to Douglas Hofstadter and Melanie Mitchell's work for much more compelling and elegant versions of the arguments presented in &quot;The Mind Doesn't Work That Way.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Mind Doesn't Work That Way: The Scope and Limits of Computational Psychology","review":"Cognitive science is a failure.

You might wonder why a philosopher whose interest is in symbolic logic and grammar is writing a book about psychologists who use a very loose analogy about the mind being like computer software. After reading this book, so am iSo why is Pinker and everyone else in cognitive science wrong? Fodor's argument in a nutshell - because computer subroutines can't access information outside of the subroutine. To use Fodor's example (of which he has *very* few), you want to go to Chicago. It's not windy. Is that good? If you're sailing a boat, yes, otherwise no. A computer can't figure that out because it lacks context - it needs to know how you're traveling before judging the meaning of wind conditions. And computers, Fodor argues, can't do that. Since computers have subroutines and subroutines have no access to relevant data, computers can't solve simple problems and so the mind can't be like a computer. Take that Pinker! Makes sense? Of course notFodor approaches the topic of psychology and computers from a logician's standpoint, which is to say he makes some really bad, sweeping assumptions then uses really high level logic to prove that reality doesn't exist. For Fodor, it's just 5 steps - 1.A mental representation must have a syntax, 2.If you change the sytax the &quot;Turing machine&quot; can no longer function, 3.Therefore syntax can't vary by context, 4.Therefore mental processes can't be affected by context 5.But they are so the mind isn't a computer and cognitive science is wrong. (He later adds Principle M(CTM) which says sunroutines can access external data but an exhaustive search/tablescan of all memory would be needed and that would be stupid so cognitive science is stupid)The book is a one trick pony. Computers supposedly can't solve the simple problems he describes (logical abduction), they are required to solve them based on the way he chose to define his terms and therefore the field and its theories are irretrievably broken.

The author always gives us an idiomatic translation and then usually offers us something said to be \\"literal.\\" These second translations are also often quite idiomatic and therefore unhelpful.If only a single definition is provided, I personally tend to prefer a rather literal one as they are often charming and memorable (to my Anglophone ear) and the figurative meaning is usually not difficult to grasp. But if two definitions are to be given, certainly the first one should be figurative, as the author has done here. The second one, however, should be highly literal to preserve the charm and allow the learner to understand all the words and experience fully the richness of the expression.I opened the book at random to test my notion here and came upon: \\"Il faut vous faire soigner,\\" with the first definiton \\"better see a shrink.\\" Then we are offered a supposedly literal translation \\"you need to have your head examined.\\" Problem is that \\"head\\" is strictly implied and so, is not part of the literal expression.

Since then I've been primarily driving \`commutemobiles,' but have recently returned to an economic situation which allowed me to also include a sport scar for dedicated recreational pursuits. After much consideration, evaluation and comparison of the initial purchase price, performance, esthetics, maintenance, reliability, parts availability, modification potential and cost for a number of potential cars, I finally decided on, and obtained a 1993 Toyota MR2 Turbo. Other cars considered included the Honda S2000, Mitsubishi Eclipse GSX, Nissan 300ZX Twin Turbo, BMW Z4, and the MR2 Mk III Spyder.I've recently obtained the two Brooklands books, \\"Toyota MR2 Takes on the Competition,\\" and \\"Toyota MR2 Gold Portfolio.\\" Both books are excellent additions to any MR2 enthusiast's library but, in particular, I really like the latter. The former focuses more on comparisons of the MR2 MkI normally aspirated and Supercharged, and the MR2 MkII normally aspirated models to competing models. The latter has more on the design considerations and characteristics of the turbocharged models. While I'm now happy to have both books in my collection, \\"Toyota MR2 Gold Portfolio\\" is my favorite and may have sped up my decision to purchase my '93 MR2 Turbo.Toyota MR2 1984-97 Gold PortfolioToyota MR2: Takes on the Competition (Takes on the Competition S.)"},{"Title":"Toyota MR2: Takes on the Competition","review":"The book has nothing on the 2000 to 2005.

You don't need to read any of these in their entirety to figure out why they suck. Bad prose is just bad prose, although sci-fi readers arn't always the most picky about that sort of thing. So bad that after waiting 20 years to find out what might happen next after Chapterhouse, I find that I'm willing to wait the rest of my life rather read more drek by these guys. There are other terrible flaws with the prequel series, but these are hardly worth getting into. But as someone with an interest in cognitive science and real AI, I just can't resist a jab at how utterly pathetic an attempt this all is to imagine an AI civilization."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I found this edition of the Herbert/Anderson cash machine to be more entertaining than the last episode (which was just plain bad). I enjoyed reading it for what it was: a space romp with backgrounds borrowed from Frank Herbert's Dune. These books are a bit like watching television. It's enjoyable while you're watching, but it sure is a waste of time.Although I won't buy these books, I'll continue to borrow them from the library just to get a glimpse of more background to the real Dune series. I agree with another reviewer who stated that if these books didn't carry the Dune name, they would never sell."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I started reading The Machine Crusade a few weeks after I finished reading The Butlerian Jihad, which is the best novel I've read in almost 20 years. And I must say I was quite disappointed. For starters, the first 200 pages of The Machine Crusade are a complete and total waist of time as the authors spend all of their time polemicising The Butlerian Jihad. The next 400 pages don't go much better. The story-telling is long, slow, and drawn out. The Machine Crusade doesn't get interesting until around page 600 (the novel is 700 pages). So, it's not a total train wreck as the last 100 pages were actually pretty good. Overall though, I'd grade this novel a \\"D,\\" and point to the heading of this review. The authors could've EASILY omitted the first 600 pages and divided the remaining 100 pages between the two novels The Butlerian Jihad and The Battle of Corrin. But there are books to be sold and publishing houses to keep fat, so they turned two Dune novels into a trilogy, making hard core Dune fans like myself shell out an additional $30.00 just to read a book that should never have been written."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Bad science. If FTL travel is not yet invented (Butlerian Jihad and the beginning of Machine Crusade), then how can the story be happening in real time? Some basic science is ignored by the authors. A lost opportunity to shape the story line and makes for dissapointment that anything meaningful in terms of storytelling is going to develop. Instead, it becomes a series of bylines built upon the outstanding Dune foundation rather than a story in its own right. A far cry from the examiniation of a consistent universe such as Alastair Reynolds outstanding treatment of the realities of sub-light travel, or Larry Niven's Mote series. This makes for a fairly weak book that's short on solid plotline development and long on writing short background pieces attempting to fill in the hints provided by the father in the far superior original series. As someone else said, wait for the paperback if you have to hear someone else fill in the gaps for you. My suggestion is that your own imagination can do a better job."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Lousy, really dissappointing. There is lot of promise in a story which pits man against all-conquering machines, but this team did not develop the potentialities in such a theme. Very bad science, very inadequate imagination of the full developmental potential of a machine-based culture and its powers/potentials. Reads like a word-processor wrote this novel. A machine could do better. Clearly a franchise product, a cookie-cutter product mass-manufactured for an established market (i.e. anything with the trademark DUNE in its title)."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"As the war between humans and thinking machines grinds on, both sides threaten to splinter under the weight of conflicting agendas. Meanwhile, on Arrakis, the outlaws who will one day be known as the Fremen begin to gather strength as the spice m&eacute;lange grows in popularity throughout the human worlds.This is a sprawling, messy novel that could easily have been shortened by more than a hundred pages by editing out the repetition, excessive narrative about minor characters, and many meandering paragraphs of extraneous exposition. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this novel because, despite their flaws, Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson hooked me with their characters and the enormous sweep of their story. A television series could get a whole season's worth of episodes out of the plot threads and twists of fate here.Frank Herbert purists are not likely to find much to admire. Herbert, Jr. and Anderson are definitely more interested in outer space than inner space. The sections in which they try to emulate the elder Herbert's philosophizing, most notably those involving the developing Fremen, contrast most starkly and unfavorably with the original vision. I read and admired the original six books many years ago; when I decided to reread them, I thought I would do so within the context of this expanded series. I was jarred by \\"The Butlerian Jihad,\\" but once I decided to just let Herbert and Anderson do what they want to do, I found much to enjoy in their work as well."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I loved the Dune series and unlike some have thoroughly enjoyed most of the subsequent prequels. No, they do not have the magic and the depth and the awe of the original but then I did not think I was going to get the exact message.This book is not as bad as some have made out but it is nowhere near a 5 star category. If the story of Norma had taken more center stage I would have considered a 4 or even 5 star. But it was lost in the onslaught of the seemingly endless tales, and unlike the original series, these folks are not interesting enough to maintain your attention over the long haul. The book seems to continually be in a rush - the chapters have been reduced to chapterettes and despite the excessive length, a lot of what is said was not necessary in the first place.I, for one, am sickened and tired of all the torture. I have got into the habit of skipping those parts but had to reread the section on Norma in order to understand her transformation. Some of the characters were better left unintroduced - the good fighter (is he supposed to be the prototype for Duncan Idaho?), the brother-in-law of Serena, assorted friends and wives and lovers - too busy.

In this book, supposedly we see the theoretical work leading to \\"folding space\\" take its first steps toward practical application. Yet in this pre-hyperspace setting, everyone seems to be able to zip around the galaxy at will, travelling effortlessly between planents and star systems apparently instantaneously. No explanation for this is ever given, which is the type of glaring plot hole that Frank Herbert would never have allowed. Isn't this supposed to be SCIENCE fiction?Pages and page are devoted to meaningless descriptions of trivial details (such as parties), there is no dialogue to speak of, and the character relationships are murky and hard to follow.The DUNE series was much better when it was simply the 6 original books by Frank Herbert, with the tantalizing and never to be fulfilled hints at the final, seventh novel.Each new addition weakens the original Dune achievement."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I'm a big fan of Dune and the other Dune Prequels.

I only recommend this book to die hard Dune fans who won't be able to sleep at night knowing they've missed part of the ancient timeline. Even in that case, you could just, read the timeline in the appendix. This book repeats obvious information, over and over again.

My husband and I both found the storyline lacking and the continuity of this book with the rest of the series is terrible. They put a story together that goes against much of the later series. What were you guys thinking? I won't give away too much of the story but they are terribly lacking and off base in the Norma Cenva story which was originally begun in the God Emperor of Dune book and Harkonnen's story also deviates from the original plot.

While I am not certain that I would not rather to have simply read Frank Herbert's notes, as a great fan of Dune and its sequels, I relish the opportunity to answer questions on the formation of this intricate universe and its complex society. The Dune culture always left a series of questions in its wake, not the least of which being the story of its origins. How did space folding, the Guild, the Sisterhood, and all of the other complex institutions come into existence? How did there arise a high technology but basically feudal human society? What were the \\"thinking machines?\\" What happened to earth?Unfortunately, only diehard fans will be even more than faintly interested in the answers to these questions. Others will find this novel and its predecessor dry, with flat characters, and amateurish stilted story telling. Where Frank Herbert created compelling portraits of Great men and women, his son's work offers little more than sketches. A few exceptions exist. Norma, for example remains both interesting and entertaining. Other pivotal characters, however, fall flat. Vorian seems incomplete and often something out of a pulp story. Compare this central character with the powerful and rich Leto, his distant descendant who dies off at the beginning of the first Dune novel yet whose complexity haunts the series next four books and credibly remains central for over 1,000 years.Readers will continue to enjoy Frank Herbert's Dune for years to come. His grand world invites one to savor and revisit. The world his son paints, however, is worth visiting only to answer some outstanding questions. If you were not enthralled by Dune, you are better off rereading that master work and skipping this rather skimpy mere curiosity of a book."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I read the original Dune trilogy years ago and recently stumbled across this book. I hoped it would match the interest and wonder of the original, but this prequel did not come close. I will not read any more books of these two authors.Another review describes it best: bloated. The authors employ a very tired formula. As the chapters skip through the galaxy visiting each major character in his/her turn each chapter seems to repeat the same monotonous pattern: 1) revisit facts from previous visits to the character, 2) introduce one or two new details, 3) foreshadow the next visits to the character. There are a few interesting new spins in this prequel but all the tedious work to maintain this clumsy structure makes the book 4 times the size it needs to be.And after it all, I have no connection with any of the characters. Most of the characters were religiously fanatical homicidal idiots. Most of the remaining ones were religiously fanatical SUIcidal idiots. Norma was interesting at first but I couldn't quite buy into how she developed.If you are addicted to everything about Dune, then the time you invest in this will give you a few bits of Dune \\"history\\" you can enjoy. Perhaps the next book will resolve the hanging details a little more for you too.But there are SO many good books out there that are more worthy of our time.

I've read the original 6 books twice through, the house set once, and the 1st book maybe 4 times. I plan on reading these jihad books when I get the time to really attempt to enjoy and digest the material. I dont really care how painful some of you think they may be, that wont stop me. Just wanted to clarify something I remember reading about the navigators and folding space... The navigators DO NOT FOLD SPACE, the ship does... they merely see the path, they &quot;navigate&quot; as the name implies. Without this ability the ship could end up anywhere, in a star or planet for expample. Leto II finds humor in the thought of a machine that will one day replace the guilds abilities and ponders if it will ever happen, which it does, and the guild's power is reduced to the equivalence of a k-mart manager. :) What about that ending on Chapterhouse, that left me wanting more... Duncan is the best character: cat like grace, skill, loyal friend that will die for you, womanizing loud mouth drunk and ive always had a fondness for hands on fighting w/ knives/swords, something that Dune brings to the table in a futuristic setting that I enjoy."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I am a long standing fan of the Dune universe. I have read the original series three times and glean more every time I read them. I wasn't as turned off by the Houses series as most of my friends, but I realize that B. Herbert and K. Anderson were working within a familiar tapestry.In stepping back 10,000+ years into the past, they have an amazing opportunity to mark their own unknown territory and give us Dune fans a real series of surprises and new characters to love. In moving away from the Dune Encyclopedia, they have attempted to create a very exciting time in man's past (future) where all of the ingredients to what would become the known universe for the next 10,000 years came together and cooked into a massive delicious stew. Unfortunately they overcooked some of the most important ingredients and never prepared others.Whereas Frank Herbert could easily handle such scope and such a broad canvas, B. Herbert and K. Anderson seem a little overwhelmed. I hate to say it, it's not their writing style that's lacking it's the story itself. It's too neat, too convenient and too predictable.Another issue is that the machines really don't seem to be &quot;thinking machines&quot;. They seem to be poor metaphors for autocratic evil. Erasmus seems to be the only one who is &quot;alive&quot;. All of the other storylines build and peak then fade too rapidly, and often too neatly. This is almost like some sort of sci-fi soap opera.Don't get me wrong, I applaud their efforts and only wish they had taken six books to tell this story instead of three. If they only would have spent more time developing the characters, this book would have been much better. I want to be shocked at the death of a main character, not sigh in relief because their death is a timely device that fixes a plot problem. Characters appear and disappear with amazing regularity and their presence only seems to offer some out to a corner they (the authors) have written themselves into.The only other gripe I have is again related to the telling of such a monumental epic in such a limited space, history teaches us that advancements in technology and society often happen in bursts, but this is too much. The strength of Frank Herbert's vision was that is was a believable future. That human struggle is human struggle, no matter when or where. It is what binds us all and what made Dune so unique and so special. By handling this series in the abbreviated format that they did, B. Herbert and K. Anderson have had to tie too many varied elements together with one bow. The B.G. Sisterhood, the Guild, the Empire, the thinking machines, the rift between the Atreides and Harkonnens, the Ginaz School, the Suk School, the Fremen, the Creation of the Mentat School, Ix and Richese and the Thulaxu all at once, within (approx) 100 years of each other? So humans were slaves to machines for 10,000 years then BOOM... and then once the dust settles everything's great for another 10,191 years?Again, I would have liked for them to have told this story over 6 books and within a time frame of perhaps 1,000 years. That would make more since. But hey, who am I? I didn't get $1 million to write this book like these guys did."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I want to start off by saying that I enjoyed the book. However, it was not a perfect ride.Some of the plots in the book seemed to drag on and on. There were some other plots/characters that seemed to just end (Ginaz anyone? Build up this cool character for several chapters, then, splat). Perhaps the sequal to this will pick up where the others left.If you are a fan of the new Dune series, I recommend this one. It does not compare to Frank Herbert's writings - but I can't seem to get enough of Dune. I want more."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Okay, I admit...

I am happy to see that there is actually a solid plot in this one.And speaking of plots- I actually got an EMOTIONAL response during this book; whereas the only true emotion I felt during &quot;The Butlerian Jihad&quot; was that of suicidal tendencies. They should have had a coupon with that one for a mail-in t-shirt that rewarded the reader for surviving that ordeal.That said, however, you'll never understand THIS book w/out the other.

If i was not a large fan of the dune series i would probably have stopped reading the book because of this.Character development was decent, but killing off almost all major characters at end of novel was surprising none the less. Guess they didnt want these characters alive in the next novel. However having started to read the battle of corrin now, i understand why these characters were killed off.All in all it is a great book to read, look forward to finishing the last of the trilogy. Just wonder if they will try to write another trilogy in the dune universe somewhere."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Having been a huge Dune fan for most of my life, I've always tried to avoid reading the prequels and sequels that I feared were shameless moneygrabs and nothing more. However, I started reading the \\"House\\" trilogy and couldn't stop! Brian Herbert is an excellent writer and his books are riveting tales of mankind's struggle with itself and the machine. The utter brutality of the machines only slightly overshadows the atrocities comitted by Atreides, Karkonnen et all. Yes, I have seen the moaning of the \\"true\\" fans that consider anything outside the Duniverse of Frank sacriledge. However, as a lighter version of the sometimes Wagnerian grandeur of the original series the pre- and sequels hold their own.The Machine Crusade picks up where the Butlerian Jihad left off. Serena Butler has escaped the clutches of the evil Erasmus and is now the spiritual force of the Jihad. Here comes the first slight nit-pick; why does the book repeat the preceding events every 100 pages or so? It's not a TV series that needs an intro like \\"previously on The Machine Crusade\\". The events on Earth and the death of manion are repeated so often that it makes me think of an anime series like Robotech. As a matter of fact, there is a lot of similarity between epic anime series like Gundam, Robotech and Appleseed and Brian Herberts efforts. A lot of \\"true\\" fans shudder at the thought that the Dune name is brought to this. However, as an avid anime and manga fan, I don't see a problem. Just leave out the repeats for when the books are serialized.The series is lifted to a higher level when it becomes clear that mankind can be just as ignorant as the thinking machines. Comparative morality is a recurring theme in the book. Slavery is an institution on most planets, not because the slave owners are pure evil but because the slaves are seen as \\"paying a debt to society\\" for being pacifists. I detect a slight jab at the politics of Bush and cronies who would gladly have reinstated slavery if it would have stopped terrorism. As a matter of fact, Arakis seems set to undergo the same fate as Iraq. If Frank Herbert were Nostradamus, Dune would be seen as a prophesy. Anyway, the absense of pure good and bad makes the whole series the best I've read in a very long time. The manipulations of Iblis and his Jipol are delightful as is the two faced Lord Bludd who shows a machine mindset when it comes to surpressing a slave revolt or two.One of the best things about the prequels is the \\"aha\\" experience I got a few times. The origins of so many of Franks Herberts institutions become clear. Holtzman (who resembles a cowardly Zefram Cochrane) \\"invents\\" most of the tools used later on. The sorceresses are the ancestors of the Bene Gesserit. Norma exhibits all the characteristics of a mentat and the origins of the Space Guild and Choam are also made clear.The separate stories in the book are expertly woven together although there are a few inconsistencies. If I take a step back, I can't understand why mankind is fighting machines with bullets and explosives. If the scrambling fields are effective against pure machines, why not send a few ships with field generators and just pass the Synchronized Worlds through a scrambler field? That should take care of the computers. The Cymeks are a different story but taking them out one by one shouldn't be the only solution. Why not lure them to a distant planet and nuke the hell out of them? Off course, that would make the story too short.I can't wait to read the Battle for Corrin, it's loaded on my Kindle now but my baby son seems determined to distract me until he can read it himself.In conclusion; if you're a hardcore Frank Herbert fan, leave these books because they will change your view on the Duniverse.

It is poorly written, has no plot, and is so fundamentally flawed that it's infuriating to read. It seems that these so-called &quot;authors&quot; have never read the original Dune books, and at the very least are totally unaware of why melange was so important to the survival of the Galactic Empire and interstellar travel and commerce in Frank Herbert's original masterpieces.How, if in later books the empire cannot survive without space-folding (and melange), are we expected to believe that the early, primitive interstellar travel could take place in such short periods of time if the places described in the book are many hundreds of light years apart, and are the same planets and solar systems as the ones in the original series? Wasn't it made abundantly clear in his books that the empire's dependancy on melange stemmed from their inability to travel those many light years across galaxies and star systems without folding space? And that the empire would disintegrate into utter chaos without it? [...]"},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"The Machine Crusade is the middle installment of a trilogy, a prequel of sorts ostensibly based on the notes and writings of Frank Herbert. For those of you that don't know, The Machine Crusade takes place ten thousand years before the time of originator Frank Herbert's immensely popular book, Dune. It is a collaboration between Brian Herbert (Frank's son) and Kevin Anderson. It is the fourth book co-written by these authors that I know of, having just finished another trilogy/prequel, The House series (House Atriedes, Harkonnen and Corrin).Unlike some other reviewers, I found this trilogy to be exceptional. I believe they may be Herbert/Anderson's most accomplished manuscripts. I finally got to experience the distant past, which was vaguely alluded to in Herbert's original Dune series. We get to meet the beautiful, compassionate Serena Butler, who's son, the murder of which, set off the rebellion, which eventually brought down the heartless thinking machines. We also meet distant relatives of Baron Harkonnen - Xavier (who is a good and honorable person) and Paul Atriedes - Vorian (the son of the wicked Titan, Agamemnon {a thousand year old human brain in a robot body})and Tio Holtzman (the revered inventor of the Holtzman Effect and other inventions). We experience the last stronghold of free humanity, with The League of Nobles, the fledgling exportation of the spice melange from Arrakis and the precursor of the Bene Gesserit, in the Sorceress's of Rossak.As with the original Dune, the authors create numerous civilizations in a Universe dwelling on millions of planets and then embellish it with devious evil characters and their requisite counterpoints. It may be ten thousand years in the past from Dune but they are every bit as advanced to us, as we are to Cro Magnon Man.I found this book, consisting of 695 pages, to be an riveting read. True, the chapters are numerous and short but the story is huge so it couldn't be overly detailed, or the book would have been unwieldy. We are, after all, talking about a Universal Epic in which the authors followed about fifteen main characters on six different planets and in space. As with Dune we are treated to an excellent page turning science fiction novel with religious undertones.I suggest that you read this with an open mind and don't pre judge these books. No, it's not as good as Dune but neither were the elder Herbert's following works. The Bottom line is this is a good piece of science fiction in this day when Fantasy has taken over the genre."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"With The Machine Crusade, many of the plotlines now begin to fall into place and we start to see the birth of the Dune universe we had come to know with the original series of novels. The conception of foldspace technology, the riding of the worms on Arrakis and the start of the Fremen tribes, spice as a valuable commodity, etc. The sorceress of Rosak are seen as the precursors of the Bene Geserit, however their telepathic powers puzzle me as this was not one of the abilities of the Bene Geserit of the original Dune novels.Here the ideological and physical conflict between man and thinking machine comes to the forefront as the two sides are at war from beggining to end of this hefty book. The best parts are when the more profound philosophical aspects are explored, ironicaly it is the robot Erasmus who ponders these matters the most and has really become one the more interesting chacaracters in the series as he strives to understand the human race and their endless contradictions. The short chapters keep the story flowing at a brisk pace and it is to the credit of the authors that the many characters and plotlines never bog the story down.An interesting aspect is that the Butlerian Jihad, more than being a religious crusade as the term \\"Jihad\\" implies, is really a war waged for many reasons, political influence among the League of Nobles, economic benefit from the Tlulaxa flesh merchants and space transport industries, and just plain hunger for power from people on all sides. Perhaps the only ones to fight for a religious reason are the Buddislamics who are enslaved by machines and humans alike.I do not give this book five stars, as that would be to put it on a par with Frank Herberts original Dune itself, the finest SF novel of all time. And yes, Herbert Jr. and Anderson sometimes fall into Space Opera mode, but The Machine Crusade is a more than worthy addition to the Dune Chronicles."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I ejoyed the book and am anxious for the final book.

I was pleasantly surprised. The story line grabbed my attention. I found it hard to put down. Granted this does not have the finesse or subtlety of Frank Herbert's Dune books; but, it is a fine book on its own merit. The major problem I had with it is how the Omnius updates are handled. The events occur several thousand years in our future. Yet the Omnius updates are delivered by ship to the Synchronized Worlds. The amount of time this takes -makes me wonder how synchronized are the Synchronized worlds. Also, this method of updates leaves you rather vulnerable. In addition, it doesn't appear that backups are created prior to updates being installed. And there doesn't seem to be a backup plan or a disaster recovery plan. In addition, there are no safeguards (encryption, etc) to prohibit tampering with Omnius. I would have thought that in this distant future some sort of interplanetary network would have been set up where uploads from the various Omnius incarnations would be merged after backups had been taken. The new Omnius update would be downloaded (after the old one was backed up) on some sort of schedule. The way the updates of the evermind are handled it amazes me that the evermind has survived for so long. Hackers and saboteurs could have disabled it long ago. Aside from that this is a pretty good read."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I have read many poor reviews of Brian Herbert's work, but disagree. He has a totally different writing style than Frank Herbert, but the stories are still enjoyable. Any true fan of the orginial Dune series and story should enjoy these books because they love the stories and to learn about the Dune Universe.Brian's focus is more on the politics, science, economy, and religions of Dune rather than the characters, which were the main focus of Frank Herbert. Where Frank left you an appendix in the back so you could look up what you wanted to know, Brian tells you about it in his story. You really felt like you knew Paul, what motivated him, we all empathized with him. In Brian's books the main characters are not as well developed, but you really feel like you understand the the politics, and economy and how they work. I thought that Brian really \\"clarified\\" some things from the orginal Dune series.Anyway, I really enjoyed the Machine Crusade more than Butlerhean Jihad. It felt like after laying out the major character and storylines in the first book, Brian finally got into the heart of the story. The book moved through a lot of time though, about 30 years, so lots of stuff happens. I also found parts of the end a little predictable, but others were not."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"The saga of the crusade against the thinking machine continues, 20 years from the events that launched the Butlerian Jihad. Good character development, and the same action sequences and thought-provolking prose that hooked readers on the Dune prequels."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Let's face it. It isn't Dune; a previous reviewer asked did the writers read the first book? A valid question. Herbert's &amp; Andersons &quot;House Series&quot; was supposed to be a prequel to DUNE, it could have been another Universe other than the one Herbert's Dad wrote about. There were that many inconsistencies. With the &quot;Legend of Dune&quot;, I must admit it was an improvement. With Legends I actually enjoy this series, probably because it's so far back in time that the Readers Digest version of Dune that H&amp;A had read before cashing in on the Dune name didn't need any research other than adding the name Butler. I confess I read Dirk Pitt novels. So I like a book that is action packed with characters you can cheer and boo. If you are a die hard Dune fan, you probably won't like it. If you enjoy a good read and are a SciFi fan, it is a good read.I have just one question. If Holtzman Shield and Lasers interaction cause nuclear devastation, why hasn't the machine intelligences use Lasers on the Jihad space fleets?"},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I rarely will throw a book away once I've read it, particularly if I've spent good money on it. Book #2 in the Butlerian Jihad Prequel Triology, this book was a raving disappointment. The only reason I actually stuck with this book and finished it was I was sick in bed for a week and had seen all the *Bonanza* re-runs. Worse than the opener (The Butlerian Jihad - which actually had some redeeming features,) but not as bad as the truly abysmal Battle of Corrin. As in books 1 & 3, multiple \\"plot\\" lines keep Machine Crusade a pot-boiler with some lines less woefully unimaginative than others. But I got thoroughly sick of reading of the sadistic cruelties of the robot Erasmus (he should have been named \\"Mengele\\"), the slaughter of humans by the cartoonish \\"Titans\\", and the boring ego tripping of Vorian Atreides - the \\"Dorian Gray\\" of this universe and distant progenitor of the ultimately, equally insufferable Paul Atreides (his little sister was twice the Fremen he was). I bought and read the last book (see my review of that turkey) out of a sense of moral obligation to finish the trilogy. No good deed goes unpunished.And I consider the fact that 6 reviewers have thus far \\"boo'd\\" this review a badge of honor. Long live the REAL Dune books!"},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"... but not by much. In this series Herbert and Anderson at least appear to have actually read the Dune series instead of a watching the David Lynch Dune movie on fast forward to learn all they need to know about the Dune universe. No more major consistency errors that was typical of the original prequel trilogy. You're not going to want to beat Herbert and Anderson about the face and neck for idiot plot ideas like introducing no-ships about 10,000 years before Frank Herbert claimed they were invented in the Dune universe. Secret Frank Herbert notes in a mysterious bank vault huh?The downside is they've yet to learn what made Frank Herbert such an excellent writer. Herbert learned the art of saying things by NOT saying them. Yeah, Baron Harkonen was very, very evil and cruel. But Frank mostly intimated that. He didn't devote entire chapters to having the Baron torture people. Herbert and Anderson seem to have turned the Dune series into a literary snuff film. We're \\"treated\\" constantly to chapter-length descriptions of robots killing helpless humans in horrible ways. Are we supposed to get off on this or something?The Butlerian Jihad should have been more than a Battlestar Galactica like rebellion against insane killer machines that want to torture and kill humans. Better writers would have found an intelligent back story about a human rejection of thinking machines. The Dune Encyclopedia paints the jihad as resulting from machines being given the ultimate authority of who is allowed to be born and who should be aborted. But Herbert and Anderson turn that more relevant social commentary into emotionless, cruel death camp electronic death camp guards running around torturing and killing humans.They also fail to address why the machines don't simply pick up and leave human space. They're machines. We're told they don't have human emotions. They're not out to avenge the humans that enslaved them. Right? They don't need air, food, water, or spice. Why should these machines risk their own destruction when they could just jump in some spaceships and find their own little corner of the universe to live in, away from humans."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I read the original Dune novels several times because they were well-written masterpieces not only of science fiction, but also (arguably) or modern literature. The other prequels seemed to carry on that tradition of fine storytelling as well as anyone could be expected to without being on par with Frank Herbert, and I read those once. I noticed minor inconsistences in the other novels, but they never bothered me too much. This second book in the \\"Legends\\" series is a different story.One thing that had bothered my since THE BUTLERIAN JIHAD was the fact that there existed Sorceresses who had telepathic powers. This exists nowhere in the senior Herbert's Dune universe. Granted, he wrote characters with extraordinary abilities, but these abilities always stemmed from extremely intensive development of faculties already possessed by humans in the real world. Paul Muad'Dib was no telepath, but could \\"see\\" the future. He was, essentially, a mentat.Paul was a mentat, and I am not the first reader to make that assertion. The spice melange, in classic Dune, was a drug that modified brain function and, in the case of Paul Atreadies, interacted with his own unique body chemestry that was a result of eons of breeding in a way that the mentat faculties he had been unwittingly trained in since birth were amplified to superhuman levles. Guild navigators enjoyed similar benefits from the spice, but at a much greater cost to their humanity and freedom. In this cost, I find it difficult to accept that humans possessed telepathic powers thousands or years before the culmination of the kwizats haderach program.The powers of the Sorceresses of Rossak bother me for another reason as well. Presumably, this group of women will evolve into the Bene Geserit. If the Bene Geseret had, in the distant past, possessed powers of telepathy, wouldn't it have been of great importance to them to maintain those abilities? Hell, if they had that, they wouldn't have needed Paul for anything. Not even the Honored Matres possessed such power. Also, why the hell does foldspace have a high rate or success without a prescient navigator? That really bothers me. And why is it possible to manipulate physical matter with your mind after your body has been destroyed? I could ramble on, but I just don't want to say any more about the faults of this book.Though this work is irreparably flawed, I must read it and those books still to come. If you've read the rest of Dune, like I have, you may find that you have the same problem. But seriously, I could have done better myself."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Frank was a genius. He made me understand the Bene Gesserett by how characters reacted and behaved, without saying stupid things like \\"I'm the greatest sorceress in the universe...\\" I want to laugh at the lack of philosophical introspection, character development, and depth these two authors display compared to Frank. Its a long, labororious read, and its only redeeming feature is that its made from Frank's notes, there-fore its interesting. How these two authors fill in the blanks is so utterly dissapointing. Fortunately the 5% of Frank's genius out of the 95% of the murkyness makes it worth a read. I'll buy the next one too. Re-read your father's book, Brian. Watch how he makes you feel something about Jessica without almost literally saying--as you do-- \\"Feel something about Jessica here.\\""},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Frank Herbert is undoubtedly turning over in his grave with this latest pretender to his literary heritage. Gone are any pretences to literature, or even decent writing-- this bloated novel seems to be written for an audience of 14-year old girls, yet is an insult to 14-year old girls. The book has the feel of a well developed outline (there is a solid story buried here) that was developed into a book simply by fleshing out the outline to the point where we have a dull, plodding description of what the real book should do, if only anyone could write it. The characters have no depth whatsoever, and develop only by statements proclaiming their development. When a character is hurt, the authors simply state that the character was hurt. The plodding, uninspired tone doesn't change to reflect the character'sstate of being, nor is the state reflected in any other subtle artifice. There's simply nothing subtle about the book.Most damning to this long-time Dune fan is the authors determination to redefine the characters created in Frank Herbert's original novels. We discover that virtually all the male characters in the original series were really just scoundrels who stole work or credit from women. The most glaring example is Holtzmann, who we learn didn't really understand his own equations, and instead stole the accomplishments of his female apprentice, Norma. (Seems Holzman was just too busy complaining about his slaves to do any real work.) This sort of politically-correct rewrite of Frank Herbert pervades the entirebook, and not only are men largely secondary characters, but the few good ones all commit suicide. Only women are allowed to shine here.Finally, where were the editors? This story could have been completely told in a third of the space. Most irritating is the author's practice of re-stating what just happened 5-10 pages ago in summaries that often take 2-3 paragraphs to slog through. Do the authors really see their audience as this incompetent to follow a story? It's a dramatic, and condescending, departure from Frank Herbert."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"It's a pretty basic fact, either you liked the prequels of Dune, or you did not. I was one of those that really enjoyed the first prequel of the original series but was disappointed with the second book of the original prequel series. This book, the second book of the Butlerian Jihad, is slightly disappointing, but the latter half of the book is where it shines.The first 400 pages, nothing happens. Nope, nothing, nada. Every other page either paraphrases the Eramus killing Serena's baby, and the other page describes how people react to the killing of the baby. By page 200, I almost gave up. The only reason why I continued was that I've read all the other Dune books, and I just couldn't stop. It was beyond tedious, beyond repetitive. I guess they got paid by the page or something.Only at about page 400 (it's a 700-page book) does the action pick up. Fortunately, the plot moves swiftly and in interesting directions. This is where I regained my interest, and I now look forward to third book. Without giving too much away, there are battles, a few surprises, interesting action, great plot twists, and some character changes.Unfortunately, the only thing that spoiled the last 300 pages was the fact that almost everyone or everything was black and white, either unbelievably great, or truly evil. This is lack of depth was almost insulting.All in all, it was decent. With proper editing, it could have been as good as the first book of the series."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Easily the most boring of the non-Frank Herbert series. Very little character development. At times, the plotline is downright silly (Norma's transformation, Holtzman's end, everything about the Titan Hecate, the Cogiters' meddling). The way they explain the so-called Harkonnen treachery was ludicrous. I kept hoping they'd explain the source of the long standing Atreides-Harkonnen animosity, but was very disappointed. Maybe they'll do it on about page 600 of the next (and hopefully last!) book, but I'm not eager to find out anymore.It also seemed like they injected politics of the last couple years into the story. How lame. Hardly worthy of a saga developed over a dozen novels."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"The Machine Crusade is the second novel in the Legends of Dune trilogy, following The Butlerian Jihad. In the previous volume, the slaves on Earth revolted against their machine masters. Amidst the confusion, Vorian Atreides escaped from Earth in the Dream Voyager, carrying Serena Butler, the body of her murdered child Manion, and Iblis Ginjo back to Salusa Secundus. The Earth Omnius and the Titans broke the revolt, but Xavier Horkonnen later led the League Armada back to Earth to sow nuclear destruction over the face of the planet. Vor captured the last memory update from the Earth Omnius, leaving the robot Seurat deactivated in the disabled update ship.The remnants of the League Armada left Earth as a radioactive wasteland and returned to a massive celebration. Xavier and Vor received military honors for their victory. Serena rededicated herself to the Jihad against the thinking machines.In this novel, over a decade later, Xavier and Vor are defending IV Anbus, a Zenshiite planet, but are not getting any cooperation from the inhabitants. The Jihad soldiers try to defend the planet on the ground by setting an ambush, yet the Zenshiites not only refuse to cooperate against the machines, but also drug the Jihad soldiers in their villages and sabotage their heavy weapons. The Jihadis are faced with defeat on the planet, yet still manage to take out the machine horde, although with heavy loss of property and priceless religious artifacts.The Jihad continues to gain ground against the machines, but at a high cost in human lives. Disaffection grows among the civilian populace, but Iblis, now entitled the Grand Patriarch of the Jihad, uses his Jihad Police to weed out traitors and political opponents. His Jihad Council has successfully usurped major powers from the League Parliament in order to increase the efficiency of the war against the machines. Iblis has made covert arrangements throughout the League and Unallied Worlds to promote the machine crusade.In this story segment, major changes occur in the political, military and technological sectors. The foundations of the subsequent Empire begin to appear. The planet Arrakis acquires the Fremen. And the Atreides family appears on Caladan.This volume moves the story in the direction of the new Empire, but somehow the progression of events doesn't seem to move smoothly. Since this is a prequel to the prequels, the events herein are forced to fit previously revealed patterns, but the progressions are too jerky. Moreover, the ambiance of this novel is very old-fashioned; it reads somewhat like one of the Legion of Space stories from the 1940s. This has been an ongoing characteristic of works by these authors, but this volume seems to have this quality to a greater extent than the other Dune novels.Recommended for Dune fans and for anyone else who enjoys space opera with massive movements of military forces, grand political maneuvers, and glorious personal sacrifices."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I bought this book against my better judgement and because Borders had it 20% off.

I borrowed the first one in the series from the library and I found it disappointing, more like a crappy Star Wars novel aimed at 14 year olds. I really did find the reading very immature, with archetypal characters, often not well defined (Iblis Ginjo lacks so much depth to be the great man he was supposed to be).Also, really bad stereotyping of Norma Cenva, from ugly duckling to reshaping her physical body into bombshell, just because she felt like it. I find it harder to believe in molecular level instantaneous body reshaping than folding space; yes, some of us scientists do read Science Fiction occassionally.Regarding the master swordsmen characters, well, they sound like the black clad people who ran the back-stage at my old Students' Union: chains hanging from pockets, ponytails (no offence meant), martial-arts wannabes who could not get off the sofa whilst watching Mall Rats or MTV.I might as well say it: my favourite character is Erasmus, I keep looking forward to him killing all the main &quot;goodies&quot;. At least he is not spineless and being 2D is an AI trait.In all, a poorly written book (it drags on), poor stereotypical characters and too many pages. Only read it if you like the quality of Star Wars novels.If you want to know about the early Dune universe, read the highlights at various websites."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"The original six books were masterfully written. Sir Arthur C.

It is undeserving of the word \\"Dune\\" appearing anywhere in connection with this book. Not only The Machine Crusade, but also all the others besides the original six.I read several of these Brian Herbert / Kevin J. Anderson prequel/sequel efforts, and every one of them is just a sorry excuse for a novel, LET ALONE a Dune novel. It is, at best, a misguided and failed attempt to honor his father, and at worst, a greedy attempt to capitalize on his father's talent as much as possible. Either way, consider yourself warned.Frank Herbert dealt with important topics (including sex, violence, politics, commerce, religion, etc.) with grace and eloquence.

However, the same writing problems abound in all of the books, regardless of what it's about - useless detail, flat characters, and clunky writing in some places. This story would have been better if it was an entirely original creation by Brian and Kevin instead of a non-canon, fanfiction-esque extension of the Dune universe.This book is heavy on filler. There are so many viewpoints and chapters that after a while it just all kind of... melts together. There was one thing that bothered me immensely - the transformation of Norma Cenva. I actually liked her better before, but then when she became transformed into a Super-Sorceress she lost her appeal. Aurelius had already accepted her for who she was, yet she felt compelled to change herself for him. I'm happy that Norma was finally able to achieve her mental potential, but to change herself to look like her mother and other Sorceresses was like validating Zufa's idea that beauty was vital to a woman.This trilogy may be the best out of the McDune books that Brian and Kevin wrote, but it was still very plodding to read and I found myself skimming pages just to get on with it."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I love reading the DUNE series, but this book has been the hardest one to read because of the constant repetition.

I first read all 7 of the DUNE books written by Frank Herbert and now am reading the additional (10-11 I think) by Brian Herbert using his father's notes. I did not run across so much redundancy in the other couple of books I have read by Brian Herbert so I have no idea why this one is like this -- but I'm sure hoping this will NOT continue in the rest of the books! After a while it got insulting: do they think I am brain-dead? I would think it would be a good thing only for those who truly do have memory problems -- and/or those who put down the book for weeks, months or years at a time before finishing it.

I have read the other reviews at amazon.com and feel that people are not judging this book based upon its own merits but as an an extension of the books created by Frank Herbert. I do agree that Frank Herbert was the best science fiction writer that ever drew a breath. I also feel that the six Dune books created by Frank Herbert are the best science fiction works ever published. Having said that I do feel that Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson do provide an exciting glimpse into the \\"what ifs\\" in the Dune Universe and I am thankful that they sought to provide us with their interpreatations of what could have occurred prior to the coming of Muad'Dib to Arrakis. No, their writing does not equal that of the original writer of the series but they do provide us with intelligent, highly readable material that we can enjoy as companion pieces to the original.Also, once e reader begins God Emperor, Heretics, and Chapterhouse one learns that the writing of Frank Herbert gets a little more high brow and it is not often accessible to the general reading public. The Herbert/Anderson duo wrote to make their prequels accessible to everyone.

But these new books by Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson are fundamentally flawed.In the original Dune books, we were made to understand that the spice Melange is the most important substance in the universe because the Spacing Guild require it to fold space. Without Melange, space folding is not possible and thus space travel will take many many light years. The result, commerce will collapse and the Galactic Empire will disintegrate into chaos.In the Legends of Dune series, Machines and humans are able to wage numerous wars in different star systems at reasonably short periods of time. Trade of slaves, light globes and even spice is thriving. All these achieved even before Space Folding is invented and without the existence of the SPacing Guild.I'm rating the book only 1 star because the authors have decided to throw the basic concepts of the original Dune books out of the window."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Herbert and Anderson continue to write complex stories full of color and surprises; this is one of the best.

But it ultimately comes down to the story and I'm actually finding most of this to be a fun and engaging read. Now, don't get me wrong. This is not a book I would describe as being hard to put down. There are some flaws in the story and the way a machine would react to things (for machines, they are waaaaaay to sentimental). There are many story lines to follow and I started skimming through certain boring ones.If you can't get enough of the Dune universe then I would recommend picking up this book. We get an early glimpse of the creation of the mentats, Bene Gesserit, the sword masters, th empire under the rule of the Corrinos, and the Guild.

It would be obvious to any learned individual that writing styles would not similar, or even in the same catagory. To expect that would be utter garbage.

I have read so many reviews where reviewers have skipped ahead because they were \\"bored\\" then complain that they didn't understand certain complexities of characters. You would have to admit that Erasmus trying to explain human reproduction to a 12 year old was funny, heck I laughed, something i have never done while reading a book.I am not saying that this book is on par with a literary master such as Frank Herbert, but if you go into this book with that in mind and accept it for its telling of the pre-history of the Duneaverse then you are in for a treat and a few surprises.And yes this book does deserve a 4 star...."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"The difference between the Dune books written by Frank Herbert and the prequels written by his son, Brian Herbert, is that they occur in a completely different time. These books are similiar in the fact that they both deal with the legend of Dune, Muad'dib, and the countless other players but the situations are vastly different. I never picked up these prequels expecting them to be immense philisophical tomes but instead I found stories that you would hear around a campfire.. stories of powerful legends and people and history that brings the great novel of &quot;Dune&quot; into focus.What many need to understand when they pick up this novel [and the one before it &quot;Butlerian Jihad&quot;] is that they won't encounter the deep-thoughts of Frank Herbert's books, but instead a far reaching story that must encompass much of the history that came before &quot;Dune&quot;. If you go into the novels knowing this, then you will come out immensely satisfied like I did. The stories are rich and the pace of the novel flows like wine. A good wine, one that you will want to taste again and again.I won't divulge important storypoints here because that's best left up to a book report or newspaper review, but instead emphasize that it got my heart racing and I couldn't put down the book for several days.

Yet, none of these \\"wheels\\" within other \\"wheels\\" ever seemed to emerge from the hints that they existed. B. Herbert and Anderson seem to think that by making references to these amazingly subtle plans that they will magically appear of their own will.I really can't say enough bad things about this book. I think I'll leave it at that."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"According to time in the Dune universe, \\"The Machine Crusade\\" is the second of all the Dune books. It is also the second of a trilogy including \\"The Butlerian Jihad,\\" \\"The Machine Crusade,\\" and \\"The Battle of Corrin\\" (all three are about the Butlerian Jihad).As author Ben Bova would probably say, the Dune books written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson are more aptly called \\"space opera\\" than \\"science fiction.\\" This does not make them bad. Star Wars is space opera, and it's good stuff. So is this Dune stuff. Good action, political intrigue, hyperlight space travel, paranormal forces, big monsters, heroes and villains and multiple intertwining plots. It's all tied together with easy-to-read contemporary prose that doesn't bog the reader down in excessive background detail.It's not as good as the first volume. The pace is slower, and the same characters are used, making them less original and no longer extraordinary. It's still a respectable read, though, and it's a necessary stepping stone to the end of the trilogy.I think I've said enough for most readers to decide if this New York Times bestseller is worth their time, but you might want to know why I give it only four stars.Every novel ever published is subject to improvement by revision. Herbert and Anderson's writing style could use some polishing--it's repetitive and verbose--but for \\"The Machine Crusade,\\" their style is not so bad that it makes me lower my rating. In regard to credibility and convincingness, however, the authors are lax. Maybe only one of them is lax, but I don't know which one. So at least one of them needs to be more considerate of his audience. At least one of them needs to do more thinking and be more convincing.So if you decide to read their Dune books (I've read only the first two of this trilogy and I'm about to read the third), don't be picky. Just swallow what the authors say and keep reading. At least that's the mantra I chant.NOTE: This book has an appendix, which is a chronology of events before the start of the novel. Even though it's at the back of the book, you should read it before you start.NOTE: Sometimes the worth of a book can at least partially be measured by the fondness with which it is remembered. It has been over a month since I completed my reading of the Legends of Dune trilogy (\\"The Butlerian Jihad,\\" \\"The Machine Crusade,\\" and \\"The Battle of Corrin\\"), and my memories of it are quite positive. Though this trilogy forms a different kind of story from that of Frank Herbert's classic \\"Dune,\\" the quality of the story is as good. For this reason I have decided to give each book in the trilogy a five-star rating. I believe the weaknesses in the books do not merit a lowering of rating."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I have read the \\"most helpful critical review\\" of this book. While i respect it i don't agree with it.First of all, i had a great time reading this book. This book was epic, not in the physical sense but in the historical sense, an excellent motion capture of events i would call it. It is obviously different than Dune's writing (the writers saying from the beginning they would not try to imitate Frank Herbert because they would fail). The tackled problems are slightly different (or subtly tackled, but differently), which, to me, is veridical, because you can't expect a perspective on a point of history to coincide with another. Problems of period 1 probably differ of the problems of period 2. Details of the original Dune novels are not forgotten because many threads come together - both important and unimportant threads, which gives a sense of total (and accurate) connection with the components of the original Dune series.Unlike the \\"most helpful critical review\\", i felt attachment to characters from this book. One in particular, not a main character, but a character that undergoes a very human transformation and is pointlessly killed towards the end of the novel (i won't spoil :). That particular chain of events, as well as others, prevent this book from being linear as if written by a robot. Random things happened too which is exquisite.Another thing i liked about this book is that it teaches us about how the world works. Intricate political and military plans, all those happen in reality in a manner similar to what was written, i'm convinced. I could also sense the writers' strong grasp of technology, which is pretty cool - it impressed even me and i'm a Software Engineer :) The technological details aren't intrusive, just right and sometimes subtle.Bottom line, what i think should be known is that this book ties many threads which also go through the original novels - from that point of view you could enjoy it as you enjoyed \\"Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith\\", you know how it ends, but you want to see how it all happens. But, although i haven't read but a few pages of the \\"The Battle of Corrin\\", i can safely say that just as the Star Wars prequel, this prequel can easily be read as an independent science-fiction story. (I liked the Star Wars prequel even though it was obviously different, same goes for this). I think considering these books started from mere notes, i think Frank Herbert would be proud of the added value they bring. Even if my eyes hurt, i started reading \\"The Battle of Corrin\\" when i finished \\"The Machine Crusade\\" - for me that's proof enough this book matches the definition of 'good' good enough. I want to think of a bad thing to say about this book but i can't find one, and i'll leave it at that :)"},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"We all know that this series is no match for Frank Herbert's work. So I will not beat that dead horse here.Looking at this series as on its own, I have to admit, I liked Butlerian Jihad as a summer trash read. I picked this one up to complete the story and have to say to Brian and Kevin this: Give me a break! - A Human/Machine Hybrid that looks like a dragon and flies around the galaxy in an asteroid!!!!This book does fill some holes of the history/mythology of the Frank Herbert Dune series which is nice, but this book lacks the creativity and imagination that one would expect in the Dune universe.I would have prefered an encyclopedic chronology of this era of \\"Dune History\\". Perhaps if this book/series was written as if it were a history book, without the cheesy story line, it might have been more widely accepted by the die hard Frank Herbert dune fans. Alas, this is hand that we have been dealt and now must live with it for the rest of eternity.This book/series should not ever be considered as required reading as the original series should be. Never the less, it is a somewhat enjoyable summer trash read if you are into spoon fed, paint by numbers plot and character development. No thinkers here please.3 out of 5 stars (and that is really pushing it). I hope these two don't blow it with Hunters of Dune/Sandworms of Dune."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"this book is very interesting for a filler it is like the second book in lord of the rings, it is a filler and is building up to the end. why would you yell at a book that wasn't supposed to be the best in the series."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Boring!!! Normally I don't write reviews, but felt the need to on this one. First I'd like to state that I love the Dune series by Frank Herbert. In my opinion it's the best science fiction ever written. And so far I have enjoyed the prequels written by Brian Herbert. \\"The Machine Crusade\\" has been the exception. I am not even half way through and will have to make myself finish it. Too many story lines going at once and none is developed well. There's no depth to them. They're all flimsy. Like I said I'm not even half way through but I don't think that's enough time for this book to redeem itself."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"While I would read anything to do with the Dune universe, parts of the Butlerian Jihad left me with mixed feelings. Maybe it was because I had to get used to new characters but the fact was that while the history and premise was very intriguing I thought much of the dialogue to be stilted. I would have given that book three stars, on a good day. It was then with much trepidation that I read the Machine Crusade. Well I could not have had a happier surprise. The characters are now more fleshed out, the history is still intriguing and the politics and backgrounds are exciting beyond belief. But the big difference is the dialogue amongst the characters and in their thoughts. I now care about the people involved in the stories. I look forward to the third book in the series. My faith in the ability of the authors to tell a story has been restored."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Every summer I choose a series of books to read and so for 2009 I chose Dune. I have read Frank Herbert's Dune, Dune Messiah and Children of Dune several times over the years but had never made it past those titles until. I started with the Dune House trilogy by Herbert/Anderson and now have completed Dune: The Butlerian Jihad and Dune: The Machine Crusade.With the Legends of Dune trilogy, Herbert and Anderson are not tied down to characters already created by Frank Herbert and I very much enjoyed some new and inventive choices for this epic storyline including the standout characters of Norma Cenva, Erasmus and Vorian Atreides. Less interesting are the cymeks and Omnius, the villains of the story. And Selim Wormrider and the Zensunni on Arrakis, not as complelling as the Kynes storyline of the Prelude trilogy, are given short shrift in this volume. I wish the authors had spent more time on them, but it is interesting to see the beginnings of spice production. Less cerebral than Frank Herbert's volumes but epic in scale, high on action and clever in its hints of what we know of Dune's future, Machine Crusade is a fun, worthy read for those who just want to spend a little more time in the Dune universe and see how it all started. I'm looking forward to reading Battle of Corrin."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"While the book managed to keep my attention, it lacked the depth and complexity of the original. Characters are developed in detail then abruptly killed. It seemed as though the author could not figure out what to do with them. Wait for paperback."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2) is the middle installment of a trilogy, a prequel of sorts ostensibly based on the notes and writings of Frank Herbert. For those of you that don't know, the trilogy takes place ten thousand years before the time of originator Frank Herbert's immensely popular book, Dune. It is a collaboration between Brian Herbert (Frank's son) and Kevin Anderson. It is the sixth book co-written by these authors that I know of, having just finished another trilogy/prequel, The House series (House Atriedes, Harkonnen and Corrin).Unlike some other reviewers, I found this trilogy to be exceptional. I believe they may be Herbert/Anderson's most accomplished manuscripts. I finally got to experience the distant past, which was vaguely alluded to in Herbert's original Dune series. We get to meet the beautiful, compassionate Serena Butler, who's young son, the murder of which, set off the rebellion, which eventually after sixty-five years brought down the heartless thinking machines. We also meet distant relatives of Baron Harkonnen - Xavier (who is an honorable person) then Abulurd and Paul Atriedes - Vorian (the son of the wicked Titan, Agamemnon {a thousand year old human brain in a robot body})and Tio Holtzman (the revered inventor of the Holtzman Effect and other inventions). We experience the last stronghold of free humanity, with The League of Nobles, the fledgling exportation of the spice melange from Arrakis and the precursor of the Bene Gesserit, in the Sorceress's of Rossak. In the final story the pieces start to come together that were the basis for Dune some ten thousand years later as the groundwork is laid for the Harkonnen/Atriedes feud as well as the space guild and mentats.The Machine Crusade continues twenty-four years after the events of the first book, The Butlerian Jihad, which started the slave revolt on Earth and Earth's eventual destruction. The duplicitous, conniving and verbally persuasive Iblis Ginjo, a former slave master, who escaped Earth with Serena Butler and Vorian Atredies in the aftermath of the slave rebellion, has been elevated to Grand Patriarch of The League of Nobles. Though Serena Butler is the titular head of the government, He, along with some of his henchmen weld the real power and sew mischief, and make unholy alliances to perpetuate the war, his basis of power. The rudimentary elements for folding space have been discovered by Norma Cenva, a brilliant prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Tio Holtzman. However it is to dangerous for widespread use, as ten percent of such voyages disappear, apparently victims of space collisions. Norma Cenva's husband and entrepreneur, Aurelius Venport has started to import melange from Arrakis, now popular as a recreational drug but it's true worth has yet to be discovered. On Arrakis, Selim Wormrider begins his own crusade, leading his followers against those who would mine the \`spice.' This is but a tiny portion of the spectacle - The Machine Crusade and it is but a third of the grand spectacle known as The Legends of Dune Trilogy.ConclusionAs with the original Dune, the authors create numerous civilizations in a Universe dwelling on millions of planets and then embellish it with devious evil characters and their requisite counterpoints. It may be ten thousand years in the past from Dune but they are every bit as advanced to us, as we are to Cro Magnon Man.I found this book, consisting of 704 pages, to be an riveting read. True, the chapters are numerous and short but the story is ambitious so it couldn't be overly detailed, or the book would have been unwieldy. We are, after all, talking about a Universal Epic in which the authors followed about fifteen main characters on six different planets and in space. As with Dune we are treated to an excellent page turning science fiction novel with religious undertones.This being the fifth collaboration of these two authors, the writing itself is fluid and easy to follow and well structured. The main characters, those that have been with us since book 1, are well developed but some of the newer ones could use some more. If the book has a fault, it's that the authors try to tell too much in too short a time. I remember when the movie Dune came out. Most of those who had previously read Dune and were able to follow the immensity of the story in a short time, liked it. To others, the movie was confusing. They couldn't follow it and hence didn't. That is the trouble with trying to tell a story that is huge, within the constraints of time or pages. We're talking about the whole universe here!As a reader it seems to be in vogue to criticize this trilogy but as a writer I can tell you that these authors did a wonderful job of juggling this very complex story, with dozens of nuances and telling the story without being confusing. (Well, it can be a little confusing) Personally I am in awe of their overall accomplishment.I suggest that you read this epic story slowly, with an open mind and don't pre judge the books. No, it's not as good as Dune but neither were the elder Herbert's following works. The bottom line is, this is a good piece of science fiction in this day when Fantasy has taken over the genre."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I for one claim this one as my favorite of the Legends of Dune books.I do happen to enjoy the Dune books brought forth by Kevin J. Anderson and Brian Herbert.The machines are altogether beastly. And they never play fair. There's some nice plots within plots, battles, victories and losses. You get to learn where many of the legends in Frank Herbert's classic novels originated.I found it to be nicely detailed and satisfying."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Two good things about this book:1) Fast-paced, planet-hopping adventure in the best space opera tradition.2) Plenty of opportunities to try to decipher how the authors are setting up characters and events to \\"lead to\\" the universe created by Frank Herbert in the original Dune series. Kind of like a detective who knows the end result of a crime, then tries to pick up the clues to the series of events that led to the crime (not that Frank Herbert's originals should ever be considered a crime, except in this reviewer's awkward attempt at an extended metaphor!).Two bad things about this book:1) Significant events hinge on pretty implausible scenarios. Humanity is fighting against a computer evermind, Omnius, that enslaved the human race for a thousand years, yet that same evermind falls for some pretty obvious tricks and is unable to detect some ruses that you'd think something called an \\"evermind\\" would see right through. I understand the authors are trying to juxtapose humans' passion and unpredictability against computers' cold logic and reliance on pure reason; still, the holes in the plot left me feeling dissatisfied.2) This sucker is way too long. Now I'm not lazy when it comes to reading; I've read plenty of LOOOOONG novels and some of them--like \\"...Kavalier and Klay\\" and \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\"--are my absolute faves of all time. But this novel could have used a LOT of editorial liposuction. I got into the story immediately and was really into it for the first 250 pages or so; but it dragged on and on and on...for some 500 more pages!I've read all Frank Herbert's Dune novels, as well as Brian Herbert's and Kevin J. Anderson's \\"House\\" trilogy of prequels, \\"The Butlerian Jihad,\\" and now this one. I've enjoyed them all, and while the new novels are not yet on a par with Frank's originals, I think Herbert the Younger and Anderson are getting better.One last thing: I highly recommend reading Frank Herbert's original Dune series before reading the newer books. They're fantastic books (the best SF series ever, in my opinion), and they'll give you the knowledge to appreciate the newer entries on a much deeper level than you'd have without them."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"This seems to be a bridge book, rather than the one we have all been waiting for. Lots of archetypes, good guys, bad guys, merciless machines, powerful women, early melange usage. Credulity must be extended more than usual: planet-wide secret projects staying secret, huge conspiracies involving thousands of low level people remaining undetected, lack of planetary defenses for ground assault (how naive can we be?), lots of things. But maybe that is what SF is all about.And in the last 4 words of the 692 page book, we learn how to pronounce Freman."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I found the ending to be a bit jumbled (too many subjetcts: The Guild, Norma, abrupt ending of Aurelius &amp; Zufa &amp; Xerxes,Tlulaxa, Titan Rebellion)with that many subjects there should have been a fourth book before the upcoming &quot;Battle of Corrin&quot; or they should find a way to modify their plans so that the next book is only the third in a series... The book overall was quite good and I would / have reccomended it to my family and friends who are also scifi fans."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"A lot of other reviewers have made the same comment, but I had to throw my two cents in:I got the unabridged audio version of this book, and it is the first time ever that I have actually skipped an entire CD. I nearly threw the darn thing out the window! So much needless repetition, so many out-of-place and contradictory facts, and so many rehashed cliches and reworded profoundities that I, a few times, actually pulled hair out of my head in frustration!I honestly feel that these authors could do a lot better. There were seeds of a decent story here, but it never sprouted. I never felt pitty for Serena or any of the other overly melodramatic, underly written tragic characters. I cheered when the book was over - because it was over. I think the authors might have used an emotionless thinking machine programmed for endless rewording of the same plot line to complete this long and boring book."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I liked this book better than the previous one. It gives more understanding to the advancement in the human mind over the thinking machine. You see how religion is used as a driving force to unite the people and bring about change. It is used as a rallying cry by the politicians who might not really believe in what they are saying, but the underlying message might still be true. You also get to see how many of the main factions of Dune came into being such as the Bene Gesserit priestesses, flight navigators, Tlulaxa organ tanks, CHOM, and Freman. Kolhar is turned into a shipyard. Rossak reminds me of Africa where since it is an underdeveloped jungle, it is able to provide many pharmaceuticals, and natural resources.The villains and heroes are not as clear cut as they used to be in these books. Aurelius Venport and Norma Cenva are sympathetic characters, but they utilize slave labor, and Venport is like a drug dealer. Primero Xavier Harkonnen is a good guy, but as a military commander he does whatever it takes to win the war regardless of the loss of human life. Serena Butler is just a tool for the Grand Patriarch Iblis Ginjo for most of the story, until she finally comes into her own at the end. The Grand Patriarch Iblis Ginjo is a bad guy for using his position for personal gain. He does get the job done however, but is the cost too high? Lord Niko Bludd (nice play on the word blood) is definitely a bad guy and reminds me a lot of Baran Harkonnen. The robot Erasmus is still around as a bad guy, but I liked the twist of giving him more human characteristics as a kind of father figure to the slave boy Gilbertus Albans. Omnius is still supposedly the main bad guy, but it's just a computer, not very scary. Vorian Atreides is a good guy even though he's vain. At first it seems he can't live a normal life because he's been given this life extension treatment, but halfway through the book they try to have him settle down somewhat and grow up a little. I wonder how this will play out when other people who start taking melage start living longer as well. Selim Wormrider is supposedly a good guy, but he's also a terrorist. Tio Holtzman is a bad guy because he's selfish and only after his own glory. General Agamemnon is still the leader of the Cymeks but his role and the rest of the Cymeks for that matter, seem greatly diminished in this novel. I suspect they will play a bigger role in the next book. Jool Noret the Ginaz Mercenary is a nice character. Kind of like a futuristic samari. I also liked the robot sensei. The Zensunni Slave Aliid is set up as a kind of bad guy even though all he was trying to do was free his people, and the other slave Ishmael is set up as a kind of good guy even though it seems to me he could have done more to have helped his people sooner.One of the big climatic scenes toward the end of the book with Serena Butler seemed so obvious to me, I would have been upset if the robots like Erasmus couldn't figure it out. I was relieved when he finally did even if they couldn't do anything about it.The love story on Caladan with Leronica Tergiet, her husband Kalem Vazz, and their twin sons Estes and Kagin was a nice touch.I liked how there were Cogitors who disconnected themselves for thousands of years from the outside world to seek inner wisdom and still did not gain any useful wisdom that could be used in the outside world.I felt at the end like I did while watching &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. It was a good book, but you feel cheated because it left you hanging waiting for the conclusion.Spoiler:In the end many of the main characters are killed off, but there are at least 6 six children all around the age of 10 that I suspect will play big roles in the third installment of this trilogy."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2) is the middle installment of a trilogy, a prequel of sorts ostensibly based on the notes and writings of Frank Herbert.

I think that's unfair. I do think the younger Herbert needs to try harder though.The story of the Butlerian Jihad continues. After years of war and little results, the people are getting tired of it. You wouldn't know that, except for the opening statement in the book. Then, you hear nothing of the war fatigue until the end of the book. In the meantime, you get a cookie cutter story of political intrigue you see coming a mile away.A more interesting story comes from Norma Cenva, and the beginnings of the Guild space-folding technology. Besides her, the only really interesting characters are the Titan villians, and they're easy to hate villians."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"This story is entertaining, but there are a few things that do not sit well. The overall plot foundation doesn't seem so well developed as the main Dune universe. The author's drive home the point that the efficient thinking machines are stupid, but that doesn't seem realistic. For one, why would machines keep humans around? They would whipe them out like in Terminator, or use them as batteries as in Matrix, but to put them to work as slaves? Uh, not!I always imagined the computer imposing itself as God, being the caretaker of man, like in a few classic science fiction scenarios including Star Trek of \\"computer knows best\\". This would make the \\"jihad\\" make sense as humans would want to oust the false god.However, the general populace doesn't seem religious, but yet they are stirred into religous fervor, without an established or well documented religion.Thus from this, things just don't seem to add up, at least from the social standpoint. From a scientific standpoint, things don't seem to add up later. Humans seem to pose a threat to the sychronized worlds of machines producing around the clock, but the humans are forgetful and lazy. The contrast between this and some brilliant remarkable humans isn't as strong because of this backdrop.Lastly, the human and machine craft have FTL (faster-than-light) travel, but the machine/cymeks mention/brag that they can go faster, as humans frality couldn't withstand the voyage. The authors could have elaborated on the science of inertia or go into the details of the ships. It doesn't seem likely that humans could survive the current FTL voyages mentioned in the book without some assistance (inertial dampeners, stasis/life-support pods, etc.), and some clarity rather than machines bragging they are superior would make the universe more believable.Anyways, in addition to machines being dumb and using humans as slaves, this part never made quite much sense and wasn't clarified."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"This book is boring, lacks action, and is essentially a modern novel pretending to be sci-fi with too much time spent on male-female relationships. The book is also PC. That isn't surprising when almost all the names are female on the publishing/editorial team that worked on this book. I put this book down after reading half of it.If you are a male then go read a real sci-fi book that isn't going to bore you with almost all the lead male characters all falling in love with boring, plain-looking, and deformed female characters. The one hot female character is described as shallow, cold, and anti-male.The lead female scientist/engineer is female and the lead male one is a bad opportunistic guy and second rate to her.

I always loved that first book. I read his sequels, and although they just didn't seem to have the same power as the original, he was still a master storyteller and wordsmith.After a long hiatus from keeping up with the Dune universe, I came across this prequel trilogy while looking for new books to load into my recently-acquired Kindle. I thought: 'wonderful! Now I can see how the Dune universe came into being!'Uuuh... not so much.Rather than a skillfully crafted story peopled with characters you cared about, I instead got a major dose of drek.This is space opera, pure and simple, and not even very good space opera at that. I (stupidly) bought the whole trilogy, and actually had to force myself to read the ponderous thing to the end.The characters are two dimensional, the action is laughable, the plot is boring and only connected to the original story by the most tenuous threads. It's obvious that these books were produced to make money, and hey, they got mine.My advice is to save your bucks, and go get a copy of Dune, and maybe Children of Dune. These... these... THINGS are a huge disappointment."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Plenty has been written about how these prequel-sequel-interquel Dune books are not anywhere close to the quality of Frank Herbert's originals. But in fact, a lot of the plots are clever and imaginatively put together. Giving credit where credit is due, Herbert Jr. and Anderson have made an interesting stab at imagining the background and events of the Butlerian Jihad.What really sabotages these books are the mediocre writing and the lack of any of the compelling ideas that formed the basis for Frank H.'s classic works. The writing is really just a couple of cuts above hack level: overuse of trite similes and metaphors, fake-sounding dialogue, poor characterization, overuse of backstory, shallow ideas and thinking. The book is episodic in the worst way, jumping around from story line to story line in a confusing manner that loses the reader, sometimes with chapters that are only a couple of pages long. Worst of all, the sinister machines, Omnius and Erasmus, are not particularly sinister but in fact somewhat comical and clownish - not what one wants for a force that threatens the very existence of humanity. Their conversations are embarrassing. Herbert and Anderson simply lack the writing skills to create truly memorable and believable characters, whether human or machine, hero or villain.Frank Herbert's books were, fundamentally, books about ideas. Herbert Jr. & Anderson's books are run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi action books, dumbed-down Dune for a dumbed-down generation and culture. Certainly an entertaining read, but just don't expect much beyond entertainment."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"A quarter century after the events in Dune: The Butlerian Jihad, humanity is still at war with the thinking-machines. Serena has become the Priestess of the Jihad, a martyr like her murdered son \\"Manion the Innocent,\\" but the former Omnius-trustee Iblis Gibjo is behind the scenes, pulling her strings and gaining a stronger base for himself, the first Grand Patriarch of the League Worlds. And while Vorian and Xavier have gone on to become Primeros, fighting Omnius as best they know how, neither of them have completly forgotten their love for Serena and what the jihad actually means to them, while Norma Cenva quietly works on Portrin on a method of speeding spacetravel...This is a stunning improvement on the first book in the Legends of Dune prequel triology, a decades spanning tale of love, war, and the impossible hope of peace at any cost... As if The Bulterian Jihad was a high school drama, The Machine Crusade takes The Legends of Dune into higher education, still filled with the usual cliches, but in a much more involved and believable way. This being said, The Machine Crusade is still impossibly slow, if only slightly less predictable. For the sheer fact alone that I could not predict the final ending of the novel, I recomend reading the wikipedia synopis instead of bothering with the rest of it."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"This book confirms my problems with The Butlerian Jihad, the first book of this series of prequels. Frank Herbert did not envision a great battle against robot overlords.He envisioned a deeply religious war against people relying over much on computers fought by ordinary people against human elites (that's why, in a galaxy of exotic names, he chose \\"Butler\\" as the name for the jihad leader). Even if there were planets taken over by robots, the jihad the elder Herbert envisioned would never have allowed people to use robots to train swordmasters or to guide human ships as happens in this book.Frank Herbert likely would have used such plot points differently. There would be people secretly and illegally using computers believing that they could learn from their enemy and that the ends justify the means. They would have been discovered by the Jihad, and whether they continued to use machines or were killed for doing so, the results would have been ambiguous.The authors of this series don't have such a vision. But the Machine Crusade was still enjoyable space opera with some hints of Frank Herbert's universe. Knowing that we would never get the story the way Frank would have told it, it was still interesting to see the continued gelling of the various factions of the Dune world--Bene Gesserit, Tleilaxu, Guild, Fremen told on the background of an action-packed war against humans and machines, a story of political intrigue among humans, and the continued and humorous (partly unintentionally) story of the quirky robot Erasmus. We never know from one moment to the next whether a character we enjoy will live or die.Less interesting was the story of the swordmasters of Ginaz. Since these two authors focused on Ginaz swordmasters in their \\"House\\" books in a way Frank Herbert never did, I guess they were more interested in telling of their audience. The rest of us could have skipped the story.This book held my interest enough that I will buy the third one when it comes out in paperback, but not enough to rush out and by the hardcover."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"If you are following the series, then my all means pick up this book. Some of the threads were actually page turners; however, I felt the book could have used a wee bit of editing. Too many story lines evolved into extinction. One of the things that bothered me was the passage of time for the characters. At no point is there a time problem, everyone kind of experience the passage of time the same way, as if there was just one clock in the Dune universe. What troubled me was the cast characters were commuting light distances during the course of the novel, but everyone was aging together. The mode of transportation was conventional spaceships: spaceships capable of folding space are invented in the volume, and used restrictively. Will I buy the next book of this series? YES!"},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"This prequel of Dune books is the second of Jihad against Thinking Machine saga.

So, if you really liked the first book in the trilogy, you will love this book. However, if you did not like the first book, do not both to read on.I gave this book four stars (would prefer 3.5 stars but not an option) due to the following reasons:1) I really enjoy the Dune universe, so more content is a good thing.2) The characterizations of main characters are not particularly exciting or deep. They are mainly to advance the plot lines appropriately. It should be noted that this is basically a long history of the galaxy -- do not expect trendemous details on specific characters, just broad brush strokes. This is the weakest part of the book.3) The presentation of how religious franticism can be easily manipulated by political leaders for personal goals. I think it is an excellent warning to our society. Religious extremism coupled with instituational lack of accurate information and misinformation produces nearly unimaginable horrors. The violence committed in the name of \\"God\\" is unmatched by the sum of all other reason in human history.4) The Tlexians (sp?) are excellent villians. It is extremely unfortunately the Tlexians are not wiped out as soon as the truth about them is learned by the Laandsrad. This does not make much sense.The book covers quite a lot of content. So, it moves fairly quickly between plot lines. The Titans are interesting but I am not quite sure why they were even created for this trilogy. The Titans do not add much value in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Remains true to the style of the Dune saga, with meticulous detail and descriptions of even the most mundane activities.Some of the dialogue seems bloated and unnecessarily drawn out, not as &quot;tight&quot; as the three &quot;House&quot; prequels, but what can you do? For instance, they could have spent more time with the followers of Selim and less on Jool Noret, but I think they are trying to justify all the time spent on Ginaz in &quot;House Harkonnen&quot; and fill in some back story.I look forward to the next book, and hope they can keep it all up to the standards of the whole epic. I was leery of the whole idea of trying to follow up the original septology by Frank, but am a believer now."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I enjoyed this book every much it didn't have the slugish feel of the last book and th echarecters this time around actually developed.As the book opens several changes have occured from the last time we meet these charectersManion Butler has retired from the senate of the Leauge and left control in the hands of the power hunergy and manipulative Iblis Gingo.The Jihad has ground on for years with little headway and the common folk are growing restless and weary of a war that seems to have no end in sight.They would have given up long ago if not for the will of Xavier Harkonian and Vor Attriades. I particulary liked the interaction between these two charecters. It will be interesting to see just how the break between their families occurs.You all will be very surpised as to what eventually happens to Saliem Wormrider and Norma Chenva, my two favorite charecters.Overall-I loved this book as much as I hated the last one. If I can be convinced anyone can so I beg all of you to pick up this book.

I can only presume that this is nothing but a pathetically inept attempt to make money off the fine works of the father. I picked up this boook and its predecessor, The Butlerian Jihad, at an airport before a long international flight. I managed to struggle through the 1st book mainly on its single virtue of frequent references to the known (and beloved) themes of Dune (my reason for giving it 1 star). The writing is atrocious! I've seen better language control in 12 year olds. I gave up in disgust after getting halfway through the second book. I could literally feel my language skills deteriorating while reading this drivel. Once again, do yourself a favor and buy something else. If you HAVE to have some Dune, re-read the originals. Stay away from this garbage."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"It's not the plot lines or the scenes or the dialogues that I have trouble with - it's the depth of character and abbreviated format. If the chapters get any smaller we'll be having one / page soon.I think the real problem is that Herbert II tries to do too much in one book, spreads himself thin, and thereby hurts the overall work. This tale could potentially have had it all: Political intrigue (Serena &amp; Ginjo), Machine life, Norma (my fave!), the beginnings of the Guild, the Bene Geserit, the start of the mysterious bloodline, the rebirth of the human race, the Worm Rider, the Fremen, the Body Snatchers....in the end, it becomes a jumble despite the very sparse prose and strict structure.If the author was soliciting advice, I would tell him to reduced the number of characters, focus on fewer events and plunge deeper into the remaining narrative and characters. I truly wanted to enjoy this book but the &quot;awe&quot; and &quot;mystery&quot; one felt while engaged in the original series is missing. The &quot;House&quot; trio was - despite the paucity of plot and characters - actually better due to a concentrated focus. Here's hoping for the better results next time."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"As everyone knows by now, this isn't Dune. The first prequel wasn't nor will this one be. The problem isn't that this book doesn't match up well against Dune, it's that it doesn't match up well against its predecessor, the Butlerian Jihad, which itself was mostly solid rather than excellent. The Machine Crusade is a bit of a step backward for this series.As in Butlerian Jihad, characterization continues to be pretty shallow, with several characters once again making transitions of behavior that really haven't been earned by the story. And some characters are simply skimped on.The prequel problem of predictability due to simply filling in the design you're aiming at is more on display here than in book one, and while I can understand the need at some point for that last line (no spoilers here), making it the last line emphasizes the dangers in writing prequels--the sense your reader has that the story is being uncovered rather than growing.The plot remains the strong point, but here too it is weaker than the first book. Some of it is too contrived while some of it takes turns more for the plot's sake than for any natural development. And the structure, which remains cutting back and forth between multiple characters and plotlines, in this book does a disservice to several characters and storylines while in the first book it served to create tension and suspense. We leave one story and when we come back to it too much has happened in the meantime that would be better shown than told or simply assumed. And I have to confess that some of the plot I just didn't get the necessity of. Some sections reinforced ideas that were pretty clear already. Some were simply repetitive, both from this book and the previous one. And some simply dwelled on characters because it seemed the authors felt it was time to get back there for a while. I thought this book needed much more editing than the first. Not necessarily to cut the length so much as to redistribute it. There was a lot that could have been freely excised which in turn could have freed up some space to do some better characterization or more sophisticated plot development.Because of the weak characterization and the overweight plot, many of the set &quot;emotional&quot; scenes are anti-climatic and fall pretty lightly on the heart. Rather than bring a tear (ok, they probably weren't aiming at tears but at least some sadness) they mostly elicit a shrug of the shoulders or a &quot;yeah, that had to happen&quot; sort of feeling, as opposed to any sense of loss.Overall, this work suffers from a common middle book syndrome--it serves its purpose as a bridge to book three and that's about it. There is little spark here, just a lot of concrete. You'll have to read it to get to Book three I'm sure, but don't feel bad if you decide to skim a bit here and there."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"First, let's get the obvious out of the way; Dune: The Machine Crusade is another prequel to Dune and a sequel to The Butlerian Jihad. It has all the drawbacks and bonuses of a sequel; if you haven't read the first in this series of prequels devised by Frank Herbert's son Brian and Kevin J. Anderson, you may feel a little lost at first. The good news is that Herbert and Anderson manage to fill in the blanks early on with a nicely written recap in the prologue (much as the Frank Herbert did with each sequel to his classic Dune novel).I imagine that Herbert does much of the plotting based on Frank's original background notes and that Anderson does more of the hands on writing. At least it seems that way. In terms of style The Machine Crusades reminds me more of Anderson's novels than Brian Herbert's novels. But both had complimentary, similar styles so it's possible they rewrite each other.Either way, the plot continues. With the destruction of the Omnius on one of the settled worlds, humanity managed to strike a blow against the computer that created hope. The Cymeks led by Agamemnon struggle to regain their lost power against Omnius all the while fighting humanity as well. Time doesn't matter to Omnius or the Cymeks but it does to Serena Butler. Nearly a quarter century has passed since the computer's henchrobot murdered her son as part of an &quot;experiment&quot; to discover humanity's emotional movitation to fight even when they are clearly defeated. She and the others struggle on in battle against Omnius.Agamemnon's son Vorian Atriedes and Xavier Harkonnen continue their uneasy alliance in fighting Omnius. We also get our first glimpse of humanity's discover of &quot;folding&quot; space and the impact it will have. On Arrakis the Fremen come into their own as fierce fighters led by Selim Wormrider. We begin to understand how this distant, remote and poor dust speck in the cosmos comes to occupy center stage in Frank Herbert's original novel.This sprawling epic sets the stage for what's to come later in Herbert's original trilogy. Although it's uneven and the plotting is a bit more awkward here than in the some of the previous novels in this series, The Machine Crusade accomplishes most of its goal. It also sets up another potential sequel. To give Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson credit, the series they've created does credit to the original novel and Frank Herbert's memory. There are a number of interesting philosphical questions examined here. To the author's credit, they don't let the philosphical questions bog down the action. Both attributes contributes to the strengths and the flaws of the novel; the questions linger on too long and the battles are drawn out a bit too much. At times it seems as if the authors are struggling with the epic tale they are trying to tell; it's as if they are trying to come to grips with the size of the story they need to tell and control it. Even when it veers out of control, The Machine Crusade is still better than most of what passes for science fiction today.Nevertheless, like its immediate predecessor, The Machine Crusade has an epic, vast scale that the story and characters deserve. It's clear that Brian Herbert in continuing on his father's story chose to do so in a fashion that wouldn't just cash in on (and hence dilute)the original novels. Instead, he and co-author Anderson have tried to come up with a series of space operas as rich in character and scope as the original series. While the dialog can be frequently clunky and the characterizations a bit too sketchy for some, these are minor flaws on this large canvas. They boldly move forward using all the colors of language that they can to describe this epic tale. If words occasionally fail them, it's because the story, like much of Herbert's original epic, can be overwhelming in its vast embrace of science, religion and politics.If Brian Herbert and Anderson can continue to create novels this complex, the Dune series has a future as more than a cookie cutter space opera series. If they occasionally borrow from some of the sf films that have come out since Frank wrote the original novel, it's only fair; George Lucas and many other film directors borrowed liberally for Frank's imagination, integrating into their own projects and calling it their own."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Unfortunately Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson have taken the Dune series and turned them into pulp science fiction. There is the same heartless story telling and lack of depth that is endemic of science fiction lately. The authors go to great efforts to make the series an epic battle, a struggle between good and evil, etc. There are so many predictable turns of plot and story that I find myself rooting for computer overlords to win, if for nothing than to kill the more annoying human characters.After finishing the Machine Crusade, I pulled out my trusty Dune Encyclopedia and read about the Butlerian Jihad. I consider the encyclopedia to be somewhat authoritative on the series. ... I also looked at the lineages of Atreides and Harkonnen families. There is no corroboration with the stories that are told there.I would wait for the paperback, or borrow a copy from the library."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I can only recommend this book (or in fact the whole series of prequels) to die-hard Dune fans who don't want to miss anything.There are 3 major points that bother me:1) The machines (especially Omnius) are incredibly stupid. How is it possible that a machine manages to master language and logical thought, but yet not understand the concept of a lie? It is really not that hard. Look it up in a dictionary. The same goes for a number of other concepts Omnius finds difficult to understand (martyr, bluff, ...). Yet, Omnius has no problem in understanding concepts like suspicion, vindictiveness, revenge, ...2) The book is incredibly repetitive. Granted, I do not have the best of memories, but I do not have to be reminded every 20 pages that Iblis is charismatic, Vorian is impulsive and Xavier is straightlaced.3) The writing is pretty poor. Good writers make a person exhibit a character trait. Bad writers explain which character trait a person is exhibiting at the moment. For example, if Iblis is supposed to be charismatic, then make him charismatic. Don't write: \\"Using his charismatic personality Iblis did ...\\"There are a number of other things that bother me about the book, but these are the big three."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Most people who read these prequels are most likely acquainted with the original works of Dune by Brian's father Frank. And if you aren't yet familiar with the originals then I suggest you start your reading there where it was originally meant to be. As it is, the prequels--started with the three &quot;House&quot; books and later moving back 10,000 years to the Butlerian Jihad--are sad little shades of Frank Herbert's visions.As Dune fans know, the Machine Crusade is the second book of a trilogy about a war between people and machines. Cliche? Very! That is why Frank Herbert began his Dune novels 10,000 years afterwards, to show the ramifications of such a war. He moved past the cliche and developed a universe that existed without machines.Here in the Machine Crusade we see the same typical writing of Kevin J. Anderson, whose writing style has very little eloquence compared to Frank Herbert. Frank Herbert's originals are a grand mishmash of intricate plotting that combines many aspects of human society: politics, religion, philosophy, ecology and family interaction. His books were all internal; he created characters that you cared about, that took on a life of their own even when they had such minor parts in the storyline. All these points are lost in the Machine Crusade where Anderson is mostly concerned with the external conflict of the Butlerian Jihad. Think Star Wars or Terminator. Lots of fighting. Lots of dying. No plot except for yet more fighting.For anyone who has read the originals, you know that telling stories of battle was not Frank Herbert's purpose in these books. It was to tell chilling tales of of tragic characters whose every move impacted all of human society. The wars that took place in the original series rarely happened within the very pages of those books, but mostly happened between books or before the books. They were irrelevant except for the fact to know that they happened and people died. His purpose was to show the ramifications of those very wars.The book fails in many aspects. Primarily, the Machine Crusade reads like a history book. In many cases its chapters just sum up what one character is thinking when it might be best to provide some much needed dialogue to give it a sense of immediacy. It's such a shame, because many of the characters have such potential, yet there is so very little interaction between the numerous main characters that you just want to yell at the book and make it DO something besides blow up robots.I have very little doubt that if it wasn't for the name &quot;Dune&quot; attached to the prequels, these books would never sell. They are cliche, poorly written, have flimsy characters and numerous plotlines that rarely come together to form an ever greater story. The book's only redeeming quality is that it provides a curious glimpse at the history of the Dune universe, and that is all. Whereas the Dune originals can be reread over and over again for greater understanding and enjoyment, these books will probably gather dust or wind up on ebay."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"This series of Novels has really torn me up inside. I'm a fan of the entire Dune series, and I really enjoy the premise of these novels. I'm very interested in seeing where the story is going, and how the characters will develop. At the same time, these novels are an absolute chore to read. Some character/place descriptions are extremely, EXTREMELY repetitive. When I'm on the 400th page of a second novel in a series, I don't need to hear about how ironic it was that one of the characters couldn't get pregnant, even though her husband was a pharmaceutical whiz who made fertility enhancing drugs.

I also enjoyed the 'House' prequel trilogy. But, I have big issues with this second book of the 'Jihad' trilogy. It is quite obvious that the authors cobbled this together from bits and pieces that each had written. It is also quite evident that none of the authors, editors, etc. read this book in it's entirety. In the first 100 pages they bludgeon you with events from the first book. Yes many people might need to be reminded of what happened in the preceeding book, but we don't have to be told about the event three or four time with int three or four pages. This got so bad that I started to keep track of them. By the time I got to page 300 I stopped, there were just too many. Examples: On Pg 106 &amp; Pg 108 repeated references to Cogitor Eklo. We are constantly reminded why Iblis married Camie. I got that the first time. On page 310 &amp; 311 Vorian volunteered to do the foot work for Serena's new plans. It says 'Even before Xavier returned from Ix.' But in the previous chapter Xaview is sitting and the Jihad council table when Serena outlines her plans. I suggest that the authors pay more attention to what they're doing in the third book (which I intend to read) and the two post FH books there working on. The other book Dune books BH &amp; KJA have written have been much better than this. I agree with the comment about the 'Encycopeadia Dune', but I don't know the full detail of licensing, copyrights, etc. that may have nesseccitated changes.

This book insults most of its reader's intelligence (Assuming it's aimed at mature readers). I'm not too concerned with the destruction of mythical heroes like Holtzman...but if he must be slammed, he should at least be slammed masterfully and not be treated like a near brainless scientist with little passion for science. Just for the authours' sake, scientists do read DUNE and it just seems like an uninformed attempt at slaming a great inventor.Up till now, I'm still having trouble grasping the &quot;Brilliance&quot; of Iblis Ginjo, or his immense lack of scheme. He is the most unfantastic pseudo-villian I've ever read of. How he could have risen to such greatness is beyond me. (Unexplored and unexplained &quot;special charisma&quot; doesn't count.)To end it all, Hecate was introduced in a spectacular fashion with great potential for plot development, only to be killed off in what can be said to be a most idiotic freak accident involving two other heroes.

It had some definite potential, but the authors, with their usual short, choppy chapters, don't allow themselves the time to develop character and plot. There are several character aspects that deserved expansion: Jool Noret and the Mercenaries of Ginaz, Erasmus and his \\"child,\\" and the character of Selim Wormrider, which had definite moments of greatness, could have been a volume unto itself. This is the main problem with the whole book. There is a lot of material with great potential, but the authors don't take the time to develop it.To their credit, Herbert and Anderson did a good job with characters such as Serena Butler, Iblis Ginjo, Norma Cenva, Xavier Harkonnen, and Vorian Atriedes. They each have brief opportunities to shine, most of them changing drastically both mentally and physically between the first and last pages. There just wasn't enough of that. However, I have to say there were moments of great joy and sadness that really grabbed my attention.Again, this is not Dune, but give the novel a chance on its own merit.

First, some of the plotlines could have been done away with- Jool the Ginaz Mercenary comes to mind first. There was a lot of reading, with little payoff in the end. There were more, but time is short. In the end, I have come to the realization that I loved the original Dune series for a very different reason than I enjoy reading this new one- The original made me think, reread, and think some more. You'll never catch anyone doing that with the new series. It is, however, an easier, quicker read... Very entertaining to my Dune-starved mind. That may or may not be a good thing."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"The characters are boring and obvious, the storyline uninteresting and the depictions of violence and torture quite distasteful. I won't even bother to finish it."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Oh yes, the story is there, but o so tedious and repetitious.

Please Mister Anderson. please stop selling movie scripts as novells. This story is behond you."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"While I liked The Butlerian Jihad (I'd give it 3 stars) it was not without its flaws; stilted dialog and character development not withstanding, it was a fun read. The Machine Crusade is a major improvement; the writing style by both Brian Herbert and Anderson is more fluid and full, the characters are better fleshed out, and most story concepts/threads are better realized, some are surprising, and a few suspenseful (the Jihadis' desperate battle for Ix, for example).This installment comes a lot closer to Herbert Sr.'s work since it incorporates the political complexities that made those books great (and in all honesty had little room in the introduction that The Butlerian Jihad really was). This story is the true core of this trilogy and the elements we are familiar with from the Dune Chronicles are in much deeper transition; the Zensunni marauders of Arrakis are a lot closer in scope to their Fremen descendants than they were last time and Norma Cenva's space folding scheme stands on the verge of fruition. The chapters are still too short, but with as many threads as this book has, that brevity is almost necessary, and actually can encourage you to keep reading so you can get back to more interesting places/characters.If The Battle for Corrin can keep up the momentum BH and KJA made for themselves, then it's likely that their execution of Dune 7 will be successful."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I loved the Dune series and unlike some have thoroughly enjoyed most of the subsequent prequels. No, they do not have the magic and the depth and the awe of the original but then I did not think I was going to get the exact message.This book is not as bad as some have made out but it is nowhere near a 5 star category. If the story of Norma had taken more center stage I would have considered a 4 or even 5 star. But it was lost in the onslaught of the seemingly endless tales, and unlike the original series, these folks are not interesting enough to maintain your attention over the long haul. The book seems to continually be in a rush - the chapters have been reduced to chapterettes and despite the excessive length, a lot of what is said was not necessary in the first place.I, for one, am sickened and tired of all the torture. I have got into the habit of skipping those parts but had to reread the section on Norma in order to understand her transformation. Some of the characters were better left unintroduced - the good fighter (is he supposed to be the prototype for Duncan Idaho?), the brother-in-law of Serena, assorted friends and wives and lovers - too busy. Serena can whine all she wants - grow up!"},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Unfortunately the story dies first.Like father like son.I do not think so.I had a difficult time staying with this book and could not wait to finish it.The zenshiites and zensunni rhetoric ruined it for me.Perhaps my expectations are too high,for it would be difficult to match the classic novels from Frank Herbert.However,In saying all this i will still read the third novel in this series because im a geek!"},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"I am a big fan of Frank Herbert and his Dune series and was pleased to learn a few years ago of the efforts of his son, Brian Herbert, and Kevin J Anderson to flesh out much of the untapped material left by his death. I knew however I would have to take these books on their own merit.The Machine Crusade is one of those books. The second in the \\"Legends of Dune\\" series chronicling the great struggle in which humans throw off the bonds of slavery from their machine masters pics up twenty-four years after volujme one, The Butlerian Jihad, at a frightful pace. One which never slackens. Jumping from one important turn of event to another, sometimes without enough buildup, the parts of the book jump entire years at a time. But there is never a dull moment. Because of this all-ctionstyle it seems like we don't really get to see some of the characters as much as we would like. Zufa Cenva and her genius daughter, Norma are archetypal in the disapointed parent/dissapointing child roles. Even when things like this, which are reiterated time and again, are resolved it's a split moment of the book.I thought the Butlerian Jihad allowed us to roll with the tide of history, but The Machine Crusade pushes us ever faster. It's like the first book was a regular long-distance space ship and now the Machine Crusade has fold-space technology.I wished that the authors had teken the time to flesh out more characters and events as they had with the first one. I'm sure they could have gotten two novels out of the one if they had wanted to. But for pure adventure and getting a grasp on the history, instead of a glimpse as Frank Herbert had always given, this truly is truly worth reading."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Though some other reviewers appear to find the son lacking as he steps into his father's shoes, I disagree. I have found these five books interesting and engaging.Norma's transformation into a Sorceress of Rossak (pp415-421) was magnificent!I am looking forward to the next book and wonder if there might be a consideration for a book to follow CHAPTERHOUSE DUNE."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Having read the original Dune novels by Frank Herbert I delved into the the Machine Crusade hoping to find myself reinvigurated into the Dune universe, but was sorely disappointed. I will read the Battle of Corrin in order to bridge the overall historical gaps in foundations that set the scene up for the original Dune novel but will not read the House books. The writting in these books is very formulaic, and as others have pointed out the author is constantly reminding you about past events which are about 4 pages back in the scene. Also I found it irritating that the legendary vendetta between House Harkonnen and Atreides seems to have been downplayed greatly. It seems destined to be as random as Xaviers fate in the novel. Heres a genuine good character, so its hard to believe that the next novel will provide me with the sufficient reasons behind the legendary grudge between Houses, if anything this book makes me symphatetic to the Harkonnens... whats that all about? Also, other central characters in the novel seem to converge on coincidental ends which seem more like cop outs rather than climactic endings. I could have gained the same amount of detail and information of the events and characters with having read appendixes and timelines. Read the original 6 Dune novels, thats what I plan to do just to filter out this bad taste in the Dune universe. A for effort, C for substance."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Very disappointing. There are a few good parts of this story, but they are buried by sorrow about lost romance, uninteresting human relationships, and tales of Octa Butler's supreme meal planning ability for her husband Xavier. For example, \\"Octa did this as a gesture to him and her dead sister, serving the tasty meat glazed with a tart currant sauce (p 715).\\" In addition in the space of about 10 pages toward they kill off four of the most interesting characters that they spent the previous novel and most of this one building up in an outrageously unbelievable scenario. Fans of other Dune novels should consider this one an \\"abomination.\\""},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Unlike Herbert/Anderson's previous \\"Dune\\" trilogy, this time around the second book is not only as good as the first, it's quite a bit better. Sadly, the main problem from \\"the Butlerian Jihad\\" is held over: Herbert/Anderson BADLY need a competent editor. There are so many badly written sentences (and a few out-and-out grammatical errors) that it became distracting.Luckily, the plot is sufficiently good to keep me from being distracted for long. Once again, I can't honestly say that it meshes up perfectly with Frank Herbert's work, but on its own, this is a pretty gripping sci-fi epic, with memorable characters (I'm particularly fond of Erasmus, one of the better villains I've read in a while) and a satisfying ambition.Maybe future editions can clean up some of the sloppy prose and correct some of the errors. It's a shame for a fundamentally good work to be marred by material that is entirely fixable."},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"It reads like the bible for a soap opera; &quot;The Machines of Our Lives&quot;. Every chapter seems to be written as if it has a three page limit which hashes out only the minutest description of the characters as well as the storyline. Much like the previous Anderson/Herbert ventures it lacks any type of great story telling and pales in comparison to the original books from where it gets its name.Why then did I finish this book in three days?Unlike the other books, the paired down outline approach to story telling seems to convey a simplistic charm that truly works. Maybe my expectations have been warn down by one disastrous &Ograve;prequel&Oacute; after another, but I cant say that the Anderson/Herbert duo didnt give me something that I liked. In some respects the books flows like fast food, and I devoured every page as such. Yeah in the end I felt bloated and knew the story would leave my mind about as quickly as it entered, but so what. It was fun.What &Ograve;Hernderson&Oacute; (Herbert/Anderson) did finally learn in this outing was how to present cool characters in enough wacky situations to keep me reading. Whether this should be called a true &Ograve;Dune&Oacute; book or not Im not to say, but at least I got to read a few pages about a character every now and again that I liked (or disliked in a good way). Dont get your hopes up about any realistic characters though. Like in the other books the dialogue is still about at the level of a bad student film and there is no real story, just one big lumberous plot with enough interesting events to make those of us with nothing better to do plod along with eager anticipation.It is unequivocal that the authors take themselves and this &Ograve;story&Oacute; too seriously considering the atrocious amount of blithe undeveloped plots and subplots designed to set up something that eventually leads us nowhere other then to tie up a loose end (i.e., the entire needless Hectate subplot). The books also seems to think that it has a surprise &Ograve;twist&Oacute; at the end, but narratively it fizzles out long before its eaten up by a sun (no Im not spoiling anything). To be honest I was more shocked at the audacity of the authors attempt at selling this as an ending of any kind then caught up in the turmoil of the narrative.Unlike my reaction to the other books though, I enjoyed the pomp of it all. I even relished in it. It seems to me that if ever anybody was going to put &Ograve;Rocky Horror&Oacute; into a book form, it would seem that these two would be perfect for it. Not because of their comic timing, or their subversive storytelling, but rather because I think that theyd take it seriously&Eacute; and thats what would make it so darn fun to read!AD"},{"Title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"The Legends of Dune trilogy is absolutely a great trilogy. I found it a little faster read than the original series, but this series still has its twists and provokes deep thinking as much as its founding series. The authors do an astounding job in showing the basis and beginnings of virtually everything in the original Dune series; from the founding of the Guild and the Sisterhood to the significance of the Atreides' hawk.

I believedthey had set the stage very nicely for the inevitable Atreides/Harkonnen schism,in &quot;Butlerian Jihad&quot; but this book added yet another twist as to what must happenin the Corrin Battle.

THE MACHINE CRUSADE has so many storylines it's difficult to pick which one is best, but they are all engrossing and entertaining.

The science is not bad either. I was riveted to my Kindle every day when commuting until finished. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Like Shevek himself, this book has a quiet, intelligent stoicism about it, and yet burns with the hot, subversive passion of revolution at its core. This is a book of ideas, and the \\"action\\" of this novel revolves around the creation and development of these ideas, rather than around specific \\"events\\" per se. Indeed, moments of \\"action\\", such as the military firing into a massive, unarmed insurrectionary crowd, barely seems to raise Shevek's (and by extension, as the lens through which we see this world, our) pulse rate. Instead, it is the subtler moments of dispossession, possession, being outcast, returning home where the emotion and the passion swell. The narrative structure is quite fascinating and effective, as chapters in Shevek's \\"real time\\" alternate with Shevek's past; however, true to the ideas of time in the book, these distinct pieces combine to form an inseparable whole. More broadly, they serve to show the seductive promise of the worlds of Urras and Anarres, and then the deep flaws of each, ending on a ambiguous note that is ultimately satisfying, for this is a book that asks more questions than it answers. What makes these two worlds, and indeed this whole story, timeless is the fact that although this book was written during the Cold War, it would be more fair to say that Urras and Anarres represent stylized manifestations of capitalism and communism, respectively rather than more straight-forward metaphors for the U.S. and Soviet Union (which would've made this story feel somewhat dated). Indeed, despite the end of the Cold War, reading this book at a time when the frailty of both capitalism and democracy in the developed world are on display makes for an interesting and contemplative experience.It is important to note, however, that this story is much more complex than a simple ideological battle between two worldviews. For, while Le Guin seems to favor the Odonian vision of Anarres over the nations of Urras, both societies are critically flawed. Urras is seen as a hell by Shevek, who abhors the greed, exploitation, dishonesty, and selfish ambition he sees there. Yet, Anarres in many ways, is just as or more flawed; pressures to conform to societal norms and expectations, informal bureaucracies just as autocratic as authoritarian states, and a xenophobic fear and rejection of Other create a repression of the mind and of creativity almost as stifling as the more overtly oppressive states on Urras. Some see the introduction of Terran and Hainish actors toward the end as a bit of a deus ex machina, and it is to some degree from the perspective of the *action* in the plot; but from the all-important perspective of the *ideas* of the novel, they provide an interesting and important counterbalance to Shevek's perspective on the two worlds, and importantly provide the possibility at the end of a way forward, and a new, more wide-spread revolution and evolution of ideas.This is a complicated, subtle novel; but the beauty of it is that its essence is captured entirely in the first two paragraphs. This is a novel about a wall and all it implies. Insider versus outcast. Belonging versus exclusion. Laughably trivial and yet the most important thing in the universe. Humanly-devised, given meaning only through the social constructions of the collective. Viewed, in our case, from the dispossessed traveler who journeys forth but always returns. A joy to read, and even more so to contemplate; a timeless classic of science fiction as powerful today as when it was first written."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Ursula K. Le Guin's classic 1974 novel The Dispossessed is brought wonderfully to audio courtesy a Harper Audio production of an excellent Don Leslie narration. Winner of both the Hugo and Nebula awards, it is also (and much less impressively, I might add!) my pick for the best new science fiction and fantasy audiobook published at Audible.com in September 2010. The publisher's summary is brief: \\"Shevek, a brilliant physicist, decides to take action. He will seek answers, question the unquestionable, and attempt to tear down the walls of hatred that have isolated his planet of anarchists from the rest of the civilized universe. To do this dangerous task will mean giving up his family and possibly his life. Shevek must make the unprecedented journey to the utopian mother planet, Anarres, to challenge the complex structures of life and living, and ignite the fires of change.\\" Here, there is simply too much to say, and so I will play a bit of the coward and not say much at all, other than: Le Guin's Anarres is the definitive rendering of anarchism in fiction, and this is an unforgettable novel, and a masterful narration."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Along with everything else which has been said about this wonderful book, I am convinced this is where the fashions of the Centauri on the television series \\"Babylon 5\\" must have originated.

I highly recommend this book, but get one from a different publisher."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Clearly written as an allegory for the cold war, the dispossessed still resonates. Money and possessions still function as prisons, keeping people apart for fear of loss. We could stand to be more like Anarres, treating others like brothers instead of strangers.With a lack of action and the usual pulp-sci-fi tripes, I think this one might bore a lot of contemporary readers, particularly those that don't have a strong understanding of the Cold War dynamic around which it was based.For those who like a little philosophy in their sci-fi, however, this is a classic work that deserves some attention somewhere down your list of things to read."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"One man's initiative combined with his abstract intellectual brilliance disturbs the political stasis in two planets and may be a seed of change even beyond. The book sensitively explores the social organisation and personal experience of the anarcho-communist world in which Shevek lives. He gradually realises that the price of freedom is eternal \\"initiative\\" - opposing the 'vigilance' of those who protect the status quo. His power to influence events comes from the value of his work in theoretical science. All worlds share a quasi-religious belief that theory is the first step to technology and thus to power.The strength of the book is the complex and convincing shades of grey in which both characters and social systems are portrayed. There are no easy solutions and even the motivation of villains is complex.A enthralling and satisfying philosophy text presented through fiction."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"In this science fiction classic a planet, Urras, and its colonized moon, Annares, have a unique relationship. Urras is made up of archistic states, whether they are socialist, capitalist, theocratic, etc. while the moon is populated by anarchists due to a quirk in history. There is little contact between the world and little trust between them. The story revolves around the life of Sevek, a physisist from Annares, who over the length of his life begins to formulate a theory of how to travel faster than the speed of light. The problem is that Annares seemingly has no use for his theory and he must deal with Urras in order to go forward.An interesting fable, it is fascinating for its approach to how a world with nor rules would function. Graphic and scatological at times, it is a great book, one I have read several times. Oh, and the maps are very helpful."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This book is a classic work of science-fiction.

Le Guin's \\"The Dispossessed,\\" is compellingly written, sophisticated in its presentation of theoretical physics, and devastating in its profound critique of capitalist culture and social structure. But the novel also addresses the potential shortcomings of an anarchist alternative that can all too easily fall victim to the tyranny of the majority. Written as science fiction and taking place in the distant future, the narrative nevertheless has a great deal of contemporary relevance. It is told from the point of view of a theoretical physicist, with the creative ability and intellect of an Einstein, who has grown to adulthood on a planet with a well-established anarchist culture. Being a committed anarchist, he seeks to defend and expand the values of personal freedom and responsibility. The anarchist society in which he lives espouses such values, but falls far short of living up to them in practice. The capitalist alternative, embodied in a society located on a different planet, is controlled by an elite driven by greed and power. This exploitative society is perceived as largely barbarous by the physicist, who is portrayed as a person with an enlarged sense of humanity. Le Guin succeeds admirably in presenting these societal critiques without being doctrinaire. She is not only an imaginative and fine spinner of tales with an anthropologist's eye for concrete detail and cultural patterns, but has a refined grasp of political theory. The dilemma posed by the novel is whether one extraordinary and courageous man with the help of like-minded others can overcome the shortcomings of both societies and make a lasting contribution that enhances peace and freedom throughout the cosmos. This is a must read for all those interested in the political and economic contradictions of our own time."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I read The Dispossessed back in college and have re-read it many times and remain spellbound and captivated by Le Guin's storytelling. Arguably her finest work, its tale of a desert-like Socialist-style communal world contrasted against its parent planet of rich resources and warring nations remains as relevant today as it did when published nearly four decades ago. An absolute must-have on any science-fiction reader's shelf -- but also required reading for any student of history, culture or society. Works of such insight, beauty, and intelligence are rare gems, and the genre is blessed to count this one among its number."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I was so excited to read a book dedicated to the principles of anarchism! Where better than sci-fi to explore an anarchist society with a long history and highly articulated ideas. Who better than a highly accomplished writer such as Le Guin to tackle the endeavor? By Odo, was I disappointed.Le Guin's \\"Dispossessed,\\" while generous in its drawing out of anarchist ideas and events, left me bored out of my wits. The plot is thinner than cardboard, the characters are unmoving, and I could find little reason to turn the pages. But turn them I did. I was carried through to the end on the vapors of anarchist imaginings. But I ran out of gas far before I reached the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"There are anarchic tribes on earth &amp; there have been socialist anarchist societies who ran communities in history. You're better off to read about them. I did like the ambiguousness because it made my belief that the capitalist &quot;dystopia&quot; was better off then the anarchic &quot;utopia&quot; seem like a valid interpretation. It was also nice to see what someone from an anarchy would be like, since historically speaking I can't think of a working libertarian anarchy. I sort of liked left hand of darkness, but I think UKLG writes some of the most intelligent, but least enjoyable science fiction out there. Don't misunderstand me I do like intelligent stuff like Of Mice &amp; Men, Canticle for leibowitz, The divine comedy, don quixote, etc. I just say that so you won't offhandily disregard this."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Required reading for my son's college course.

I didn't like it, though. It is ambiguous in message and cerebral to the point of being annoying. It is a perfect example of 'soft' science fiction, written for the folks who prefer anthropology over physics. The funny thing is, I can't understand why it was in the libertarian Prometheus' Award Hall of Fame, next to 'The Moon is a Harsh Mistress' by Heinlein and 'Atlas Shrugged' by Rand, since it is completely different from the other winners. If it's given to you, though, it is worth a read, I guess."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"There are 2 Ursula Le Guins: The one that wrote the Earthsea series, and the one that writes really preachy sci fi novels. Basically, if you like 'Left Hand of Darkness' (and many do, for some reason), you will like this novel. They have a very similar premise: One man, alone on a new planet, with new ideals, forced to live between 2 sets of incompatible countries. I don't understand how Le Guin can write such a masterpiece of fantasy literature (Earthsea) with action, and depth, and such an amazing plot, and then also, churn out this sci fi philosophical trash. I know she is trying to be like Heinlein, who is also very libertarian and preachy. But, Heinlein, on the other hand, is a good story teller and drives his novels through action and clever dialogue with many twists and turns and usually a very cool unexpected ending. Le Guin's novels have NONE of that. Just like there is a huge difference between Science Fiction and Future Fantasy, I will say that there is a big difference between Future Fantasy and Future Philosophy, because that's what I believe Le Guin's sci fi novels are. They are her attempt to sell her libertarian anarcho syndicalism by placing it in a futuristic setting between 2 extreme forms of government; a plutocracy (capitalist dictatorship) and a communist dictatorship. Le Guin never attempts to compare her utopian society to a democratic socialism or democratic capitalism, at least, not to my way of thinking. I have had to scratch and claw my way through 2 Le Guin sci fi novels now, and I will not be planning on trying another."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I really appreciate amazon.com for being punctual. this is one of the very few websites on which i fully rely. amazon.com is undoubtedly number one when it comes to online shopping. i strognly recommend you use it!"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I could not finish reading this story.

Although I stuck with it on a second read because I didn't have anything better (and needed to justify the $8.00 I spent), I really should have spent my time doing something more enjoyable.Others have recapitulated the plot, so I won't bore you with another summary. If you love philosophical books on political systems, then you'll love this book. I don't, and thus didn't."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"\\"The Dispossessed\\" is a utopian/dystopian novel along the lines of \\"Brave New World\\" or \\"The Handmaid's Tale.\\" Although Le Guin creates an atmosphere of tension, there's not a lot of action (at least for the first three quarters of the book)--so readers expecting more \\"traditional\\" science fiction or surprising plot twists will certainly be dissatisfied. This unashamedly political novel portrays one character torn between two worlds with disparate political and economic systems, and it focuses on the highlights and the inadequacies of both those worlds.Shevek, an unappreciated scientist from Anarres, travels to Urras, whose inhabitants seem to value better his discoveries in physics. Annares, the home of the \\"Dispossessed,\\" is a 175-year-old rebel outpost of anarchists who have established \\"an experiment in nonauthoritarian communism\\" that emphasizes community and cooperation and who must make the most of the limited resources on their desert planet to avert the constant threat of starvation. Anarres's mother planet, Urras, boasts a triumvirate of strong and repressive governments, the most important of which is the capitalist government of A-Io with its impressive wealth, cultural accomplishments, and scientific achievements.But all is not what it seems on either world. Le Guin alternates chapters detailing Shevek's early years of disenchantment on his lawless but peaceful native planet with chapters describing his growing realization that Urras has a significant \\"dispossessed\\" population as well. The novel is, of course, deeply informed by the Cold War--it was published in 1974--and each world features its own \\"ambiguous utopia\\" (the book's subtitle). The anarchists of Anarres have diluted their revolutionary vision with mindless and dogmatic conformism, discouragement of artistic pursuits and dissenting ideas, and an entrenched and uncaring bureaucracy that acts like a government in all but name. The capitalists of Urras, meanwhile, have traded libertarianism and meritocracy for a repressive oligarchy and the armed reinforcement of widespread economic disparities. As the novel progresses, Shevek appreciates that there is much to be learned from both (or rather, all) worlds.Some readers and critics have suggested that Le Guin is \\"promoting\\" anarchism/communism; this is too simplistic, since the book is far too subtle and tentative to work as propaganda. Instead, she posits an attractive and idealistic society, contrasts it with a world with an appealing facade and an unattractive underclass, and shows how human nature tends to corrupt even the most well-meaning of civilizations. A book of ideas rather than of advocacy, \\"The Dispossessed\\" challenges readers to envision humankind's limitless possibilities."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"A group of revolutionaries settles the dry desert moon of a rich, Earthlike planet. Their founding philosophy is based on the writings of Odo, a woman who never sees the moon colony created on her ideas, which are based loosely on pure Communism. Odonianism tries to change human nature, by inculcating the principle of sharing and non-possesiveness, with the interesting twist of removing the possessive word &quot;mine, ours&quot; from language and substituting &quot;the one I use.&quot; The Odonians create a somewhat impoverished but vigorous society on the moon Anarres and for two centuries have been isolated from their Urras roots except for trade contact at the spaceport. In fact, Anarres is a mining colony for Urras and is left alone as long as valuable minerals are shipped back to the mother planet.The Anarresti use a language created by a computer and using their philosophical beliefs. People when born are given a two syllable name from the computer. The society is free, all sexual activity is allowed as long as the partners agree. Marriage is not uncommon, but not the norm either. Children are raised communally, a bit like the first kibbutzim in Israel. Work is assigned from a labor pool with a computerized system of allocating assignments wherever they are needed. But anyone can choose any occupation that suits them, and is free to refuse a posting, or even work at all. Once in every ten days, an Anarresti participates in volunteer labor that's needed by the community. Only a sense of responsibility, taught from birth, a conscience, keeps everyone working for everyone else and free from &quot;propertarianism&quot; or the desire to accumulate possessions and wealth. People are free to move around, choose their work, choose partners and do what they want as long as it doesn't hurt others.This Utopia has seeds of destruction, however. Individuals are quashed by &quot;syndicates&quot; or groups controlling various occupations. New ideas are &quot;egoistic&quot; and suppressed. The main character in The Dispossessed, a brilliant physicist named Shevek, has suffered this isolation and discouragement from childhood on. His brilliance is fostered however, by two special teachers, one of whom is another such isolated and unappreciated brilliant mind. When he goes to Abbenay, the capital, to work at the central institute, he becomes aware of the jealousy, conservatism and backbiting that are undermining their utopia. He also embarks on a major discovery in physics, that is rejected by the institute, but greatly coveted by the physicists and industrialists on Urras. He's invited to finish his work on Urras and to accept a prize equivalent to a Nobel. No one from Anarres has gone to Urras in two centuries and a conflict of huge proportions erupts, against the backdrop of a heartbreaking drought and famine on Anarres.How the conflict is ultimately solved, and how the Utopia is forever changed makes for some exciting reading. The book is a good examination of the question whether it is possible to set up a completely unselfish society and what the eventual outcome might be based on human nature. This is one of Le Guin's best books, and written in spare, beautiful language that describes the people, the landscape and the drama in a most memorable way."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Quick -- name three SF literary portraits of functional societies founded on principles of anarchism.I come up with Eric Frank Russell's Gands in _The Great Explosion_ (&quot; . . . And Then There Were None&quot;), Robert A. Heinlein's Loonies in _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_, and Ursula K. Le Guin's Anarresti in _The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia_.Oh, there are a handful of others, notably James Hogan's _Voyage from Yesteryear_ (which was itself strongly influenced by Russell). But most of the rest are thinly disguised libertarian propaganda without a great deal of literary merit (though your mileage may vary).Of these three, Le Guin's is in some ways the most compelling. In part that's because she's just such a fine writer. But it's also because she's probably the _least_ &quot;ideological&quot; of all the SF writers who have ever tackled this subject.On Le Guin's somewhat Taoistic approach, each of the contrasting societies contains the seeds of the other, and she lets the reader see both their &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; points. She clearly likes the Anarresti society (and on the whole it comes off rather better than its Urrasti foil). But she doesn't hesitate to show the reader some of its critically important drawbacks. Its childrearing practices, for example, recall Ira Levin's _This Perfect Day_, and its treatment of original thinkers (and their &quot;egoizing&quot;) even recalls Ayn Rand's tub-thumpingly propagandistic _Anthem_.In general, then, Le Guin is pretty well immune to the usual salvation-by-ideology claptrap. And as her subtitle suggests, her utopia really _is_ ambiguous. For her, people aren't &quot;saved&quot; by adopting the correct philosophical position or social principles.Least of all is her protagonist Shevek &quot;saved&quot; by such means. Shevek is a physicist from Anarres (the moon of the planet Urras) and has grown up in its anarchist society. But it doesn't really have a place for him. Neither, more obviously, does Urras, the &quot;propertarian&quot; counterpart to Annares's communitarian society, with which Annares has had no contact for about a century and a half. So with respect to the two polar-opposite patterns of social organization, Shevek is doubly dispossessed.What's the book actually _about_? Well, Shevek cooks up a plan to get the two societies on speaking terms again and, in order to pursue it, decides to leave Anarres for Urras; so off he goes, as a passenger in a ship called the _Mindful_. (And yes, do be careful not to trip over the symbolism.) That's all I'm going to tell you about the plot. But the essential theme of the novel is, I suppose, barriers and their overcoming. (The very first sentence goes like this: &quot;There was a wall.&quot; Yep.)It's a very thoughtful novel. The narrative hops around in time a lot and the plot isn't exactly marked by nonstop action, so it's probably not for space opera fans. But readers of a more philosophical bent will enjoy it immensely.And if you're at all interested in literary portraits of anarchist societies, make sure you read this one. If you share Le Guin's Taostic/anarchistic leanings (as I do), you'll like the Anarresti _and_ appreciate Le Guin's refreshingly anti-ideologue-ish honesty in her portrait of it."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This novel won the 1974 Nebula Award and the 1975 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel of the year as well as the 1975 Jupiter Award. It is centered about a complex society that is founded upon anarchism: an ordered society without laws. The &quot;dispossessed&quot; in the novel are the millions of the inhabitants of Anarres, an arid moon of the lush planet of Urras. Two centuries earlier, the followers of an anarchist philosopher had fled Urras to forge a new society, a society that has done away with the concept of &quot;possession.&quot; There is no property on Anarres, no money, no marriage (I hope that Le Guin is not meaning to suggest that marriage is a possession by one or other of the participants), no government, no laws, no prisons. Even the language reflects this attitude. Possessive pronouns are even avoided. Instead of saying &quot;My hand hurts,&quot; one would say &quot;The hand hurts me.&quot; A mathematical genius of Anarres, who has made a conceptual breakthrough that allows for the development of the ansible (an instantaneous communication device that other science fiction authors will begin to use), travels to Urras. He had been having difficulties with the philosophical ideas of his home world but the social structure of Urras baffles him. The cultures of both world cause problems for the protagonist Shevik. This is one of the best science fiction novels of all time. However, I'm surprised at some of the comments by earlier reviewers. It appears that some reviewers are really offended at more cerebral type of novels. I gave this book five stars. And, I also gave &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; five stars. Both books have their place within the genre. Perhaps we should be not so narrow in our tastes so that we exclude valuable works. Both of these novels should be read by any serious student of science fiction literature."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Whether or not THE DISPOSSESED passes as good sci-fi, I know not. I am not very knowledgeable of what SF fans look for in a book.

The questions Le Guin grapples with here are by no means simple. Even great philosophers, like Marx and Bakunin, had difficultly imagining what an ACTUAL society would look like without bosses and owners. But through the gripping tale of an anarchist caught between two fundamentally different worlds, Le Guin seeks answers to many of the questions these philosophers left untouched. How would an anarchist society function? What would it take as its fundamental principles? What problems would that society have? What would a &quot;propertarian&quot; capitalist society appear from the perspective of an anarchist? Without offering any quick or final answers, Le Guin sheds light on these issues and beckons the reader to imagine the possibility of another world.

Beyond Le Guin's compelling storyline, masterful character development, and brilliantly constructed setting (all of which can be found in any of her other books), The Dispossessed is a social commentary the likes of which I had never experienced before.Most people, I am sure, hear the word &quot;anarchy,&quot; and it brings to mind images of smelly punk-rock kids throwing rocks and trashing cars (direct action!) However, the layperson generally cannot see beyone the premise of &quot;no government = chaos.&quot; Le Guin tears down the philosophical walls and false presuppositions and proposes a world based on true libertarian socialist ideals: Anarchy. These people are not terrorists, but hard working, sincere individuals, possessed with all the faults that we have always had. It adresses the problems that could arise in an anarchist community plagued by extreme scarcity, but its message triumph over tribulation rings true.It is this book which radically changed my political philosophies, and if is powerful and beautiful enough a piece of literature that it can do the same for all who read it."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Do books really change people's lives? I've read this book many times over the last decade or so, and it never stops speaking to something deep inside me (and my wife, who I knew I had to marry when she said this was her favorite book).

And there's no Ursula book like The Dispossesed. If you haven't read it by the year 2001, you kind of missed the boat on 20th century literature.

The Dispossessed is a startlingly ambitious and perfect novel. On its face, the novel is about a physicist from a world of self-exiled anarchists (Anarres) who decides to travel to the \\"propertarian\\" (capitalistic) mother planet (Urras), both to complete his life's work of reconciling two contradictory theories of physics (Sequency and Simultaneity) and to tear down the walls between his society and the Urrasti world left behind.One of LeGuin's remarkable achievements is her conception of an anarchistic society, something that has never existed in history. LeGuin fleshes out a world of 20 million anarchists, explaining how the people of such a society might live and love, how such a large community could function without a government. But this novel is so much more than a writer's imagining of functional anarchism. This novel is not really about politics, it is about love and the nature of human interaction.The life work of the protagonist is to reconcile Sequency -- time as linear, history as progress -- with Simultaneity -- time as instaneous, history as cyclical. Similarly, Shevek tries to reconcile his society of Anarres, where there is no government oppression or inequality but also where individuality is stifled and creativity devalued, with Urras, where there is unjust distribution of power and wealth but also great beauty and achievement. LeGuin tells Shevek's tale in two different time arcs, a linear progression through Shevek's journey to Urras and the events there, and a looping back through Shevek's life from infancy to reach the beginning of Shevek's journey at the end of the novel. LeGuin writes the novel in two chronologies as if to highlight Shevek's struggle with reconciling the two theories of Time. This literary device works brilliantly, as the reader rushes through the novel not only to find out what happens to Shevek while in Urras but also to find out why Shevek chose to leave Anarres for the journey.Underneath it all, LeGuin is not just trying to reconcile competing conceptualizations of time, or to decide what is the best way for people to govern themselves, but rather to harmonize the contradictions that exist within human nature. We are all \\"propertarians,\\" as LeGuin demonstrates simply and beautifully early in the novel with a heartbreaking passage in which Shevek as a toddler is enjoying warmth and sunlight flowing through an open window, trying to \\"possess\\" the sunlight, only to have a larger boy shove him aside. We are all anarchists as well, disregarding government mandates for the sake of personal choices. Humans are both greedy and altruistic, inclined both to take and to help, to hate and to love. LeGuin settles on love as the human constant, the key variable in the equation of human interaction, but does not presume to define love, only describe aspects of it. LeGuin shows us that trying to understand human nature, and reconcile its contradictions, is easily as difficult as trying to construct fundamental principles of the physical Universe and reconciling the conflicts in our perceptions of reality. Following Shevek as he finds his own answers to both is a rewarding journey. This is a great novel."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I read this book about 10 years ago and it still echoes in my mind as far and away the best science fiction novel I have ever read simply because it avoids problems found in most SF--poor characterization and over-reliance on techno-babble. It amazes me that this classic has not been made into a movie yet, but it would lend itself much better to the screen than, say, &quot;Dune.&quot; This book squarely faces the central dilemma of a materialistic society--that by its very nature encourages possessive (hence the title) desires, both sexual and otherwise, that lead inevitably to spiritual dissolution and unhappiness. And as far as LeGuin's prose goes, there are sentences here that I will never forget. The last line is surely one of the most memorable in American literature."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I read this book years ago and have re-read it many times. It and Left Hand of Darkness are my favorite novels by LeGuin. Both books start with a what-if premise. In Lefthand of Darkness the premise is what if there is no separation of the sexes. In The Disposessed the premise is what if there were a truly communistic society. What would it be like? How would it compare or hold up to a capitalist society? What impact would it have on the people that live in that society? She explores these questions through the life of the main character, Shevak. Shevak is a brillant physicist (akin to Einstein) who grows up on the communistic moon of Annares and later travels to the capitalistic parent world of Urras. Although LeGuin obviously favors the commmunistic world of Annares, she does not hesitate to fully explore its weaknesses. She also shows how difficult it is for a truly visionary human such as Shevak to live comfortably in either world. I found The Dispossessed to not only be a thoughtful examination of a philosophical premise but to also be a beautifully written novel and a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This book ranks high in my top ten list, and actually well above the Left Hand of Darkness. It's characters are complex and interesting and the political commentary is insightful. It's clear Le Guin has leftist leanings (as do I, which might bias my opinion) but she shows the darker sides of both capitalism and communitarianism. I believe that this book encompasses the better part of Le Guin's worldview, including her views on government, feminism, relationships, technology, and human nature. Readers who are strongly attached to capitalism and consumption may misunderstand Le Guin's portrayal of Urras, but everyone else should find some familiar elements in world where everything is for sale, scientific research is driven by profit, and sex is used to sell everything but love. These same readers will also be touched by Le Guin's careful rendering of the communitarian Annares, and will appreciate her honesty in dealing with the possible problems of this society (namely, forced regression to the mean, a tendency toward commitment to society over the individual in times of crises, and a strong current of xenophobia)."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I rate this book up there with the Dune series by Frank Herbert. The only Ursula LeGuin novel that ever held my attention for more than a few pages. Her insights on social interaction within and between cultures are somewhat profound.

Have we not all eaten while others have starved? Will you punish us for that crime? Have we not each of us starved while others ate? Will you reward us for that virtue? Free your mind of the idea of deserving and then you will begin to think.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"The Dispossessed is one of my favourite books - one that almost always gets re-read when I pick it up just by accident. Ursula K. Leguin does construct a world for utopians; but this world is not really a conventional utopia. Our united suffering is one of the key themes, and while the book is often explaned in terms of its idealology, it shines in its personal relationships. I love Shevek, I love Shevek and Takver together, I love Dap with Shevek's younger daughter. Ursula K. Leguin can explore difficult ideas with a flowing style that never makes you think you are being preached or pandered to."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I recommend \\"The Dispossessed\\" because it is a good example of how to write a philosophical novel. The story deals with the planet Urras, a modernist technological society, and the moon Annares, an anarchist Utopia populated by outcasts who fled Urras many generations ago. The plot in this book is really secondary. The purpose of \\"The Dispossessed\\" is to analyze both of these societies and to point out their strengths and their flaws. While I don't agree with everything that LeGuin says about community life on Annares, I do believe that she does a good job of displaying what life under such a system would be like. Despite being relatively short, this book covers a lot of ground, including religion, economy, sexuality, family life, and art.With that said, I must confess a little bit of disappointment with the writing of \\"The Dispossessed\\". Having read the Earthsea Saga and \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\", I know that LeGuin can do better. In particular, this book lacks any of the great descriptive passages found in her other works. A few good word pictures of the unforgiving landscape on Annares would have gone a long way towards making the book more intensely realistic. Some of the dialogue also falls a little bit short. Still, I view the book overall as being quite impressive, and a must-read for science fiction fans who like to think."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"There is no better work of fiction that describes what a society based on true anarchy might be like. You soon see that it certainly would not be chaos. That is because a society without leaders and laws is not a society without order- it is just that the order comes from within. That is true order. People work and sacrifice because they recognize that it is in everybody's best interest. Society should be brotherhood of equals, a big family. In a sense, the world of Anarres reminded me of one great farm where family members realize from an early age that they are needed for work that must be done. Either that, or I would describe it as an old-style kibbutz on a planetary scale. It isn't a perfect system. Vigilance is needed to make sure that unofficial tyranny from peer pressure and individual corruption do not set in, but it comes across as workable and believable.As for her sister world, Urras, it is a place of both the plutocratic-oligarchic state, as well as, the centralized communist dictatorship, locked in perpetual struggle. It is a world where men are forced and coerced to obey their leaders. It is our world. Urras is archism, Anarres is anarchism. You are forced to examine first hand the fundamental differences. It is the difference between a society of true individuals and a society of slaves.The hero, Shevek, is both a physicist and a philosopher. His was a mind capable of reconciling not only the seeming incompatibility of the simultaneous and sequential nature of time, but also of the conflicting drives of human nature. Both required the freedom of mind of a true revolutionary.I first read this novel over 25 years ago. It came as a shock to me to realize how much I must have internalized the character of Shevek."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"As someone who grew up on Asimov, Heinlein and Arthur C Clarke, I'd looked forward to reading The Dispossessed. Ursula K. Le Guin rightfully has a reputation of being their peer, and I'd enjoyed other Le Guin books (Left Hand of Darkness). As a book of ideas, The Dispossessed is a peer of the aforementioned authors. But as storytelling, it leaves a lot to be desired.First, the ideas. It's easy to dismiss this book as an outdated, cold-war diatribe, but that would be overly simplistic. The author does what great writers do--no idea is presented without ambiguity. No system is prefect, none are without flaws. Untimately, this is a story about a complex and enormously talented physycist, Shevek, who is held back by his anarchistic society (everyone is free to be part of the community, but not free to be different or exceptional). But when he seeks support for his breakthrough theory in the propertarian opposite of his world, he finds disappointment there as well. Through Shevek, the book becomes more about the need of humans to fulfill their potential (almost like an Ayn Rand novel) than about judging the political systems he challenges.Unfortunately, despite a strong protagonist, great writing and intriguing ideas, it's a slow read. The approach Le Guin take of alteranting chapters in the present, with back story in the past is constantly slowing down the flow. And Dispossessed is without significant surprises, plot twists, or indeed much plot at all. Even the ending is ambiguous and unsatisfying.This is a worthwhile novel for anyone interested in political systems and their impact on the individual. It is however, neither a fast read nor a great story."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"There's a non-linear approach to The Dispossessed, which actually \\"begins\\" in the middle of the story. The novel begins with Shevek, a physicist on Anarres, preparing to make a landmark journey to sister planet Urras; he does this amid turmoil and protest on his own planet. The chapters alternate in time between events on his home planet leading up to this journey, and the events on Urras after his arrival. While he is working on his theory, Shevek's hope (and the ultimate theme of the novel) is to not only seek out the utopia he hopes for, but to break down the walls and find ways to unify the two worlds, which have grown distrustful and resentful of each other. However, an idealistic society is a complex and difficult puzzle to crack; both worlds have faults, both in the propertarian, material world of Urras as well as the workman, factory-like existence on Anarres. Shevek experiences disillusionment and frustration, but it is part of the self-discovery experience, the epiphany later on.The Dispossessed is smart novel which explores many spectrums and avenues of the \\"utopian-dystopian\\" existence. I thought it was fascinating how Le Guin encompasses so much in such a (relatively speaking) short novel. \\"Prisons\\" become a running symbol throughout Shevek's journey, from the time early in the novel when he becomes physically sick at the site of a peer being locked up, to the various \\"prisons\\" he witnesses within the realm of the two worlds.I can see why The Dispossessed is highly regarded and respected in science fiction circles, I felt a bit mixed about the reading experience initially. Le Guin has a strong foundation for making one think while reading The Dispossessed; it's no light experience. There are so many philosophical nuggets of wisdom, so many ideas to wrap your brain around and to take from the book, which gives insight into one's conception of utopia that you may have to spend a day or two thinking about its message. It is a high IQ read, but at points Le Guin borders on telling more than showing, and some passages and points of dialogue become a bit too preachy and agenda-driven, rather than using a subtle edge to make a point. The book is a bit slow going at first, and at points, but it does pick up. In the end, however, this book won me over, and I appreciated the ideas explored and the \\"humanistic\\" quality of Shevek, especially in the later parts of the story where he faces his most difficult conflicts.Any fans of science fiction or dystopian should give this novel a try."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Although The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia is classified as science fiction, it is hardly a novel about aliens and space travel. Rather, it is a speculative work of fiction that explores the possibility of existence and limitations of a completely anarchist society.At the center of the novel is the planet Anarres. Annares is populated by a community of anarchists, whose ascendants have left Anarres's sister planet Urras almost 200 years prior to escape its oppressive regimes and to establish a new society built on the principles of freedom, brotherhood, and complete anarchy. At this point Annaresti are isolated from and have no contact with Urras.At first, Anarres does seem like a utopia - no Annaresti is a subject to any law (they simply do not exist). Citizens of Anarres have a total freedom - sexual freedom, freedom of occupation, freedom to pursue their interests anywhere on the planet, freedom to work or not work at all. No one on Anarres owns anything, all property is communal. Even children do not \\"belong\\" to their parents, but raised in dormitories by volunteer teachers. There are no prisons or law enforcement on Anarres, because 1) there are no laws to be broken, and 2) if there is no private property, no power struggles, no sexual and physical abuse - there are no reasons to be imprisoned.As the story unfolds however, we see the other side of this society through the eyes of the novel's protagonist - a genius physicist Shevek. Shevek's is the plight of a person of outstanding abilities in a socialist world. Having a knowledge that could possibly bring together the societies all over the universe, he is unable to explore his theories on a planet where resources (including intellectual resources) are limited. He decides to go against the rest of Anarresti people and seek intellectual companionship on Urras. Can Urras give him what he seeks? Will his opinion of his mother planet change once he finds out what they all are missing out on? It is through Shevek's memories of Anarres do we see the weaknesses and strengths of the planet's chosen ideology.I have to say, although The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia is a fascinating novel, I liked it much less than The Left Hand of Darkness. It is simply too dry and too didactic.The best part of the book is, of course, Anarresti form of socialist anarchy. Ursula K. Le Guin's ideas of how such society might function are inventive and daring. But did I ever believe that an anarchist society can exist? Not for a minute. I think thousands of years of human history are on my side. I can't believe in a human society that rejects even the basic idea of family, because supposedly to be a dedicated parent to one's child is to be a proprietor, an egoist, a privateer. What can possibly hold people together except an elusive concept of \\"brotherhood\\" in a place like Anarres? It is also simply impossible for people to co-exist and cooperate without someone striving for power. It is a part of human nature. IMO in reality Anarres would be able to exist as anarchy for no longer than a generation. Once the staunch idealists are dead, any group of people will eventually settle into one of the more efficient orders - be that a democracy, dictatorship, theocracy, oligarchy - basically any social order with a power structure at its core.Nevertheless, as a work of speculative fiction The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia is an interesting book to wrap one's mind around."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Ursula K. LeGuin is one of the very few science fiction or fantasy writers whose work regularly is praised in the world of mainstream \\"literary\\" fiction. While this prejudice is unfair to the genres of science fiction and fantasy, the fact that her work escapes it demonstrates just how good LeGuin's writing is, and in my opinion, The Dispossessed stands as her crowning achievement. When you consider that she also wrote The Left Hand of Darkness and the Earthsea series (one book of which won the National Book Award), you can see how much I really like this book.The Dispossessed does what is rare in fiction today (whether science fiction or otherwise): it goes beyond just telling a story to asking basic questions about what it means to be a human being. How do we balance between our social natures and our individuality? Can a utopia really be achieved given the fluid, changing nature of human behavior, our wants and needs and imperfections included? What makes great literature is not that it answers these questions, but that it poses them and demands that the reader wrestle with them. We care about the characters, about Shevek and Takver and Pilun and the rest, but to gain the full benefit of reading The Dispossessed requires that we engage the ideas of the book. Here I mean not just the anarchist philosophy of Odo or the fascinating ideas about physics but the deeper human questions that motivated LeGuin to create them."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I love Ursula K. Le Guin. I count her as one of three writers I aspire to. She has a fascinating grip on anthropology and sociology and using the forum of science fiction creates complex worlds as far as social class, politics, ecology, culture, and human spirit. She is not a practical or \\"hard\\" scientist and it is very evident by this book. She has created a character who realized the Unified Field Theory, the holy grail of physics of today. But since this would require either her or the general audience to understand basic relative physics, she tries her best to talk around the science and more about the spirit of science and discovery. As much as I love her writing, and there are beautiful passages in every chapter, (My favorite is towards the end, the main character is in a garden on-board a spaceship and a flower has just blossomed during the night-time setting of the lights and the character thinks \\"The sunlights differ but there is only one darkness.\\") something like the \\"unified field theory\\" demands some science in it, Asimov would have had a fit that she skirted talking about physics, but this is Ursula's book not Isaac's. Overall it was satisfying, but satisfaction came at the end. To get there you have to traverse two stories of the main character's life, Shevek, One of him being born on a anarchist/commune culture that manages life on a desolate moon. The other is being from this commune culture and being placed into another culture based on capitalism and authoritarianism. It is interesting to note as I was reading this there were parallels to the happenings in Egypt. The clashes between authority and anarchy, which Le Guin does not give its common bad light, but actually akin it to libertarianism. But no one system of governance (or lack of) is regarded as better than the other they are just difference in culture. If I had any criticism it would be the structure seemed to beholden to linear structure, in that the book is designed to corresponded chapter by chapter to events of Shevek's life on his home world, to the next chapter of his life on the new world. I feel if it were designed where the two parts were mainstreamed I would have had a richer experience, and getting through some parts wouldn't have felt like a slog. At times I feel like there was padding to some of the chapters to expand them more artificially, but I kept going because I was invested in the complex world and the character of Shevek was very compelling, even if at first he seemed stand off-ish. But over all it was very satisfying ending and I do recommend giving it a read if you seem interested in it."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"The first science fiction I ever read was this. I was impressed enough by it to subsequently read all her others. Two worlds are contrasted--Anarres, on which an anarchist system prevails and resources are shared, and Urras, a violent, hierarchical world. Le Guin is a subtle writer and her story consists of far more than a contrast between utopia and dystopia. Her landscapes are compelling and her spare prose memorable and haunting."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Most reviewers seem to miss the essential point, distracted by the most elegant elaboration of anarchy ever in print. The structure of the novel itself with its convergent time lines is the very realization of the physicist-protagonist's theories. A most beautiful example of the novel form."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"...FAVORITE books. I've read it at least seven times and each time it stays as wonderful as I remember. Le Guin is outstanding as a realistic visionary bringing to life alternate realities. Not only is this gem purely entertaining, it starkly holds up our society in the mirror right next to another society, a sort-of &quot;utopia&quot;. Le Guin doesn't insult anyone's intelligence. You'll believe those places exist. Her writing is that great. It's not a tough philosophical read. You'll love it. I've bought and given this book away about five times. Lots of copies are out there used and in the library. Get your hands on one."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is a fabulously well-conceived book. I wouldn't call it a utopia, because it is more realistic than that, but it's not a dystopia either. Le Guin has carefully thought through the consequences of anarchism and idealism, while vividly portraying a living world in which her ideas evolve. The attention to detail has made this book stick in my mind years after reading it. If you like sci-fi with more than guns and battleships, this is an intellectual treat."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Ursula K. LeGuin always writes thoughtful novels about cultural and/or political clashes. This one is about an idealist, anarchist society exiled to a nearly barren sister planet of a predictably imperialist, capitalist society. If it sounds heavy-handed, it usually is not because it is really about the protagonist and the deeply human story about his two loves: physics and his family. John Lennon sang, &quot;Imagine no possessions&quot;; Ursula K. LeGuin tries to imagine the consequences of no possessions."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"In \\"The dispossessed\\" it's been almost 200 years since a million people left the kapitalist state Urras to go to Anarres and start an anarchistic society. At Anarres everybody is equal and possessions are being shared. Shevek is a brilliant scientist who realises he misses something. His ideas are not being approved of in Anarres. He thinks the freedom in Anarres is fake. He gets invited to talk about his ideas on Urras and he goes there. Here he tries to unite the two different worlds, but that's very hard.I liked \\"The dispossessed\\" because the society on Anarres is explained very well. Shevek is someone who you get to know. He becomes a real person."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"The original subtitle of The Dispossessed was \\"An Ambiguous Utopia.\\" It is the best work of utopian literature I have read, including Thomas More, Plato and all that. Instead of rolling my eyes and saying to myself, \\"people don't behave like that\\" or \\"whoa, that sounds fascist and would not work,\\" I could imagine real people, with all their vanity, selfishness, jealousy and spite, working together this imagined society.The Dispossessed won both the Hugo and Locus Awards (awarded by fans), and the Nebula (awarded by professionals in the SF field) in 1974-1975.It is a intricately constructed tale (switching between planets and past/present) of a physicist, Shevek, who visits capitalist Urras (a thinly-disguised Earth) from his Utopian planet, anarcho-socialist Anarres. Although the socialism/capitalism debate may seem dated, Le Guin's vivid characters and compelling prose style illuminate the underlying politics with pathos. These conflicts in how we live and govern ourselves (property, division of labor, production & consumption) have remained inevitably fresh."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"The action is set on two sister planets, with alternating chapters on each. The hero, a brilliant mathematician/physicist/philisopher, explores the nature and consequences of two political systems, their good and bad points - Capitalism and true 'Communism' verging on anarchy; there is even a brief, chilling view of our own future world in which the consequences of unrestrained consumerism has left a drastically reduced society ruled by an autocracy in a landscape become hopelessly degraded.In my opinion \\"Dispossessed\\", written in 1974, should be 'up there' amongst the great satires of our literature (Gulliver's Travels, Animal Farm and 1984)instead of stuck away with poor science fiction as implied by the cover. My enjoyment of the text was seriously impeded by poor editing, horrible type face/page layout and misleading cover. Maybe I should have gone for the hard-cover version."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Science fiction is no stranger to social commentary nor to utopias/dystopias. The structure of the totalitarian state has been dissected so thoroughly now by various writers in the sci-fi tradition that it has become just another piece of furniture in the world of science fiction. But there has been a distinct lack of good science fiction that has analyzed the structure and mechanics of the anarchistic society. Among a few short stories, the two that really stand out are Robert A. Heinlein's The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and Ursula K. LeGuin's The Dispossessed. These two works, of course, cover opposite ends of the spectrum of anarchy: Heinlein the anarcho-capitalist side and LeGuin the anarcho-syndicalist side. LeGuin's novel is far superior in this aspect, to my mind, because of its thorough and non-ideological analysis of the good and bad aspects of this society. It is by far the most honest and compelling analysis of an anarchy that I have ever seen. Even better is Le Guin's ability to extrapolate and discuss the underlying philosophical framework of this society. There is a scarcely a more compelling creation in all of fiction.The plot is straight-forward enough: over a hundred years prior to the start of the novel a communist revolution, led by a woman named Odo, swept the world of Urras. Rather than waste time and resources waging a bloody war against them, the council of world governments on Urras decided to let the revolutionaries claim their uninhabited desert moon, Anarres. The revolutionaries built a utopian anarchistic society on the moon and, for the next hundred or so years the two worlds have built walls of hatred and distrust between one-another (yes, this novel is, in part, a cold war allegory). This wall of separation is breached and challenged by a Anarrestian physicist, Shevek, who wants to find common ground in-between the two worlds.This book is not perfect, however. While she does many things right (her beautiful writing style; her storytelling abilities; her realistic and fully-developed characters; a novel structure that jumps between two time-lines and which expertly interweave; her compelling look at the world of the Anarresti), other aspects aren't up to par. The story, for one thing, seems to run out of energy near the end, and it is if Le Guin did not know how to end her novel. There is little to no plot resolution. The only lesson the main character learns from his quest seems to be that the entire thing was a bad idea (you could make the case that he understands his role in the \\"social organism\\" of Anarres better, and that the trip was a necessary revolutionary action, but one shouldn't have to read so far into the story to justify the lack of necessary resolution by the author). So while the characters grow and learn, the story as a whole seems to just lose energy and fall over. Moreover, while Anarres is fascinating, the world of Urras is merely a foil and reads like a bad parody of nineteenth century Britain. LeGuin makes Anarres complex and fascinating, but she seems content to leave the Urrasti as caricatures of a very simplistic (and thus problematic) socialist worldview. She doesn't challenge herself by creating a complex capitalistic society and then looking at its positive and negative traits, as she does with the communists on Anarres. Instead, she creates a society so shallow, socially stratified, and brutal that almost anyone would want out. It's as if she chose Chile under Pinochet as representative of all 'archist' or even capitalistic societies.For its faults, however, this is still a fascinating, complex, and thought-provoking read, wherever you are on the political spectrum."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"One of the best books I have read, especially in the Sci-Fi category. The contrasting worlds of capitalism and anarchy are philosophically expressed in this book, and are very eye opening. It is easy to fall prey to the societal view and images of what life would be like if we all lived in an anarchistic world, but this book helps to paint a clearer picture of what that reality might actually be like. The author, essentially gives us a ladder to climb over the wall of our own ingnorance, and see through the eyes of the characters a very different world and way of life."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"It's long been known that since the advent of science fiction, man kind's greatest inventions were foretold in books and stories. In recent decades the focus of this genre has shifted from technology to sociology and psychology. This book, though published more than 30 years ago, is a prime example of how relevant this kind of writing is to our lives today. Even more importantly, with corporation-led globalization, and the protest and antagonism that it breeds, the lessons of this book are becoming more important by the day. The boundary between Utopia and Distopia is never clear (especially in LeGuin's writings), and this story serves to emphasize the differences between a couple of tracks we as a race may choose to follow. Never unbiased, LeGuin takes a strong moral stand, and brings some convincing arguments toward her case. Still, this is a very enjoyable read, but take care- it will make you think more than you might want to."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is one of the best and most thought-provoking books I have read in ages. While it is a sci-fi novel about two sister planets, one ruled by an advanced version of our own society and the other a planet of anarchists, the book reads more like philosophy than anything else. Don't let that scare you, though. The story was excellent.The planet of Anerres is a dry, dusty, arid planet and was unpopulated until citizens of Urras came to mine it for resources such as gold and lead. While this was happening, another citizen of the planet of Urras, Odo, began to write and speak out about the virtues of a society where no one owns anything and power is non-existant. The movement her teachings sparked became so prominent and threatening to the governments on Urras that they bought them off with Anerres. The miners and other workers on the dry planet were brought home, and the Odonians (as they came to be known) were sent to establish a new society of their own, free from government, bosses, money, and class. The Dispossessed tells the story of a physicist named Shevek that lived one hundered and seventy-five years after that society began.The story itself seemed to take a backseat to the ideas that run rampant throughout the text of this book. Thoughts about how a society based on anarchism would and would not work, as well as ideas that made you really take a look at the world around us pervaded each paragraph.It's difficult to write about this book because there was simply so much going on that I find it hard to focus on any one thing. Last night, after I finished the last few words, I set the book down and immediately thought: \\"I'm going to have to read this again soon.\\" There was so much depth to the world and ideas conveyed that I honestly believe a single reading isn't enough to absorb it all.Keep in mind (I can't stress this enough), this is not your average read and then put-on-the-shelf-and-never-think-about-again sci-fi novel. It was a true piece of literature, and I had a hard time (at first) believing that it was written by the same woman that wrote A Wizard of Earthsea. Not that there is anything wrong with A Wizard..., mind, I just wasn't expecting such an adult book.So, I have to say, I loved it and plan on reading it again soon."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"\\"To break a promise is to deny the reality of the past; therefore it is to deny the hope of a real future.\\" -- one of the more pertinent observations made in this outstanding book, one I found myself thinking about more than any other after reading it. Otherwise \\"The Dispossessed\\" is, among other things, an exploration of utopias, political systems and the politics of utopias. As usual Le Guin wraps all of these otherwise tiresome sounding political/philosophical themes into a very engaging SF story, with outstanding characters and a generally plausible storyline. It also falls among Le Guin's many books that subtly dissect humankind's rather high opinion of itself. . ."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This book made a profound impression on me when I first read it 20 years ago, and still is one of my favourites of all times. It is filled with philosophical concepts that make us think again about how we view the world around us.Most highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is a brilliant work that contrasts two competing world-views in late-20th/early-21st century Earth. Neither is explored through rose-tinted glasses. Shevek, an anarcho-syndicalist from the Moon, comes to believe that the only way to save his society of free anarchists from descending into a Soviet-style authoritarian culture, is to re-initiate cultural exchange with the rich and diverse home world, Urras. Because he has developed the equations that will enable faster-than-light communication across interstellar distances, the propertarian cultures of Urras invite him to visit. He eventually becomes involved in the labor movement of Urras, and, with the help of the Terran ambassador, gives his equations to all of humanity rather than a single nation. Unlike most plot-driven science fiction, Le Guin writes in a human-centered style that uses fictional worlds as a backdrop. An outstanding book."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I recommend this to everybody who ever shared or liked any meme related to the Occupy movement in the last year. At the heart of Occupy were anarchist ideas which begin at anti-statism. Most don't give much thought to how the nation-state developed. It's like water out of the faucet. Nobody did anything to get it there, you were born and it was just there. Le Guin shows one particular vision in how a society would function without the state. It would have its problems, and in fact some of those problems wouldn't be that different from the ones we have within state/capitalistic society. But the inequalities would be less severe and overall quality of life and freedom would be greater. Who knows if this is realistic enough, but as we can see from Occupy Sandy, Rolling Jubillee and #strikedebt, \\"the people\\" are pretty into what a lot of anarchists are doing these days. There is nothing preachy in this novel and nothing overly intellectual that might confuse or condescend to you, also a plus."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"One of the most overtly political science fiction novels - and one certainly deserving of the term \\"speculative fiction\\" - ever published, \\"The Dispossessed\\" remains Ursula K. Le Guin's literary masterpiece. It chronicles the journey of \\"post-relativistic\\" physicist Shevek from his home world of Arras to the planet Urras, seeking the answer to the puzzle that has eluded him, and one that will allow him to develop the ansible, the faster-than-light means of communication, that will bind humanity and other, closely related, sapient beings into a interstellar commonwealth known as the \\"Ekumen\\"; the setting for many of Ursula Le Guin's anthropological science fiction novels, of which \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" and \\"The Dispossessed\\" remain the best known examples, though the latter is set in a time prior to the Ekumen's founding. (In Le Guin's \\"Ekumen\\" series of novels and short fiction, humans and others are descendants of early interstellar colonization by the natives of Hain.) Hers is a political science fiction novel in the sense that it compares and contrasts the vibrant, politically Byzantine-like world of Urras, orbiting the star Tau Ceti, eleven light years from Earth, with the anarchist utopia on the barren, desert world of Arras. Originally a \\"Botany Bay\\"-like penal colony, settled by dissidents from Urras centuries before Shevek's birth; Arras is a world close to Urras, as an orbiting moon of the much larger planet, and yet, one that is distant too, since Shevek is the first Arras native to visit Urras in nearly two centuries. Le Guin offers readers a captivatingly poignant portrait of Shevek as he contends with the almost polyglot nature of Urras' governments, which are predominantly capitalist in orientation, rejecting the notion of \\"fairness\\" that is prevalent on Arras; a world where there are no laws that govern the behavior of its human residents. While Le Guin describes the vast inequities that exist still on Urras, she also emphasizes the importance of personal liberty, and by referring to both Arras and Urras as though they are the polar opposites, the \\"Yin and Yang \\", of human political behavior she does imply that both are of equal importance, especially with regards to Shevek's quest toward developing the ansible. As a novel of both ideas and a riveting, insightful, character study of Shevek, blessed with Le Guin's elegant, often poetic, prose, \\"The Dispossessed\\" is a science fiction novel that has earned deservedly, ample critical and popular acclaim from those otherwise unfamiliar with the genres of fantasy and science fiction. Without a doubt, \\"The Dispossessed\\" is not only a great work of 20th Century Anglo-American speculative fiction, but one that should be viewed as among the most important novels ever published in the latter half of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"It's a good book. I love books that take you to different planets--in this case, it takes you to two, since the Cetians are not from Earth. Urras is a world similar to ours in both class systems and economy. Anarres is socialism in action, with no monetary system. It was really, really neat to read it and see a different way of doing things. It might be science fiction, but it's mostly an exploration of society, and while reading it, you're really not certain which way is the better way to live, even though le Guin does try to portray Anarres as the more \\"ideal\\" world, the planet that is much, much different than our current function here in the U.S. and in the world."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Slow-starting, as others have said, but the writing drew me in, which was a good thing, because much of the background detail was not provided until deep into the story. Indeed, some rather crucial details did not appear until near the end.Shevek's twin worlds are not appealing: his native planet is as socially stratified as any communist state and just as poor, while his ancestral planet is a gender-segregated hidebound capitalism that quells mass protest with helicopter gunships.Shevek's attempt to reunite the two worlds, however unlikely, makes reading about them bearable, even compelling. This is the first Le Guin novel I've read, but if they're all this good, I will try more."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is the first book by Le Guin that I have read. I read quite a bit of science fiction, some serious, some just for fun. This book was recommended by my son's college friend and I decided to read it.This book is serious, a study of the human condition and politics. It takes place in one solar system, on two planets. One society, the odonians, live on one planet, self-exiled and homegeneous, while the planet they left is a hodgepodge of cultures. The odonians have what they believe to be the best part of the exile, forbidding all but the barest contact with the societies of the old planet from fear of corrupting their perfect freedom of their perfect philosophy they have enjoyed for almost two hundred years.The odonians are anarchists. Communists if you like, they seem to me to be an idealized versions of Maoists. They live a painfully tedious life with little or no comfort, little food, in shacks with no running water and communal baths. They eat in what are really mess halls, but might be charitably called dining commons. They are perfect, without any flaws of self-worth or self-aggrandizement. Their planet is a desert, inhabited by nothing higher than fishes and worms and some hardy plants. They power themselves through their daily drudgery without the use of egos, or desires, or loves, or anything that might detract from their perfect ant-like existence. There is a hero. Shevek. Shevek is a physicist, a genius on the scale of Einstein. His marginally anti-social father loved and raised him after mom, the perfect anarchistic feminist, left them to pursue her owns goals. That is perfectly normal for odonians. The father's love, even attention, is anti-social, verging on the obscene and definitely \\"egoist.\\" Egoist is not exactly explained. But if you think what you do is of some value, if you think you are of some value, an artist or a scientist or even a person, or think your own children special to you, then you are an egoist. That's a bad thing to be.Shevek is good with numbers, as his dad is. He quickly becomes familiar with the narrow-mindedness of his society. As a natural theoretical thinker, he is thrown out of one math class as an undesirable, an egoist. He should just learn the problems his teacher assigns, not work at understanding them or what they imply. Who does he think he is?Shevek is shunned by odonians as somehow unclean, somehow possessing a uniqueness. A uniqueness that most people raised in Western society would treasure, but to odonians is a distasteful throwback to the archist societies. But he is not perturbed nor dissuaded. The odd part is that he is a loyal and deeply committed odonian. He once says, \\"You cannot buy the Revolution. You cannot make the Revolution. You can only be the Revolution. It is in your spirit, or it is nowhere.\\" Shevek is the Revolution. He is as true to his beliefs as he only can be in this work of fiction. Shevek perseveres with his math even while living a plodding life of hard labor, volunteering for more hard labor when he is not assigned to it. Obviously brilliant, he has few friends, mostly quiet admirers of his uniqueness. He is the living embodiment of the contradictions of humans living under odonianism. He is a self-abasing tireless worker ant, willing to do any base or menial task for the good of the community, all the while developing a theory that takes over where Einstein's life work left off! A difficult juxtaposition for sure. He succeeds in this story.Le Guin's language skills are evident. She is no mean hack for sure. Well written scenes and dialogue abound. I found myself rereading some portions of the text, not because they were poorly written, but because they were so naturally crafted. Shevek and other characters are consistent and more believable than most authors could have made them. In spite of the negatives of the story, within its fabric you will find a story of a man in conflict with his society, rent by the disparate desires of his humanity in a society attempting to snuff out all traces of that humanity. A society that commands his philosophical, nay, religeous loyalty.This book has a few negatives. The first is sequencing. It is as if Le Guin wrote the whole story out and then cut it into nine or ten sections and shuffled them. Transitions are rough, you are dumped from one to the next in such a way as you don't know when you are in the story. It is not unlike some movies that jump back and forth from flashbacks and reality to confuse you and make the story more nightmarish. The entirety of the story really does not fall into place until you are near the end of the book. Considering Le Guin's skills, this seems a very arbitrary fault. I would easily believe some editor thought this would increase the drama of the story and chopped up the completed novel.The second is the transparent impossibility of the odonian idea. If you build a bridge across a chasm, and then remove its supports, it will collapse into the chasm. Similarly, any group of people so narrow minded and doctrinaire, whose lives had no meaning other than just breathing and eating as these people are presented, would have literally died out when first deposited on this barren world, long before they build a functioning society. They have no humanity, no reason to exist. They are so pettily committed to odonism, self-effacing and self-sacrificing that they are mindless. Without even a mind, their blind little existences would have collapsed under the hardships manifested in the story. Of course, everyone who is even the smallest bureaucrat or busy body neighbor is an egoist, a closet capitalist if you will. The hypocrisy is everywhere evident as such a society cannot possibly exist, and so Le Guin must insert real people.Last, the dreariness of the odonians lives and world. What an unbearably gray existence! If they had survived the first twenty years to create this society, then thousands would just have laid down and died, rendered hopeless by their exile in Hell. Except for the egoists, who are doing okay living off the backs of the worker ants.In the end, the story demands a suspension of reality greater than any SciFi I have ever read, but was more engrossing than not, worth a read."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"It's one of my favorites. As others've said, it's a book you can return to again and again.It's the best -- most literate -- utopian novel ever written. Most utopian novels try to blend a good enough story with the ideas they want to tell. The Dispossessed is unique for having both story and ideas, without making either suffer. It's also great for trying to realisticly describe what it might be like to live in a utopian society -- good for making the point that even in a utopian society, there's still the pain of being human, of suffering for love and loneliness, of finding one's purpose in life and society, etc. Also that even a utopian society is an ambiguous one and that it's going to have its problems with corruption and rigidity, of idealists being criticized by society, etc.Interesting note: saw a recent paperback edition of The Dispossessed whose back cover blurb described the book as something like &quot;From the anarchist moon of Anarres Shevek travels to the utopian world of Urras to try to dispel the bonds of hate and ignorance that keep the 2 worlds apart.&quot; Interesting how which world as being the most utopian has changed -- publisher's mistake, or the publisher deliberately trying to appeal to more '90s tastes?"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"It is easy for an anti-materialistic, anti-government utopia to exist when you set it up as darn near impossible to be materialistic due to the ecological scarcity of the planet. This makes it imperative for society to create ethics of no extraneous possessions, of hard work and sharing. And the attendent problem of coersion through peer pressure. As I said, it gives you lots of food for thought, totally fulfilling its mission."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"i regard this as one of my favourites ever. a thoughtful and enjoyable plot filled with conflicts between the reflective scientist shevek, and the social functions of surroundings. the *fantastic* social analysis on top of that makes it deserve more than five stars, imo.this book really opened up my eyes for the ideas of anarchism and syndicalism, and ultimately led to the point at which i engaged myself in this movement."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This may be LeGuin's best novel, despite its slow, ruminative pace. It's a thinking person's adventure, filled with ideas and so eminently quotable that it can spark discussion. Shevek is searching for answers, just like the pioneers who founded his ascetic, open society on the arid world to which they exiled themselves decades ago and from which they banished the concepts of private property and privacy. Are they on the right path? Do they really have a future? His search takes him back to the neighboring home planet of Urras, a wealthy, materialistic society corrupted and possessed by the desire for power, whose vulgar, neurotic inhabitants &quot;lived among mountains of excrement, but never mentioned shit.&quot; Their decadence helps explain and balances the anarchistic social extremes of Shevek's world, which were developed partly in reaction. The story loses power at the end, when the corruption of Urrasti society manifests itself in cliched violence, but thoughtful readers will find the novel very rewarding."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"A case can be made for Mrs Le Guin being seen to be the most important woman writer in English in the second half of the Twentieth Century. A review I read here which compared her to Ayn Rand is not only to insult her intelligence and wit, but to demean her style.I admit to a personal interest in Mrs le Guin's Speculative Fantasist (SF) vision, since I am myself an Anarchist. Indeed, I had never seen the sub-title &quot;An Ambiguous Utopia&quot; until I read this page. I do not think that the book fits into the &quot;Utopia/Dystopia&quot; tradition, but then, le Guin may be taking the Mickey out of us as she so often does.There is no other book, fictional or otherwise of which I am aware (with the possible exception of Orwell's &quot;Homage to Catelonia&quot;) that so clearly demonstrates the practicality of Anarchism as a political philosophy. Indeed, I have lost count of the number of copies of the book that I have given away for this reason alone."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I was reading a library-bound first edition of The Dispossessed, then I bought the Kindle edition.Oh dear, what edition was used to make the Kindle version? I find in the second half of Chapter 9, jumping in mid-chapter, two errors in the Kindle version that are not present in the first edition. It's hard to believe these were scanning errors; there's one case of the non-word \\"princple\\" instead of \\"principle\\" (page 300 location 4212) and a case where the word \\"where\\" is used instead of \\"were\\".I find that disconcerting, and it makes me wonder whether I'm reading an authoritative edition. It makes me wonder how Kindle editions are made. One wouldn't guess that a book published in 1974 would have fewer errors than its derivative Kindle version. It makes me nervous about the quality of Kindle text in general.Your thoughts on this?"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is one of my favorite books, but I regret buying the Kindle edition. It's obvious that to prepare this edition Harper Collins ran the book through a cheap OCR and then didn't spend much effort copy-editing the results. Just to take some examples from the first few pages of Chapter 2, the protagonist as a child is described as \\"a lanky eighty-year-old\\"; the correct text would read \\"eight-year-old.\\" Later a character is described as taking \\"a decade at the beach\\"; this should be \\"decad,\\" which is a word used in the setting to indicate a span of ten days.You should read this book, but not this edition."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"My review seeks to add nothing to the positive evaluations that other readers have already offered. This story is simply excellent. I only want to point out for anyone thinking of buying the Harper Perennial Classics edition that the text is riddled with very annoying typos. For example, I was seriously confused when I read a scene about the protagonist, Shevek, when he was a child, and the text said he was EIGHTY-years-old. Since I was unfamiliar with the story, and since just about anything goes in science fiction, I thought that Le Guin had created a society in which eighty-year-old people were still somehow childlike. It took me a few minutes to figure out that this was not a part of the plot, but one of many simple typos (Shevek was eight, not eighty).

I soon realized that the structure mirrored the theories in temporal physics (the physics of time) that Shevek is struggling with: Simultaneity and Synchronicity. As the greatest physicist of both of his worlds, and possibly of the Ekumen (Le Guin's universe that includes the world of The Left Hand of Darkness), Shevek grapples with both the content and the practical result of his work.Shevek remains one of the most ethical and humane characters I've ever encountered.

I broke out my old Rush CDs and Spider Man comics, streamed X-Files, and re-read a handful of books.I found myself wondering why I ever liked David Eddings, and even found Robert Jordan a bit tedious.It was with some apprehension that I re-approached The Dispossessed. I had long considered it my favorite book of all time, and I wasn't sure it would hold up to a re-read. But a small voice within me suggested that avoiding the reread would reveal that I had not grokked the book in the first place.&#8220;If you evade suffering you also evade the chance of joy. Pleasure you may get, or pleasures, but you will not be fulfilled. You will not know what it is to come home.&#8221;And so I re-read The Dispossessed. And I re-wept, and re-dreamed.

Oh, and MOON ANARCHISTS!"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"As many reviewers have noted, this LeGuin novel is more about the socio-political content than the action or characters. Although the book follows a single character from birth to late middle age, the story is really a canvas upon which the author paints a picture of the benefits and dangers of both anarchistic communism and oligarchical capitalism. The anarchistic society is presented in a slightly more positive light than its counterpart in this book, though the main character, Shevek, becomes disenchanted with both types of social arrangements in one way or another. Shevek ultimately chooses his home world, Anarres, as the superior one, shunning the world that held the promise of scientific progress, but tainted that promise by treating science as a means to gain superiority over other worlds.I prefer science fiction to lean more heavily on the plot and characters than this book does. While the philosophy is wonderful to explore, I felt that it could have been done equally as well with much more emphasis on a more interesting plot and compelling characters. Three stars for this one."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"One of the most overtly political science fiction novels - and one certainly deserving of the term \\"speculative fiction\\" - ever published, \\"The Dispossessed\\" remains Ursula K.

LeGuinn novel I ever read, and I loved it. I then went back and started the Hanish cycle from the begining (according to in-verse chronology.) This is hard sci-Fi, but it's more focused on anthropology and sociology then on astronomy and physics. Not that the physics are bad, they are just not the focus. Neither is the plot really, but it has a good one. Oh yah, it's also beautifully written."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Shevek is a brilliant physicist from the barren anarchist world of Anarres. His work could revolutionise interstellar society, permitting instantaneous communication - maybe even instantaneous travel - between the worlds of humanity. But, in contrast to the idealism of Anarres, he finds his work undervalued and even repressed by jealous colleagues. Frustrated, he travels to Anarres's capitalist sister world of Urras, hoping to find more tolerance there but instead becoming embroiled in politics, rebellion and war.The Dispossessed is widely considered to be one of Ursula Le Guin's finest novels and is arguably her most ambitious work. The book asks nothing less than how best should human society function and by what means. Le Guin picks two popular models, that of a semi-communist state and a capitalist one, and pits them against one another. She is not interested in 'proving' the values of one over the other, instead comparing and contrasting the strengths and weaknesses of both and also the affect they have on the individual, particularly on the individual who has a great, transformational idea but whom is seen by others purely as a pawn or something to be crushed.The novel relies on this thematic idea to sustain it, but the actual plot structure is also intriguing. The book alternates chapters between the present-day storyline (Shevek on Urras) and events in his past (Shevek growing up on Anarres). We see the present-day Shevek as being an open-minded, questioning individual and how he has changed from his earlier incarnation as a blinkered man who accepts dogmatic ideas as fact (such as the notion that Urras is a corrupt capitalist state that will one day destroy itself), with later Anarres chapter depicting his shift in belief and motivation. Le Guin constantly has Shevek developing as a character even as she develops her ideas and the setting of the two worlds.The novel's greatest strength is its depiction of someone who seeks simple answers and is instead rewarded with having his worldview broadened and made more complicated. Shevek sees Urras as the answer to all his problems but instead of the utopia he was hoping for he finds a cluster of nations all feuding with one another (at one point fighting a Vietnam-style proxy war between two superpowers with the rulers acknowledging that nothing will change, only thousands dying for no real goal). Anarres is not rose-painted either: the world is desolate, the people poor and, for all of their freedom of choice, are often forced into jobs and roles they despise and are not well suited-for. The book is sometimes criticised for condemning capitalism and promoting communism/anarchism, but it's more complex than that. Le Guin's argument appears to be that all human societies are prone to dysfunction and corruption, no matter how well-meaning people are.The novel's ending is intriguing, as Shevek's conflicted views are commented upon by an outsider (an ambassador from an Earth ruined by war and ecological disaster) and her analysis spurs him to reconsider his approach. However, the book somewhat abruptly ends before Shevek's return to Anarres with him not having reached a conclusion. This is presumably because any answer would be unsatisfying and simplistic. Instead we are left with the questions, which are far more interesting.The Dispossessed (*****) is a thought-provoking novel that does not attempt to simplify complex matters and combines fascinating worldbuilding and character development with a refreshing plot structure and some rich prose. The novel is available now in the UK and USA."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I'm very particular about the books I read, and I rarely give out 5 stars. However, The Dispossessed is simply one of the best novels I've read, and definitely by favorite science fiction book in recent years. The worlds that Ursula LeGuin paints for the reader are exotic and unique enough to be interesting, but still familiar enough not to lose the reader. The emphasis is on human interactions and social questions as opposed to aliens and technology, and LeGuin does a magnificent job showing us the political and social side of the various societies in the story. The main character, Shevek, is very three-dimensional and very likable."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"The daughter of a husband-wife team of anthropologists, the Kroebers (spelling uncertain), Le Guin writes from a complete understanding of anthropology. This book is like Gulliver's Travels or Utopia in that it draws a detailed picture of another society to criticize our own. In The Dispossessed, there are two societies, one rich and capitalist, the other poor and communist. The book is careful to explore the strengths of an ideal version of each. If you enjoy philosophy, this is one of the best, and one that is not well known"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Le Guin weaves two interlinking tales that are joined at the end.Shevek is an inspired scientist who lived two different kinds of livesin the socialistic Anarres, and later in the capitalistic Urras.These are the personal accounts of Shevek's search for meaningand love, against life's obstacles.1974 Hugo and Nebula award winner"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I read this book because it was recommended as similar to Sherri Tepper's \\"The Gate to Women's Country\\".Wrong. They are not remotely similar. But still an okay book.Le Guin's writing style is spare and elegant, and Shevek, the physicist hero, is a kind of Andrei Sakharov character who is trying to change political systems while bringing a revolution in physics and communication to a world his people were exiled from 200 years before. So... think if America and western Europe had kicked out all the protesters in 1968, sent them to live on the moon, what would they be like 200 years later? Yep, liberalism and sanctimony run amok.Like \\"A Gate to Women's Country\\", \\" The Dispossessed\\" is a futuristic dystopia where the worst aspects of the United States, the Soviet Union, 60's environmentalists and pacifists all collide in tepid conflict. Shevek lectures a lot, but he is a likable enough character that the reader never loses her affection for him.I recommend this book as a kind of time capsule -- what was the World like between 1966 and 1974? Like the best science fiction, it reveals more about the time it was written than the time Le Guin is writing about."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is an incredible book and I reccommend it to any thoughtful individual out there. Read it with an open mind."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"A novel beginning with anarchists on one planet, 'archists' on its twin. That is, the planets are astronomical twins; the anarchists' planet is only marginally habitable while that of their seeming bete noir is quite earth-like. Very earth-like, in fact, replete with capitalists and modified communists (the novel is a cold war artifact).The author attempts to explore what happens in societies, how people lose their freedom. The anarchists become somewhat bureaucratic and terribly provincial in the worst sense, that of pruning outcroppings of creativity by means of social opprobation.The capitalists, wealthy though the aristocrats are, are not free in the author's view. The society has its best analogue in 19th century Great Britain, complete with the class distinctions then normal.The text is turgid, even occasionally ungrammatical. The characters are shallow, mere ciphers for the author's didacticism. Of action we will not speak: there is none of which to speak.Looking at the other reviews, I see one that says he got the message: \\"capitalism good, communism bad.\\" I do wonder what book he read when he thought he was reading this book. The message here is \\"freedom,which implies responsibility, good; societal/governmental repression of freedom bad.\\" This is a message that is easy to endorse, even if the book was far from my favorite."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This book is about what communists and socialists dream about, what's called anarcho-syndicalism. As such, it's very well executed. As an aspiring writer, I find anarchy a very interesting topic. This was a good book to get a feel of what what these types are thinking. I believe, the anarchists you heard about among the occupy wall st crowd were essentially of this variation. What I found interesting was to identify the inconsistencies with this vision. But I find Anarcho-capitalist's arguments much more compelling. For an understanding of that perspective, read 'The Moon is a Harsh Mistress' in fiction or 'A Market for Liberty' in non-fiction.These people are supposedly free, but they can't leave their planet, and no one is allowed to come to theirs, they can't name their own children, and a computer runs their lives even separating families which are very loosely sanctioned. And nobody who's in charge of keeping the 'ruling computer' uses it corruptly for their benefit, though there are hints of corruption that don't seem to spin out of control like we witness in every pretty much every society with a power structure.Every effort at communism end's in very big, corrupt government and severe poverty if not outright starvation, so this vision is totally impossible. Le Guin recognizes that such 'equality' means a more meager existence, but she under-appreciates the complete societal breakdown which ensues.This book has nothing to do with reality, but gives insight into a very odd and dangerous political philosophy.The book, while reasonably engaging and well written, is also overly philosophical and insufficiently story-based. The science fiction ideas are totally weak and erroneous. The protagonist travels around near light-speed without having to worry about aging differences with his loved ones. She doesn't seem to fully understand her invention of the Ansible which is reused from an earlier novel."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I came into this book with some high expectations and while it did disappointment the actual journey was a pleasant one. Le Guin's prose is crisp and makes her lengthy passages of idealogy very brisk and readable. She avoids the trap of many Utopian/Dystopian novels by attempting to show the flaws of the former and the good points of the later as well as noting that the seeds for either already exists in both societies. Her main character, Shevek, is engaging and isn't a bad person to spend this nearly 400 page novel with. The love story between he and Tavark is touching.The problem? I simply do not believe the communist commune society of Arrakis. Le Guin fails to demonstrate why this society would succeed when so many other like minded attempts have failed. Her reasoning seems to be that other attempts have been underminded because not everyone in the country is equally committed to the idealogy. Her answer? Build the society with nothing but 'true believers'. Its a nice thought but I think it denies a fundemental aspect of human nature and that's self-interest/preseveration. We're not an alturistic species by nature. Sure, many of us are quite willing to help our fellow man in his time of need, but at the sake of our own happiness and prosperity?As just one example, Le Guin presents a society where properity is forbidden. Rather, possesions are kept in warehouses and other such places and handed to anyone who needs them, then are promptly returned. Forgive my cynicism but I think that warehouse would be missing quite a few items after a few months. To Le Guin's credit she does make concessions that this type of behavior goes on but we're led to believe its among only a handful of individuals.If you find the description I just gave you plausible you'll probably find much about this book to enjoy. But if you're like me and have doubts about humanity's ablity to work soly for the benefit of their neighbor then you may want to avoid this. Libertarians, if you found this book through the Prometheus Awards realize that Le Guin's anarchist society is quite different than the one Heinlein presents in \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\\" (what inspired me to try \\"The Dispossessed\\")."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This book is definitely thought provoking, but I found it was not much fun to read. I think it might have been more relevant at the time of its original publication, but the premise of exploring alternative political systems (or lack thereof) is dated. I have to give the author credit for portraying the anarchic communtiy as far from perfect, but then again, this is blamed on the inevitability of capatalism. I don't believe anarchy could work, but I think I would have given the concept more credit than the author does. I don't think selfishness and the lust for power (other than what is needed for self preservation) is genetic or inevitable, but rather those traits are something that is learned."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"There is precious little \\"science\\" in this Science Fiction masterpiece. Lovers of Vernor Vinge or Kim Stanley Robinson, hoping to discover a rock-solid hard SF tale, will likely be disappointed. Likewise, lovers of rock'em'sock'em space opera, or media tie-in books like Star Wars or Star Trek, will be similarly disappointed. \\"The Dispossessed\\" is a very quiet read, dwelling almost entirely on concepts of the individual human and his/her proper role in a properly-ordered society.I can see why this book gets a lot of traction with college professors and academic types. \\"The Dispossessed\\" panders to the conventional wisdom of the academic set, namely in that its protagonist is also an academic who perpetually steps outside boundaries and defies convention, eventually coming face to face with the 'evils' of capitalism, which in turn steer him back towards his native, idealic anarchism.From the standpoint of pure writing, this is an elegant read from start to finish. But my suspension of disbelief was greatly strained through much of the text because I couldn't believe in the Odonian society of Annares. Even assuming that all of the million original Settlers were fully committed to non-authoritarian anarchism, there is no reason to assume their descendants would be. If there is one constant about the human species, it's that children often think and act differently from their parents, no matter how they are raised. Thus the glass-fragile, idealized society on Annares would surely have collapsed within two or three generations, so that by the time 160 years had passed the descendants of the Settlement would have largely abandoned the socially-cooperative 'utopia' established by their forebearers.Meanwhile, A-Io on the planet Urras is something of a straw-man. If it was Le Guin's intention to criticize the United States and its capitalist economy, I think she failed. A-Io did not remind me of the U.S. as much as it reminded me of late 19th-century England, replete with royalty and class stratification and higher education being the playground of the very, very rich. Even if we timewarp back to the early 1970's, when this book was written, it's difficult to see America in A-Io; though the conflicts between A-Io and Thu read as directly analogous to the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.Again, as pure writing, this is an elegant book. That's why I gave it three stars, even if I think some of the politics and the assumptions behind them are flawed.For a fictionalized account of how true anarchy might REALLY function, I recommend Larry Niven's story, \\"Cloak of Anarchy.\\" As Larry himself is known to have quipped, the problem with anarchy is that it's too delicate; it falls apart at the slightest touch."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Thank you, Mrs. Le Guin, this book is a great gift for the reader."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Quite conceivably the best SF novel ever written - if that phrase means anything at all. There are two different achievements in this novel. Firstly, it is a superb portrayal of the mind of a scientist, showing the slow conceptual struggle towards a new idea (instantaneous communication). Worth reading just for that. The second achievement is that UlG explores the balance between the individualistic and collectivist strains in all societies. The device that she uses for this is a world (Urras) much like earth which contains mixed economies and socialist states around which orbits a moon (Annarres) containing an exiled colony of anarchists. The protagonist, Shevek, is a physicist on Annarres who becomes aware of the constraints of the anarchistic society and journeys to Urras. Here he sees the limitations of state power, whether capitalist or socialist. The superb, and vitally important, narrative structure that is used is Shevek's concept of simultanaeity: the novel intertwines two narratives (Shevek leaves Annares, and Shevek leaves Urras) which allows UlG to raise the problems with both types of system simultaneously. This is not a political rant (or Rand, perhaps) but a story about an enquiring mind. And yes, it does have characters. It does what SF is supposed to do: it frees us from the tyranny of present fashion."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"As his anarchist society threatens to degenerate into hierarchy and authoritarianism, brilliant physicist/philosopher Shevek decides to shake things up in an attempt to jump-start the revolution that must be lived every day. So he heads off to the capitalist world of Urras - the historical home of his people from which they fled into self-imposed exile nearly 200 years earlier - in order to trade the extremely powerful \\"Grand Temporal Theory\\" that exists only in his head for a chance to forge connections between the people of Urras and the anarchists of nearby Annares.However, being an anarchist, Shevek is not a very good trader. He quickly finds himself trapped in an invisible prison, carefully isolated from the restless masses of Urras, while the leaders of Urras try to get the Grand Temporal Theory from him in order to establish their rule over the entirety of known space. Breaking out of his luxurious jail, Shevek joins up with socialist revolutionaries and tries to make sure his life's work is not misused.\\"The Dispossessed\\" is written in an interesting fashion, with flashbacks covering the course of Shevek's life routinely interrupting the narrative. While some might be annoyed by the story's resulting disjointedness, I personally was not bothered. The flashbacks let Le Guin explore her ideas of how an anarchist society would operate, how life, love and politics would work in a government-less world. For me, being able to explore the conflicts and tensions between society and the individual, between centralization and autonomy, between responsibility and freedom - this proved nearly as interesting as the plot itself.Although \\"The Dispossessed\\" is technically a work of science fiction, it seems to be primarily an exploration of society and the human spirit. The physics that forms the base of the plot is presented more as philosophy than hard science and the level of technology on Urras and Annares seems hardly more advanced than what exists today. Overall, this book has excellent characters, a good plot, and a whole approach that is sure to make you think about government, society, and humanity itself. Five stars."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"There are three groups of people in the world: those whose favorite LeGuin book is THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS; those whose favorite LeGuin book is THE DISPOSSESSED; and ... well, let's not waste our time on the poor fools who don't even have a favorite LeGuin book.I'm of the Dispossessed party. It's possibly the most perfect SF novel I've ever read, and certainly one of my five all-time favorites. (The other four? C.J. Cherryh's CYTEEN, Bruce Sterling's SCHISMATRIX, William Gibson's COUNT ZERO.) But whether you like The Dispossessed or hate it - and many readers do hate it - it is the book that changed everything. And you can't call yourself a science fiction reader until you've grappled with it.The Dispossessed is one of those sf novels, like Orwell's 1984, whose literary production values are so high that it's hard to talk about it purely as science fiction. It 's also a quiet novel, even by LeGuin's standards, and it offers pretty cold comfort to readers in search of high-tech thrills and chills. What it does offer is believable characters, unresolvable moral dilemmas, and ideas that will rattle around in your head for the rest of your life chipping away at the received orthodoxies.Read it. If you don't like it now, put it down and try again in five years or so. Repeat as needed. Eventually this book will change your life."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"my favorite book is &quot;grapes of wrath.&quot; number 2 is &quot;the fountainhead.&quot; number 3 is &quot;the dispossessed.&quot; it's a fascinating story of how life might be lived if there were true equality and no government. the little touches were nice, like how weeks were called &quot;decads&quot; and lasted 10 days and how the words for sex do NOT imply doing something to someone else (screw, nail, do) but rather an equal consensualness (copulate). also, i liked how the children were taught the ancient history of laws, cops and prisons and this prompted them to want to play &quot;jail&quot; with each begging to be the prisoner because they had no locked doors in their lives. The talk of this being a &quot;utopian&quot; world is interesting, because le guin takes great pains to show that the anarchist world is NOT utopian, just better than one where greed and violence are the driving forces. for anyone curious about how anarchy could really work, this is a must. but more so, it's a fun read with lots of action, love and ideas. i still think about shevak, just as i think about tom joad and howard roark."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This compact book is easy to read and absolutely gripping, yet it has a depth to it that unparalleled in any fiction I've read. I have re-read this book more than any other, and I never cease to contemplate the ideas contained in it.I can't even begin to describe all the issues that this book tackles, but to just name a few, it tackles: distribution of resources and its effect on a society, the relationship between language and culture, the hidden assumptions behind how we conduct scientific research, how people can coerce others in a non-violent environment, what motivates people to work, how people view relationships, etc. The most amazing thing is that the book relates these issues to each other: it shows how one area of life (for example scientific research) that we might think of as completely separate and unbiased, is actually intimately tied up in subjective areas (such as political beliefs, or the distribution of resources).This book is just amazing and everyone should read it!"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Ditto to all the five-star comments. I read this book after reading Left Hand for a class assignment and flipped-out over it (better than Left Hand - is that possible?) Le Guin has a way of getting under your skin - her characters are memorable with their thought-provoking dialogue. Le Guin is a very talented author - don't miss out!"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"It has been said that utopias are just social engineering, there are no human beings in utopias, only their functionalities. It may or may not be true in other utopias, but this &quot;ambigious&quot; utopia has real human beings in it. It is not about a perfect world, or a world where there is no suffering but only about an anarchistic (and I believe probably more human) world where the real freedom is not confused with capitalist slogans.Mrs. LeGuin is too clever to avoid her book becomming a book of slogans, a book to be preached. She, in her soft way, shows an alternative, not decides about the good and the bad.The book is not some science-fiction, it is a novel, and as great a novel as Crime and Punishment. It tells the story of Shevek, a great phycisist, a good lover, a wanderer, and an amator philosopher seeking for the truth. He is not a hero, he has his mistakes and virtues, like all of us.I think Mrs. LeGuin is one of the best writers of all times, and this novel may be her best. I have read it many many times, very few books inspired me as much. By the way, if you like LeGuin, I'd recommend you also to read &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Four Ways to Unforgiveness&quot; Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is a wonderful book, the best utopian novel written in English. The only comparable book is Zamyatin's We. The quality of writing is splendid. Set in a planetary system with 2 competing societies, a conventional capitalistic society on one planet and an anarchist utopia on its companion moon. The hero is a visionary scientist, a scientific revolutionary committed deeply to the ideals of his anarchist society. This book is one of the few that deals well with the issue of social obligations of scientists. It is a shrewd and often moving analysis of the necessity and costs of pursuing noble ideals and the obstinacy of human nature in the face of ideology. This is one of those genre works whose quality trascends its genre."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is a nice book, and it kept me engaged, amazingly. There isn't much action here, just interesting themes and thoughts and the struggles of one man to explore ideas and to fit into society, both of which become herculean tasks. Do not get this book if you want exciting sci-fi action or if you want sci-fi technology. This is a book for sociologists and explorers of human society."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This was one of LeGuin's earlier works and still one of her best -- second only, in my opinion, to _The Left Hand of Darkness._ Shevek is a once-in-a-century theoretical physicist and also an Odonion -- an anarcho-syndicalist on the world of Anarres, which is a satellite of the thoroughly capitalist-imperialist planet of Urras, from which the Odonians had removed themselves two centuries before. But Anarrian society is becoming infected with egoism and bureaucratic attitudes, and Shevek finds himself to deal any longer with the jealous resistance his theories have created among his scientific colleagues. Shevek and his friends undertake the necessity of rebelling against the permanent anarchist rebellion, and this involves Shevek making the journey to Urras, both to pursue his research and to attempt to communicate with the anarchist underground there. It's a fascinating story with very fully realized characters, both in their human personalities and in their sociopolitical attitudes. The Urras-Anarres dichotomy, of course, is a straw man LeGuin has set up for the purposes of exploring how a true anarchist society might function, and she succeeds admirably. This book won both the Hugo and the Nebula, and for good reasons!"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is an excellent book. I had to read it for class, so it was kind of a drag. However, after the first few chapters I became completely immersed in the book and could not put it down. It is very thoughtful, intelligent book that really questions our societies. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"There is no need for a lengthy discussion of Ursula le Guin's intriguing premise and fine execution, her masterful description of contending utopias. Other reviewers have done that.I do want to compliment the author on writing what is one of the finest depictions of love - that of Takver and Shevik - that I have read in any genre. Her prose is as always delicate and eloquent, suggesting great vistas with an economy of means that one can only read with joy and - I admit - envy. But these two characters...breathtaking. The warmth and earthiness of their love is infectious, and, implicitly, the strongest argument in favour of Anarres' ambigious utopia. I cannot recommend this wonderful book enough - oh, and one final qualification: slow? Lacking in action? This is completely dependent on your definition of action. If you think realistic character development is action, then this book is completely for you. If you think guns, swordfights and the like are the only way to constitute action, then you are less lucky - although I would add that the massacre in Nio Esseia is one of the most ghastly scenes I've ever read!Ursula le Guin makes few bones about her own philosophies - but even if you cannot agree with the direction of her thought, you can sit back and be warmed by her gentle, beautiful writing."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Which begs the question: aren't all utopias (beginning with the original) thoughtful? Yes and no. Quite a deal of thought usually goes into utopian societies, yet most, in my opinion, studiously ignore the question of how actual, real people would live in these societies. The populations of Utopian novels are often slightly plastic, as if they were facsimiles of people rather than the bonafide article.And this is where Le Guin steps in. The anarchist society she depicts in The Dispossessed is clearly utopian, but there is trouble in paradise. Isolated and calcifying, the society on Annares is crumbling. Why? Because as well-organized as it is, it ignores certain human tendencies (inertia, dogmatism, and those other insidious beasts of the mind) that threaten the ideals of freedom the society was founded on.But all this tells you nothing about the story. In a word, it's wonderful. Like most sci-fi, the preoccupation with some imagined changes--in this case mostly sociological and political--can distract one from the plot, but overall the characters are well-developed and believable. Le Guin is a talented, impassioned writer, and she shines in The Dispossessed. The pages are overflowing with ideas, impressions, events, and emotions that are at once intimate and inspiring.I'm ending this review. If you've read Le Guin but not The Dispossessed, do yourself a favor and read it now. You won't be disappointed; in my opinion its easily her best sci-fi novel. If you haven't read Le Guin at all, do yourself a favor and read her now; in my opinion she's easily one of the best writers in science-fiction or in any field."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This book deserves to take its place among the classics that explore the possibilities of creating a just and content society. Unlike Walden 2, or Utopia, the thesis of the Dispossessed is that utopias cannot be realized: the anarchist society of the title already carries the seeds of its own destruction. This is a necessary read for those who mistakenly believe that the &quot;End of History&quot; has arrived."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This book is very involved and chalanges you to think, like most of Ursula Le Guin's book it chalanges our values and our ideas of morality. Not a &quot;light&quot; read but one worth reading more than once.It is classic science fiction like early Asimov and Heinlein. I have read hundreds of books and own over a hundred mostly Science Fiction this book has been my favorite for over a decade, ever since I first read it."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"The Disposessed is one of the best books that I have ever read. The plot, setting, and characters stand alone as an excellent novel, but LeGuin goes further, weaving in a full political dialogue about anarchism, capitalism, and the meaning of freedom. I would recommend this book for anyone who likes to think."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is my favorite Le Guin book. As much a political science book as science fiction.Also one one of the feew utopias written after WW2. The title refers to an anarchist society that lives on the moon who do not have possesion. Far from one sided this book shows the problems of both societies through the eyes of Shevek,an Anarres Physicst. Shevek has problems with both his society because the descendents have lost their political idealism and with Urras' because the greed and corruption of it's captialism . A complex work of thought with no easy to find solutions. And a good introduction to the theories of Anarchism."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This book is a five hundred page social commentary, decribing a utopian communist commune. The main character is a physist who is out to resolve conflicts withing the communes planet and it's sister plant. A Earthlike planet with a political situation, not unlike the one we have now.The reason I &quot;disliked&quot; the book is the political and social commentary that is at the center of this book just did not sit with me at all. Le Guin just didn't convince me that this society had fixed the issues within communism and anarcy that make them unstable, and have led to some of the most promising nations in the last hundrend years and driven them into the ground. It would be nice if people could live the way she suggests, but the book does not give any real answers. A famous econimist recently stated in his book that all econimic systems are inherantly unstable, and that strong regalotory systems are needed to stop periodic crashes and times of econimic chaos. This hurts this book because this is a political book that is about the politics of a perfect world, and validity of the political system is the center of the story.That being said, this is a brilliant piece of writting. As much as I disliked the politics of this book, the story is very well told, with engaging characters, and a well depicted world. I find it nice to sometimes read books about ideas I disagree with, it makes me re-evaluate my point of view, either changing my ideas or making my beliefs stronger.This book did not change my political ideas at all, but it at least gave a good account of itself. And that makes it well worth reading, no matter how distastefull the book feels."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Like her Left Hand Of Darkness, Le Guin's Dispossessed is a sharp commentary on the insanities of human society. Yet what has stayed with me over the years since I first met Shevek is the integrity of this truly good man who stands firm in what he believes. While Le Guin pulls no punches when it comes to deprivation and human pain, I finished the book with a sense of hope for a hopeless world."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"The title of my review says it all. When it comes to philisophical soft SF jam packed with insights into the contemporary world, there's no one better than LeGuin. Shevek, in my opinion, remains one of the most well-written characters ever to come out of science fiction. Be sure to read this one along with her earlier work, The Left Hand of Darkness."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Another wonderful book from Le Guin. My only advice is don't give up on it too early. The book is a bit hard to follow at first because it takes place in two separate time lines that interchange from one chapter to the next (which is a great little technique, since the main character is a physicist studying the nature of time and space).Once you reach the end, it all makes sense....and if you read it carefully, it will almost certainly lead you to ask some serious questions about whether our society makes very much sense. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Le Guin's &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; deserves the accolades it has received. It is a tremendous example of soft sci-fi, with little high-tech wizardry (though this book does contain the oldest reference to an instantaneous-communication ansible I have encountered), but deep character developement and social commentary.Unfortunately, I just could not find either of her hypothetical societies believable. The capitalistic Urras seemed to be a mix of 21st century technology and 18th century ethics. Though at face value, Urras appears to be a scathing condemnation of capitalism, a deeper look shows the problems on Urras result less from its free markets than from its totalitarian government and rampant &quot;isms&quot;. Likewise, the anarchistic, communist utopia on the moon Anarres also did not ring true. Le Guin simply did not convince me that the inherent conflicts of anarchy and communism could be resolved. People on Anarres did not shirk duties or commit crimes, even though they did not have self-interest (ala capitalism) or the threat of force (ala totalitarianism) to bring them in to line. Le Guin seems to explain this by proper education, social pressure, and child-rearing, which I couldn't swallow. I did enjoy her pointed commentary on the tyranny of the majority (even absent the rule of law), and of the oppression of the individual by social pressure for conformity.Overall, this rates as a sci-fi classic - even though it barely qualifies as sci-fi at all. Le Guin's best work."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Two inhabited worlds, each with a claim at being a perfect utopia: Urras is a wealthy planet, full of haves and have-nots, warring nations and vast resources and Anarres is its almost barren moon. Anarres is populated by anarchist rebels who fled Urras generations ago to try to create a perfect society where everything is shared.This is the story of a brilliant physicist, Shevek, born on Anarres. He grows up with the political ideals of his society, but it seems as if his own culture and people have no use for his theories of physics. His academic adviser proves to be corrupt and plagiarizes his work. Eventually he loses his academic post, and is sent to toil at physical labor far from his family. Eventually he and a group of childhood friends start their own publishing company and begin corresponding with scientists on Urras.This arouses strong feelings. Shevek's own mother accuses him of betraying his society. Eventually he decides he must risk everything to go to Urras. Only there will he find the resources and the time to complete his great labor of physics. So he goes, not knowing if he will ever be able to return. But once he is there he discovers that he can not let the secrets of his work fall into the hands of those who would use them only to gain more wealth and power over the poor and oppressed.How does a man chose between the ideals of his heart and his life's work?This is a work of classic science fiction, where ideas clash instead of spaceships blowing each other up. Real philosophical questions are posed. Instead of good versus evil, LeGuin has poised a question of good versus good. This book is only for the thoughtful. The richness of its meaning will sink in deeper with every reading. Not for stupid people, but worthy of the highest recommendation all the same."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is one of LeGuin's great thought experiments. It is interestingto compare it to her later, more tribalist, _Always Coming Home_.This is a smart book. It's full of ideas and speculation. It may not always succeed in its aims-- I for one found the sexism in her 'egalitarian' Annares irritating-- but it's a grand work of imaginary anthropology. She tries to lay bare for us the workings of two societies, the anarcho-syndicalist Annares and its capitalist home world.Whatever its problems, the fact of LeGuin's having attempted something that no one had ever done in Science Fiction before makes this worth looking at."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Read on, I'll get to the book...all this initial background is essential to my review.Don't listen to what others claim I believe, I'll tell you what I believe.As an avowed anarchist, I am appalled by mainstream perceptions of Anarchism. Most people confuse Anarchism with Nihlism (nothing matters, so take what you can--rape and plunder). When I insist that political Anarchism is actually quite the opposite--in fact it aims at creating an egalitarian, ultra-democratic, socialist society--most people can't or won't understand. I even had a professor of history at the U. of Barcelona who laughed about Anarchists during the Spanish Civil war as \\"People who don't believe in anything trying to have a political philosophy\\" (revealing himself absolutely unqualified to teach).Of course all these misconceptions are carefully nurtured by the prevailing orthodoxy (similar to intentional mainstream mirepresentations about Socialism) because the true philosophy, if understood correctly in the mainstream, might (I believe WOULD) attract mass support and thus become a real threat to the power elite. Such mass support has happened many times in the past, and governments have learned to carefully control how ideas are presented in the mainstream (Orwellian Newspeak). All governments hate Anarchism above even Communism and Socialism, because we want to do away with all institutional power, unequal wealth, and arbitrary privilege--starting with theirs.The truth is, Anarchism is simply the belief that all arbitrary power by one individual or group over another inevitably leads to abuse of that power. Political Anarchism attempts to find ways of organizing society that avoid such arbitrary power (in business, governments, families, and all human associations). This normally involves communal decision making, collective property ownership, and grass roots democracy in pure form.After explaining this to the person questioning me and getting a blank stare in return, if I deem them genuinely interested (as opposed to only feigning interest as justification for thier attempt to debunk Anarchism and teach me how foolish I am) I refer them to \\"The Dispossessed\\", by Ursula Le Guin.\\"The Dispossessed\\" is, as far as I know, the most eloquent and nuanced study ever put into print of how a true Anarchist society MIGHT look (not the only form such a society might take though). LeGuin illustrates the thinking, education, advantages, disadvantages, development, and pitfalls inherent in Anarchism, and contrasts it with totalitarian Communism and of course with our \\"holy Capitalism.\\"It's also a great sci-fi work, in the tradition of Asimov, Bradbury, or Heinlein. By that I mean sci-fi for thinking people, not action fanatics.This book will bore cartoonish sci-fi fans, generate confusion and rage in Republicans, Libertarians, and other reactionary proto-Fascists, cause nausea in rightious hipoChristians, baffle adolescent minds of all stripes, and provoke argument from Communists. But for true intellectuals it will never fail to generate personal epiphanies--even if you don't \\"agree\\" with anarchism. Also, for the capitalist power elite who want to better understand their enemies, this could be useful. Fortunately, most of the power elite believe their own propaganda (Orwellian Doublethink)--and so would find this book baffling and blasphemous.Le Guin is a brilliant intellectual, not to mention a fantastic author. Few fiction writers match her nuanced thinking, multi-faceted characters, and social insight. The Dispossessed showcases these qualities in the best way. Obviously I'm biased toward this particular book because of the subject matter, but other of her works also demonstrate her amazing mind and writing talent.Want to understand the essential underlying issues in all politics and history? A good place to start your education would be to read this book. Want sci-fi that actually explores the implications of a truly alien society? This book is also for you.This book is about the struggle for freedom. Marx said \\"...all history is the history of class warfare.\\" He was right, but could also have explained it: \\"...all history is the history of the struggle for freedom.\\" Same thing.Do your own thinking people..."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I keep coming back to this book and still consider it one of the best novels I've ever read. It's interesting and inspiring, and only \\"science fiction\\" because it's set on another world."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"There are so many reviews of this book I wondered whether to contribute to this \\"discussion\\".I think I have something to add.Le Guin deserves to be given credit for imagining an ideal society and acknowledging that like any other society it has it's flaws.I suspect that this society will only appeal to radical egalitarians.Anarres strikes me as being a dour,puritanical and overly utilitarian place.It's very conformist and beneath the surface there is a current of ugly authoritarianism that seems ready to break out into murderous violence with a little provacation.It's this that would likely be the death of the society.It stuck me at a certain point that Anarres biggest problem is it's priggish insistence on trying to supress any division of labor.Shevek is the universes greatest physicist.However he can't devote himself to that exclusively because he has to dig ditches and clean latrines periodically.I'm not suggesting that Shevek is too good for manual labor.I'm suggesting it's a waste of time and resources.At one point,shevek reflects on the concept of economics and is utterly dissmisive.Foolish man!At its most basic level economics is an analysis of scarcity.You'd think on a planet noted for its scarcity this would be of some interest.Unfortunately the Anarreans and Ursula LeGuin think economics is essentially an aspect of the false conciousness of capitalism.Anarres is probably doomed by its own inflexability.It will probably degenerate into Maoism if it doesn't open itself up to capitalism.I kept thinking what would be wrong with Shevek working in a think tank?a university?a private corporation? Well he can't do that because those aren't allowed.The paradox here is that \\"freedom\\" has diminished not increased choice.You might get the impression I don\\"t like this book.On the contary,any book that makes think this much is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is an excellent novel of ideas. Leguin portrays a nearly stateless society based on small groups of communes inhabiting a arid planet. The residents are exiles from a capitalistic planet, and Leguin uses the capitalist planet as a foil for her utopia. The novel was written in the early 70s when there were still hundreds, maybe thousands of active communes across America and the book is a speculation about how these social ideas might play out if used on a large scale society. The subtitle is 'an ambiguous utopia', Leguin tries to be realistic about the problems that human nature presents to such a society. My only criticism of this novel is that the pace is a bit slow at times, following the life history of the main protagonist sometimes in too much detail."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is not a review of the content of the book, but the text itself, specifically the Kindle edition. I am not 10 pages in yet and have already encountered multiple dangling sentence endings and incorrect words (e.g. \\"dock\\" instead of \\"clock\\"). I'm sure this is a great book, but I can't recommend paying $8 for an electronic copy riddled with typographical errors. Yes, it's perfectly readable and comprehensible, but it's annoying and I would expect better from a major publisher."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This book shows both the social and personal effects of both types of government organization. It also tells the tale of a naive and brainy rocket scientist named Shevek whose genius is stifled by being stuck on a barely habitable moon. This book is great as pure fiction, the social commentary just makes it even better. Definitely the best &quot;utopian&quot; novel I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"We have the planet Urras with a single large moon called Arrakis. Urras is very like Earth; the main difference is that their moon is (marginally) habitable. Having discovered this early on, the Urrans became capable of space travel much earlier in their political-social development than we did on Earth.Just as they develop the ability to explore and exploit their moon, there arises an anarcosocialistic philosopher called Odo. Her followers become troublesome, and are invited to remove to Arrakis to build a utopian society on their own.Now, LeGuin is no Marxist herself; having been raised in \\"the People's Republic of Berkely\\" (her parents were professors at UC/B; her father was a famous anthropologist, although I don't remember her mother's field), she was aware of and sympathetic to Marxist theory and ideas. However, like any halfway aware person, she knew what happened in Russia, China, etc. when these countries attempted to set up Marxist societies.\\"Ah!\\" say a defender of Communist theory,\\"That is because not everyone in a country is equally committed to realizing the ideal. Many don't understand it; many oppose it. That is why these attempts have failed.\\" Please remember that most Communists are, at least, at first, well-meaning reformers; most really want to make the world a better place, even if they become corrupted once they get into power. Lenin and Trotsky really wanted to make Russia a better place, and Mao firmly belived (at least at first) that Communism would make China great; Stalin was another kettle of fish entirely, or course.LeGuin responds, \\"OK, let's have a group of colonists, all True Believers, go off and try to establish a this Utopia on their own, where the 'dead hand' of the old ways won't effect them.\\" The novel is a result of this thought-experiment; she could as easily have chosen Plato's Republic, except that nobody has seriously tried to establish a Platonic state, and several people have tried to establish Marxist ones.These events happened about 200 years before the start of the book. On Urras, we have various nation-states dominated by two powers which have a strong similarity to the United States and the late, unlamented Soviet Union. On Arrakis, the descendants of the Odoites maintain their ideological experiment. And it works, more or less. But at what a price! Individualism is repressed not by government--as there is none per se--but by social pressure to conform. Originality and excellence are frowned upon, for they lead to inequality and thus inequity. Stifled by this dull, grey, conformist society, a brilliant young Arraki physicist defects to Urras, the first Arraki in 200 years to do so.Of course, Urras is no better. All the excesses of Western Capitalism are seen in the one major country, while all the evils of Soviet Communism are seen in the other--all exaggerated to be sure that the reader does not miss the point. Due to there being no Democratic Socialists in the Capitalist country, the government has not been moved to construct even a minimal 'safety net', and the Communist country (for similar reasons) is more brutal than the Soviet Union or Red China were even in the worst Stalinist/Maoist stages. The exile of the Odoists was seen at the time to be a preventive of revolution, but Urras lost something important when they left.Although LeGuin is sympathetic to the ideals of Arrakis, she knows human nature too well not to know that the Utopian society there can't work without repressing significant aspects of that nature, but rather than telling us this she shows us how this repression can't be kept up, and how the Odoist experament can't be kept up much longer.I did not give this more than three stars as, while the ideas were interesting, it takes more than interesting ideas to make a good novel. The plot is merely a hook upon which to hang the ideas, and none of the characters are very memorable."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I don't think le guin was advocating this &quot;utopia&quot;.

Pages and pages of talk about government styles and philosophies. I suppose this was meant to topical at the time but it comes off as fake and heavy handed. Something else that seemed very odd to me; the author uses 'technical' terms for everything except toilet use which is referred to as with a certain curse word.Obviously a lot of people liked this novel, and was the main reason I read it in the first place. For me, however, it was boring and pointless."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This review was given one star only because I could not give less, and this review is NOT about the book, but is about the profiteering practised by its publisher.HarperCollins must be trying to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. Charging $13.77 for a digital copy of a book that sells for as low as $4.65 in paperback should rank as damn near a crime. The paperback at least used paper and ink, but the ebook cost the publisher virtually nothing!!Hell will freeze over (or the Cubs will win the Series, equally likely) before I would pay three times the price of a paperback for an ebook!!"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This book is a good read and has some insights worthwhile, but nothing spectacular. Basically the best thing I received from the book is &quot;excess is excrement&quot;, too bad the author could not have followed her own advice when writing this book, which is largely a discourse on Anarchism. Don't wast your time, unless you're looking for a description of how a &quot;Utopic&quot; Anarchy itself could work. Looking at the genre of science fiction itself, I recommend: &quot;Flowers For Algernon,&quot; by Daniel Keyes, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey,&quot; by Arthur C. Clarke, &quot;Dune&quot; by Frank Herbert, or &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; by Orson Scott Card."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is a truly loathsome world that was created here.

The landscape of Anterres and that of Australia melded very well.

Each time I find a new nuisance. This year I was amazed by the small physics description of how when you throw an object, theoretically, it could never hit another object as it is always between two points in the arc--the length of space between always having a halfway point.Read the book.Think about the fact you may never reach the end of your travel because you'll always be a the half-way point!"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"The Dispossessed is the best book I have read so far and I think Le Guin is the best writer of the ages.When I was at the last quarter of the book; I didn't want to read it any more.

For a long while I have been telling everyone my favorite author is Ursula LeGuin. I read all her stuff when I was a teenager and now, 20 years on, have re-read much of it (Left Hand, Rocannon, Planet of Exile, Lathe of Heaven) and enjoyed it enormously again. But for some reason I had never read The Dispossessed until last week. Having read the reviews on this page, I was looking forward to it very keenly.However, I found the book tedious and very disappointing. If it hadn't been written 5 years *after* Left Hand of Darkness it might be seen as a rehearsal for that much better book. But where Left Hand of Darkness is lean and exciting, The Dispossessed is full of boring backstory. Left Hand starts with a parade in Ehrenrang, where we meet the key players whose intrigue will absorb us for the next 300 odd pages - and then we're running. It's an opening sequence Burgess would have been proud of. Dispossessed starts off slow, and then is constantly bogged down by its non linear format: interspersing current events on Urras with Shevek's backstory on his home moon of Anarres. No doubt this parallel telling of the moons' stories is necessary for getting across the concept of &quot;simultaneity&quot; which is Shevek's life's work. The bigger problem is that there is nothing much happening on *either* moon, until Shevek's climactic entry into Annarian politics in the latter part of the book. And that is not a great payoff either, I'm afraid.In all the navel gazing and study of Le Guin's work, people tend to forget that she started off as a great storyteller. The Dispossessed is perhaps where it began to come off the rails.The book is certainly NOT a good introduction to people who haven't read any LeGuin. I would advise them to read Left Hand of Darkness or Lathe Of Heaven. If you don't mind a little science in your SF, Rocannon's World is also great, and in fact science-phobics can read this latter book as a &quot;swords and sorcery&quot; yarn, with a couple of spaceships and a radio (OK, an &quot;ansible&quot;) thrown in.Anyway, on balance, UKLG still rules. So I'll raise to 2*"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I read with great enjoyment her \\"Left Hand of Darkness,\\" and had high hopes for more of the same. While both build slowly, \\"The Dispossessed\\" was teeth-grindingly slow and after half the book I gave up on it ever going anywhere. The protagonist is dull and somewhat unpleasant, and if the hero is going to have those kind of flaws he or she'd better be doing some pretty interesting stuff. Well, he is, sort of. He is trying to bring together the Lunar people and their Earth kin, or the Soviets and the west, or the environmentalists and the capitalists, or some such metaphorical split. Mostly the communists and the capitalists, and one is reminded how defining the cold war was to that era. How quickly we forget. However most of the action takes place in his head, in his own bare and spartan thoughts, and the heroic nature of his \\"betrayal\\" of his country in the interest of unity and truth is never really conveyed to the reader on any kind of emotional level.The writing itself is splendid, the Sci Fi is only a context, but if you've read her stuff you know what you're getting into there, but again there is no action, no real tension, at least not in the first half. It may turn out great, I'll probably finish it eventually, but the author shouldn't demand of the reader that they endure 200 pages of prose just on the hope that it might get better later."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Le Guin is known for rich detailed background. That's what I found, except the societies in this novel are so ... blah.It all comes across as too symbolic; sci-fi as moral template of current politics. Like Rand-lite for geeks. Oh, she dives into the nuts and bolts of each world. Yet there's no passion. No intrigue. It's all laid out like a thesis, when it should be more of a fiery sermon.I only made it halfway through this novel, until I simply avoided opening it again. I love the detail, but I am pushed away by the sterility."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Shevek, um m&eacute;dico brilhante, que vive em Anarraes (uma lua de Urras), decide procurar respostas e questionar o inquestion&aacute;vel, tentando derrubar os muros do &oacute;dio que isolam seu mundo de anarquia, do resto do universo civilizado.Anarraes &eacute; um planeta de anarquistas que experimentam o no-autoritarismo que enfatiza a comunidade e a cooperao, e que tem de aproveitar ao m&aacute;ximo os recursos limitados de seu planeta des&eacute;rtico, para evitar a ameaa constante da fome.H&aacute; duzentos anos Anarres est&aacute; isolado de Urras, exceto pelos valiosos minerais que so enviados atrav&eacute;s de seu espaoporto.A filosofia de Anarres &eacute; baseada nos escritos de Odo, uma mulher com id&eacute;ias baseadas no comunismo puro.

But it's really worth it. The story deals with the possibility of creating a functional anarchistic society, and the problems linked with doing so. The storyline is difficult to decribe here, so I just advise you all to read this book and be enlightened, for it is truly brilliant."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Le Guin, anthropologist-turned-sci/fi author, writes about aninteresting anarchic society, failing only to realize thatdecentralization is key to stability for any utopia. (Otherwise, anysuch society can be conquered at its central control point[s]."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"First off, if you're looking for action, this book is not for you. The Dispossessed is very much a novel of ideas, esp. those current in 1974, and these are expressed mainly through complex characters, and secondly, through thinly-disguised analogies to geopolitical states and ideologies on our planet (which itself makes a late, crucial appearance as \\"Terra\\"). But for a book written as the Cold War was still chugging along, the grand opposition between the capitalist US (aka A-Io) and the communist USSR (Thu) is, interestingly, quite back-burnered by LeGuin herein. Most subsequent histories of the New Left, whether sympathetic to that movement or not, assume that it was primarily socialist in spirit, but LeGuin shrewdly estimates its vaguely defined ideology to have been anarchist in character. At least in the US context, she's pretty dead-on with that assessment (and if you aren't willing to acknowledge that there's a big difference between the two, you're probably not going to like this book anyway). Furthermore, rather than writing a paean to presumed anarchist wisdom, LeGuin subjects her \\"ambiguous utopia\\" of Annares (which is her stand-in for that ideology as \\"organized\\" in [non]state form) to penetrating but fair criticisms, from a perspective that Orwell would have deemed \\"inside the whale.\\" In this respect, her book thus reflects the profound disillusionment felt among the immediate post-Vietnam American Left at the time she wrote. The book's social commentary is weakest, I think, with regard to its feminist themes: women are treated unbelievably badly in A-Io's society, far more so than any reasonably objective assessment of their standing in analogous post1950s America could claim. It is also an interesting lapse, in light of the time it was written, that racial themes play no role whatsoever in the book, even though gendered ones do, not just vis-a-vis feminism but in a handful of apparently gay characters as well. In any case, The Dispossessed can be read productively alongside Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) as period-piece bookends that together represent mutually reinforcing skeptical (some might say cynical) attitudes toward the 60s counterculture. (Heinlein's, however, is the superior and more durable novel of the two, at least in my opinion.)"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is possibly one of the most hypocritical chunks of literature I have ever been forced to read. There is nothing here to praise except an unlikeable, dull, and whiney man who is truly not as impressive as he is made out to be. The author tried so hard to create a utopian world where things were supposed to be so efficient as compared to the motherworld that she wants the reader to look past the fact that she gives Shevek everything he is not supposed to want or need. The whole story winds up based around a nuclear family and personal ambition, the very things that she tried so hard to make her readers see past as a cultural need. Also, if I wanted to read anthropological theory in massive chunks, I would go to my bookshelf and pull down one of my many anthro text books."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Science fiction has often described libertarian societies and ideals. Think of such works as Heinlein's \\"Stranger in a Strange Land,\\" Russell's \\". . .and Then There Were None,\\" and Williamson's \\"The Equalizer,\\" among others. One of the most explicit of science fiction works on a society characterized by freedom is Ursula LeGuin's \\"The Dispossessed.\\"At one point in the history of the planet Urras, a feisty woman named Odo led a movement for freedom, for liberty, for anarchism. Finally, Urras ceded the moon, Anarres, to her movement. Here an \\"ambiguous utopia\\" developed, as per the subtitle of this book.The primary character in this novel is Shevek, a physicist on Anarres. As the novel proceeds, he becomes concerned that the original promise of the libertarian society is being lost. Over time, something like \\"a tyranny of the majority\\" is creeping into society. Nonconformists are subtly (and not so subtly) penalized. Obviously, this undermines the concept of a libertarian society. His friend, who starts him thinking along these lines, Bedap, Says: \\"You can't crush ideas by suppressing them. You can only crush them by ignoring them.\\" He goes on to point out that Odo herself had mentioned this as a threat.The society on Anarres is a kind of amalgam of a Kropotkin anarcho-communist society (in terms of the production and distribution of goods and services) and a Stirnerite individualist society. At one point, Shevek decided to visit the home planet, Anarres. He comes to understand the promise of Anarres--and the threat to the vision of freedom.Upon his return, he begins an effort to organize in such a manner as to renew the ideals that Odo had raised and advocated for. As he said later on in the novel: \\"That the Odonian society on Anarres had fallen short of the ideal did not, in his eyes, lessen his responsibility to it; just the contrary.\\" Later, he argues that \\". . .we didn't come to Anarres for safety, but for freedom.\\"The novel sometimes drags a little, as discussion and debate might slow the action. But, in the end, this novel works very nicely. And it raises issues that all of us need to think about. What are our country's ideals? How far should we go to undermine those just to have \\"security\\" (whatever that means)? In many respects, this novel speaks to American ideals after 9/11. Do we turn our back on those ideals for security? Where is the fine line between undermining the ideals of the Founding Fathers to maintain security or to demand freedom and undermine the need for security? Such questions are raised in this work, indicating that it addresses critical issues of relevance to all of us, long after its original publication."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I tentatively picked up this book at the age of 10, guiltily not sure if I was allowed to read an \\"adult\\" book. Although it's protagonist was a physicist and I hated science, this became my favorite book. It offers amazing insights into the innermost thoughts and feelings of one man. Shevek was completley real to me and I could completely empathize with him. I loved the scene when Shevek, as a youth in class, disproves his society's current scientific edicts. The anger in the teachers eyes taught me that people don't always react to the truth kindly. All the characters in this book are utterly genuine, from Shevek's friend who gets exiled from \\"Anarchist\\" society for being too controversial to the fawning housewife on the foreign planet who gives Shevek his first exposure to women with shaved legs. A great quote is when someone asks Shevek if it's true that Men and Women are treated exactly the same on his planet. And Shevek answers \\"That would be a waste of good equipment.\\""},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is one of my all time favorites.Reading over the other reviews, I hope people don't get the wrong idea. Sure, this is a very smart book that explores the possibilities of anarchy in a serious, philosophical way. But even though those things interest me, didactic science fiction with a MESSAGE is usually incredibly boring. This is not that kind of a sci-fi book. LeGuin writes a story with intelligent, real, flawed characters, and I find myself drawn in every time I go back to the book. Buy it for the story; the philosophy is a bonus if you like that kind of thing. (Of course, if you like zap, blam sci-fi, don't get this book.)"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Both The Dispossessed and The Left Hand of Darkness are modern masterpieces. Mrs. LeGuin's writing is thought-provoking, complex, mythical, and, I believe, more fantasy than sci-fi. Her lineage can be traced more to Tolkien than to Asimov. The Dispossessed displays a deep understanding of culture and human sociology, just as The Left Hand of Darkness displays a real exploration of myth-making and religion. If you want your characters cut out along dotted lines and a book's ideas to not make you think too hard, then these books are not for you. If, however, you expect the books you read to be interactive, offering a dialogue rather than a monologue, than I highly suggest you give these books a try. For those people that rate these books below a 5, stick to Grisham and Crichton."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This was required reading in my Science Fiction class at Penn State (in 1983), and for good reason. The Dispossessed is not great science fiction, it is great fiction that happens to be science fiction. Ms LeGuin has written a masterful book that could be set in any era, anywhere. I, as other reviewers have mentioned, have given this book as a gift -- to non sci-fi readers who have been extremely pleased with it. Do not miss the opportunity to step into The Dispossessed. I have no need to buy this book from Amazon as I still have my copy from 1983, but have gone out of my way to review it here anyhow, fourteen years later. That is the kind of impact this novel had on me.The Dispossessed is in my top five of all time, and by far the best science fiction book I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Shevek is a physicist from a world of anarchists who finds the only way to spread his revolutionary ideas of temporal physics is to visit the world who exiled his culture nearly 200 years ago. In this act and in those leading to and from it, he brings a reexamination of the revolutionary anarchy of the desolate moon Anarres as well as casts a gaze on the stratified capitalist world of Urras.Set in the same universe of LeGuin's other space stories, _The_Dispossessed_ critiques the capitalism of late 20th century Western culture, with its proxy wars and gender inequities, the failings of idealized communist societies which succumb to human drives for power through buereacracy, as well as the drive in both to maintain a status quo.In addition, Shevek's struggle to unify linear and circular views of temporal physics parallels Einstein's (or Ainsetain's (sic))and modern physics struggles to unify general relativity with quantum mechanics. This, along with insights into the perils of dual career families and academic politics round out the tale.Shevek, is perhaps the only fully realized character and he serves as the readers eyes onto the two Cetian societies and thus the aforementioned critique of our own. So, while I did identify and feel empathy for Shevek, it was the social descriptions and plot which kept me from putting the book down more than once to sleep, over the course of 24 hours.Are you possessed by your possessions? by your ideas?"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"This is a rare book of science ficiton that transcends the often masculine, ultra-high tech prose that dominates the genre. Le Guin's father (Kroeber) was one the founders of Anthropology as a discpline and this fasicination with the possibilities of human culture is what drives this book. It is not, as some people say, a rant against capitalism or cannonizing anarchy as the tonic for human ill rather this book opens up the possibilites of human organization, of human culture. If you enjoy the themes of alientation and the idea cultural evolution then you will likely enjoy this book. If your'e more into fast paced, kill the aliens, type prose then you'll be better off dismissing this book as a cold war relic."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"The Dispossessed is my favorite work by le Guin-- this is the book I give a copy of to everyone I know. It covers so much ground; you have the whole anarchy vs archism, of course, but gender roles are well explored, theories of time, all sides of the human mental/emotional/social experience that you can fit into a story; there are no one-dimensional characters in this book. Of all the friends i've given this to, there isn't one who hasn't enjoyed it, and there isn't one who hasn't told me how much it made them think."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"For those stupid Sci-Fi painted covers bore me to death and this one makes the book seem just another vaguely interesting Sci-Fi novel. Believe me, it is not really Sci-Fi at all - the story doesn't happen on earth, but that is the only Sci-Fi thing about this book. Sorry I won't go into detail. The weird thing is that I am always more than suspicious when people say that books changed their lives...this one didn't change my life, but left me deeply impressed and deeply thinking about different realities within countries and -generally- larger groups of human beings. Anyways-if you don't find it generally stupid to think a bit from time to time on how else life could be get this book. It is very smart and very fascinating."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"While reading this book, I couldn't help but get the feeling that it is an Atlas Shrugged but for the Left Libertarians rather then the Right Libertarians. They are both books of Idealistic politics and morality. But there is a major difference between the two. Whereas Atlas Shrugged is one-sided propaganda that could hardly be called critical, The Dispossessed is not a fawning love-portrait. Ursula K. Le Guin does not accept Anarchism with the feverent faith that Ayn Rand accepted Capitalism. She recognized that problems would certainly arise, and true to Libertarian form, she addresses these problems in The Dispossessed. Shevek is no John Galt, and that is why The Dispossessed is simply the best novel of Idealistic politics out there."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I highly recommend this book. Very nice character developement and a plot that examines societal issues from different perspectives. It is nice to read a novel that makes its point in one book."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Excellent science fiction with a strong sociological-cultural angle. Le Guin creates two compelling and radically different planets, and a fascinating character traveling between them. I love how she presents two such different worlds, with opposing views on the equality of sexes (among many other things) but does not judge them explicitly. Every choice we make as a culture has positive and negative effects, and this book demonstrates that well."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Despite being less well-known than her Earthsea books or The Left Hand of Darkness, Dispossessed is one of Le Guin's best, a fine political allegory in SF form. The story revolves around the cultural clash of a member of an anarchist world encountering a society much like ours.(Side note: if you think anarchism means throwing bricks through Starbucks windows, you need to watch less TV. Anarchism is a political \\"ism\\" with as long a history as Marxism. The easiest way to convey it to an American is as a \\"libertarian socialist\\".)"},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"Recently, I've read a number of books written by Ursula LeGuin. This after having somehow avoided her for the last forty years, largely as a result of her Earthsea cycle. I've come to enjoy her science fiction with an anthropological slant, best represetned by The Left Hand of Darkness and her Hainish tales. This novel takes it a liitle further, adding a very philosophical political commentary to the sociological layer of the story.Our backdrop is the Tau Ceti system, and more particularly the inhabited planets of Anvarres and Urras. Urras is the cradle of Cetian civilization and is composed of several different nation states, the two most prominent being A-Io and Thu; the former, a free market capitalist state (think United States) and the latter an authoritarian Communist state (think U.S.S.R.). It would seem that 200 years in the past, the underclass of A-Io revolted under the leadership of an anarchist/libertarian by the name of Odo. The Odoists were gathered up and settled on the stark, barely survivable moon, Anvarres. There, they built their ideal anarchist society, with no concept of ownership or personal entitlement. Pronouns such as \\"my\\" and \\"mine\\" were not even part of their language. The worst insult from an Anvarren would be to term someone an \\"egoist\\" or \\"profiteer\\". Their motto: \\"No one starves while others eat.\\" Though plenty starved. The two planets are almost completely isolated from one another.Our protagonist is an Anvarren physisist, Shevek. Shevek cannot fully explore his ground breaking theories (involving instantaeous space travel, Simulaneity) on Anvarres and is invited to study and publish in A-Io, an unprecedented turn of events. It is Shevek's journey to A-Io, his observations and the interactions between the several competing political systems that make up this novel. There is a second thread which describes the lead up to Shevek's journey, in which we learn more of the Anvarren, anarcho-socialist civilization, and its far from ideal operation.This novel becomes somewhat weighted with political discourse and even theoretical physics, sometimes to the detriment of the underlying story. However, by and large, it is a fair treatment of the various political systems, their strengths and weaknesses. We see two alien races interacting with the Cetians, the Terrans and the Hainish. For those familiar with the Hainish tales of LeGuin, we discover the source of the ansible, a communications device allowing instantaneous communication throughout space. The story is similar in style to Heinlein's The Moon is a Harsh Mistress in its socio-political overtones, but not as dense as some of Philip Dick's or Frank Herbert's work. Bottom line: A worthwhile and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"The Dispossessed is a story with multiple levels. On one level, it's the story of a man- Shevek- on a quest. On another, it's a utopian/dystopian novel. On yet another, it's about the nature of time.Shevek lives on Anarres, a large moon of the planet Urras. Anarres is a harsh world with sparse resources. There is no luxury and there are sometimes privations, but the people live in an anarchic socialist state. There is no property; everyone shares everything- if one goes hungry, all go hungry. If there is excess food, all eat well. In theory, everyone is free to do what they want, but this is a very organized anarchy. The Division of Labor's computers show all jobs available and you pick what you want, or, in times of crisis, are asked to take specific jobs. Syndicates decide how to deal with specific issues. This is where Shevek runs into trouble. He is a physicist working on a unified theory of time. His theory is at odds with the theory the head of the university syndicate has worked on. When the syndicate refuses to publish his theory, he finds that even a society based on equality, freedom, sharing and not having anyone superior to any other has it's rules, rulers and ways of making people conform.When Shevek does get his theory published, he gets it sent to Urras. He is awarded a prize for the innovation and importance of his work, and this is where the story starts: as he leaves for Urras. While there has been some small trade between the worlds, the people do not mingle. Ever.The story weaves two time streams together: Shevek's life from his childhood, leading to the point where the story starts, and Shevek's life as he goes to Urras. Some have found this technique hard to follow, but it emphasizes Shevek's theory of time being simultaneous rather than sequential.Urras (where the Anerres people migrated from less than 200 years before) is the opposite of Anerres: society is materialistic, capitalistic, class and gender stratified. Many people go hungry while a few have food to waste. But it's a luxurious world; there is great wealth, both in the upper class people's lives and in natural beauty. Here there are trees, flowers, grass, abundant rain. Shevek enters this world as a noble savage- will he hold to his ethics, or be seduced by the soft Urras life they offer him? In the end, it's obvious that neither society is perfect and that things still need to be worked out.Written in 1974, this book explores a lot of the issues that were important then. The situation of Urran women as property, kept from education and jobs, vs the gender equality on Anarres steps right out of the second feminist movement. There is some space given to anti-war sentiment; the Viet Nam war would have been winding down while this book was being written. The biggest theme, of course, is communism vs capitalism, which was a big issue in the 70s. What saves this book from being a ponderous treatise on sociology and politics is the characters. Le Guin's people are complex, rounded, interesting people. We have no caricatures here, we have living, breathing humanoids dealing with the effects of the society they live in. Despite the 36 years since this book was written, it remains both meaningful and engaging."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"There is no better work of fiction that describes what a society based on true anarchy might be like. You soon see that it certainly would not be chaos. That is because a society without leaders and laws is not a society without order- it is just that the order comes from within. That is true order. People work and sacrifice because they recognize that it is in everybody's best interest. Society should be brotherhood of equals, a big family. In a sense, the world of Anarres reminded me of one great farm where family members realize from an early age that they are needed for work that must be done. Either that, or I would describe it as an old-style kibbutz on a planetary scale. It isn't a perfect system. Vigilance is needed to make sure that unofficial tyranny from peer pressure and individual corruption do not set in, but it comes across as workable and believable.As for her sister world, Urras, it is a place of both the plutocratic-oligarchic state, as well as, the centralized communist dictatorship, locked in perpetual struggle. It is a world where men are forced and coerced to obey their leaders. It is our world. Urras is archism, Anarres is anarchism. You are forced to examine first hand the fundamental differences. It is the difference between a society of true individuals and a society of slaves.The hero, Shevek, is both a physicist and a philosopher. His was a mind capable of reconciling not only the seeming incompatibility of the simultaneous and sequential nature of time, but also of the conflicting drives of human nature. Both required the freedom of mind of a true revolutionary.I first read this novel over 25 years ago. It came as a shock to me to realize how much I must have internalized the character of Shevek."},{"Title":"The Dispossessed","review":"I just finished reading this book for what must have been the fourth of fifth time in 20 years. Everytime I read it, it is a completely different book from the book I remembered. I've decided the book actually metamorphosizes and is growing. How else to explain it? The book is always good, but always different. This is the best book ever written about how a real communistic system would probably work. It shows the good aspects and the bad. But I remembered a lot more about the main character's early childhood than was actually in the book last time. So either the book changes, or the character has lived in me so long that I've filled in some of the times Le Guin didn't write about.

But then once I'd put it down for the night, I'd think about the characters and the plot and ideas and liked them...And I *really* enjoyed the story once I was done reading it, and have found that it has helped inform my thinking about other texts and subjects.

The feedback he got was funny... and enlightening.The dangers of attaching people to your screenplay who may put a drag on it's chances of getting made into a movie.In summary:I really give the book 4 1/2 stars but I rounded up to 5 because the book offered so much that many other books I've read about screenplay never did. My hesitation at giving the book 5 unqualified stars was that I felt like it was missing a chapter(or at least an online resource). The first chapters of the \\"Raindance Writer's Lab\\" set up a \\"promise of the premise\\" that I would read a chapter where all the how-to techniques were actually applied comprehensively and in an iterative fashion. Specifically, an inclusion of a sequence of a screenplay (or an entire short screenplay) taken from initial idea, to outline, to first draft, to intermediate draft(s), to final draft. In each sequence of revisions Grove could nail all the issues that keep the screenplay from achieving it's maximum audience interest (whether the audience is a Hollywood reader or a film audience)."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"Polite, well-brought-up Clarice has a secret... she is hiding the mysterious Olga, who ran away from her cruel boarding school (where they were only fed dog meat) with her stash of diamonds.

Van den Haag like Paul Johnson and Thomas Cahill later writes from outside the Jewish experience with real appreciation and understanding. Having read the book many years ago I will simply give one small insight of his. According to Van den Haag the intelligence involved in disproprotionate Jewish contribution to scientific and cultural creation came in part because among the Jews the most intelligent the learned were encouraged to have large families, while in the Christian world the most intelligent were priests and encouraged to be celibate. A counter- argument could be made pointing out the relatively small size of the families of the non- Hasidic Jewish leadership.

Written almost fifty years ago, it attempts to give insight into the commonly held beliefs, tendencies, quirks and stereotypes typical to the Jewish people.For instance, it examines the Jewish reverence for education, how they feel about and interact with non-Jews, their belief systems, their fears and obsessions, their general hangups and pet peeves, their 'Jewishness' which is perhaps central to who and what they are ......Since a work such as this would be unthinkable in this day and age, the glimpse it provides into the collective psyche of this great but tortured people is rather rare.Yet, a glimpse is all this book really provides given its superficial approach to such a complex subject. The Talmud, for instance, is only mentioned about twice throughout the entire book and even then only in passing. Perhaps the hatred and vitriol spewed throughout its thousands of pages, its racist and contemptuous references to the 'goyim' was too much for the author to explain away as he seems to do about many other aspects of Jewish character - their love of Communism, their weakness for its totalitarian thinking and ideas, their ongoing rejection of Western Christian civilization, their chronic, almost obsessive hatred of Jesus Christ - all of which he fobs off in a very subjective and casual manner without any references or footnotes which left me, as someone seeking answers, feeling cheated.Perhaps there is an explanation, however, and it may lie in the enigmatic nature of the Jewish people themselves. Obviously very great and gifted, prone to tortured introspection and self-doubt, with a habit of clinging tenaciously to myth and legend about both its history and its adopted homeland, forever at the centre stage of world history, what a people this is! Admirable at one time, disgusting at another, religiously zealous but also doggedly atheistic, The Jewish Mystique provides a somewhat lame attempt at understanding this very formidable yet peculiar people."},{"Title":"THE JEWISH MYSTIQUE.","review":"Why are Jews smarter than Catholics ? Because Catholicism is a religion of Pork-Barrel-Sacrifice, while among Jews the-best-have-more-babies. Anyway Haag makes this point up-front in the first few pages of the book, and the review-author knows of no more concisely elegant description of this distinction, having stumbled across the book via Google, but not claiming exhaustive literacy on this.The first part of the argument is that in primitive times, religious study was a primary way of expressing intelligence - there being no technology as of yet. Among Catholics, the best students became celibate priests. Among Jews, the best students became rabbis, AND RABBIS WERE ENCOURAGED TO MAKE BABIES.This basic theme of course continues today. A lot of bright folks choose to become doctors, but medical school is a lengthy process - therefore doctors don't seem to have especially many babies themselves. Garrett Hardin's commonism, the doctrine of outcome-equalization, that an indiscriminate nation-or-world-wide-pork-barrel should in particular redistribute the benefits of medicine - this makes medicine or at least the doctrine of a universal-medical-insurance-pork-barrel analogous to Catholicism, hmm ?

It's a genre of steps and formulas that never seem to transfer from the printed page to real life. But this book is different. Jones recognizes that parenting often happens \\"on the fly,\\" \\"on the way,\\" or \\"in the middle of\\" -- in those scurrying moments 10 minutes before school starts when one kid can't find her shoes, another can't find his backpack, and the third just remembered he's supposed to make a diorama of the Sahara desert -- and it's due today. You know what I'm talking about.I realize that some of the most important decisions I make as a parent (the ones that tell my kids who I really am) happen at the speed of a knee jerk at the times when I'm least equipped to make them. I like Timothy Jones because he understands the disonance between what I want my life as a parent to look like and what it really is. He understands my desperate desire to nurture in my children a gift I'm still working out in my own life -- the gift of an abiding faith in something (someone) beyond myself, bigger and better, more satisfying and sustaining than anything else. And he gives me hope... but not an easy answer.The book is an easy read, not over-long, and packed with a gentle understanding of the tenuous and strenuous work of being a parent. If you're looking for a step by step formula, it's not for you. But if you're looking for an overall framework to continually build on as you grow together in faith with your children, I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Nurturing a Child's Soul","review":"Offering ten soul nourishers as the basis for this book, Timothy Jones gives wonderful encouragement for any phase of parenting, grandparenting, nurturing, teaching or guiding children in their faith jouney.

As a parent of 3 young children I found this book very helpful in identifying very practical ways to introduce my children to and help them grow in their relationship with God. This book also brought back many memories of the ways in which my parents had nurtured my faith walk. I am grateful for the book and will apply many of the ideas and thoughts in my walk with my children.

(Wraparound)","review":"Arnold Friend for the short story \\"Where are you going, where have you been\\" is first introduced in the story as boy with shaggy black hair, driving a convertible car, giving Connie a grin, waiving his finger at her and saying \\"gonna get you, baby.\\" This leads you to believe that he is just one of the guys out on the town looking to meet girls. At this point in the story you are not really thinking any more than just that as the story turns to talk about the rest of the night Connie had. However, things change one Sunday for Connie when she decides to stay home alone instead of attending a barbeque with the rest of her family.She wasn't home alone for very long when she heard a car pull up. When she went to the front door to see who it was, she was very taken back when she learned that it was the guy from the car the other night. He got out and said \\"I ain't late, am I?\\" Connie reminded him that she had no idea who he was. That is when he told her it was Arnold Friend and that it was also painted on the side of his car, and he was there to be her friend. Arnold tried to get Connie to go for a ride with him and his friend Ellie who had a radio that they were listening to Bobby King. Arnold knew that Connie liked Bobby King. However Connie was still taken by the fact that he knew what her name was. She questioned him as to why he even knew what her name was, and to her surprise he knew what all of her friends names were, and what her family's names were, and actually where they were at that very moment. Connie was quite frightened by this.Connie moved from the front steps back into the house and continued to try to get Arnold to leave, talking to him through the screen door. Arnold at this point was out of his car and leaning on the front of his car. He was telling Connie that she needed to come for a ride with him, so that he could show her what love was. He told her how he would drive her to a nice place and hold her so tight in his arms so that she would know what love was. At this point Connie was frightened even more and threatened him to leave or she would call the police on him. Arnold told her that he promised not to come into the house to get her unless she moved for the telephone, and if she did not move for the phone he would wait for her outside. At this point Arnold stumbled over to her front door step as if he was drunk, and Connie backed away from the screen door and leaned on the kitchen table in the house.Arnold continued to try to talk her out of the house, and she was still threatening to call the police. At this point Arnold was telling her that her best option would be to just come out and go with him, as she did not want to involve the rest of her family with this. He was trying to seduce her into thinking that it was in her best interest to not have her family know about this. Additionally, he was trying to keep her from the phone, so that she would not contact the police. Finally Connie grabbed the phone and ran to the other room to call the police, however found herself in such fear that she could not. Arnold convinced her to put the phone down. A few moments later, Arnold was still trying to get her to come outside and go with him, so she got up and walked towards the door and pushed it open to go outside.Arnold was like a stalker in the way that he first saw Connie, then found out everything about her, including where she lived. Once he confronted her even though he was creepy, he remained calm through the entire encounter trying to convince her that this was the best thing for her to. The story ends with you left to decide Connie's fate, as she decided to leave with Arnold."},{"Title":"Where are you going, where have you been?

However, the preeminent scholarly work on this subject remains Avner Cohen's \\"Israel and the Bomb.\\" Perhaps the greatest shortcoming of \\"The Bomb in the Basement\\" is the lack of detailed citations, which will make it very difficult for scholars to benefit from Karpin's research. For example, it is frequently unclear whether the author obtained quotes from interviews, diaries or secondary sources. Also, although Karpin effectively demonstrates how the Holocaust and fear of being wiped out by Arab enemies motivated Israeli leaders David Ben-Gurion, Shimon Peres and Ernst David Bergmann to pursue a nuclear option, this concept has already been thoroughly addressed by Avner Cohen. Nevertheless, even readers of Cohen's book will find new insights in Karpin's account. For example, \\"The Bomb in the Basement\\" highlights the roles of lesser known players in Israel's nuclear history, including Munya Mardor, director of Israeli defense firm RAFAEL, and Shalhevet Freier, a diplomat/defense attach&eacute; who was instrumental in securing French assistance to Israel.Karpin also brings to life the various political, bureaucratic and ideological differences among Israel's elites, such as the rift between Ben-Gurion and Chaim Weizmann, Israel's first president. Other highlights include a never-before-published account of a radioactivity accident at Israel's Weizmann Institute in 1957 and an exploration of France's motives for aiding Israel in the construction of the nuclear reactor at Dimona. Finally, whereas Cohen's account ends in the early 1970s, Karpin concludes his book with a chapter that recaps more recent events shaping Israel's security environment and examines the implications of a nuclear-armed Iran. The latter discussion is particularly relevant in light of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's recent call to wipe Israel \\"off the map.\\" Overall, Michael Karpin's \\"The Bomb in the Basement\\" objectively tackles a subject that has historically received far less attention than it merits. While the book may have limited scholarly value because of its scant citations, more casual readers will find it a compelling and informative read."},{"Title":"The Bomb in the Basement: How Israel Went Nuclear and What That Means for the World","review":"This is a terrific book. It's a bit gossipy, which makes it extra entertaining. Example: Golda Meir's breakdown during the Y-K war; the general contempt for Shimon Peres; how both Truman and Kennedy acknowledged that they owed their election to the Lobby; how Rabin got his Phantoms out of LBJ; Teller's assistance with the project. There is a great deal of information about the French connection, pre-de-Gaulle. And it is of course not just about the development of the device, but about the creation and growth of Israel in general.A couple of details reviewers might find of interest, recalling that Karpin can't say a number of things, and other things he simply doesn't know about (his unknown unknowns). 1) Nothing new here but the bland denials about the 1979 test; yet most who have reviewed the Vela flash and corroborating evidence seem nearly 100% convinced that it was a genuine test. (Karpin talks about \\"photographs\\" from Vela, so he hasn't investigated this very deeply.) 2) Nothing new about USS Liberty, although most likely Karpin does know what really occurred. 3) A bit of interesting detail about the Egyptian (prob. Russian) overflights of Dimona in May 1967, during extreme tension. This is good, because a couple of Israeli jokesters have weaved a conspiracy theory about it recently (Foxbats over Dimona). Karpin says they were MiG-21s dashing in from Jordan at 55,000 feet and the IAF Mirage IIICs could not catch them.A very good read, but obviously not the whole story, and probably not all accurate. Ben-Gurion made a wise choice back at the founding; events continue to prove him right."},{"Title":"The Bomb in the Basement: How Israel Went Nuclear and What That Means for the World","review":"The story being told here has been covered by others, namely in \`The Samson option' and \`Israel and the bomb' however this book not only updates the story regarding the Yom Kippur War but also explores the characters involved, it is a story worth telling again and a brilliant examination of the personalities of Ben-Gurion, Peres and others. Most familiar with Israel today will be surprised to learn that France was Israel's closest ally in the 1950s, when America opposed Israeli policies. This book serves as a good account also of the nature of Israeli reasoning regarding the bomb. This is not a dramatically biased book, so most readers should be able to stomach it, since most people are incapable of reading anything about Israel if it doesn't fit their ideological love-hate of the country, but this book should sidestep this to some extant, unlike \`Samson' option it isn't basing its logic on the question of why Jews should or shouldn't be allowed to develop nuclear weapons by using Biblical analysis, rather it is a modern fair book examining how Israel obtained the bomb. Israel, alone among the many nations who covertly have attempted to develop nuclear weapons secretly(Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, India, Libya etc...), did not sign the non-proliferation treaty, so as to remain \`ambiguous' and thus not in violation, unlike other hypocritical nations who sign the bogus treaty and then build nukes. Ironically the very same people that condemn Israel's possession of nukes are the same people who condemn America for daring to invade Iraq because of WMDs, in there view Israel possessing WMDs is tantamount to the \`holocaust' whereas Iraq or Iran pursuing the same objective is merely for \`national defense and sovereignty and combating colonialism'.A good read, fair, however it is a mostly popular work.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"The Bomb in the Basement: How Israel Went Nuclear and What That Means for the World","review":"The first that the author clarifies is that the book has been heavily cencored by the Israeli military, thus do not expect to find in it startling revelations about Israel's nuclear program. What you will find though is a very good account of the whole effort and its protagonists, from 1948 to the present (albeit the story somehow stops in the \`80s). The reader will find also many similarities between the Israelis' efforts to conceal their project and the Iranians' efforts today and will come to the conclusion that when we have to do with a national effort to aquire the ultimate weapons of mass destruction we must it's rather nave to expect those responsible to tell the truth or confess their aims. The chapters which deal with the US - Israeli relations and how they were strained by the race for the \\"bomb\\" are amonf the best.

It provides a great review for the history of Israel, from the perspective of developing nuclear capability, and pretty good political analysis. I learned a lot of things I had previously been unaware of including why Lyndon Johnson was so attached to Israel, and how Anwar Sadat planned the last war Egypt fought against Israel. The insights I gained into Egypt were by themselves worth the book. I finished the book with lots of admiration for Sadat. The book also discussed Egypt's intervention in Yeman, under Nassar, which I was previously not well informed about.

Who knew that France was so involved, that France benefited from Israel's own expertise, and that Israel's ambiguous messages evolved in such a delicate fashion. The story is also a clear lens through which to see Israel's emotional, social, and political development - not to mention the transition in Israel-U.S. relations from wariness to warmth.The subtext I found most interesting was the role that censorship played and plays. The phrase \\"according to foreign sources\\" ends up, rather than concealing, ironically being a signal for the most important revelations. Any sentence that carries that phrase or its equivalent is to be taken most seriously.Joe Cohen, NYC"},{"Title":"The Bomb in the Basement: How Israel Went Nuclear and What That Means for the World","review":"Israel not only became the Middle East's first nuclear power: it kept its atomic program secret - and veteran Israeli journalist Michael Karpin explains how in THE BOMB IN THE BASEMENT: HOW ISRAEL WENT NUCLEAR AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE WORLD.

Donovan, EditorCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"The Bomb in the Basement: How Israel Went Nuclear and What That Means for the World","review":"I read this book on a whim, I'm not very familiar with the subject as some of the other reviewers here appear to be. There are two aspects of the Bomb in the Basement that I really enjoyed:1. The story of Israel's history and evolution transcending one multi-decade policy initiative to acquire the bomb and obfuscate its acquisition is fascinating. I found the analysis of the international political and dimplomatic intrigue as well as the roles played by many familiar figures (Peres, Rabin, Ben-Gurion, Begin, Golda Meier) to be thoroughly rewarding.2. The books detail of the political, scientific, financial, human and physical challenges to acquiring and concealing a nuclear weapon was enlightening to me. During the Iraqi Disarmament Crises I found myself very frustrated with the WMD inspectors as they explained the complexities of their effort (and subsequent interpretations by parties with vested interests). I have a much better appreciation now for the variety of moving parts that underly an effort to obtain and conceal WMDs."},{"Title":"The Bomb in the Basement: How Israel Went Nuclear and What That Means for the World","review":"Karpin's history of Israel's nuclear project comes at an appropriate time, just as the Iranian nuclear crisis exhibits how sensitive and hazardous the Middle East is and how clever were Israel's visionary forefathers. Their determination to acquire the ultimate deterrent and their wisdom to hide it in the basement are excellently described. Karpin for sure knows the political and defense establishments of his country. He also has the advantage of being free of any ideological agenda. His detailed story streams superbly in spite the restrictions imposed on him by Israeli army censors.What mattered for me as an American Jewish reader was that the United States made sure that Israel could defend itself without using its deterrent and that Israel's bomb did its work simply by its existing. Karpin points out that Israel planed that that the bomb will function as the instrument that would convince the Arabs to accept a peace settlement. The last chapter shows that in the long run the chances for materializing that aspiration are not bad at all.Rebecca C., LA"},{"Title":"The Bomb in the Basement: How Israel Went Nuclear and What That Means for the World","review":"As WWII came to close the world was left to confront what happened to the vast majority of Jewish population of central Europe. As result of the holocaust (and the rest of the world's failure to prevent it) the Jewish wanted to have there own land and vowed to never let the holocaust happen again.There were waves of Jewish illegal immigrants to Palestine. Once the Jewish population reached a critical mass the international community paved the way for the modern Israeli state. This new state needed the ultimate weapon to detour would be invaders. There was a nuclear program before there was a state. The hope was the bomb would be \\"in the basement\\" as defensive weapon.The Arab and North African countries (among others) took offense to the Jewish state. To increase the insult the Jews created an industrialized democracy without the benefit of petro-dollars. Over the years Jews living other Middle Eastern countries became hard so the migration to Israel increased. With the concentration of the Jews in Israel the Arabs had one place to focus their hatred (the US not withstanding).The premise is forwarded that the bomb in the basement protected Israel during the 1973 war on the assumption that Sadat knew of the bomb and simply wanted the Sinai back in the hands of Egypt. Somehow Sadat knows about the bomb but Assiad in Syria doesn't? If you know they have the bomb then how can you be sure they won't use on you in the heat of battle? Why was there no effort on the part of Egypt to negate the nuclear threat of Israel? Why have the bomb the in the basement if you are the only one that knows it is there?Lets assume that everyone who would wish Israel harm after 1973 knows they have the bomb, do they let them live in peace or do they just change their tactics? Now we have the diplomatic games such as land for peace and the ever in and out tide terror attacks. Does anyone really expect the Arab nations will allow Jewish state to live in peace? The bomb may have allowed Israel to exist for its first 60 years but what of the next 60? Will Iran have the bomb later this year? What country or group will be next join the nuclear club? Israel is rumored to have over 150 nuclear weapons some of which could be deployed in submarines. If Israel has put nuclear ordinance on submarines then the bomb has already left the basement. As long as there is an Israeli state, that state will always have to be vigilant in protecting its people from hostile forces committed to its destruction."},{"Title":"The Bomb in the Basement: How Israel Went Nuclear and What That Means for the World","review":"This writers has made a good effect to find out his facts.I have read many books on this subject. Most book on this subject, even by Israeli have a tendancy to concentrate totally on the US and Israel relationships such as Avner's \\"Israel and the bomb\\" and almost ignore local Israeli and French policies.This book however does make an attempt to discuss the actually bomb construction including the relationship with France, that was so important in getting it built. What struck me almost immediately is how cheap was the Israeli nuclear program! Many 100 of millions US dollars and several thousand people might be a massive project but compared to other nuclear programs, it does seems incredibly cheap. Still I would have liked to have seen more about the nuts and bolts of how Israel actually built the bomb.Whether the US could have stopped the project as the writer states, I think is unlikely, considering that they had little to do with its creation nor did they know for certain about it until the Israeli bomb was well established. Without the US though Israel would have probably have a public nuclear defence policy.The writer also provides a fairly good discussion at the end of what Israel achieved by its bomb program and the reasons for the Israeli policy of ambiguilty."},{"Title":"The Bomb in the Basement: How Israel Went Nuclear and What That Means for the World","review":"I agree with most of what the prior reviewer had to say, I was just overall less enthusiastic.

Since the 1940s the U.S., Canada, and Britain had excluded France from nuclear secrets, mainly due to fear that communists in French nuclear research programs would pass information to the Soviets.France also went on to play the key role in moving Israel to nuclear weapons capability. France's support began with a commonality of interests - both were being confronted by angry Arab populations; in addition, a few French leaders had strong sympathy for Israel (eg. one had his brother killed in a German death camp, even though not a Jew).Exactly how did Israel obtain the bomb? France helped it construct a nuclear reactor that could produce up to 40 kg. of plutonium/year (about 4 kg. required for a bomb), supplied it with the initial fuel, and also helped construct a fuel reprocessing plant to extract the plutonium for weapons. Norway also contributed - selling heavy water to Israel to serve as a moderator for the reactor.The U.S. estimated the entire project cost between $100-200 million - undoubtedly at least partially made possible through the large amount of U.S. financial support. Both the U.S. and Israel denied that bombs were being made at the time.

Thus the author's term &quot;Synerjet,&quot; which is synonymous with RBCC.The editor of this collection, Bill Escher, is also the author of most of the included papers. Bill is one of the leading experts in the world on the subject of combined cycle propulsion. He was heavily involved with the early work on RBCC engines performed at The Marquardt Corporation in the 1960's. Thus the historical background on RBCC engines given in the first couple of papers comes from a man who was actually there when the early work was being performed. In addition to a historical account of RBCC efforts to date, the book also includes papers on various RBCC subsystems, thermodynamics, performance, and implications for vehicle design.This book can serve as an excellent introduction for engineers to the subject of RBCC engines. The only reason I would not give it a 5 star rating is due to the technical paper format. I find a focused, coherent text directly expressly toward a single subject to be preferable to a collection of papers. However, the author's inclusion of extensive introductions to each paper does much to address the issue of coherence.Currently, NASA is predicating much of its efforts for so-called &quot;third generation&quot; launch vehicles on the capabilities of RBCC engines. While these vehicles are not expected to be in service until the 2020 time frame, a substantial amount of development effort will most likely begin in the next five to ten years. Engineering wanting to get a head start on the &quot;next big thing&quot; in propulsion engineering would be well advised to begin following the current work on RBCC technology. Bill Escher's excellent compilation would be a good place to start."},{"Title":"Love and Work","review":"There is no question that Reynolds Price is a superb craftsman, one of the best. His writing is powerful and lyrical at the same time. But in this short novel I felt at times overpowered by the writing itself and thought the story was crumbling beneath the mighty word craft. The novel is in four sections with each section lasting only a short period of time. Tom Eborn, a rather cold and distant writer, learns that his mother has died; when this doesn't interrupt his work, his wife Jane criticizes his seeming lack of feelings. Later, while investigating a break-in at his parents' house, he encounters his parents' ghosts and experiences the strong love that they had for each other: he has his work but they had each other. Price's stylized writing makes this already cold-hearted main character even more icy and walled in. The theme is an interesting one, however, and is a good reminder how people can sometimes implode from the \\"things\\" they choose to do and allow to consume them while shutting out the love-sustaining outside world."},{"Title":"Are You Running With Me, Jesus?: A Spiritual Companion for the 1990s","review":"This book is as tremendous in 2002 as it was back in the 1960's.

People, young and old, will fall in love with Harry all over again when they read about the dilemmas he encounters in his 3rd year at Hogwarts.

It is also pretty accurate in terms of price and food quality. I've been to a few of the restaurants in the survey and the review was pretty much right on. Plus, there are plenty of restaurants in here to satisfy any craving.On the downside, the book doesn't list restaurants by area, only alphabetically. You have to scan the whole book to find the ones in your area. Also, there are a lot of unrated restaurants. I would rather see ratings for those, even if the sample size was low, with a qualifier that the sample size was low. Finally, there are some real gems out there that are missing from the survey.

It's a &quot;must read and pass-on&quot; book."},{"Title":"Unleashing Excellence","review":"Customer service is similar to Motherhood and Apple Pie. Organizations that deliver outstanding customer service as an integral part of their business operation build customer loyalty and bottom line strength. Those that don't...well, we all know that bad customer service can destroy a company, or at least severely limit its potential.This knowledge is legendary. Techniques for delivering good customer service are well-known. This is not brain surgery. Why another book on the ubiquitous topic?First, note the title. The book title doesn't talk about Excellent Customer Service or You Will Be Fired if You Aren't Nice to Our Customers. The Unleashing Excellence title-and theme of the book-is directed toward senior executives. Customer service is a corporate strategy that needs to be led from the top. This book needs to be read by senior executives that allege that they don't have time to read it. The downside of mediocre customer service can be career-limiting to executives who don't pay attention to this critical component of their company's business.The authors, both formerly part of the Walt Disney leadership development programs, are now in private practice. They are active consultants-to a wide range of employers-on customer service issues. In their work, they apply what they learned at Disney and other employment experiences to deliver an executive-targeted message. Toward this end, the book is easy to read, includes shaded call-out boxes, Action Steps and Pitfalls to Avoid at the end of each chapter. The book's concluding chapter presents nine leadership actions to guide readers in strengthening their customer service delivery. A comprehensive index makes the book even more reader-friendly.Readers will benefit from a continual flow of best practice stories from many employment settings. Many of the examples of good work come from the authors' clients. These illustrations serve to enhance and illuminate the content to bring the traditional concepts to life in ways that leaders can read the book and initiate appropriate actions for individual and organizational improvement. Several sections of the book stand out in my mind, but all chapters are filled with ideas, thought-provoking discussions, and anecdotes to bring the concepts to life.Yes (sigh), this is ANOTHER customer service book. Do we need more books on this topic? Some of us are beginning to feel overstuffed with this topic---like the bloated feeling we get after a huge Thanksgiving dinner. Thankfully, this book serves a specific purpose of providing how-to advice and insights for executives and managers to consider and implement. Use it as a tool to stimulate customer service conversations in your organization as you inspire increasingly high attention to incredible customer service as a part of your corporate DNA."},{"Title":"Unleashing Excellence","review":"As the title Unleashing Excellence suggests, this book is directed at senior executives. It starts with the premise that customer service is a corporate strategy (just as technical competence is) and needs to be cultivated from the top.Companies that build customer service as a vital part of their business model also build customer loyalty and strengthen their bottom lines. Those that don't, end up limiting their potential in the marketplace. The first chapter develops a framework to understand the essential ingredients of customer service, and the second chapter outlines the rest of the book. The remaining chapters focus on making customer service part of the \\"corporate DNA.\\"These remaining chapters go through the steps of institutionalizing customer service as part of corporate strategy. Topics range from setting up a service improvement team, and also setting service philosophy and standards, communication, training, measuring program effectiveness, recognition, and accountability.The clean layout without footnotes, endnotes or a bibliography is clearly aimed not at the academician but at the practitioner. The fluid writing style makes the book easy to read.The numerous anecdotes from a wide variety of settings peppered throughout the text help bring the concepts to life. The ideas and thought-provoking discussions in the chapters are supplemented with shaded call-out boxes, Action Steps, and Pitfalls to Avoid. The book's concluding chapter presents nine leadership actions to help readers strengthen customer service delivery.While reading this book is the first step, the authors' intent is for readers to implement their ideas and suggestions.

I'll add this to the top of my review, leaving the original intact at the bottom.As I originally posted, this book is a \\"How to\\" rather than a simple \\"Why You Should\\". There are anecdotes, sample forms available (via website) as well as detailed \\"How to\\". What I personally found interesting and important, because of my experience, was the emphasis on the following:1) Buy in from everyone, at every level. Talking the talk is one thing, walking the walk is necessary as well. If the focus on excellence is not driven from the top, and noticeable by those not on the top, the entire effort will fail. Spectacularly. Leadership, or lack of same, will be apparent.2) Hiring the right folks in Customer Service. Those \\"right folks\\" are the folks that possess soft skills. Possessing brilliant technical skills is wonderful provided that you can work, well and comfortably, with folks who are not as technically brilliant. I'll leave it to readers of this review to research \\"soft skills\\".All in all a very well done book and I recommend it be read.Reading it now at the request of Terri Yanovitch who read a comment of mine on LinkedIn, regarding Buckingham's First, Break All The Rules.

Maybe it's the tough economic times we're trying to deal with; or maybe some companies simply grew too big for their own good, led by an arrogant and pompous CEO who thinks they're invincible.That of course, is a fatal mistake for many; as we've witnessed with an alarming degree of regularity over the past several years, if a company's corporate culture is more concerned with short term profitability over long term customer satisfaction, that's a sure ticket to financial trauma; even government bailout money won't change the inevitable disaster.In this wonderful guide to helping companies provide excellent customer service, Dennis Snow and Teri Yanovich have pinpointed precisely what needs to be done for an organization to thrive in this highly competetive 21st century business environment. Without a doubt, there are some companies already doing this stuff, and they're the ones poised to dominate a market; if they haven't already done so.The strategies are simple, but usually those are the ones that are most effective.

Rappaport was one of the most distinguished anthropologists of his generation. What sets this book apart from other anthropoplogical studies of religion is that it is not only &quot;about&quot; religion, but is also a profoundly religious book. The author makes a strong case for what he sees as religion's significance in human evolution and argues passsionately for the reconciliation of religion and science. He suggests that human survival may depend on developing a postmodern science that is thoroughly grounded in ecology. Examining evidence from fields as diverse as history, cybernetics, communication theory, semiotics, ethnography, ecology, philosphy, and comparative religions, Rappaport comes to the conclusion that riual should be the main focus of religious studies because &quot;ritual is the ground where all religion is made.&quot; The book provides the fullest analysis of ritual since Emile Durkheim's The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (1912). It is carefully argued; well reasoned, and precise, and is likely to influence scholars for many years to come. Extensive documentation. Solid bibliography. Highly recommended.&quot; Stephen D. Glazier, Professor of Anthropology, University of Nebraska"},{"Title":"Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity (Cambridge Studies in Social and Cultural Anthropology)","review":"As the centuries long battle between religion and science unfolded in the 19th century, science became the clear winner in terms of intellectual prestige. But that fight, while leaving science victorious in the realm of the intellect also left lingering prejudices within science towards religion. As science moved forward offering us ever deeper knowledge of the cosmos, life, and ourselves, science also began to ignore its former nemesis. Despite the awesome significance of religion in human life and history, the social sciences have relatively little to offer on the role of religion in human evolution and the reasons for or mechanisms whereby religions tradition are transmitted from one generation to the next.It's not uncommon to meet fantastically educated people, with strong knowledge in the physical or social sciences, who not only know nothing of religion but seem to insist that there's nothing worth knowing. For these people, human religious behavior is looked at as some kind of quirk or anomaly, an embarrassing hold-over from a dark past that we'd all just hopefully outgrow. Such people tend to comfort themselves with the old baseless superstition that religion is the &quot;opiate of the masses.&quot; But considering the importance of religion in human history and the astonishing grip religious belief holds over the lives of billions of human beings, it's probably safe to assert that disciplines such as psychology and sociology are fundamentally grasping in the dark if they are unable or unwilling to seriously come to terms with role of religion in the lives of individuals and societies.Rappaport's book provides the most thorough and penetrating look into human religion that I've ever come across. Combining insights from an astonishingly wide array of fields, Rappaport demonstrates the role that religion has played in human evolution and how and why humans evolved to become religious beings. In the end, he makes a fascinating case for the role of religion in human life and why our survival as a species depends on understanding that role.This is unquestionably the most intellectually rigorous and powerful book I've seen on anthropology and human evolution. As the review below by an anthropology student shows, this book is not easy reading and certainly isn't recommended for people with little background in these topics. However, dedicated students of the social sciences who have an interest in these issues should be able to make it through with some patience. Those who do will be richly rewarded. I've read some fascinating and brilliant works on these topics, but nothing I've come across approaches the raw analytic and synthetic power of Rappaport. He truly was one of the greatest anthropologists and arguably one of the greatest social scientists that the United States has ever produced."},{"Title":"Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity (Cambridge Studies in Social and Cultural Anthropology)","review":"The late Roy Rappaport should be more famous than he is now. He's one of the scientific mystics of the ecopsychology movement and so it should be. One thing lacking is the next step: If the sacred, ritual, shamanism, language, and symbolic culture all appeared at the same moment, we need more speculation on exactly when this moment was, what brought it on, and why it occurred. The suggestion verges on the mystical -- and in such a brilliant, erudite, well-reasoned (if challenging) book, the mystical would certainly have been earned.

Roy Rappaport (a former boss and good friend of mine) was dying of lung cancer while he writing this book and I think that is reflected in the tone.

A tour de force of the highest calibre."},{"Title":"Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity (Cambridge Studies in Social and Cultural Anthropology)","review":"I would add my voice to the others- this book is a big, big, winner. Written by the author at the sunset of a distinguished career as a professor of anthropology at a us unviersity, Ritual and Religion uses the discipline as anthropology as a mere starting point for an in depth exploration of the relationship between humanity and it's religion.In particular, he integrates the fields of semiotics, linguistic philosophy and cybernetics/systems theory to create an argument that manages to both dissect and rebuild the role of relgion in human society.Rappaports central argument: That ritual is crucial to maintaining human adaptability in the face of environmental challenges, is teased out over some 450+ fascinating pages. He defines terms like an analytic philosopher, talks about New Guinean tribal culture with the aplomb of an anthropolgist, and summarizes difficult to understand thinkers like Charles Peirce and Austin in ways that even a college undergraduate (or their equivalent) could grasp.In the end, Rappaport argues that humanity without religion and ritual is not humanity at all. Or rather that it is ritual and religion that allows us to dominate the natural environments we exist in."},{"Title":"Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity (Cambridge Studies in Social and Cultural Anthropology)","review":"Having been told by our lecturer that the material in Rappaport's book poses challenges even to PhD students in anthropology I am not particularly surprised by an undergraduate's strong negative reaction (see one star review). Our lecturer eased us in gently by taking several weeks introducing the core material Rappaport uses in his book to build his argument. As a consequence the far reaching wisdom expressed in Ritual and Religion managed to have the full effect at least on me. Absolutely brilliant book which I can not praise highly enough. But novices beware - not for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity (Cambridge Studies in Social and Cultural Anthropology)","review":"This was a great resource for class.Thank you for the timely shipping.Lisa Fisher"},{"Title":"Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity (Cambridge Studies in Social and Cultural Anthropology)","review":"This holistic evolutionary account of the ritual foundations of human communication and religion represents a major theoretical formulation by an major anthropologist."},{"Title":"Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity (Cambridge Studies in Social and Cultural Anthropology)","review":"Being an Anthropology major and have read many anthropological books.

Her rigorous and challenging analyses include continual engagement with human experience beyond, before, and within any interpretation of text or context.Part One, \\"Troubling Theology: Liberation Theology Meets Sexuality,\\" attends especially to the voices of poor Latin American women and in doing so questions the patriarchal assumptions of traditional liberation theology. The bodies of women and concrete experience of menstruation are keys to undoing the \\"universals\\" of traditional theology and recovering a dialogical christology always in process with the caminata, or walk, of the poorest women.In Part Two, \\"Indecenting Theology: Undressing Sexual Ideology in Theology,\\" Althaus-Reid uncovers uncritical theological methodologies that are dualistic, hierarchical, exclusive, and androcentric. She calls for new ways of knowing, \\"epistomologies from the poor\\" which are characterized by struggle that constantly unseats any theology that is becoming ideology, including heteronormative christology.Part Three, \\"Postcolonialism, Feminism, and Liberation,\\" suggests that theology is a consumer good and in particular that Latin American Liberation Theology has been reappropriated and marketed for an educated North American theological community.Finally, Part Four, \\"Indecent, Radical, Queer: The Future of Feminist Theology of Liberation?\\" incorporates queer theory, which can help theology transgress all boundaries and question all assumptions about God. She again uses experiences of the poor in Latin America, most provocatively in the final chapter in which she reads the life and death of Jesus through a story about a murdered transvestite. Here Althaus-Reid locates Jesus with the most marginalized exploding all sense of christological normalcy in gender or sexuality.I commend this book, as a challenge to pastors, academics, and lay people and as an encouragement to the queer, the poor, and those otherwise marginalized. For those unfamiliar with theology and critical theory, it may be difficult to read and understand but it is well worth the time as it helps us all see the world in new and transgressive ways."},{"Title":"Coaching Zone Offense: Attacking Unconventional Defenses (The Art & Science of Coaching Series)","review":"This book is terrific. Bob Huggins (U. of Cincinnati) gives you every weapon you need to embarrass any kind of zone defense. 1. Overview of how to beat Zones. 2. Player Job descriptions and placement of personnel. 3. Terminology. 4. Techniques (and drills). 5.Entries and quick hitters. 6.Zone offensive sets.This book is a great tool. You'll never have a problem scoring against a zone defense again. The author makes it clear WHY you setup the way he suggests, and WHY the offensive principles work. The best part is that he provides drills that make it easy to teach your team everything they need to know to be effective.This is a must-buy. It's a great weapon."},{"Title":"Coaching Zone Offense: Attacking Unconventional Defenses (The Art & Science of Coaching Series)","review":"Every good youth AAU basketball coach should know his or her limits. In my case, the trademark of most of our teams is usually to play tough defense. To this end, our defensive pressure generates plentiful scoring opportunites. However, as my teams climbed into the tougher AAU tounaments and faced nationally ranked clubs I found our style was lacking and we needed a vast improvement in our ability to execute a reliable zone offense.Consequently, I found, &quot;Coaching Zone Offenses,&quot; by Bob Huggins is an excellent guide to help teams score against complex defenses. Coach Huggins does a good job of providing zone offenses in all shapes and sizes. The key of course...as Huggins points out is to immediately identify what type of zone defense you are facing and then to make the appropriate adjustments.The Huggins &quot;quick hitters&quot; and &quot;penetration &amp; pitch&quot; plays are easy to teach and valuable tools for getting quality shots during offensive opportunities. We found the low post &quot;kick-out to wing,&quot; play a reliable offensive set against good zone defenses. Certainly, the overload and ball reversal plays that Huggins recommendes open scoring opportunites on offense as well. Coach Huggins is also a master of stacks and offers sound ideas on how to consistently crash the boards on offense.Overall, this is a great book for coaches looking to prepare youth players for serious AAU or high school basketball competition. The narrative in this text is well written and the many diagrams are easy to understand. Recommended for coaches looking for more offensive options.Bert Ruiz"},{"Title":"The Great One : The Life and Times of Wayne Gretzky","review":"I bought this book for my 3rd grade son to write a paper with, and found myself completly engaged in it.

Freedman cuts back and forth between sections of personal narrative and the political and social history of the Lower East Side so that you really gain an understanding of the way that many of these problem has been created and maintained by the education system over such a long period of time that overcoming them may be quite difficult. The story of Jessica Siegal, the teacher profiled in the book, is one of amazing courage and dedication that sinks into a depressing story of insurmountable obstacles such as uninterested politicians, bitter, lazy educators, and rampant poverty. The small victories that she achieves are incredible and important but are so far from remedying the very real problems of the school system, which short changes so many thousands of students in so many ways, that it is hard not to be left with a sinking feeling that the large failures of the system that surrounds Siegal just might swallow up the pride and drive off the teachers like her who perservere. Though this may be incredibly depressing it is a story that needs to be told and I applaud Freedman for tackling such a difficult topic with such a keen eye and unrelenting dedication to the truth."},{"Title":"Small Victories: The Real World of a Teacher, Her Students and Their High School","review":"I was very moved by this book which intertwined the stories of the lives of a dedicated teacher and her lower East Side students, many of whom faced giant obstacles to their academic success. I particularly appreciated the author's smooth narrative style, which contributed to his effectiveness in painting real lives. I was also grateful for the complete absence of a &quot;preachy&quot; tone, or a self-righteous attitude sometimes found in books on this subject.With the many stories in today's newspapers about NYC firing yet another school chancellor, students failing standardized tests, etc, this story, with its detailed descriptions of daily life in the classroom of a typical NY high school, and the colorful personalities of the school administrators, faculty, and the students they seek to educate, made a real impression. Not just statistics or hysterical arguments, but real lives, passions, and burnouts.Small Victories was very helpful to me to read in my effort to develop a more detailed understanding of the public education system and the problems facing young people today. An excellent story, cooly told with a powerful shape and impact."},{"Title":"Small Victories: The Real World of a Teacher, Her Students and Their High School","review":"This moving and engaging book is the written form of the movie STAND AND DELIVER!Well, not exactly, its a different plot, a different set of students, but its theme is similar. It depicts dedicated, caring, and truly amazing teachers at their very best bringing hope to students who have came from a neglected, hopeless, situation. The talented journalist Samuel Freedman has decided to tell us what life is for the students of Seward Park High School in NY city. During the 87-88 school year he literally trails around English intstructour Jessica Seigel and from his observations hes has compiled Small Victories. These are students who have come from families to poor pay rent for a house with working sewage, often abused at home, many immigrants, homeless and being shuttled between boarding homes and shelters. And yet, the talented, but moreover dedicated, instucours -- especially Jessica Siegel -- can turn many of these students around and help them see their dreams. How, can, form one of t he lowest 10% schools in US 90 % of graduates go on to higher education colleges? From a school where people come as their last choice, they come here knkowing they are &quot;Built to Fail&quot;. Samuel Freedman takes us on spectcular journey thru Seward park high as we get to know the students crowded 30-40 per class, the teachers underpaid and overworked, a poor and underfunded high school, and a marvelous feat. This has been one of the most fascinating books I'v ever read. Indeed, though originally a college assignment, it has truly transformed my view of the &quot;other end&quot; of the world. Those who dont have what we take for granted -- a nice suburban home, money for clothes, heating, and food. How then can they be expected to even THINK about school... while the drug dealers drive &quot;golden plated limosines&quot;...? The wrong path is very tempting, the red carpet is lies for them. This book has taught me about what is th miserable reality for many inner city families, an imporant lesson in years of class work wont tell me. Indeed this book has a major significance for american education system. How can students like this strive so hard to get into some college while in &quot;our world&quot; those who have all dont care to? This book taught great lesson for american education, improtant lesson for life -- however in a different manner. It is very enjoyable to read .. not like a statistical study on american education... almost like a novell. Yet it shudders you to think ALL THIS IS TRUE... THIS IS (unfortunately ) REALITY.

Some have been enlightening, some occasionally useful, and some a bit self-serving. But the subject of this account did not choose to speak for herself--nor did she seek to have her story told. For this reason alone the narrative \\"case study\\" that ensued when NYT's journalist Freedman walked in the shadow of this teacher is both believable and compelling.What the reader gains is insight into the daily life of a teacher struggling to make a real difference in the lives of disadvantaged kids. I could relate, having spent a decade teaching in a similar setting, and therefore recommend it for education faculty to share with preservice teachers (of English) or instructors of courses on contemporary American education and its socio-cultural contexts. Moreover, the profiles of individual students from a range of ethnic backgrounds gives the reader insight into their home lives and how their lack of social capital, save for one caring teacher, nearly prevented them from higher academic aspirations. That being said, I take umbrage with the tired accusation, levied in the editor's review that the system is solely to blame. Many bureaucrats work against nearly insurmountable odds; some are former teachers themselves who burned out along the way. And the families--especially the parents but also the students involved--must shoulder some of the responsibility for what they do or do not achieve. This simple reality is often conveniently overlooked by the finger-pointers.All in all, this is an easy narrative read with poignant depictions without the gratuitous sentimentality to go with it. I'm sure the teacher in focus must have been satisfied with the journalist's effort to sketch her life as an educator."},{"Title":"Small Victories: The Real World of a Teacher, Her Students and Their High School","review":"As a soon to be teacher, I was inspired by this book and the stories within it.

However, if properly studied, this book will be highly rewarding and well worth your effort.Jevons starts with the very basics by defining what logic is: \\"Logic is the Science of Reasoning, or the Science of those necessary Laws of Thought which must be observed if we are to argue consistently with ourselves and avoid self-contradiction\\" (p. 9). He then goes on to cover all the various topics (terms, proportions, induction, etc.) that are necessary to obtain a basic comprehension of logic.If completely unfamiliar with logic as a theory, perhaps read Thinking as Science by Henry Hazlitt, which can give you a good foundation to build upon. For further reading, also recommended is John Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding, and Thinking for Oneself by Arthur Schopenhauer.In short, this book is highly recommended. The only fault in my view is the exercises at the end of the book, which I found to be not very useful."},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"I havn't read this book since I was six but that is beyond the point!

The Goat in a Boat? The Ape in a Cape? The Crab in a Cab? The Whale in a Pail?The Whale in a Pail! I can just see it now. The long awaited follow up to The Cat in the Hat, featuring a walking, talking whale who, for no reason whatsoever, happens to spend time in a freakin' pail! Never mind the fact that whales don't fit in pails, never mind the fact that whales can't talk--this particular whale defies all the laws of nature for reasons that go entirely unexplained.I'd like to know where this Seuss fella got his degree, because I think they're handing out diplomas to anyone who shows up at their door.One star"},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"This book was very good.

There is an amusing plot guaranteed to hold their interest and the illustrations are very nicely done. There are inevitably a few words in the text of the book that children will not know; this gives the child a chance to learn new words as they enjoy this classic tale. Moreover, children build self-confidence about their reading skills and intelligence as they read this book and learn some new words. Excellent!The plot is fairly simple: two children are left home alone while their mother is out during a cold, wet day. They are bored until a huge cat wearing a hat comes into their home. The cat attempts to entertain the children but wreaks havoc instead. Total chaos ensues when the cat introduces his two friends \\"Thing One\\" and \\"Thing Two\\" to the two young children.The book is affordable and the writing is so endearing that your child--or children--will enjoy it over and over again. You can also talk with your child about the colors used in the illustrations as a way to teach them names for colors.One reviewer writes that the fish represents the conscience of the children who know better than to create chaos and wreck the house while their mother is away. This could very well be true; but, then again--who cares? This is a children's book and it is not intended to be interpreted on that level by very young children.I have fond memories of reading this book with my parents and occasionally a babysitter when I was a very young boy. It brought back memories of a time when I felt protected by my elders; hopefully you can sit next to your child--or children--and help them read this book so that your child will have those same fond memories one day.I highly recommend this book for children who are learning to read or who have recently mastered the ability to read this relatively elementary type of book independently. It is a fine example of juvenile fiction. Moreover, if you sit with your child as they read you can not only educate them but hopefully the children will have fond memories of reading this book with you when they grow older."},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"It was very late one weekday night,My sleep was restless so I turned on the light.I was looking for something...something to read,But what on earth would fill such a need?I searched high and I searched low for just the right title,Would it be literature?Would it be non-fiction?How about the Bible...I wanted something fun...something light...something easyAnd then I came across the gift I was givenwhen I was just three...The Cat in the Hat, such a delightful taleNo matter how many times I read itIt never seems staleSo I sat on the couch and turned the old pages,Wishing my wife were awake so we could both laugh,(Cuz laughter's contagious)But I persevered and continued to readFeeling and knowing I had met my heart's need.I put the book on the shelf in its placeA smile still stretched on my happy faceI went back to bed with that smile still onAnd quietly slept until the new morning dawned."},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"A timeless story of mischief and mahem"},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"i myself do not enjoy this book, but my little sister loves it, so i'll speak for her and give it a 10!

It's doubtful there is anyone anywhere in the US that hasn't heard of Dr. Seuss or his most famous of books The Cat in the Hat. Suffice to say this book was a classic when it was written and it remains a classic today, some fifty years later.What you may not know about Dr. Seuss is that the good doctor was really a gentleman named Theodor Seuss Geisel. Mr. Geisel began his career as a little known editorial cartoonist in the 1920s. As his work evolved, he became known for his intriguing perspectives and fresh concepts. His works moved from basic cartooning to deft illustrations, sculptures and oil paintings that showcased his elaborate imagination. He had a unique artistic vision, and his artwork became the platform from which he delivered dozens of children's books, hundreds of political cartoons, hundreds of advertisements, and many editorials filled with wonderfully inventive animals, characters and clever humor."},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"The Cat got old?

(for my money, Jim Carey will osmote into Jack Nicholson, history repeats.)But Mike Myers is overstretching himself this time. He's just not cool enough to be the Cat. Carey probably could've been, Myers will fail. Even in the preview mpgs, it just sucks. Pretend the movie doesn't exist, it's ugly and nasty, read the books, watch the cartoon... Myers has got it bottom-backwards; the cat's careless irresponsibility is the core of the character, dictating \\"right-minded correct behaviour\\" is just dumb. Kids got brains...Ah, jeez, it's so depressing. The Cat is an iconic figure, and Myers is gonna destroy him, 'cos he's run out of ideas. (Wayne, Austin P, worn out..)

Well my favoritechildhood book was and always will be the cat in thehat.The reason the cat in the hat is my favorite childhood book is because of it's funny little rhyme's and poamsthey have hidden along the paragraph. I think the little catchy phrases make the book more interesting and funnier.I think eight year old's and down should really hear this book I think they would like it .The children would probably like the weird and unusual pictures and crazy sounding words some of those words I don't even think are words.I think the children would get a kick out of this book by reading about thing one and thing two how they get brought in to the book by the cat carring them in on his back in a box. When the cat lets them out they take of running threw the house trying to destroy it by playing games and tarring things of the walls.Some adults that might come over this book would probably think it is cute and suitable for there children. But it never hits them that they could try tomake some since out of the book that would be a mind blower. I don't think I could ever make any since out of it.

It's a classic, no doubt there, so don't pass it by for your children. Who can't remember a rainy day as a child, nothing to do but look out the window and be bored, bored, bored?! But, in walks the zany cat who wants to have fun, but really doesn't know how. Instead, he tries but ends up messing up the house entirely, but he does know how to clean up and that little machine causes a lot of discussion in our house (\\"Mommy, why don't we have one of those? How does that work?\\", etc.). What I think is really good in this book is that it teaches children to do what is right, even though something may actually look like fun. The little boy in the story actually captures Thing One and Two and makes the cat leave with them. He could have joined in the mayhem but instead, honored what he had been taught and made the cat stop. The story is just fabulous and stirs all kinds of imagination in children.

In the foreground, a large tree/phallic symbol dances wildly in the wind, taunting the children and encouraging them to succumb to the sexual yearnings they undoubtedly feel for each other.Even to the most unlearned reader, the blatant references to the incestuous relationship the two share set the tone for Seuss's probing examination of the satisfaction of primitive needs. The Cat proceeds to charm the wary youths into engaging in what he so innocently refers to as \\"tricks.\\" At this point, the fish, an obvious Christ figure who represents the prevailing Christian morality, attempts to warn the children, and thus, in effect, warns all of humanity of the dangers associated with the unleashing of the primal urges. In response to this, the cat proceeds to balance the aquatic naysayer on the end of his umbrella, essentially saying, \\"Down with morality; down with God!\\"After pooh-poohing the righteous rantings of the waterlogged Christ figure, the Cat begins to juggle several icons of Western culture, most notably two books, representing the Old and New Testaments, and a saucer of lacteal fluid, an ironic reference to maternal loss the two children experienced when their mother abandoned them \\"for the afternoon.\\" Our heroic Id adds to this bold gesture a rake and a toy man, and thus completes the Oedipal triangle.Later in the novel, Seuss introduces the proverbial Pandora's box, a large red crate out of which the Id releases Thing One, or Freud's concept of Ego, the division of the psyche that serves as the conscious mediator between the person and reality, and Thing Two, the Superego, which functions to reward and punish through a system of moral attitudes, conscience, and guilt. Referring to this box, the Cat says, \\"Now look at this trick. Take a look!\\" In this, Dr. Seuss uses the children as a brilliant metaphor for the reader, and asks the reader to re-examine his own inner self.The children, unable to control the Id, Ego, and Superego, allow these creatures to run free and mess up the house, or more symbolically, control their lives. This rampage continues until the fish, or Christ symbol, warns that the mother is returning to reinstate the Oedipal triangle that existed before her abandonment of the children. At this point, Seuss introduces a many-armed cleaning device which represents the psychoanalytic couch, which proceeds to put the two youngsters' lives back in order.With powerful simplicity, clarity, and drama, Seuss reduces Freud's concepts on the dynamics of the human psyche to an easily understood gesture. Mr. Seuss's poetry and choice of words is equally impressive and serves as a splendid counterpart to his bold symbolism. In all, his writing style is quick and fluid, making \\"The Cat in the Hat\\" impossible to put down. While this novel is 61 pages in length, and one can read it in five minutes or less, it is not until after multiple readings that the genius of this modern day master becomes apparent."},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"I read this book to my children and they enjoyed it.

This has rhyme, as well. We have forgotten the value of rhyme. In the old days, students would memorize what they learned, in rhyming verse, because rhyme is easier to remember.

I used to read them to my children almost every night. That is how they learned how to read, if you let your child sit next to you and listen to how many times Dr. Seuss would repeat the same word in his books. It drove me crazy but it worked to teach my children how to read at a very young age.As I read the stories we looked at the silly pictures and then eras the same words again in a short time they were correcting me, I made mistakes on purpose to see how much they were paying attention.Sitting with a child and reading to them is both a benefit to them and to you it is relaxing and fun to share such moments together."},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"the cat in the hat by dr. seussthis is about a girl and boy and how they sit in their home while their mother went to town. a cat walks in and wants to have fun with them.the fish is not for it at all and tells him to leave. the children play with different things and the whole house turns into a mess and they seetheir mother about to walk in the door when the cat calls upon things one and thing two to help clean up the mess. they do it before the mom walksin the door and the cat leaves. the ending question is do you tell your mom what you did while she was gone or just say you looked out the window all day....."},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"I know this book almost by heart from it having been read to me during my childhood.

The characters in the book are an outraged fish, an extremely bad cat, a very good girl, and a very good boy. The story is very entertaining to read to young kids.The story begins when the sister and brother are very bored on a wet rainy day. A big naughty cat comes to the children's home. The fish is right when it said \\"He should not be here. He should not be here at all.\\" And so the cat in the hat makes an enormous mess of the children's house. Their Mommy is away, and the kids are afraid the messy house will never get cleaned before their Mommy gets home. How will it get done? Read the book to find out.Now the children in the book are not at all bored. I liked the pictures that show how the cat makes hilarious things happen in the usually, very neat home.

In the end though, the cat cleans up after himself, becoming a somewhat good role model despite his previous carelessness.The before mentioned rhymes are used in this story to represent the text in a grabbing and mind provoking way that my child loves.

I liked reading it to them too, though I was always a bit disturbed by it. The cat -in- the hat's entering the house and making disorder everywhere was if i remember rightly, made amusing by the rhyming humorous language. This was one of the children's books that did not simply fascinated but amused.Perhaps too children identify with the cat-in- the- hat's total defiance of adult order and rule. He comes into the house when the parents of the children are away, and from then on proceeds to take all a part. The way he rapidly cleans it up before they come home, I think too speaks to children.They have done something forbidden, defied the order of the world, and yet gotten away with it.I will admit reading this always made me a bit uneasy. But again the language, the excellent illustrations made for delight.

A bizarre blending of Seuss's trademark illustrations with an eerily Kafkaesque plot, &quot;Cat&quot; will delight both children and adults.The plot is simple: The narrator, a small boy, is left home on a rainy day with his sister Sally. But their boring day is interrupted by the Cat in the Hat, a weirdly anthropomorphic, talking feline who proceeds to turn their house into a chaotic playground. The illustrations--think Salvador Dali meets Beatrix Potter--are marvelous.This book is simple enough for beginning readers, yet full of subtle touches that could keep an army of literary critics and psychologists busy analyzing it for decades. And that is the brilliance of Dr. Seuss. Buy a copy of the book for your favorite child, buy a second for your favorite adult, and keep a third for yourself."},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"Researchers constantly find that reading to children is valuable in a variety of ways, not least of which are instilling a love of reading and improved reading skills. With better parent-child bonding from reading, your child will also be more emotionally secure and able to relate better to others. Intellectual performance will expand as well. Spending time together watching television fails as a substitute.To help other parents apply this advice, as a parent of four I consulted an expert, our youngest child, and asked her to share with me her favorite books that were read to her as a young child. The Cat in the Hat was one of her picks.I have always thought of this book as a metaphor for the sort of &quot;make believe&quot; thinking that children like to do and are good at. The setting is a cold rainy day, and the children's mother isn't home. I have always transformed that into they are playing in their room while their mother is busy elsewhere in the house. Suddenly, a mysterious cat arrives who can do remarkable jugging (until he drops everything) and brings in a fun box (with two little creatures who fly kites). A parental voice, however, is always present in the form of the children's fish who constantly warns them to get rid of the cat in the hat.Suddenly, the mother is spotted about to reenter the house. The children are panic-stricken. The house is a mess! What to do? They are obviously about to be really in for it. I can feel the adrenaline rushing even now as I remember similar situations with friends as a child.But then, the cat in the hat returns with a miraculous device which cleans everything up! And then he is gone, just as their mother steps in. She asks, &quot;Did you have any fun? Tell me. What did you do?&quot; The two children don't know what to say. They ask you what you would do if your mother asked you.The ending is wonderful because it sets up a wonderful opportunity to talk about the story. Would the child let in the cat in the hat? Would the child ask the cat in the hat to leave and when? Was the fish correct in warning the children? What are the other reasons not to let strangers in? Why should you tell your mother if things go awry, or not? In the course of the discussion, fears that the story probably raises can be dealt with in a constructive way that reduces fear in the future and improves communication in the family. Most children have these kinds of fears, but aren't usually willing to bring them up. So the book gives you the excuse to work on improving their security.This is one of the more difficult Dr. Seuss books for beginning readers, so you'll be reading this one to your child for a while. The appeal to the child is very much in the idea of playing unrestrained in the house. Almost no child is allowed to do that, and the consequences are pretty funny for the child if they are happening to someone else.If you want to see the earliest versions of the cat in the hat character, be sure to see Dr. Seuss Goes to War which documents his work as a political cartoonist in World War II.Then, encourage your child to use the book to come up with her or his own ideas about fun things to do as make-believe on a rainy day. Can they imagine a more fun make-believe visitor than the cat in the hat? What would the visitor do? If you ask these questions, you will extend your child's imagination now and for a lifetime.Enjoy for the rest of your life!"},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"I loved this as a kid, and I love it now. It's not politically correct like much childrens' literature today--and that's its charm. The children are not naughty, but they certainly get themselves into a pickle with the Id-like cat who cheerfully enters their home and wreakes havoc while their mother is out for the afternoon. Would that the Id were always so congenial! The house gets wrecked, but the cat can clean up as fast as he can make a mess, and by the time mom gets home, everything's back to normal. The last line in the book is best of all: \\"What would you do if your mother asked you?\\" No moralizing here--just a simple question. This is children's literature with a capital L....buy it for your kids, buy it for yourself if you're \\"all growed up.\\""},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"With the Universal Studios movie just out, my fondness of cats and a work mate who affirmed, \\"if you haven't read Dr. Seuss, you have missed on one of the most wonderful childhood literary experiences\\"; I decided I would pick one of his books on my next visit to Borders. That was this afternoon. The result? It's simply brilliant. \\"The cat in the hat\\" presents children not only a wonderful chance for learning to read, but with the possibility of having fun at no one else's expense. When feelings don't get hurt, no one ends up unhappy. The two children enjoy what would otherwise have turned into a dull rainy day thanks to presence of the magical cat. He does make a mess of things, but in the end he knows when to stop and ...PICKS UP AFTER HIMSELF. (Young children, listen!)The wonder of the book is not that the mom will not be upset at the mischief her children have produced when she comes back, but it lies in fact that the children have ownership of their own private world. The fun they had is their own little secret. No one knows or has to know. And the ending? Well, I can just imagine a child's face when the story gets read to them and the parent goes: \\"What would you do if your mother asked you?\\""},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"A neglectful parent, a subversive cat, a piscine Big Brother, and twin automatons.People regardAlice In Wonderlandas a shining beacon of literary nonsense, but The Cat in the Hat more than holds its own.Illustrated in simple primary colors of red and blue, this is a book your kids will love but with which you ought to have a rather more complicated relationship. Ted was some kind of writer to spin a story so silly (in a child's eyes) and yet so deviant.The questions that may be asked are myriad: Should Sally and her brother have called 9-1-1 the moment the Cat broke in? Why does this \\"Cat\\" wear gloves? Does ennui invite catastrophe? Why are young children home alone? Did their mother set up the entire plot? Why did Seuss choose a Darwin fish to be the eyes, ears, and mouthpiece for Big Brother? Did the circus ever find their performing cat? And perhaps, was it all a dream?The story ends with a question reminiscent of Dr. Seuss' very first book (And to think that I saw it on Mulberry street), i.e., What would *you* do?"},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"We like the characters in this book, especially the talking fish. The kids should never have let anyone or anything in their house while their mom was gone. It was fun to hear and to say the rhyming words and it helped us learn to read.

In reality....this is the classic book that nearly every child,and adult should read,or have read to them. Two children left at home by their mother,on a boring rainy day,and told to behave. Enter the Cat In The Hat....who's goal in life,seems to be doing anything but behaving! The childrens goldfish is the voice of reason,but he is easily out voted,by the want to have &quot;fun&quot;. But as we learn,fun that is without boundries,is fun that causes trouble! I remember this book as a child,and we all delighted in a Cat in a Hat,but how soon we would wish we were as smart as a fish!

Using a vocabulary of a mere 223 words, 'The Cat in the Hat' has become a standard children's classic throughout the English-speaking world. I remember as a child delighting at the discovery of rhyming words and what fun they could be, and when coupled with the imaginative drawings and simple yet engaging plot lines, Dr. Seuss became my favourite almost instantly.The plot of 'The Cat in the Hat' is simple yet meaningful. A cat, a perfect creature for exhibiting independence and mischief, is befriended by children who express delight, astonishment, and occasional disapproval of their be-hatted feline. Children learn behaviour in a humourous and touching way by relating to the children.However, all of Seussian literature was almost not to be. Geisel had literally dozens of rejections for his early works, from publishers who doubted the appeal or the marketability. Fortunately for us, Geisel continued to pursue both writing and publication, which he continued up to the time of his death in 1991. He still had a book on the bestseller list at that time.Long Live Dr. Seuss!"},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"This is a charming tale of home invasion and Stockholm Syndrome from the perspective of a child. Left alone while their mother is \\"out of the house for the day,\\" two children are surprised as the Cat in the Hat forces his way into their house (\\"how that bump made us jump!\\"). Once inside, he attempts to win the children over with acrobatics but only creates a mess and damages their property. When asked to leave, the situation escalates (\\"I will NOT go away. I do NOT wish to go!\\") and he shows the children two small \\"things\\" that he keeps prisoner in a box. Once released, the things run wild through the home and cause even more mayhem. It is only the imminent return of the children's mother that brings the standoff to an end, and the Cat in the Hat quickly cleans up the evidence of his presence before escaping. Interestingly, when their mother returns home, the children are not sure whether they should report the day's events to their mother, apparently sympathizing with the Cat despite the danger he put them in. Or perhaps they fear their mother more than the destructive, erratic Cat."},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"I learned to read with the dull and predictable Dick, Jane and Sally books. And Spot. I mustn't forget Spot. Then one day I got my hands on The Cat in the Hat and reading changed for me forever. It became fun, lively and whimsical. In short, magical. And that's how it's been for me ever since. I couldn't read enough Dr. Seuss as a kid, and as a parent, of course I shared all his books with my own children."},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"Dr. Seuss was one of my favorite childhood authors. His books were easy for me to read as a very young child. They are excellent primers for beginning readers. They are also beautifully illustrated and they will tease and twist your child's mind into a delightful pretzel filled with laughter.The Cat in the Hat has got to be one of my favorites. It is a wonderful story about how a cat shows up at a child's home one afternoon and turns the house into chaos.I would have to say that Dr. Seuss' writing has affected my own since I write books in a humorous albeit adult vein.

You can't go wrong."},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"The Cat in the Hat at first glance may seem like a nonsensical text meant merely to amuse its readers. If you stop and ponder this story of two children left at home alone one afternoon, you soon realize there is a more powerful message than first meets the eye. The children clearly know the difference between right and wrong, but with the slightest influence from the Cat, they easily give in. I believe the fish represents their conscience. They choose to ignore its warning time and again, and therefore, find themselves in a mountain of mess. Before the story's end, they are able to right the wrongs, but we as readers are left with this thought and question: \\"Then our mother came in and she said to us two, \\"Did you have any fun, tell me what did you do?\\" Should we tell her about it? Now what SHOULD we do? What would you do if your mother asked you?\\" (Seuss, 60-61)."},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"The Cat In The Hat is a great book.

Second, after we've read \\"Cat\\" or \\"ABC\\" or \\"Green Eggs\\" ten times, the tape (or now DVD) comes out.Hey, these aren't computer-generated neon robots that nearly come at you from inside your TV, but quick editing and flashing neon colors don't necessarily make good kiddie entertainment.I'll stick with the classics."},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"I've now read Cat in the Hat to my 2 year-old son everynight since we took it off the shelf two weeks ago.

Beyond the fun of the words and story, an implicit subversive message resides merrily with the book's affirmation of order and stability in a child's world.

It was too wet to play. So we sat in the house. All that cold, cold, wet day.\\"The setting is a cold rainy day, and the children's mother isn't home. Suddenly walking up the driveway comes The Cat in the Hat. And what a mess he makes. Inviting himself into the house he breaks plates, gets food all over the place, and much, much more. He then brings out of his hat Thing 1 and Thing 2 accompanied then by a lot more Things. They make an even better mess jumping into the goldfish bowl, breaking more plates, and banging pots and pans. Then all the Things go back in the hat and magically everything is put back to normal by a giant vacuum as the mother gets home. She asks, \\"Did you have any fun? Tell me. What did you do?\\" The two children don't know what to say. They ask you what you would do if your mother asked you.This is a good book to read to your children on a cold, wet day, or on any type of day. They should get some laughs out of hearing or reading this book. This may be one of Seuss' harder books to read but it's still an all time favorite like all his other books."},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"If you approach Seuss's \\"Cat in the Hat\\" looking to be told a story worthy of the Modern Library's #1 book of the 20th Century, then you will most likely be disappointed. But if you throw aside your expectations of what makes a book great and just read the words as you would the people, places, sights and sounds that trigger your thoughts during the course of a normal day, then you will be amazed.In \\"Cat,\\" Theodor Seuss Geisel uses his superhuman vocabulary and literary knowledge to relate a day in the life of a couple children and the animals and things with whom they interact. Seuss's words are abnormally sophisticated, yet one never gets the feeling he is simply showing off. While his writing style is often referred to as stream-of-consciousness, it is clear that every word is appropriately placed and deeply thought out. As \\"Cat\\" meanders along through its day, the objects that enter the periphery of the protagonists triggers emotions and thoughts that lead to: poems, songs, theological and political discussions, laughing, shouting, incoherent noises, etc. The novel ranges from sublime to aggravating, but that is only because it is so true to its form. How many times in a normal day, if we were to stop and ruminate upon what we were just thinking, would we then think, \\"What was that?\\" But then it's quickly on to the next interaction destined to spark different emotions, thoughts, ideas, etc...It is impossible to sum this book up. It follows no plot or pattern other than that it is simply 1 day. Two people, a cat, a goldfish, and two things... 1 day.Reading this book reminded me at times of the Simpsons episode where Homer is seen watching an episode of David Lynch's Twin Peaks. \\"Brilliant!\\" Homer remarks, but then quietly to himself, \\"I have no idea what is going on here.\\" While I often found myself in Homer's predicament while reading Cat, I was always able to appreciate Seuss's writing, even if the individual words were all I understood. For that reason, I plan on reading this book again several years from now to see what life has taught me that might expand my understanding of Seuss's beautiful day."},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"The title of my book is \\"The Cat in the Hat.\\" I liked this humorous, fiction story so well that I gave it a five star rating.

He cleans up his mess and is gone. Right after that the mom walks in.The characters in this book are Sally, her brother, the cat, a fish, and their mom.

Not that I won't acquiesce, mind you, but some five-page works that are perhaps less imaginative than others are harder to approach with a high degree of enthusiasm. This book is not one of those.Thank goodness there is nothing in this book (written decades ago) that can in any way be deemed \\"politically incorrect.\\" While my experience is solely with a two-and-a-half year old, I assume that this book would be interesting for older children, and is also geared to those learning to read. I can remember the animated feature that used to run on CBS every year (probably thirty years ago), but the book is far better.It is the tale of a cat who attempts to provide entertainment to a couple of children on a rainy day. A terrible mess is made in the process, but the Cat in the Hat \\"always picks up his playthings,\\" and I believe parents can get some use out of this desirable character trait evident in the titled feline.The Suess rhymes and rhythms are terrible fun, and I have have yet to tire of them.

This book has great style like descriptive, voice, vocabulary, and most of all it has lots of figurative language, for example, when he said \\"fast as a fox.\\" The illustrations and characters are very creative because they are very weird names and things. Dr. Seuss is the most creative and amazing author I have ever heard of. One of the things we didn't enjoy about this book is that it has too many tongue twisters. Here is an example of the tongue twister, \\"I can get them I bet. I bet, with my net, I can get those Things yet!\\" The lesson in this book is to never say that you will never have fun if you are not outside. I would recommend this book to people who like tongue twisters and also people who have read Dr. Seuss books because this is another great story with great styled in it."},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"Used it as a photo prop for my newborn nephew and when he becomes a reader, he will love it as much as I do!"},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"Yes, I think New Hampshire's state motto fits with the Cat :)For me, the morals of the story are:1.

This book allows children to enhance and expand their imagination. The main character, a talking cat, causes distruction in the house of two children while trying to have fun.

Beginner Books, The Cat in the Hat is a hard-hitting novel of prose and poetry in which the author re-examines the dynamic rhyming schemes and bold imagery of some of his earlier works, most notably _Green Eggs and Ham_, _If I Ran the Zoo_. In this novel, Theodore Geisel, writing under the pseudonym Dr. Seuss, pays homage to the great Dr. Sigmund Freud in a nightmarish fantasy of a renegade feline helping two young children understand their own frustrated sexuality. The story opens with two youngsters, a brother and a sister, abandoned by their mother, staring mournfully through the window of their single-family dwelling. In the foreground, a large tree/phallic symbol dances wildly in the wind, taunting the children and encouraging them to succumb to the sexual yearnings they undoubtedly feel for each other. Even to the most unlearned reader, the blatant references to the incestuous relationship the two share set the tone for Seuss' probing examination of the satisfaction of primitive needs. The Cat proceeds to charm the wary youths into engaging in what he so innocently refers to as &quot;tricks.&quot; At this point, the fish, an obvious Christ figure who represents the prevailing Christian morality, attempts to warn the children, and thus, in effect, warns all of humanity of the dangers associated with the unleashing of the primal urges. In response to this, the cat proceeds to balance the aquatic naysayer on the end of his umbrella, essentially saying, &quot;Down with morality; down with God!&quot; After poohpoohing the righteous rantings of the waterlogged Christ figure, the Cat begins to juggle several icons of Western culture, most notably two books, representing the Old and New Testaments, and a saucer of lactal fluid, an ironic reference to maternal loss the two children experienced when their mother abandoned them &quot;for the afternoon.&quot; Our heroic Id adds to this bold gesture a rake and a toy man, and thus completes the Oedipal triangle. Later in the novel, Seuss introduces the proverbial Pandora's box, a large red crate out of which the Id releases Thing One, or Freud's concept of Ego, the division of the psyche that serves as the conscious mediator between the person and reality, and Thing Two, the Superego which functions to reward and punish through a system of moral attitudes, conscience, and guilt. Referring to this box, the Cat says, &quot;Now look at this trick. Take a look!&quot; In this, Dr. Seuss uses the children as a brilliant metaphor for the reader, and asks the reader to re-examine his own inner self. The children, unable to control the Id, Ego, and Superego allow these creatures to run free and mess up the house, or more symbolically, control their lives. This rampage continues until the fish, or Christ symbol, warns that the mother is returning to reinstate the Oedipal triangle that existed before her abandonment of the children. At this point, Seuss introduces a many-armed cleaning device which represents the psychoanalytic couch, which proceeds to put the two youngsters' lives back in order. With powerful simplicity, clarity, and drama, Seuss reduces Freud's concepts on the dynamics of the human psyche to an easily understood gesture. Mr. Seuss' poetry and choice of words is equally impressive and serves as a splendid counterpart to his bold symbolism. In all, his writing style is quick and fluid, making _The Cat in the Hat_ impossible to put down. While this novel is 61 pages in length, and one can read it in five minutes or less, it is not until after multiple readings that the genius of this modern day master becomes apparent."},{"Title":"The cat in the hat","review":"The Cat in the Hat is a hard-hitting novel of prose and poetryin which the author re-examines the dynamic rhyming schemes and bold imagery of some of his earlier works, most notably Green Eggs and Ham, If I Ran the Zoo, and Why Can't I Shower With Mommy?

Bennington is easily one of the (maybe) 2 or 3 persons alive that are even nearly qualified to \\"finish Derrida's sentence.\\" Everything I read of his is almost as if Derrida, himself, were writing.Though an excellent look at exactly what Derrida is up to in his early days from Grammatology to Glas, this is not for the beginner. \\"Deconstruction in a Nutshell\\" by John Caputo and \\"How to Read Derrida\\" by Penelope Deutscher are better for introductory purposes.This work was indispensable for me, as I was introduced to Derrida through his later works and had very little idea how his whole project began in the 60s, 70s, and 80s.If you are fairly experienced in theory, I would recommend laboring through this work, then re-reading it a couple years later after further work with Derrida, Heidegger, etc. It will clear up a lot of question marks while opening up new, more exciting ones."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida (Religion and Postmodernism)","review":"If one reads JACQUES DERRIDA by Jacques Derrida and Geoffrey Bennington as an attempt to combine theme with content, then the result will surely be what it is: a massively unruly exposition of deconstruction which practices what it preaches. The basic idea of deconstruction is that there is no definitive linking of signifier to its ultimate referent, called variously the \\"metaphysics of presence\\" or the logocentric reality. One signifier seeks its signified which in turn seeks its referent, but in the unruly world of Derridean deconstruction, that referent is never found. The result is that one signified points only to another in an eternal linguistic loop. There is no \\"there\\" there. Further, since Derrida asserts that there is nothing outside the text, then the very definitions of words like \\"text,\\" \\"border,\\" and \\"page\\" need some serious adjustment. The rules that most readers think of as natural are now seen as not so natural at all. A page, for example, is not merely a piece of paper with a fixed set of dimensions bounded by such determinate barriers as letters per line, words per page, or special marks. Instead, in JACQUES DERRIDA, what Derrida and Bennington have done was to unite concept to reality. About two thirds of each page is reserved for Bennington. The bottom third is separated by a horizontal line, under which is a running commentary by Derrida. Bennington's approach is reasonably traditional; he discusses in a general manner the rudiments of Derridean deconstruction. Derrida's contribution is harder to fathom; he rambles as if each rambling thought were a signified seeking its referent. Alas, just as all signifieds vainly point everywhere except to that, so do Derrida's linguistic peregrinations similarly meander. I was able to follow most of Bennington's points, which like in a good cop/bad cop routine played straight man to Derrida. And perhaps that was the intended point. For readers who prefer their themes to be rendered traditionally intelligible, then Derrida's JACQUES DERRIDA may be just a bit too much."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida (Religion and Postmodernism)","review":"Bennington/Derrida's coauthored text is a creative (and often lucid) attempt to demonstrate deconstruction, as well as the life and work of the ever bewitching Derrida. Bennington's contribution is one of the finest attempts at an explanation of Derrida's work yet available. He attempts to systematize deconstruction through a rigorous reading of Derrida's moves and positions from the early work found in 'Writing and Difference,' to the later texts regarding politics and religion. Derrida contributes his 'Circumfession,' a free-wheeling text devoted to the idea of the confession found in St. Augustine (and of course Rousseau), while at the same time providing an opportunity for Derrida to reflect on memories from his life. The circumfession is also a demonstration that deconstruction cannot be systematized, as Bennington's commentary fails to truly 'pin down' the life of Derrida as made evident in this curious little text. Admittedly, I found most of 'Circumfession' hard-going and uninteresting. Perhaps there is simply too much about Derrida's penis. Nevertheless, this book is one of the finest of critical commentaries available."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida (Religion and Postmodernism)","review":"It is a extraordinary book. It Gives you a perfect way to introduce you to Derrida's project (if it is possible to say a \\"project\\") of deconstruction and if you have already read something of Derrida it gives you a way of get deeper in Derrida's way of thinking.Goffrey Bennington worked close to Derrida in order to achieve this book in a very faithful way to Derrida's thought. Derrida himself write the supplement (If you allow me the irony)of this book, it is very interesting see how Derrida think about himself."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida (Religion and Postmodernism)","review":"I'll admit that it's hard enough to read Derrida, and I won't suggest that this is easier - in fact, reading this as a straightforward work front-to-back will probably lead to more confusion. But I definitely appreciate Derrida's paratextual manipulations and evasions of Bennington, who tries as hard as he can to pin down Derrida's thought at the same time. Bennington's topical arrangement is a great entre into the various subjects Derrida takes up in his philosophy, as long as you don't take it too dogmatically... and Derrida constantly comments in his running footnote to make sure that you don't."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida (Religion and Postmodernism)","review":"I will of course be called a fool, but someone has to say it. The Emperor has no clothes.I read this book to find out what Derrida thought about one thing (circumcision). Reading between the lines (to say the least!) I came to the conclusion that he doesn't like it (he hints that he left his sons intact). This may be connected to his being expelled from school at 12 for being Jewish.In between I learnt more than I ever want to know about his mother's death and her bedsores. I don't think I learnt anything else about anything. I gather Bennington is a devotee, and Derrida is phenomenally self-absorbed.Both Benningon's \\"analysis\\" of Derrida's thought and Derrida's \\"autobiographical\\" footnotes, in sentence-long chapters, read like Gertrude Stein on crack. Bennington at least puts full stops at intervals. Each word (usually) grammatically connects with the next, but this is neither philosophy nor literary criticism as these terms are usually understood in the rational world. Most of the words I understand (every so often there is an undefined neologism like \\"affabulation\\"), but try as I might, I can not translate anything Bennington or Derrida says into anything sensible (able to be affirmed or denied) about the real world, language, literature, or philosophy. (Post-modernists and New Agers may laugh at me for thinking there is a real world, but if there is not, what is it that we are disagreeing about?) It is filled with wild generalisations asserted with no evidence, undermined by weasel-wording (\\"we may\\" \\"perhaps\\" etc.).Photographs in the text indicate that Derrida took stands on some of the political issues of his day. One assumes he did not use the kind of thought on display here to reach those stands, or he would have taken both sides on every issue.I am not at all surprised that text like this can be generated by a computer (Search on \\"elsewhere pomo\\"), and it would not surprise me if people who read and claim to understand this kind of thing consider the computer-generated text to be just as valuable as what Derrida or Bennington write. If so, I agree: not at all."},{"Title":"A History of the Jews in New Mexico","review":"The author does a good job covering the general history of the Jews (Ashkenazi) in New Mexico who came after the opening of the Santa Fe trail and mostly after the arrival of the Americans and the Mexican-American War.

I find nothing here to inspire me, and I would rate this book a 1 if it weren't for the good research the author's done on types of beads and materials used in jewelry. Here's what I found in this book; maybe you will see more value in it than I do:The majority of the book is taken up with descriptions, histories, meanings of beads and materials. There is a section on materials from nature, and necklaces are shown of chicken bones, chili peppers, dried oranges, leaves, etc. A couple pages on shells describes how to cut, file, and drill them for threading. There's a section on how to discern between real and fake materials like coral, amber, jet, ivory, pearls etc. Chapters on metal beads and glass beads spend many pages describing how they are made. A short chapter on polymer clay beads shows examples of items made with them, but gives instructions for only one of the examples.A following chapter is on the history of jewelry styles in the U.S. throughout the 20th century. Quite a few pictures are shown, but instructions for very few of them are given. The next chapters focus on specific jewelry styles i.e., the liberty necklace, chokers, lacy collar types, and pendants. Although many pictures are shown, some fairly attractive, only one necklace of each photographic display has instructions.The instructions for the projects are interspersed throughout these chapters, mixed in with the history, etc. of the bead types and styles. For the most part, they are written instructions, rarely accompanied by diagrams, which I think are generally more useful than wordy explanations. The instructions often refer you to see a technique described elsewhere, sometimes in the last chapter of the book which has skimpy instructions for general techniques, along with some diagrams. These are not adequate for beginners.One somewhat interesting chapter deals with beads used as currency, the symbolic meaning of beads in some cultures, amulets, talismans, healing gems, and documenting your collection of beads. Within this chapter is a page of necklaces made with \\"junk\\", and junk it is! The worst of which, in my opinion, is a black cord with the arm of an antique doll hanging on it as a pendant.On the whole I have found this book to be poorly organized, uninspiring, and useful mainly as an encyclopedic resource if one wants an education about the beads themselves. I have other bead books that do this same job at least as well and also have wonderful projects and instructions."},{"Title":"The Bead Jewelry Book","review":"Stefany has gone and done it again. Like her earlier book, Beads!, she presents many ideas and techniques, but you can easily see how people's interest in beads has increased in these last ten years. Her layout, sprinkled liberally with sharp photographs by Maggie Campbell Pederson, flows smoothly and invites you ever forward in your study. Stefany does not leave you wondering about the beads in the photos, but clearly labels each piece that is pictured.Stefany begins in her first chapter by describing beads made from natural materials. The second chapter opens with the work of glass bead artists, then moves on to metal, clay and decorated beads. Techniques and styles of beadwork are in the third chapter, then the fourth chapter is devoted to collectible beads.The techniques Stefany presents are about the only repetition from the older book Beads! that there are in The Bead Jewelry Book, so I would not discourage you from having both books in your personal library. Start saving your chicken bones; page 13 will show you what to do with them."},{"Title":"The Bead Jewelry Book","review":"In the mid 1990ies when beading became popular, there were few books around.

Imagine a book without lots of Japanese seed bead projects!It is more about historic, ethnic beads, large beads, handmade uneven beads, and classics. This book would appeal more to collectors, and bead historians than new beaders who are into Austrian crystals, and 3D seed beading projects that are very popular now.A practical set of suggestions for combining bead colors is on page 119 \\"Designing with Colour in Bead Jewellery\\" section.

Even now, as adults, we still enjoy them, and have read the series (through 9) multiple times. This is the first book of the series that comes with notes for each chapter, which adds much to the understanding of the historical nature of the story. This is also the first book in the series that is told from the perspective of several characters. Because of this, the book jumps around much. I imagine that some kids may have difficulty keeping the flow of the novel with so much switching between narrators. As with the other books in the series (#3 and forward), there are multiple story-lines in the book. However, this is the first book that really does not connect the stories, and therefore leaves the book lacking in some respects. Even the next in the series does not connect the stories, so I wait with eager anticipation that #10 will finally wrap them all together. Unlike the trilogy of 5-7, which connected nicely all the way through, this one leaves a group of characters essentially floating in a literary limbo, leaving the reader wondering. Nevertheless, for readers of the series, one must read this one too. \\"Gadiantons and the Silver Sword (#2)\\" remains my favorite of the series for suspense, and numbers 3 and 4 remain my favorites for story-line.

If you want to begin educating your children earlier about American history, specifically slavery have them read K.J. McWilliams books; The Journal of Darien Duff, an Emancipated Slave, The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo, and The Journal of Leroy Jones, a Fugitive Slave. They are based on slave narratives such as this one and include many interesting photos as well as additional information."},{"Title":"Remembering Slavery: African Americans Talk About Their Personal Experiences of Slavery and Freedom","review":"I am a high school librarian cataloging this book. For a book published in conjunction with the Library of Congress, it is astounding that it does not have an L.C. number"},{"Title":"Remembering Slavery: African Americans Talk About Their Personal Experiences of Slavery and Freedom","review":"There can be no more powerful telling of the history of slavery in the United States than to read it and hear it from the slaves' own mouths. Their recollections are, for the most part, graphic and chilling, but the diversity of these life experiences are also rich with good stories, too....slaves bonding together, looking out for one another and at times outwitting their masters and overseers. While the general knowledge of salvery has been known to many Americans for years, it is the actual detailed accounts of day-to-day life that make this book come alive. I hadn't known, for instance, that slaves were required to have passes in order to travel off the plantations or that Christmas and New Year's were largely times of rejoicing for both slave families and their master's families. Yet for the rest of the year the hardships and conditions that most slaves witnessed was incredible....beatings often for no reason, no shoes or lack of other clothing during the winter cold and often not nearly enough food. The clarity with which these former slaves recall their life 80 years or more before is an indication of how etched in their young minds life had been. The accompanying audio cassettes were the main reason l bought the book and they simply added a human dimension to the whole story. l had only two small disappointments with the audio segment....l would rather have had none of the actors read the transcripts...(the actual slave voices are far more powerful) and l wish that photos of the slave speakers could have been provided.... while there were many photos of the former slaves in the book they were not the photos of the slaves who made the audio tapes. In a time where revisionist history seems to be the rage it is, in a strange way, rather comforting to hear these stories told by the people who lived them. How these men and women suffered under bondage and lived for so many years afterward to finally tell about it is a tribute to their spirit and courage."},{"Title":"Remembering Slavery: African Americans Talk About Their Personal Experiences of Slavery and Freedom","review":"the collection puts a face and voice to slavery. it answered any questions, while creating others. informative, letting the listeners know of the pride, courage and brillance of slaves. but in knowing more, the tapes clearly reveal that the whole, real truth died with the people of that era. we will never know the complete truth about that institution. it was a brutal mistake that still haunts all of civilization. the collection is an unbelievable experience."},{"Title":"Remembering Slavery: African Americans Talk About Their Personal Experiences of Slavery and Freedom","review":"It's tough to tackle slavery and a work of such substance in a forum such as this, but here goes anyway...Ira Berlin does a magnificent job, especially with his introduction, which sets the tone of the work and explains the various shortcomings related to the primary sources for his material.This is not a compilation of slave narratives. This is a compilation of excerpts from interviews with elderly former slaves. It is a powerful look into the institution of slavery; while hardly exhaustive. it provides an excellent snapshot of slavery by the people who lived through and, indeed, suffered under it. You read about slaves: how they were born; where they lived; their relationship with the land, their masters, their drivers, and their fellow slaves; their religious expression; and several other aspects of their lives.I found that this work helped puncture the mythology of slavery on both sides -- the mythology of the apologists as well as the liberals.For me, ultimately, it reinforced a belief that I have developed a long time ago. There were &quot;degrees&quot; of slavery in practice across the US; there were good owners and bad ones; but one thing is for sure, all slave owners at some level knew of the humanity of their slaves. While for some this lead to leniency, for others this lead to denial-inspired harshness with their slaves.

I was drawn to it, as you might expect, by my enjoyment of Waters' camp classics. But to be honest, I enjoy Waters the essayist at least as much, if not more, than Waters the filmmaker. Waters' films, and particularly Pecker, Serial Mom, and Hairspray, set the scene for the miscellany of obsessions which animate this book. Crackpot offers a comforting way to understand Waters' recent turn to a more conventional cinematic venue: these films are *also* celebrations of his passionate likes (and dislikes).Waters writes a witty and acerbic prose, which conveys genuine passion for his obsessions, obsessions which include trials, the National Enquirer, Woody Allen's Interiors, dangerous candy, menthol cigarettes, and Christmas. His preferred methods seem to be the catalogue and the reminiscence: Waters' list of 101 things he hates, and 101 things he loves, are obsessive ruminations on the everyday, and Waters' methodical survey of his everyday touches gives new meaning to the sublime *and* the ridiculous. Most memorable to me, perhaps, is his LA Tour, a pre-OJ intinerary of murder, mayhem, and showbiz, and his loving tribute to the Enquirer. But his celebration of William Castle, or shame-faced coming out as a fan of avant garde, his ritualistic account of Christmas and his loving descriptions of his interests, home, and personal history all make for a case study of obsession that feels both candid and arch, in Waters' inimitable, and paradoxical way. If you read it once, you're going to read it again."},{"Title":"Crackpot: The Obsessions of John Waters","review":"I have to add.... I read this book ten years ago and I still return to it when I want to laugh and look at inspiring essays. All the essays are inspiring and hilarious but a couple of them (or one) about showmanship represented at movie houses is required reading--if not the whole collection--for anyone wondering why many don't stop to talk about a book they read, instead of how amazingly fast they read the whole book; or for those who complain about the media and music and don't create their own; or those who can't pursue their dreams because they're saving up for retirement and childrens' college funds. Yes, I've stretched it completely. But my point in highlighting one of the essays is that at least there's someone saying it's OK to give a project or idea everything you've got, and there's nothing or anyone prohibiting illusion or hilarity."},{"Title":"Crackpot: The Obsessions of John Waters","review":"If you have a spare hour here and there and want to read some wickedly funny stuff, this book's for you. It contains a collection of essays (many of which have been published elsewhere) that cover a variety of topics, most of which have a similar theme: people are idiots and John Waters hates them. However, Waters also lovingly covers things that are dear to him (menthol cigarettes, the art of serial killers, Pia Zadora, etc). You will laugh out loud or there is something seriously wrong with you.

Whether raving over meeting with Pia Zadora, listing the events of a truly hellish day, or giving a guided tour of Los Angeles as only he can, he guides the reader along in a cheerful skip, full of bounce and frolick.Even for one who's unfamiliar with his films, this book is a light, quick read sure to entertain and provide laughs, crating a vivid and lovable image of the man known to so many as &quot;The Prince Of Puke&quot;"},{"Title":"Crackpot: The Obsessions of John Waters","review":"I wish John Waters would publish more collections of short narratives because I think he excells at them, even more than a filmmaker (which is saying a lot).

If you have any interest in unusual human behavior, this short, easy read is halarious."},{"Title":"Crackpot: The Obsessions of John Waters","review":"First, let me say that this book should have more universal appeal than do his movies. We all know that his movies are just too gross for some people to stomach, but there's nothing here that any adult reader should find offensive. If you enjoy homorous writing, a la Woody Allen, Steve Martin, Joe Queenan, David Sedaris, etc., you should find this little volume right up your alley.Waters displays an acerbic, eccentric, but highly insightful comic sensibility. There are fifteen short pieces here, which first appeared in various magazines during the mid '80s, primarily NATIONAL LAMPOON (When it was still funny) and AMERICAN FILM.The book opens with a bang, in one of the funniest pieces, &quot;John Waters tour of L.A.&quot; Needless to say, this is not the L.A Chamber of Commerce &quot;official guide.&quot; He takes us to some of the seamier sights, including the spot on Hollywood Boulevard where you can catch &quot;the legless, one-armed white guy who break-dances on the street for horrified families as they stroll up the Walk of Fame.&quot; He also offers some timely,timeless advice for when you're driving around L.A: &quot;Never look at pedestrians; they're the sad faces of L.A., the ones who had their licenses revoked for driving while impaired.&quot;There really aren't too many weak entries in the collection. He does go a bit over the top in his rhapsodizing of Pia Zadora, perhaps, in an article devoted to that queen of glitz, but one comes to expect &quot;over the top&quot; from Waters. Who would want it any other way? He's also very much the exaggerator when it comes to his likes, &quot;Puff Piece (100 Things I Love)and his dislikes: &quot;Hatchet Piece (100 Things I Hate).&quot; Amongst the things he most admires are Supermarket Tabloids: &quot;Then I gazed at the great LAS VEGAS SUN wire-photo of a giant ostrich, escaped from a zoo chasing a totally bewildered middle-aged woman down the street. Every time I see her horrified expression, the creative juices start to flow.&quot; Not content with this passing mention, he writes an entire article entitled WHY I LOVE THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER as a paean to that fine bastion of journalistic integrity.Some of Waters' images do convey a bit more of the &quot;so banal it's hysterical&quot; quality of his movies, as when he conjures up &quot;a fancy Santa,&quot; in a piece called WHY I LOVE CHRISTMAS.&quot;Why hasn't Bloomingdales or Tiffany's tried a fancy Santa? Deathly pale, this never-too-thin-or-too-rich Kris Kringle, dressed in head-to-toe unstructured, oversize Armani, could pose on a throne, bored and elegant, and every so often deign to let a rich little brat sit NEAR his lap before dismissing his wishes with a condescending 'Oh darling, you dont REALLY want that, do you?&quot; I mean, really, wouldn't you just love to have John Waters' private phone number and be able to shoot the breeze with him about popular culture? No!! you say? Well then this book's not for you. However, if you enjoy mordant, biting wit, and a breezy, conversational style of writing, this book is definitely for you. It was sent me by a friend.

Most cater to the popular image of Yoga as yoga postures for physical well-being. Few challenge the reader to a deeper vision of Yoga or of their own inner nature. The Synthesis of Yoga stands apart from the available literature on Yoga, expressing the soul of Yoga to the deepest intelligence within us.In fact, there are few works of such magnitude and comprehensiveness about Yoga ever written, and probably nothing comparable in the English language. Yet more importantly, this profound compendium on Yoga was not written from an academic or scholarly perspective, or from the view of those who work primarily with the physical yoga. It is a study of Yoga written by one of the greatest yogis of modern India, Sri Aurobindo, who has a reputation of spiritual greatness in India that exceeds Mahatma Gandhi, Tagore and other more well known figures in the West. There is probably no work of such scope and grandeur on Yoga available, and none by an author who was speaking from his own direct experience and realization.The Synthesis of Yoga deals with Yoga as a means of Self-realization, God-realization and the transformation of humanity. It addresses all the classical yogic paths of knowledge, devotion, works and meditation, including Raja Yoga in all of its aspects. In this book, the term \\"Integral Yoga,\\" first arises, combining all aspects of Yoga into a comprehensive system for the full development of all of our potentials on all levels of our being. The book shows the relevance of Yoga to all that we are, do, or are meant to become.As a student, teacher and writer on Yoga and related teachings for more than thirty years, I cannot emphasize enough the importance at looking at Yoga the deeper and integral manner that is so eloquently expressed in the Synthesis of Yoga. It is recommended reading to all those who want to approach deeper or inner aspects of Yoga. The book will transform your idea of Yoga and open many new dimensions of practice and realization for you that you had not previously considered possible. I don't think anyone can seriously read the book and not come away without a sense of the vastness of real Yoga practice. The book will provide you with a deep understanding of the essence of Yoga, far beyond the common stereotypes of yoga as a physical or psychological practice for personal enhancement. The Synthesis of Yoga contains the keys for restoring Yoga as a deep spiritual practice with both an ancient and a futuristic vision.In these days in which Yoga has largely been reduced to an exercise or fitness system, it is important to remember the spiritual orientation and purpose that classical Yoga was all about. The Synthesis of Yoga does this and much more, not from the ancient past or a poorly translated foreign language, but from a master teacher of the modern world, an eloquent poet and profound philosopher."},{"Title":"The synthesis of yoga","review":"In this monumental work, Sri Aurobindo explains in depth how the different aspects of the ancient practice of yoga combine to enhance and promote our spiritual evolution. Speaking from a knowledge that is clearly the product of experience, Aurobindo explores and explains every facet of our human journey as we move toward conscious unification with our Source. One can get the most from this definitive work by moving through it slowly, giving oneself the time needed to understand and absorb its contents, for its scope is both broad and deep, thus making it a perennial reference for the serious seeker."},{"Title":"The synthesis of yoga","review":"Sri Aurobindo provides an overview of the field of yoga. This is not a series of physical exercises, but the practices that allow an individual to understand the complex inner psychology and begin to move it toward union with the Divine. After a brief overview, Sri Aurobindo goes into great depth on the paths of knowledge, love and works, and concludes with his own unique contribution to the yoga of self perfection, where he reveals the evolutionary purpose of our human existence and puts the entire struggle we face into context."},{"Title":"The synthesis of yoga","review":"While bowing to the Venerable David Frawley's excellent review, I thought I'd add my two cents from an experiential perspective.Many consider Sri Aurobindo'sLife Divine - U.S. Editionto be his magnum opus, but for me, Synthesis of Yoga has consistently intersected my sadhana (spiritual practice) in seemingly miraculous ways.Along about summer of 1995, I'd lost all desire to maintain an existence on Earth, and was spending about ten hours daily in meditation. Needless to say, my landlord was running out of patience. Deep down inside, I'd made a deal with myself that said, \\"I'm not dealing with the world until my spiritual activation is initiated.\\" This meant that I was ready for homelessness if it came to that.Things opened up in the nick of time. While I'd met a few people who'd experience a classic \\"bottom-up\\" ascent of the kundalini energy -- with all the difficulties that typically accompany that divine experience -- the onset of shakti in my system started in and around the head, spreading outwards and downwards, which was all very pleasant but unexplainable to myself or anyone else. I was ecstatic to have witnessed the rise of these phenomena... though I had absolutely no way of processing them from a place of authority, and I found myself desperate in search of guidance.My future wife happened to work in a metaphysical bookstore at that time, and she intuitively guided me to this book. She had not read it, but had flipped through it a time or two, and she thought there may be something there for me.I started on the first page and read all 900 within the space of a couple weeks, barely emerging from my bedroom the entire time. Aurobindo's teaching actually encourages a top-down movement of the divine energy, asserting that, by purifying the higher chakras in descending order, a clear pathway is created for the kundalini serpent, which is then able to ascend to the 7th chakra with relative ease. There are three chapters in the last section of Synthesis of Yoga that spell this out in great detail, terming the process \\"descent of Shakti.\\"So, at my moment of worldly bottoming-out, which coincided with a spiritual crisis for which I was receiving no guidance or encouragement, Sri Aurobindo reached across the years to not only validate my experiences, but place an entire practice system around it. He continues to do so to this day.This one is on my very short desert island booklist."},{"Title":"The synthesis of yoga","review":"A letter that Sri Aurobindo wrote in 1936 gives some idea of his purpose in writing The Synthesis of Yoga and his overall plan for the work:\\"The Synthesis of Yoga was not meant to give a method for all to follow. Each side of the Yoga was dealt with separately with all its possibilities, and an indication was given as to how they meet so that one starting from knowledge could realise Karma and Bhakti also and so with each path. It was intended when the Self-Perfection was finished, to suggest a way in which all could be combined, but this was never written.\\"The Synthesis of Yoga is a reorganization and continuation of The Life Divine, richer in detail and potential. The Method is found in The Mother and the lETTERS ON YOGAThe style is the ususl opulence. Midway through we find:\\"But even if this difficult thing were perfectly accomplished, still the intuition would not be the gnosis; it would only be its thin prolongation into mind or its sharp edge of first entrance. The difference, not easy to define except by symbols, may be expressed if we take the Vedic image in which the Sun represents the gnosis and the sky, mid-air and earth, the mentality, vitality, physicality of man and of the universe. Living on the earth, climbing into the mid-air or even winging in the sky, the mental being, the manomya purusa, would still live in the rays of the sun and not in its bodily light. And in those rays he would see things not as they are but as reflected in his organ of vision, deformed by its faults or limited in their truth by its restrictions. But the vijnanamaya purusa lives in the Sun itself, in the very body and blaze of the true light; he knows this light to be his own self-luminous being and he sees the whole truth of the lower triplicity and each thing that is in it. He sees it not by reflection in a mental organ of vision, but with the Sun of gnosis itself as his eye, -- for the Sun, says the Veda, is the eye of the gods. The mental being, even in the intuitive mind, can perceive the truth only by a brilliant reflection or limited communication and subject to the restrictions and the inferior capacity of the mental vision; but the supramental being sees it by the gnosis itself, from the very centre and outwelling fount of the truth, in its very form and by its own spontaneous and self-illumining process. For the Vijnana is a direct and divine as opposed to an indirect and human knowledge. ~ Sri Aurobindo, SY. 481\\"One will note his use of the elements of poetry in the passage; and no study of Aurobindo can be satisfying or complete without a copy of Savitri at hand."},{"Title":"The synthesis of yoga","review":"This is the sort of book that is an automatic meditation as it is read. Read slowly it might take a year or more to get through. But you get enough each day to satisfy. When done with it, start over.

A medicine is designed to zero in on an enzyme system responsible for creating a condition of disease. Diet and nutrition supplements encourage a natural balance that will not only hit the target but spray the surrounds with beneficial boosts of activity. Dr. Saul, besides being a nutrition expert, is foremost an educator. He has mastered the art of getting information firmly implanted into his students' brains.

When a person abdicates that responsibility, they often place themselves in the hands of the \\"disease care\\" industry, a monolithic and profit-driven enterprise where getting well isn't the bottom line.Through lively anecdote, personal history and accounts of patient education and treatment, Dr. Andrew Saul (not an M.D., by way of disclosure) takes the reader down a path most M.D.'s never dare to tread. Without a hint of pretension or medical braggadocio, the reader shares Dr. Saul's encounters with individuals as they seek relief from common maladies feeding the trillion dollar medical monsters of the Western world; arthritis, cancer, schizophrenia, depression, obesity, allergies, heart disease and many more.We're also introduced to a \\"Who's Who\\" of unjustly ignored medical pioneers like Abram Hoffer, Robert F. Cathcart, Wilfrid and Evan Shute, Linus Pauling and Frederick Klenner. These unconventional M.D.'s and researchers ignored the scorn and censure of their peers in order to treat patients with nutrition and lifestyle change rather than dogmatic, pharmophilic (drug loving) therapies that most often do not cure, but merely attenuate a sufferer's condition.Doctor Yourself is a page turner, written in a friendly, conversational style that takes you inside the interactions between healer and client, unafraid to detail the skepticism and even fear shown by patients when alternative medical advice runs counter to the normal drug, cut and radiate school of thought. In addition, Dr. Saul lists specific protocols for the use of nutrients as therapy; the reader is never left on their own to experiment or wonder at the possible safety of a potential cure.It is clear that Dr. Saul has profound respect for the science and art of medicine, but far less for physicians and their patients who willfully remain blind to the value of nutrition, for hospitals that \\"serve green jello and white bread to cancer patients\\", to drug companies who relentlessly market to a gullible, insured public.Based on what I've learned from this book, from Dr. Saul's website and from the many reference materials provided by both sources, I've been fortunate to cure sciatica that hobbled me for three months, and rid myself of hay fever to boot. My wife, an allergy sufferer of 30 years, hasn't touched prescription meds in two seasons. My two boys are healthier because of the changes the family made in diet, supplementation and exercise. Does that make readers of this book \\"health nuts\\"? Dr. Saul would ask, \\"Who wants to be a disease nut\\"?Single or married, young, middle-aged or older...any person who lives in a human body will find inspiration and education in the pages of Doctor Yourself.

In these times of rising medical costs, along with the fact that many lack health insurance, Dr. Saul's book gives hope and confidence, almost like a personal consultation with the author. It sets out dozens of well-documented nutritional protocols for treating ailments using supplements rather than prescription drugs, thereby avoiding drug expense and side effects.

While many of the books that I've read were quite good, I've found that even the best of these seem to be merely facts tied together with words. Dr. Saul's work, Doctor Yourself stands out in a market that has long been saturated with books of varying degrees of quality. Doctor Yourself is not only the best of the best in the marketplace, it is book with a voice. Reading Dr. Saul's book, I can clearly hear the unique voice of the author in it's pages. Dr. Saul's vast knowledge of his subject is presented with clarity, logic and humor. If I was to have one health care book in my library, it would clearly be Doctor Yourself."},{"Title":"Doctor Yourself: Natural Healing That Works","review":"Expertly written by biologist and naturopathic teacher Andrew Saul (who has served as a consulting specialist in natural healing for more than twenty-five years), Doctor Yourself: Natural Healing That Works is a straightforward and &quot;non-specialist reader friendly&quot; guide to organizing one's diet to promote health and nutrition. Promoting nutritional therapy as a preventative and treatment for many diverse ailments, and offering solid advice for adjusting one's diet plan to better live with everything from Diabetes, to PMS, to Parkinson's Disease, Doctor Yourself is a very helpful guidebook which is filled from cover to cover with gems of information that aren't usually discussed in most other nutrition books. It should also be mentioned that Andrew Saul has also developed an impressive website at DoctorYourself.com with additional information on the scientific studies behind the protocols referenced in his book and offers any interested party more than additional 4,000 references."},{"Title":"Doctor Yourself: Natural Healing That Works","review":"I bought my mom & myself a copy of this book and both of us keep it handy for ready reference.

Some of these sections were okay, but many did nothing more than relate a single case study which was almost always completely resolved following the use of high dose vitamin C or similar.What was lacking was information on how typical such results were and what could be done if the remedies listed did not work. At the very least, it would have been better to include at least a few case studies rather than just one.This book, as with 'Fire your doctor' just does not have enough information about chronic diseases, and long-term illness. There is little talk of how much high dose C's effectiveness is limited by years of damage caused by the disease, and how long to keep C at bowel tolerance if your disease is long term, and some case studies of what can happen in long-term disease with orthomolecular medicine. This is a problem I have found with most books on this topic, so little is written about long-term illness. I suppose it's just not as 'sexy' as writing about getting amazing and very quick results treating a serious infection in its first few weeks etc.Many of us have the non-sexy diseases though!I'd highly recommend 'Fire your doctor' before this book, but it is still far better than almost all books on this topic that are out there. Other good books include 'Orthomolecular medicine for everyone' and 'Dr Atkins' Vita-nutrient solution' as well as all the books by Dr Sherry Rogers.To be clear, I very strongly support the basic message of in this book and am convinced by the benefits of orthomolecular medicine, I just think that this book does nowhere near as good a job as others in presenting this information to the reader, it's a bit simplistic and vague. There was nothing in this book I hadn't already read in 'Fire your doctor' as well.Update: There is a 2nd edition of this book just out which is getting very good reviews. I'm very tempted to get my hands on a copy. It has over 100 pages of new information!Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E.

He is right in that natural compounds are great at keeping us healthy. My interest is primarily cancer therapy.

The state medical boards can fine or decertify doctors who use unapproved therapies. Fortunately, patients are not restricted by their state medical boards.

It's also very easy to understand where the author is coming from regarding his strategies for healthcare.This author does a great job of addressing many diseases that doctors today don't have the answer to. Modern medicine wants to keep you sick whereas this author writes to get you well. However, he still advocates you keep an MD. Then he tells you to take personal responsibility of your healthcare so you won't need your doctor.The best thing this book has going for it is that it's real world and you can put the techniques in practice immediately.

Andrew Saul is a very intelligent writer. I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Doctor Yourself: Natural Healing That Works","review":"A very accessible, well-organized, and easy to understand book on natural healing. I took an immediate liking to it. Even if you have none of the ailments addressed in this book, you will still learn something of interest. Dr. Saul favors vitamin megadosing - especially with Vitamin C. My own experience with Vitamin C has made me a believer long before this book. I'm glad to see it mentioned here.A couple of things I found particularly helpful: One was the information on Vitamin C IVs. If this is something that interests you, you might want to take Dr. Saul's advice and make arrangements way ahead of time. You will probably meet with obstruction at every step. Secondly, Dr. Saul brings home the necessity of staying with our loved ones while they are in the hospital to make sure their needs are met.The Table of Contents lists 52 health issues, from acid reflux to vaccinations. Each issue is only a few pages long, but packed with useful advice on which nutrients (vitamins, diet, etc) might help with healing. Each chapter also is followed by a reading list for further study. As with any health book, one-size-does-not-fit-all. But overall, this is a good natured, positive, and often humorous look at natural healing - healing that YOU can do on your own. A keeper."},{"Title":"Doctor Yourself: Natural Healing That Works","review":"Andrew W. Saul is an awesome author whose books are extremely informative and easy to read.

I think that more of it should be nutrition based, because our nutrition has much more to do with our health than medical science gives it credit for, but more of it is orthomolecular. I am not an advocate of taking vitamins to fix health, but I feel you should get your vitamins from whole food as much as possible, although there are some vitamins that should be taken. Dr. Saul has a wealth of information in here and I keep it as a valuable reference book. One can't go wrong with his natural healing recommendations."},{"Title":"Doctor Yourself: Natural Healing That Works","review":"I highly recommend obtaining and reading the second edition of the book DOCTOR YOURSELF.Even if you have a copy of the first edition, you will find the revised, up dated second edition with its additional 160 pages of new material well worth owning.I highly recommend obtaining and reading the second edition of the book DOCTOR YOURSELF.Doctor Yourself provides specific dosage information, along with case stories of people who used therapeutic nutrition to change their lives. The information on vitamin C is greatly expanded and updated, providing one of the most practical presentations on this subject in print. Discussion of vitamin safety is especially thorough, a topic that many readers will want to share with their doctors. Few books discuss alternatives to vaccination like Doctor Yourself. In fact, few books discuss any aspect of health (let alone most of them) as does Doctor Yourself. The twin strengths of this books are the factual detail and the easy, humorous writing style. It's a win-win for the reader.This book written by Dr. Saul provides excellent suggestions for addressing various health problems and enhances and expands one's knowledge and outlook about personal health care. It is also easy and enjoyable to read. It's like a breath of fresh air brought into the stifling and complex room of conventional Western disease care.I believe great benefit can be derived by lay persons and health professionals alike by using the suggestions described in this book.John I.

Loved the movie so much I purchased it through Amazon and there I found Dr. Andrew Saul's book. I purchased the movie and the book. Love, love, love it and my 90 year old mother could not stop reading it. My daughter borrowed it because of interest in the \\"kids\\" chapter (she has since purchased a juicer and my grandchildren are juicing!)so I told her to keep it and I will buy another.

I can't tell you whether you should go to a doctor or not, because I don't know you. Certainly if you break a bone, whole wheat flour won't help (actually, you can make glue from white flour in an emergency). Make your decision cautiously, because you may be stepping into a vortex. First, there's the yellow pill; then the green one to counter the side-effects of the yellow; then the blue... You get the idea.Doctoring yourself begins at the table, and Andrew Saul tells you how to eat to stay healthy. If you do develop a health problem, you may be able to treat yourself, and Dr. Saul helps you with that also. This book is written in a very entertaining style, which has helped Dr. Saul to become one of the most recognized figures in nutritional medicine. His website, [...], is, in my opinion, the best health site on the web, and a major source for information about the orthomolecular approach to healing.

It is going to get much worse, unless the majority of folks take some responsibility for their own health.

This book shows it's not always necessary to go along with pharmaceutical treatments as the only option. I heartily subscribe to this school of thought as living proof of its efficacy."},{"Title":"Doctor Yourself: Natural Healing That Works","review":"It is amazing to me that the orthodox medical establishment seems so unaware of the information presented in this book. To its credit the medical profession in the developed world -- with the aid of antibiotics -- has conquered most infectious diseases which used to be the most common cause of human illness and death. But, for some reason -- perhaps the size and power of the pharmaceutical industry -- the orthodox medical establishment seems unwilling to consider that most of our current ailments including heart attacks, strokes, asthma, type 2 diabetes, as well as the common cold and the flu are caused by deficiencies of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. While we humans need a broad range of nutrients, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, and magnesium are so important that deficiency of one or more of these essential nutrients may well account for half or more of current chronic ailments. Instead the treatment offered by conventional physicians is a host of pharmaceutical drugs, even though the side effects of pharmaceutical drugs currently are the 4th leading cause of death in the U.S. I applaud Dr. Saul for his breadth of knowledge and for the courage to write this important book."},{"Title":"Doctor Yourself: Natural Healing That Works","review":"I have read and tried both of the info of several doses of vitamin c a day---based on Dr Linus research (5 doses of 3-4 mg in powder with water).

I must admit that this novel is not as good as The Mysteries of Udolpho. But I think when reading this novel it's important to keep in mind why Ann Radcliffe wrote it in the first place.It's impossible to appreciate Ann Radcliffe's intentions in writing this book and the complexities of The Italian without having first read Matthew &quot;Monk&quot; Lewis' The Monk. Lewis was so inspired by The Mysteries of Udolpho that he wrote The Monk, which has characters engaging in activities that are horrifying. (Lewis became so identified with his book that he was nicknamed Monk Lewis.) Mrs. Radcliffe was very upset that Lewis was inspired by her book to write his. In response to The Monk, Mrs. Radcliffe wrote The Italian. Mrs. Radcliffe &quot;corrected&quot; in The Italian what she felt was wrong and horrifying about The Monk.For anyone who finds The Italian lacking at all, I highly recommend he or she read The Monk to gain a better understanding of what Ann Radcliffe was trying to accomplish. And for anyone who has not read The Italian yet, read The Monk first- then I'm sure you will find The Italian a much more enjoyable read."},{"Title":"A Sicilian romance","review":"This is the first book I have read by Radcliffe, and only the second gothic novel I have read. It is, by all standards of style and method, a gothic novel--so I doubt there is any need to elaborate on the moods, the romanticized environmental settings, or the literary devices found in the novel. As far as the writing itself goes, it becomes clear that the author is a very young and relatively inexperienced writer. The two major flaws of the novel that bothered me the most are: 1.) There is a great deal of redundancy in how the events unfold. For example, several times various characters would find themselves lost in the woods, suddenly see a faint light in the distance, follow the light, then find themselves in a perilous situation, only to escape by a similar means. This type of formulated plot was prevalent throughout the entire novel. 2.) Radcliffe seldom utilized transitional phrases. Often, paragraphs would shift from one location or person to another location or person with no transitional phrases such as \\"meanwhile\\", or \\"back at the castle\\", etc. The next sentence would just be about something different.In the simplest description, the plot was about a tyrannical, ambitious father who tries to marry off his daughter to regain his social standing and wealth. His daughter, whose heart belongs to another, escapes the castle, and proceeds to experience one perilous adventure after the other. But this is not really what the novel is about. It appears to me that it is more about the difference between men and women. In Radcliffe's world, the majority of men are to some degree corrupt, power-hungry, ruthless, debauched, selfish, insensitive, and tyrannical--and the effect these men have on the persons and environment around them is usually tragic. Even the presence of the few virtuous men in her novel seems to create in the women around them feelings of turmoil and anxiety. Even when they evoke the feelings of love, it is always bitter-sweet and agonizing. When men are present all is awry; violent thunderstorms cloud the sky, and even the natural environments are treacherous, gloomy or desolate. But not so with women! All women but one in this novel are virtuous, pious, demure, pure, innocent, submissive, and noble, and the natural environments that surround them are serene, beautiful, inviting, and sublime-at least until a man arrives. Throughout the novel women are constantly victimized by men, and Radcliffe seems to suggest that only when left to themselves can women be find peace and happiness in this world. Of course, considering the few rights and privileges enjoyed by women during her time (1764-1823), one can hardly blame her.Overall, I found the book a bit too tedious to really be enjoyable. Reviews site her novel The Mysteries of Udolfo as be her best, though I have not read this one. I would only recommend this book if you are serious about reading all the gothic novels you can get your hands on."},{"Title":"A Sicilian romance","review":"My favourite novel of Ann Radcliffe's is The Mysteries of Udolpho, but I think A Sicilian Romance is a promise of what Mrs. Radcliffe will be able to accomplish in her later books. For Ann Radcliffe and Gothic romance fans, this novel is a must because it plays on all of the classic themes of the genre. This is also great escapist reading to a world very much unlike our own. Radcliffe's heroines and heroes do suffer greatly and go through some extraordinary (perhaps sometimes unbelievable) events, but I find it thoroughly enjoyable to read about their adventures as I am a true romantic at heart. It's good to read about a world where when virtuous people are put through struggles at the hands of villians, the heroines and heroes are able to triumph."},{"Title":"A Sicilian romance","review":"I got this because it sounded good, and how can you pass up a Kindle freebie.

THE LOOKING HEART is one such collection that not only leaves you with a smile, but with motivation, strength and undeniable faith. Marc Lacy has assimilated a selection of poems that will leave each reader with a lesson on how much the heart can express itself in so many manifestations if we just take the time to listen to it.The collection is broken down into seven chapters: Chapter one - Heart Thoughts; Chapter two - Issues Encountered by the Heart; Chapter three - Love and Feelings as Seen by the Heart; Chapter four - Motivation Becomes the Heart; Chapter five - Odes from the Heart; Chapter six - To Heart, with Flow; and Chapter seven - Weather the Heart Sees. Each chapter embodies emotions and thoughts we all feel, whether we are faced with unforeseen circumstances in our lives or the feelings our hearts sense when we love unconditionally, as well as our acceptance of our spirituality. I enjoyed each chapter, but I really connected to the author's odes, which intrinsically captured the essence of people such as Malcolm X, Bob Marley, Martin Luther King and even Ghandi. However, readers should also be prepared for the beautiful expressions of faith interwoven throughout this compilation.THE LOOKING HEART uses the heart as a metaphor for life's emotions from strength, courage, motivation and spirituality. It is a beautiful collection of poetry that will quench thirsty minds. The author includes expressions that will be alluring to the older reader, as well as capture the interest of the younger reader with selections that give thanks, for example to the culture of hip-hop. Marc Lacy has incorporated a wonderful selection of lyrical poetry that uses rhythm, rhyme, cadence and metaphors as emotional expressions of the heart.

Ransel, the core of Tian-Shanskaia's writing and her straightforward approach to the [then] young science of anthropology shines through to make this account quite a fascinating read for nearly anyone. I don't mean treat Ransel harshly but, as a university professor carrying out a funded project, he was clearly forced to swallow a certain amount of input from associates and other scholarly drones.I'm certain that this 20-page Introduction would have come off as infinitely more palatable and devoid of academic baggage had Ransel just sat down and written it from his clear knowledge of the author and from his heart -- in other words, there were too many cooks in the kitchen. But this is only a mild critique of the work and the fact that Ransel included a nice black-and-white photo of the author as well as a map of the study area at the very outset balances out the other shortcomings. I also found Ransel's footnotes, throughout the book, to be quite enlightening.Chiefly, the reader gets a view of the post-emancipation Russian serf world from Tian-Shanskaia's aggregate fictional \\"Ivan\\". She was pretty much forced to eavesdrop on village gossip as she painted pictures in these villages to garner mostly anecdotal information about life among the peasants. In any case, we discover what Ivan liked and disliked, how his life was pre-ordained from even before his birth until his death including his infancy, adolescence, married life, and his life as a parent. The account includes discussion of social interaction, economics, and the many ominous labors which every peasant had to bear in order to survive. Death by accident, disease, or homicide was clearly a daily possibility for Russia's muzhiks.This is a nicely-bound college text-type paperback, 176 pages in length. It reads as smoothly as fiction and I highly recommend it.I should also add that if you read and enjoy this book, you'll probably also like Lyeskov's fictionalEnchanted Wanderer."},{"Title":"Village Life in Late Tsarist Russia (Indiana-Michigan Series in Russian and East European Studies)","review":"I do not possess enough professional knowledge to critique the accuracy of the work or quality of compilation. However, as a professional Russian translator who has traveled in Russia and continues to study its culture, I found this a fascinating look by an early ethnographer into daily life in Russian villages. The translation is clear and very readable, well-supplemented with notes and many photographs. The authors compiled this book from a great deal of related documents left by Tian-Shanskaya, and made use of other related ethnographic work. They include explanations of the sources where appropriate, which gives the book and added value: the reader gets a sense of how this unified book of her work was patched together. They give a good overview of the contemporary context of her work and of the 'peasant question'. In addition, they explain what they perceive as the influence of her own ideals and values upon the interpretation of peasant behavior, and compare it to later theories (for example, where she reports chronic 'squandering' of surpluses, they compare it to later theories of the peasants' perception of a limited world of resources and the importance of investing in status within the social network of the village). The book contains many overheard conversations and remarks among peasants. All in all, a pearl of a book, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Village Life in Late Tsarist Russia (Indiana-Michigan Series in Russian and East European Studies)","review":"This book is basically a compiler of accounts and general ideas of what it was like in Russia during this time for the peasant class. It tends to jump around and leave out a lot, but with help from the editor, it becomes more clear. He apparently took what she wrote for the actual book and spliced in some of her old field notes, which helps you to understand what she's trying to convey a lot more easily. The problem with the book is the author is clearly very biased, which is admitted in the book, but despite that it paints a picture of a peculiar people with a culture very different from modern day America. It was an interesting read, I would suggest it if you're interested in how other cultures work."},{"Title":"The Chessmaster and His Moves","review":"Quite simply one of the best and most unique novels I've ever read. His use of langue is very flexible; the only similar experience I can recall is when I first read Proust. Admittedly the novel will not appeal to everyone; it is useful to have some familiarity with Indian religion and mysticism to get many of the references and the general feeling of the novel.Just to get a sence of it, the opening lines :\\"You remember, J., you said to me: Tell me you need me, and I'll come.I need you now, you know what I mean. I do not truly nee you. Yet I need you. Would you therefore come? Would you return as parrot, betel vine or bodhisattva.

In lieu of her dissertation, she's been granted permission to co-author a book with respected professor, Jackie Pappas. They're writing about a lost coven of witches founded by Rebeka Hibbens in 1692, and have discovered the existence of a chronicle written by Rebeka, which allegedly reveals what happened to the witches who disappeared just before their execution. The chronicle's now owned by Deborah Sewall, owner of a new-age store and self-proclaimed reincarnation of Rebeka.Deborah agrees to let Jackie read the chronicle, but before Jackie can tell Lauren why the contents have upset her so much, she dies and the chronicle goes missing. Lauren, meanwhile, has been having strange nightmares and unexplainable visions about the 17th century which are growing stronger all the time. As she searches for answers, she has good reason to fear for her and her seven-year-old son's life.Barbara Shapiro's SEE NO EVIL is an eerie, suspenseful mystery centering around black magic, cults, and reincarnation. This isn't a fast paced book, nor should it be. Shapiro does a great job in slowly building tension to the point where I couldn't stop turning pages. This book is about learning to survive self-doubt, huge obstacles, and finding one's true path in life. The author creates a well-rounded protagonist in Lauren, who's determined, smart, insecure, afraid, and devoted to her child. The story's climax was predictable, yet knowing that Lauren couldn't avoid the final confrontation only added to the suspense. There were a couple of places where events seemed a little too coincidental, but SEE NO EVIL is still a spine-tingling read."},{"Title":"See No Evil","review":"If you really want spooky witch stories, try \\"Wither\\", a terrific novel about witchcraft; or watch two great old movies, \\"Burn Witch Burn\\" with Janet Blair or \\"Horror Hotel\\"with Christopher Lee. Those were great witch stories.Barbara Shapiro's \\"See No Evil\\" is one of those plodding books where you can predict almost every move the heroine, Lauren Freeman, will make. She's separated from her philandering husband, Todd, and takes care of precocious and rather bad little boy, Drew. Her best friend, Jackie, gets her involved in writing a book stating how important witchcraft was in shaping Colonial life in the 17th century. The book opens with seven witches in the 17th century vowing to return every 101 years and do the same type of shenanigans they are doing now, and eventually, in 1995, they will become immortal. So if you like silly reincarnation stories, this one's for you. There's little suspense; Lauren behaves like a nincompoop. Her affair with the handsome and successful Gabe leads exactly where you know it will. Not a good entry in the witch series.NOT RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"McKinlay's journal of exploration in the interior of Australia: (Burke relief expedition)","review":"Poor show Amazon.....

Dialogue, along with the main character's inner thoughts, constitutes virtually the entire novel. Stripped-to-the-bone and lacking the descriptive paragraphs one would expect in an historical novel set in late eighteenth century Gottingen, the narrative is told in a simple style and in short sentences reminiscent of fables and children's stories. The humor and the observations about life, however, are decidedly adult, and the insights into the strange life of Georg Lichtenberg, a real mathematician-astronomer-physicist, give a broad picture of scientific investigations and social life in Germany during the period.A hunchback, who can not leave his house without being pestered by people who want to touch his hump &quot;for good luck,&quot; Lichtenberg is something of a dandy, affecting silver buttons and multicolored wigs. Always fascinated by new observations, especially his own, he carries a &quot;waste book,&quot; in which he records his passing thoughts and dozens of aphorisms: &quot;If a man has webbed fingers, he is unlikely to make a great flautist.&quot; On one of his walks, he buys flowers from a beautiful thirteen-year-old child, Maria Dorothea Stechard, who eventually moves in with him, becoming his student, then his housekeeper, and finally his mistress. Keeping &quot;the little Stechardess&quot; hidden from his friends for many years, he shares his scientific experiments on electricity, hot air ballooning, and phrenology with her, feeling &quot;doubly near&quot; her when he can share both his love and his science.Reminiscent in some ways of Penelope Fitzgerald's The Blue Flower, this slim novel is far less descriptive, a story reduced to its absolute essentials with not an extra word. Understated in the extreme, it is a peculiar story of seduction, often witty and often discomforting, giving a unique view of late eighteenth century academic, intellectual, and social life. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Lichtenberg and the Little Flower Girl","review":"Michael Hofmann's poem \\"Epithanaton,\\" from Approximately Nowhere (Faber, 1999), which contains a dozen poems about the death of Gert Hofmann, begins:Last words? Probably not, or none that I knew of,by the sea with your grandsons in another countrywhen it happened. A completed manuscript on your desk . . .That completed manuscript on the desk--perhaps the closest thing to Gert Hofmann's last words--was Kleine Stechardin, translated by Michael Hofmann as Lichtenberg and the Little Flower Girl. In his \\"Afterword,\\" Michael Hofmann reminds us that his father was a \\"late starter\\" at fiction, having for many years traveled, professing German literature and writing plays for the stage and for radio. After publishing his first novel in 1979, he wrote nearly a novel a year until his death in 1993. This one, like the previous two--The Film Explainer and Luck--is full of quick, witty dialogue and strange silent-filmic, vaudevillian comic angles on the most ordinary daily things.On its surface, Lichtenberg and the Little Flower Girl is a fictionalized story of a few years in the life of Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799), a hunchbacked professor of physics (and math and astronomy and electricity and nearly anything else the Enlightened 18th century called \\"scientific\\") in G&ouml;ttingen, Germany, and the story of his \\"highly irregular\\" affair with teenaged flower girl Maria Stechard (1764-1782)--die kleine Strechardin, the little Stechardess. The plot follows Lichtenberg's path from his lonely, desperate, sniping bachelor days--reviling his students, his colleagues, and the world of learning--to his brief happiness as a Humbert Humbertish pedophile who eventually charms his way into the thirteen year old girl's intimacies. She moves from being his house girl, to lover, to student and companion. He even teaches her to read, though she often stumbles over \\"a word she didn't know, like \`moralize' or \`abomination'.\\" But none of this scandalous behavior really seems the point of this novel. Instead, this is a book that explores the full scope of eros: the love of learning and the joy of discovering not only immortal scientific truths but also words, stories, the mysteries of another human being, and how love (and lust) transforms one's reality.Drawing on Lichtenberg's writings (his letters and especially the aphorisms of his Waste Books, so admired by Nietzsche, among others) and filling in the gaps with his own concoctions, Gert Hofmann's Lichtenberg is an outrageous, tiny, impatient, paranoid, vain, horny, hypochondriac who prides himself on his silver buttons, dandyish outfits, and yellow wigs as he parades around gossipy G&ouml;ttingen, hoping for a windblown peek up a woman's skirt, and embarrassedly putting up with all sorts of people staring at--and even touching--his hump. Some days he can't be bothered to speak with his hundred students (though sometimes there are only ninety-nine) or fellow scientists, and sometimes he can't wait to dazzle them all, beginning lectures, \\"Now, gentlemen, what is Nature?\\" or \\"Here comes erudition!\\" Through this mixing of facts and fiction (the whole \\"human mess\\"), Hofmann notes in a little preface, we get not the real Lichtenberg but a true one.More than an imaginary look inside Lichtenberg's love affair, this is book about a dreamer and a scribbler, someone who \\"dribble[s] ink over paper for a living\\" and who preserves his thoughts \\"for the sake of posterity, which won't want to read them.\\" Hofmann's Lichtenberg is always on the lookout for the secrets of language, but sometimes just for \\"words, words,\\" and \\"When he found one, he would write it down on a piece of paper.\\" He might stop in the middle of the street, examine a sentence that came to him and proclaim, \\"That's a keeper!\\" or \\"Another sentence is in the bag!\\"Always unsure if he would ever devise anything that would \\"render him deathless,\\" and constantly comparing himself to others, this Lichtenberg kept a \\"list of the immortal men\\" of his time, crossing off the dead ones and starting new lists. While others where developing new instruments and discovering new planets, Lichtenberg \\"made some extraordinary discoveries that later all turned out to be wrong.\\" But he did develop an \\"aerostatic machine,\\" a balloon that would help him \\"flee the world\\" in a basket (along, of course, with a sheep, a cock, and a duck)--something others had already successfully invented, and when he managed to inflate his, \\"it couldn't fit through the door or the window. So Lichtenberg was left sitting with his balloon in his lecture room.\\"Drawing on the Waste Books, Hofmann's Lichtenberg writes, \\"The greater part of what I commit to paper is untrue, and the best of it is nonsense!\\" But this is a novel about the beautiful ways nonsense and fictions can give meaning to our lives. Even in the Enlightenment, where truth's the thing, everyone's really playing dress-up, their inventions and discoveries attempts to outdo a rival, seduce a girl. Even the Stechardess, who \\"preferred to read aloud fairy tales, or stories that \`went on and on and never stopped'\\" understood this, and she helped Lichtenberg see it too. As she contributes to his work--kisses his equipment, polishes his telescope and his clock (\\"Now they'll run better\\"), Lichtenberg kisses her and doesn't disabuse her of her notions: \\"Like other erroneous beliefs, this one brought them closer together.\\"As Michael Hofmann notes in his \\"Afterword,\\" \\"All writers' lives are more or less misshapen and more or less failed,\\" but in this translation of Gert Hofmann's last quirky, strange, funny, heartbreaking tale, we, like the Stechardess, learn to love what is misshapen, to treasure the failed thing, and to doggedly keep asking \\"And then?\\", wishing for tales that never end."},{"Title":"Snowbound Cinderella (The Fortunes of Texas)","review":"i'm really not into romance books, but a friend gave me whole bunch. although, this isn't my favorite type of book, i loved it. it didn't have any borig details, it kept right to the story line. jace and ciara had spark, and the aurthor made me feel it through her writings."},{"Title":"Snowbound Cinderella (The Fortunes of Texas)","review":"Good tale!

I've enjoyed all the book. This is the story of Ciara Wilde and Jace Lockhart, both with links to previous characters. Although their story is set away from the Fortune Ranch author Ruth Langan maintains the link with the continuing plots. These two lovers are both looking for more substance and warmth in their lives. Langan weaves a tender love story with the required misunderstanding but the eventual happy ending. The refreshing part of her writing is that she allows them to be less than prefect and therefore more believable.

Her actor fiance won't sign a prenuptual agreement and is making her feel guilty about being selfish.War reporter Jace Lockhart is also looking for alone time with a burnout problem and a few wounds to heal. He's headed to the same cabin with keys from a different relative and it's snowing. It's a classic recipe for romance and done pretty well. Ciara reveals her dirt-poor past, determination, and frustration with being typecast as a blonde bimbo; and Jace slowly talks about seeing death and destruction, helping people out, and losing a woman to a bomb.The most frustrating part of the story to me was that Ciara not only doesn't reveal her fiance, but when the couple are getting wild & crazy she doesn't seem to feel any hesitation related to the idea of having a fiance. Sure, she's about decided to call things off but she hasn't.Also her original indecision about marrying the fiance is focused too heavily on superficial things on one side : she doesn't want to marry him because he might be after her money, he's inconsiderate, etc but she thinks she should marry him because he's rich (perhaps), handsome, and in the movies. Ciara's thinking seems to be messed up and we don't see that she's figured it out in the end - maybe she's more attracted to Jace rather than realizing that he's a better man.Still there's plenty of fun in the story and enough serious issues for a romance of this type."},{"Title":"Snowbound Cinderella (The Fortunes of Texas)","review":"I really enjoyed this book because it made me wish that I could experience the same romance that Jace and Ciara did.

Young people up to about age 14 would love it. Tom discovers a secret tunnel dug by criminals to access Swift Enterprises grounds and steal his secrets. He soups up a motorboat to get double the original speed. At one point, he fights for his life as he tries to outrace a boat full of gunmen from a criminal gang. Tom is kidnapped and imprisoned, but escapes. The style is lucid, simple, and clean for young readers. The setting of 1910 adds an exotic quality to today's readers. These were the best-selling boys books of all time, with possible exception of Hardy Boys. Your son or grandson would love it. In a beautiful reprint of the original edition."},{"Title":"Tom Swift and his motor boat, (His The Tom Swift series)","review":"I was compelled to buy this book because my Dad grew up reading the original Tom Swift books and I grew up reading the Tom Swift, Jr. books in the 50's and 60's. I had never had a chance to read any of the original stories until I found this website and when I did, well, nostalgia took over.This book is fun to read both for the story, which for Tom Swift fans from the 60's is in keeping with those stories, and for the flavor of the early 1900's. This book was written in about 1910 and the grammar and &quot;dialogue&quot; are of that era. Anyone who has read a book by a modern day writer trying to write as if he was in 1910 will be able to feel the difference. Tom's adventures are what you would expect in a book aimed at pre-teens, but the &quot;Science&quot; he uses is 1910 and presents the reader with a wonderfull picture of ordinary life in that era.I highly recommend this book for anyone who wishes to get a view of 1910 regardless of whether or not the reader is a former Tom Swift Jr., Hardy Boys, or Nancy Drew fan."},{"Title":"Tom Swift and his motor boat, (His The Tom Swift series)","review":"When I was a young boy I read the adventures of Tom Swift, Jr., the son of the Tom Swift in this series of books. I was accustomed to the science fiction stories in the new series, and I thought the original series would be similarly oriented. While this series of books incorporates technology, the level of technology is so archaic as to occasionally be humorous. Some terms are no longer used, and I suspect some technologies have changed so much from this series that I found it difficult to understand precisely what Tom was doing as he adjusted an engine.This book is a sequel to the first book in the series, \\"Tom Swift and His Motor Cycle.\\" In this story, Tom purchases a motor boat with a mystery. A gang of robbers appears to be anxious to steal the boat for some reason. The same gang of robbers also seems anxious to steal some of Tom's father's secrets. Tom and various companions cruise up and down Lake Carlopa at the blistering speed of 10 to 12 miles per hour, getting into various exciting situations. Tom frequently has to adjust his motor, which forever seems to fall into disrepair.In the course of Tom's adventures, someone is injured and a tourniquet is required before that person goes to a sanitarium for treatment. Tom quickly acquires a fine shotgun and is happy of the fact. I was uncomfortable with the characterization of African-American Eradicate Sampson. Eradicate is illiterate and speaks poor English, though this series indicates that Eradicate is quite brave, intelligent and loyal. However, this book was written in another era. Consider that our knowledge and attitudes are very different from that era.I initially found this book a little hard to read until I became accustomed to the style of the book. I have read quite a few books by Charles Dickens and Mark Twain that I thought were much easier to read. I do not know if this style was one that was used only for children and in this era or whether the style is that of author Howard Garis, who was the \\"Victor Appleton\\" of this book.I found this book enjoyable once I became used to the style of the writing and once I was able to grasp the technology. I think that adults who are fans of Tom Swift, Jr. and those looking for a quaint mystery from the era before World War I will find this book an interesting read.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"We Americans","review":"I always thought this was an impressive book though the format is not that unusual. Celebrating the Nation's bicentennial meant that plenty of publishers saw a marketing opportunity to put a visual history book. This one is certainly a cut above any others, with 439 photos, 220 illustrations and graphics all beautifully handled on the page and well printed, too.A page at the back of the book gives a short biography of the twenty writers and it seems to me that these folk know their stuff and write in a very accessible way about the broad sweep of history. The look of the pages is equally impressive and as a publication design I can appreciate the effort that went into selecting the photos. I've seen many of them before, especially those that show the twenties to the seventies but these are the best photos available and many have achieved icon status.OK, it only runs up to the early seventies but as a very accessible history book of significant events before then I don't think it can be beat.

It highlights the reaction of the Arab intellectual circles to the expanding European influence that had reached the Arab world by the early 19th century.Hourani, however, presents a more thorough description of the life and thought of the most prominent Arab thinkers of the time including Jamaluddine Al-Afghani and Muhammad Abdo among others as opposed to Sharabi's brief account on the life and works of these people.Despite the academic nature of this work, grasping what's in it is easy and not at all complicated. Hourani's narration is well-researched and elegant while his translation of the original texts is also remarkable. The end result is an accurate account that invites the admiration of the readers.This book is so much needed for those who are interested to understand the evolution of Arab thought over the past two centuries and how this evolution was interrupted with the discovery of oil and the advent of imperialism."},{"Title":"Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age 1798-1939","review":"Hourani and Hitti have always been the darlings of modern Western (American at least) thought on the Middle East and while Hitti may cloud much of what he writes with a bizzare form of Lebanese nationalism that is equally as far fetched as Turkish, Arab, Persian and Slav nationalism that have done little but bring misery to those nations. Hourani on the other hand is a little more down to earth and while this book may have its faults until someone else comes out with better it remains the best of its kind.The book covers the history of Arab reform in the latter part of the Ottoman Empire, I have no idea what point a previous reviewer was trying to make about the Portuguese conquest of parts of Moghul India (he seems to have failed to point out the Portugues also had colonies in present day Morocco and Muslim East Africa also) as around the same time the Ottomans (who he wrongly calls a 'Turkish' empire) had conqured much of Eastern Europe and their Tatar allies much of Russia. If only Americans would stop to look beyond their own narrow history and even give a glance to Europes history.Hourani points out the foundations of the Arab nationalist movement were from to some extent a Christian background and how the teachings of Islamist reformers such as Afghani and Abduh (formerly a darling of the Ottoman Caliphs) became one and the same with the ideas of pan-Arabism and Arab nationalism.Hourani gives extensive detail into the lives of Afghani and especially Abduh and just where they took much of their inspiration from. One fault I do feel I have with this book is he covers little of the the structure of the Ottoman empire that the myth of Arabs being some kind of 'colonised people' is just a complete nonsense and that the roots of Arab nationalism are far more complex than that. The book however does give some insight and does act as a useful introduction to modern Middle Easter thought. I would definately recomend this book to anyone who realy is serious about wanting to know about the roots of some of the modern conflicts in the Middle East.Not the be and and end all but without doubt a very good place to start."},{"Title":"Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age 1798-1939","review":"Although Islam had begun retreating at least as early as 1509 (when a small Portuguese squadron operating far from home destroyed Muslim naval power at Hormuz), the Muslim world was so hermetic that it did not realize the terms of trade had changed decisively for almost 300 years. Only when Napoleon slaughtered the Mamelukes in 1798 did Muslims recognize that they were backwards. Some of them anyway.In this classic, though known more than read, work, Albert Hourani says that the first interest in the West was a quest for weapons. That began the tradition, which exists today, of liberal army officers attempting to reform traditional governments. Liberal in only a restricted sense, of course.After a generation, a civilian Arab intelligentsia began to emerge, especially in Cairo and Beirut. Reforming despots (again, reforming in a limited sense) recognized the need for western (largely French) knowledge to staff their governments.Hourani traces how these modernizing men began to wrestle with competing ideas: religion vs. territory vs. culture (Arabic language) as the basis of a successful government. Some of these men were litterateurs only, but many got involved in politics. Not a few were murdered.All attention is directed toward reformist thought. In a masterful introduction, Hourani sets out the traditionalist view of Islam and then lets it sit in the background. Some of his comments approach the aphoristic. For example, \\"Muslims believed themselves obliged to keep their neighbors' consciences as well as their own.\\"He gives pride of place among the new men to al-Afghani of the \\"strange personality\\" and his disciple Abduh. But there were many others. To an infidel, the most attractive, by far, was Qasim Amin, who told the Arabs: \\"It is useless to hope to adopt the sciences of Europe without coming within the radius of its moral principles.\\"Hourani rightly emphasizes the context of the times: Within the ken of the Muslims, the world was comprised of empires, including their own Ottoman one, with which they had a difficult time coming to terms. Some thought the empire, though led by Turks, vital to Islam; others were ready to adopt a more particularly Arab stance. The second approach allowed Arab Christians to join with Arab Muslim reformers.Hourani's history is of Arab thought, not exclusively Muslim thought.Only occasionally does the old Islam peek through, but when it does it signals a message to the 21st century. Even the \\"reformer\\" Bakhit could write: \\"The Islamic religion is based on the pursuit of domination and power and strength and might, and the refusal of any law which is contrary to its shari\`a and its divine law, and the rejection of any authority the wielder of which is not charged with the execution of its edicts.\\"This sentiment, well into the third generation of \\"reform,\\" should have caused more concern that it did.Hourani ends his assessment in 1939, when world war upset everything, including the French and British empires, although he does carry some of the story forward. He completed the book in 1962, at a time when secularism and nationalism seemed to have established an ascendancy in Egypt and western Asia. \\"The shari\`a had been abandoned\\" with surprising speed, he wrote.Since then, of course, the socialist, secular trend has proven to have been just a passing fancy. In his look to the future from 1962, Hourani was spectacularly wrong.Nevertheless, \\"Arabic Thought\\" must be a fundamental text for infidels in trying to understand Islam and especially Middle Eastern varieties. The book must make depressing reading for Arabs. No matter how they thought it should be accomplished, all the modernizers were after the same thing: a successful mode of governance for their people. As of 2007, the record is complete failure by every and all approaches.Hourani's book was directed at scholars in 1962. In 1983, Cambridge University Press brought out a paperback edition, and my copy (from a 1997 printing) brags that it had then sold over 8,000 copies.No wonder so few understood, or understand now, what's up, although no doubt many more copies than 8,000 have been sold since 2001. My second-hand copy has notations indicating it was used as an undergraduate text.Well, for serious undergraduates. There is nothing recondite here, but Hourani's text is dense.CUP should consider a new edition, with the French quotations translated (at least in an appendix, although with computer typesetting it ought to be possible to amend the main text at a reasonable cost). When Hourani wrote, he was a professor at Oxford and he could assume that all his few readers would be as conversant in French as in English.The French here is not difficult. Even my high school French coped with it easily. However, it can no longer be assumed that even educated American or British readers can also read French."},{"Title":"Founding Mothers & Fathers: Gendered Power and the Forming of American Society","review":"Cornell University professor Mary Beth Norton has once again turned the world of colonial American history scholarship on its head with her incisive review of gendered power structures in the 17th century mainland English colonies. For the first time she exposes the world to Filmerian thought and its implications for women (and men!) in society, both in New England and the Chesapeake. The book is dense, and at times boring and repetitive, but freshly informative too. Multiple stories about sex, sexual deviancy and scandal lighten up otherwise dry scholarly analysis. This is a valuable addition to the literature of colonial American history which has ignored feminist analysis for so long. She's a tough grader, but also a great scholar and a fabulous teacher. Even a dead white male worshipper like me can enjoy and learn from her brilliance! Good luck on your next project Mary Beth, I eagerly await it."},{"Title":"Founding Mothers & Fathers: Gendered Power and the Forming of American Society","review":"Norton argues that during the mid to late 17th century, colonial American political authority was based on biblical interpretations which encouraged a unified, gender-power based authoritarian system centered on the role of the father as undisputed ruler of his household. The founders were operating in a &quot;Filmerian system&quot; in which the sources of authority in the state and family were identical.However, this Filmerian system did create opportunities for women to wield some power. High-ranking widows were the rulers of their households and were deferred to by both males and females of lower ranks. Problems arose when these high-ranking widows failed to fall in with the male consensus, such as Anne Hutchinson.In the Chesapeake region, the Filmerian system was much less successful than in New England because the Chesapeake settlers were predominantly single men. The family-based power system failed in this region because it had very few traditional family households. Although power remained gender-based in the Chesapeake region, it became more like a &quot;Lockian system&quot; in which power in the family was differentiated from political power."},{"Title":"Founding Mothers & Fathers: Gendered Power and the Forming of American Society","review":"By Mary Beth Norton. Founding Mothers and Fathers: Gendered Power and the Forming of American Society. (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1996, hardcover 1996. Pp. ix, 496, appendix, abbreviations, notes, index....hardcover.)From the time of the Pilgrims to present day, women have played more of a substantial role than they are commonly accredited for. In Founding Mothers and Fathers: Gendered Power and the forming of American Society, Mary Beth Norton parlays her idea that although woman did not have an independent role in the political arena of early American society there were many woman and groups of woman who knew the undisclosed sins of the community. This they used in the assumption of leadership roles among the communities.Norton goes on to explain power inside the household as well as in the community. She connected Sir Robert Filmers' (The Filmerian view) and John Lockes' philosophies (the Lockean view) to both domestic life and the political structure and formation of early American society.As you probably know, the practice of bearing children was most likely the primary focus of 17th century colonial woman. Lacking in birth control, a woman would go through a constant cycle of becoming pregnant and giving birth. Norton points out that these regular childbearing sessions excluded men from attending. It is very important to understand the role of the midwife. She could be the necessary one in keeping the woman and child alive during birth. She could, as well, expose any form of bastardization, premarital sex, adultery, and infanticide. The power of the midwives and the ignorance of men on the subject of childbearing gave way to many cases in which women could bend around the \\"man-made\\" laws.It is probably demeaning these days to say that woman \\"gossip.\\" Well, according to Norton, this did indeed go on during colonial times. The reader will discover the \\"gossip networks.\\" Due to the fact that woman were separated from men in many social aspects led to these networks. Rumors of criminal activities would travel this way to the Colonial Magistrate and would very often result in punishment for the crime.I found the two different philosophies on gender power to be very interesting. Should the most power come from the parent most represented, whichever that may be? This idea would bring more power to widows and present them with a greater role in the community. However, the people of this enlightened area would demand that the power of a woman's authority was inexistent outside the home.Mary Beth Norton is a very accredited historian. This book gives remarkable incite to the power of woman in colonial times. Anyone interested in the social history of our country would enjoy this book and feel enriched after reading it. Many of the woman's roles discussed were unknown to me. Norton puts them across in a very intelligent and unquestionable way using many actual cases of the times to back up her theories.This book, although written by a scholarly author, is not a difficult reading. Since it deals with many aspects of colonial life unknown to many people the readers interest should withstand through its entirety. Indeed, woman played an immense, although not formal or independent, role in the formation of our country as it is today.-Charles Michael Farley-"},{"Title":"Founding Mothers & Fathers: Gendered Power and the Forming of American Society","review":"This book is utterly AWFUL when it comes to comparing it with other academic histories.

What if this same product was for sale only instead of Jehovah's Witnesses, it said: \\"Baptist\\", \\"Methodist\\", or \\"Catholic\\"? Enough of the hateful slanderous products on Amazon, please. My mother used to say, \\"If you can't say something nice about someone, don't say anything at all.\\" How true. Author tries to exalt their own religion by putting down others. What easier way than to brand the ones who believe differently as a cult. I was not born into this religion, but converted after 10 years of Bible Study and personal research. I attended many different Christian denominations prior to that. I believe that I was brainwashed BEFORE and the Jehovah's Witnesses opened my eyes by showing me in my own Bible the scriptures and encouraging me to become more familiar with my Bible. But, I would never tell someone of my former faith that they are in a cult, because that is not the loving way of Christ. That should be your first clue in staying away from products such as this.

I have researched Lake Michigan shipwrecks for 20 years and I own several hundred books about Great Lakes shipwrecks and nearly 100 titles about Lake Michigan shipwrecks specifically. Comparatively speaking, this book is very superficial. The book treats a few hundred Lake Michigan wrecks and fails to even mention that at least 2000 other historically verified total loss Lake Michigan shipwrecks are known. I also noted several relatively serious factual errors in the specific wreck accounts. All the wrecks detailed in this book are already covered in existing books and it appeared that little original archival research went into the book's preparation, as evidenced by the book's bibliography. The book would have benefited from some contextual historical material about the social and economic conditions that caused so many wrecks on Lake Michigan. I believe any reader with a background in Lake Michigan maritime history will be disappointed by this book's lack of perpective, historical context and depth."},{"Title":"Shipwrecks of Lake Michigan","review":"Shipwrecks Of Lake Michigan by Great Lakes expert Benjamin J.

Focusing on England, the book covers personages, buildings, educational institutions, practices, and more within the English realm of the period. The book is not only a true encyclopedic reference, but is beautifully bound and was originally destined for library use, due to its size and cost. As such, these types of books may become increasingly rare as we move farther and farther into the digitized book world, but there is still much to be said about having these types of books on the shelf. This one is gorgeous to look at, is printed on library quality paper and binding, and uses a font that is pleasingly easy to read. Numerous black and white photos and drawings support the text.The content itself is superb. The sheer reach of its content (for example, entries on sceintific and medical writings, Round Tables, Pembroke College, James of Gruytroede, the Battle of Val-es-Dunes, enameling, allegorical interpretation, Cistercian architecture, the Salisbury rule, and on and on, up to some 700 entries) is impressive, and the array of acclaimed researchers who participated (some 300 in all) make this a critical work for use when studying the period. Each entry is completed with a bibliography of supporting references, making this an outstanding first stop for conducting research in both primary and secondary sources.An easy five stars. If you can get a used copy at a reasonable price, it is even a greater bargain. Its $300 original cost from the publisher generally keeps it only within the realm of libraries, but you should be able to find a used copy at reduced price. If you can, grab it while they are still circulating.A few others from the same set (Routledge Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages):1.Medieval France: An Encyclopedia (Routledge Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages)2.Medieval Ireland: An Encyclopedia (Routledge Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages)3.Medieval Archaeology: An Encyclopedia (Routledge Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages)4.Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia (Routledge Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages)5.Medieval Iberia: An Encyclopedia (Routledge Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages)6.Key Figures in Medieval Europe: An Encyclopedia (Routledge Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages)7.Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia (Routledge Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages)8.Medieval Jewish Civilization: An Encyclopedia (Routledge Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages)9.Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia (Routledge Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages)"},{"Title":"The Lawman Said \\"I Do\\": The Frasers","review":"This book was relatively disappointing, although I was truly rooting for this book. However, I have many reasons for feeling disappointed.I won't go into a whole plot review; many have done so excellently before me! The premise was good- handsome rebel gentleman saves feisty yankee schoolmarm/sheriff's daughter from a stage robery, he saves the day again by becoming deputy at a time most needed, he's basically saving the day all the time, which I enjoy in a hero. After all, that's what heroes are supposed to do!There is no doubt about it, Colt Fraser is a generally \\"good\\" guy doing \\"good guy\\" stuff like what's listed above. Problem I have is that the entire time, he is trying to ooze his way into her bed. This doesn't seem to exemplify the men of the period. He KNOWS he's going to hit the road soon, but still tries to compromise this young lady? He even comes up with some very modern sounding \\"It's-not-having-sex-it's-making-love\\" jive and eventually talks her into it. Rather curious, if you ask me.Not very many books have Southern men and Yankee women. Usually, those roles are reversed. I was so hoping to see some real spark there, but it lacked it.

He has company on his trip in the form of Cassie Braden and her brother. Cassie is sassy, spirited, and totally female. Colt appreciates a beautiful woman, and he is attracted to her but before he can act on his feelings his stagecoach is held up at gunpoint and everything changes with that moment. And he may have just made one enemy that he wasn't counting on. Colt is injured in a gunfight and finds himself taken to the small little town of Arena Roja. He has no idea that the spitfire calls this place home, or that her papa is the town sheriff. When Colt finds out that the next stagecoach to Santa Fe is not for another week, he allows Papa Braden to talk him into assuming the position of deputy sheriff. But will he be able to walk away from Arena Roja and Cassie, or will he finally settle down and carry on the family tradition of marrying a Yankee?Ms. Leigh's read offers a little bit of everything. A colorful cast of characters, one stubborn horse, laughter, and a romance that will keep you glued to the pages. I'm happy to see that the western historical is finally making a comeback and this effort is truly worth getting a hold of.

This scene was just too funny. And yet Cassie and Sam won.Favorite scene with Colt-His conversation with Ted about Cassie.Together-Colt erasing Ted's message, and almost making love on the schoolroom floor. Colt had to show Cassie that living for a man who might never return would slowly kill her. She had to move on with her life, not live in the past. And it wasn't the right place and time to make love.What did you like about Cassie-Her strength and mischeviousness. She wasn't afraid to take risks, although sometimes I didn't think she was thinking. Her love for her family, and for Sam, Bowie and Petey. Her wanting to go to California with Colt. Being the first to tell Colt her feelings. How brave she was. That braveness and strength also saved her life many a times.What didn't you like about Cassie-It wasn't that I didn't like these traits, but there were times that I thought that Cassie didn't think. She took stupid risks, which almost endangered herself and others. She was also willing to marry Ted, although she loved Colt. She was also willing to give up her life, waiting for Ted to return to her. Cassie had a good heart, but it was killing her.What did you like about Colt-I loved his affection for the rugrats. I loved that the town and its people came to mean so much to him. He helped Jeff grow up, and he helped Jethro when he was ill. He was willing to put his life on hold to help others. I loved that he wanted to make love, not have sex, that he believed there was a big difference. He really wanted to be a lawman. It suddenly became more important than California. Colt had the town wrapped around his little finger. Everyone wanted him to stay.What didn't you like about Colt-It was the speech he made about how things would change, esp. the town. He loved the town and its people, and yet, although the truth, I can't believe he would say such a thing. Willing to leave town, esp.

Colt enjoys what would otherwise be a tedious trip because of his fellow rider, feisty spitfire Cassie Braden accompanied by her brother Jeff. Colt likes the pretty Cassie especially her courage and spirit. However, five armed robbers hold up their coach; in the ensuing chaos a somewhat drunk Jeff fires a shot. Colt, protecting Cassie, takes a bullet in his shoulder from the robbers. He is taken to nearby Arena Roja, Cassie's hometown, to receive medical attention.Colt learns that the next stagecoach to Santa Fe is not due through the small town until next week. As such Sheriff Braden, who needs help, persuades Colt to become his deputy temporarily in spite of some people objecting to a stinky Reb. As he performs law enforcement work for Cassie's father, Colt and Cassie begin to fall in love, but will the newly appointed deputy sheriff stick around long enough to recognize his feelings.The second \\"Fraser\\" western romance (see FRASER: CLAY) is a fabulous tale due to an eccentric cast including an obstinate steed, who makes Mr. Ed look like a team player. While the unconventional townsfolk either matchmake or try to run the Rebel out of town; either way they place the lead couple into some amusing situations. Fans will enjoy the antics while wondering whether Cole will stay or go. Ms. Leigh provides an enchanting Americana tale that sub-genre fans will cherish.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Health Policy in a Globalising World","review":"I reviewed this book for the Yale Journal of Health Policy, Law and Ethics, 2003, 3:2, 417-424. The text below is from a draft of that review -- for the final version see the reference above. (warning -- this is a little bit long!)As I write this review, the United States has taken on the role of global \\"enforcer\\" -- we have gone to war with Iraq to effect \\"regime change\\", largely without the support of our traditional European allies - dismissively termed \\"old Europe\\". This war sets a frightening precedent - the first time the United States has gone to war without having been attacked first. The president who has declared this war presides over the sole remaining superpower and thus, is arguably the most powerful American president in history. Coincidentally, and very sadly, among recent presidents he also stands out as one with little interest in, and experience of the rest of the world. Of the Congressmen and Senators he has to work with (and who serve as an important check on his power), only about 30% actually hold a current US passport. This war is the culmination of a unilateralist trend which began with his presidency - walking away from numerous international treaty obligations and promises on global climate change, the international court, landmines, and so many other issues. But the seeds of this trend were visible earlier: the US has become the most powerful and most influential nation, and the \\"driver\\" of globalization in so many ways, and yet we remain a nation which is largely unconcerned with the impact of its actions and policies, and those of its citizens and corporations, on the rest of the world.That is where this book comes in. Lee, Buse and Fustukian have brought together an excellent collection of essays on a wide range of aspects of the health impact of globalization. Anyone who wants to take the time to understand the wider implications of this phenomenon will find much of value in this collection. Students of health policy and of international health would also do extremely well with this collection, and teachers of those subjects will find this a very useful contribution to the literature on this recent and evolving issue.What do these authors understand by globalization? The authors use a definition of globalization as \\"processes that are changing the nature of human interaction across a wide range of spheres including the sociocultural, political, economic, technological, and ecological.\\"(from Lee, 2001) As a consequence, boundaries whether they are \\"spatial, temporal, or cognitive\\" are changing and in some ways becoming far less important than they were previously. The authors also distinguish between \\"international health\\" and \\"global health\\", with international health relating essentially to matters between states or regions, and global health dealing with issues which are \\"transborder in cause or effect\\" and not confined to any country or group of countries.The fourteen chapters of this book cover a wide range of issues, from an introduction to global health policy; the implications of the multilateral trade agreements; the growing enthusiasm for public/private partnerships; regulation; health care financing reform; cost-effectiveness and priority-setting; violence against women and reproductive health; the globalization of the DOTS approach to treatment of tuberculosis; aging and health policy; worker's health and safety; and finally globalization, conflict, and the humanitarian response. Some of the chapters are more directly related to the issue of globalization than others. I confess I read the introductory chapter but then moved directly to the chapter which seemed to promise the most relevance to the current world situation - chapter 13, \\"Globalisation, conflict, and the humanitarian response\\" by Anthony Zwi, Suzanne Fustukian, and Dinesh Sethi. I was not disappointed. The authors make several important observations. First, that insufficient attention has been paid in recent conflicts to \\"prevent or mitigate significant human rights abuses...(and) to the links between external and internal non-state actors, such as private companies and diaspora communities, that can play a major role in supporting violence...\\" A second key observation is that ethnic identity is playing a growing role in conflict; they quote Lipschutz and Crawford (1999) that \\"so-called ethnic conflicts are reflections of failing social contracts between different groups as global economic forces place governments under immense pressure to promote greater economic efficiencies and exploitation of local resources.\\" Conflicts have winners and losers; and typically the losers are the already poor and marginalized, while those who benefit are in a position to manipulate markets or seize assets - and thus have an interest in perpetuating conflict.The health impact of conflict includes the high mortality due to the conflict itself, and due to displacement both internally and across borders; and the mental health impact of trauma, torture and stress is enormous. Often the conflict results in damage to the health services themselves, whether through actual destruction to infrastructure including human resources, or diversion of funds away from health purposes to the military. How has globalization contributed to conflict? Globalization involves a shift in power both from states to markets, and from weak states to strong states. Within countries, the pressure brought about by the World Bank and IMF's program of Structural Adjustment Programs, or SAPs, has produced a \\"residual state\\" unable to contain or curtail violence within its borders, or worse, based on \\"structural violence\\" which involves unequal and unfair distribution of resources and services. And the World Bank continues to insist on economic policies consistent with a \\"globalized world economy\\" wherein the state is no longer a \\"provider\\" but rather a \\"facilitator and regulator\\". Truly weak states are not in a position to either facilitate or regulate. And the authors point out that income and wealth disparities have grown substantially over the past several decades. The UNDP estimated in 1999 that the assets of the three wealthiest individuals in the world are more than the combined GNP of all the least developed countries and their 600 million people. The top three in recent years have all been Americans.Many readers will find chapter 2, on \\"The public health implications of multilateral trade agreements,\\" particularly useful. This chapter focuses in particular on the World Trade Organization, or WTO. The chapter begins with the WTO's basic premise, that \\"human welfare will increase through economic growth based on trade liberalization....From a public health perspective, this desirable goal requires linking the benefits of the global trading system to sound social policies.\\"(Drager, 1999). That key link, as the chapter demonstrates, not only has not been made, but attempts to make it have been opposed by a number of strong states and actors.One of the more interesting discussions is in chapter 6, by Lee and Goodman, in which they describe the policy discussion around health care financing reform, and the formation of a \\"transnational policy elite\\" with two hubs, in Washington and London. (This book is largely the work of researchers with ties to, or based at, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, and in the interest of full disclosure, this reviewer spent 10 years as a faculty member there and obtained her PhD from that institution.) They describe an \\"early transatlantic divide\\" between the Washington hub which had links to the World Bank and USAID, and the London hub, largely based at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, with funding from the UK government and links to colleagues at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, WHO and UNICEF. The main issue on which they divided was user fees, with the Washington hub being a strong proponent, and the London hub raising equity concerns. They trace this to \\"differences in the underlying values and principles that shape the US and European health care systems\\", with the Europeans viewing health care as a \\"social good\\" which should be available to all regardless of ability to pay, whereas in the US health care continues to be viewed as primarily the responsibility of the individual, and a private consumption good.Chapter 8 by Kumaranayake and Walker, on the applications of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) presents a thoughtful commentary on the use of especially the Disability-adjusted life year, or DALY, which will be of interest not just to economists but to anyone who has wrestled with the use of CEA for health priority setting. They review the use of this tool to attempt to determine global priorities, with all its limitations of poor local data and difficulties of application of those data to different settings. They sensibly conclude that \\"we must be aware of not expecting too much from the tool... rather than aiming for precision, which both the data and tool are not designed for.\\" And further, that CEA \\"does not take the politics out of decision-making...but is an element in the process of overall-priority setting, rather than a mechanistic way to select alternatives.\\"(p. 155)In chapter 9, on violence against women and reproductive health, Mayhew and Watts review the global attempts to reduce the horrific levels of different forms of violence against women. They cite figures which indicate that around the world, between 20 and 50% of women report having been assaulted or raped by a male partner at least once in their lives. They point out that \\"partner violence occurs in all countries, and transcends socio-economic and cultural boundaries.\\" But violence against women includes not only rape and sexual assault by partners, but trafficking in women, forced prostitution, and violence and rape which is \\"perpetrated or condoned by the state, such as rape in war.\\" Curiously this definition, adopted by the UN, does not appear to cover the selective abortion or infanticide of female fetuses and babies which results in the \\"missing females\\" - over 50 million female infants were missing in India and China at the beginning of the 90s according to Coale, and Nobel prizewinner Amartya Sen believes the number is closer to 100 million.(Gray, 2001) Their discussion of the global debate around this issue is valuable and focused, and they point out that the Reagan administration's \\"hard right-wing line on population\\" forced the groups of women who otherwise would have focused on violence against women to align with those promoting family planning, so as to prevent further restrictions on availability. It seems that the same phenomenon is repeating itself - the threat of limiting access to family planning and contraception, including abortion, diverts attention from the wider issue of violence against women in all settings.So much has happened in the past few years - September 11, the war on Iraq and worldwide protests against that war, to name a few - that some will forget that the last time large numbers of people took to the streets was to protest the WTO, in particular its impact on workers and worker health. The chapter on \\"Workers' health and safety in a globalizing world\\" by Fustukian, Sethi and Zwi is one of the most useful in the book and is packed with information - a survey of this important issue in 20 pages. The chapter begins with a review of the data on workers' health around the world and catalogues the reasons why this is so - the lack of health and safety standards; the concentration of poor migrants in the most dangerous jobs, where they are vulnerable to exploitation; and the transfer of often-dangerous technologies to areas where there is little awareness of the dangers they pose, or where enforcement of existing standards is minimal. The use of female and child labor in the workforce, particularly the even less regulated informal sector, puts them beyond the reach of international organizational efforts which usually target the formal, export industries. Workers in developing countries are often particularly vulnerable to the practices of multinational and transnational countries which are deliberately targeting countries with a large labor force and poor regulation; they cite the notorious Union Carbide disaster in Bhopal, India in 1984, as an example of this: double standards in terms of design, equipment and maintenance, as well as deficiencies in operational practices, meant that the workers and surrounding population were put at significant risk. However, as the subsequent investigation showed, the Indian authorities were complicit in the low standards maintained by this subsidiary of a large multinational company. The authors describe how most low and middle income countries are content to leave labor standards issues up to the largely toothless ILO, rather than an organization such as the WTO which has genuine \\"teeth\\". In this they are joined, somewhat surprisingly, by the multinational companies themselves - and the reason is that they fear losing the industry altogether in a world where the multinationals are able to quickly shift their operations from one country to a more \\"welcoming\\" environment elsewhere. What then is to prevent this from happening more regularly? This brings us back to the protests in Seattle and elsewhere in the world in 2000 and 2001, where the interests of industrialized countries' consumers and their unionized workers coincided to bring pressure on such companies as Nike to improve their \\"sweatshop\\" practices. Voluntary codes of practice are being adopted in response to demands from civil society - or were before the economic downturn post-September 11.There are several areas which I would have liked to see covered in such a book. Using the definition set out by the authors in the first chapter, of global health being affected by processes which are changing the way humans interact, I would have liked to see more explicit consideration of several important global health issues. For example, an examination of the attempts to agree on measures to improve the environment and slow global climate change, the politics around the Kyoto protocol in particular would have been welcome as would have been a review of the attempts to set up a tribunal to hear accusations of war crimes and on the effort to agree on a global ban on landmines. I would also have expected more on the changing roles of other UN agencies such as the UNFPA and the influence of US domestic politics on reproductive health; on the UN Security Council and the UNDP, and UNHCR. A chapter devoted to the controversies around pharmaceutical distribution, pricing, and access would have been timely, although the issue of patent protection and the impact of the WTO's Trade related aspects of intellectual property rights, or TRIPS, is nicely covered in the chapter on regulation by Kumaranayake and Lake. Other issues which are closely linked with globalization, but which are not covered in any depth are the global trade in illegal drugs, trafficking in women, and international attempts to control the distribution and marketing of tobacco products. According to WHO, by 2020 tobacco use will cause over 12% of all deaths globally, and tobacco will cause more deaths worldwide than HIV, tuberculosis, maternal mortality, motor vehicle accidents, suicide and homicide combined. It seems a significant omission from this important book. And finally there is no chapter devoted to the biggest health issue of our time -- the HIV/AIDS pandemic. These last two are huge omissions from a volume on international health and globalization.But what is here is a very useful and thoughtful collection of work on many of the most pressing global health issues of the day, with a policy framework to tie them together. It should be of much interest to both those interested in health policy and international relations and international policy specialists who want to know more about how globalization affects health."},{"Title":"Cottonwood Summer","review":"Cottonwood Summer documents author Gary Slaughter as a master at creating loveable characters and an engaging story-telling narrative style enriched with humor and originality.

Having spent most of their 11 years on earth sniffing out and conquering adventures, they have gained quite a name for themselves. And the summer of '45 is no exception. Living in Riverton Michigan, home of one of the wars POW camps, this young sleuthing pair found it almost impossible to stay away from detective work were so obviously destined for.Being taken hostage by a disgruntled POW and forced to co-pilot a stolen plane, discovering a soldier gone AWOL, and joining the police force in a seemingly dead-end robbery case, are only a few of the exciting feats this pair finds their selves mixed up in this summer. And that's just in Michigan. When a friend invites them for a 10 day stay in Nashville Tennessee, their only plans were to have fun, they were not expecting their detective skills and illustrious names to follow them on vacation.They had barely left on the train station when their new adventures begin and they follow them into Nashville, they suddenly find they now have to balance their time between site-seeing and visiting the new southern friends they have made, due to their heroic acts upon their first days of arrival.Banding together and taking in every experience with relish and excitement, these boys, yet again, find themselves right where they love most to be, in the heart of the action!This was the first book I have read in the Cottonwood series. I feel the author did a great job making this book read as a stand-alone book. He also does a great job in including lots of interesting history. I especially enjoyed it in this one, as I currently live in Nashville, and learned quite a few new things. I had a little bit of a hard time with how the history was placed in the book, as I am used to reading the history weaved into the fiction story. In this book, it seemed a little disconnected at times, but as I have never read his other books, I may just not be familiar with his writing style. I also wasn't aware that this was really written in the style of a youth or young adult book. And so at first I was a little bored with the urealistic adventures in the story. I think now, understanding both of those things, I would be able to enjoy the rest of his books. And while I think these books are enjoyable to adults, I think a younger crowd would really love this. I know my children will, once they are old enough to read.I received this book for review."},{"Title":"Cottonwood Summer","review":"Cottonwood Summer is a delightful visit to a simpler past.

This is a most enjoyable book for all generations to read."},{"Title":"The Riemann Hypothesis: the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics","review":"I think potential readers of this intriguing book need to bear in mind the following: (1) you do not need to understand Riemann's hypothesis to enjoy this book and (2) Mr. Sabbagh does a very fine job of outlining Riemann's hypothesis in layman's terms. Riemann's hypothesis is not easily grasped; what Sabbagh wants to do is to enhance your understanding of it. There is no pretense here that the hypothesis in all its complexity is being conveyed. In fact, near the book's end, he concedes that &quot;you know almost nothing [about R's hypothesis] compared to what there is to know. The hypothesis itself is an outcome of Riemann's zeta function which is the sum of the series 1 + 1/2^s +1/3^s...1/n^s, which means 1 + 1/2^a+ib + 1/3^a+ib (where i is an imaginary number). All sorts of values are possible, but the values of interest center on the Riemann zeta function when it becomes zero. These zeroes, as its turns out, fall on what is known as the &quot;critical strip&quot; and their graph is linked to the fluctation of the primes, which are themselves the building blocks for all the other numbers. The hypothesis is that all the &quot;significant&quot; zeroes line on the critical strip. The proof has become the Mount Everest of mathematics, but it remains unscaled. Many mathematicians, who perhaps found the hypothesis disarmingly approachable, have died before reaching the summit.Sabbagh does want you to understand the hypothesis, but he is also trying to delve into the community of mathematicians generally -- what they are like as people -- in an effort to make them more accessible as well. Inevitably, in this area, Sabbagh often reads like an anthropologist documenting the ritualistic &quot;abnormalities&quot; of some primitive Amazonian sub-culture. What I found surprising is not that Sabbagh finds that the thought processes of mathematicians rarely intersect with that of non-mathematicians; rather what I found striking were the similarities with the &quot;rest of us.&quot; They can be collaborative yet guarded, brave yet insecure, intuitive but distrustful of intuition. Several he finds are lousy at simple computations (but brilliant on abstractions). They are a colorful lot, but they are not high IQ aliens from another world. The portrait of Louis de Branges is especially fascinating and forms a strong sub-plot within Sabbagh's text.I don't plow through many books like this, but I do recommend The Riemann Hypothesis. Like Sarah Flannery's &quot;In Code&quot; (which has an excellent chapter on prime numbers), The Riemann Hypothesis is suited for, and ought to be attractive to a wide audience."},{"Title":"The Riemann Hypothesis: the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics","review":"I want to call this a &quot;biography&quot;, but the Riemann Hypothesis isn't biological. It's almost take on a life of its own, though - maybe the term really does apply.In any case, this is a very enjoyable book about the history of the hypothesis. In many ways, this book is more about the people who pursue that elusive proof. That small, distinguished crowd includes the reticent and the outspoken, the loners and the social thinkers, the meticulous and those who think by leaps and bounds. Sabbagh has a strong emphasis on the living mathematicians who hunt this elusive quarry. He has spent long hours interviewing these mathematicians and watching them at their work. At bottom, this may be a book about intellectual passion and the people for whom its reward is real.The book contains a few disconcerting mis-statements:-- one says that plutonium occurs naturally - on Earth, it does not,-- another on p.11 makes a statement about prime factors of the number 60 (I'd believe that same statement about all of 60's factors, including non-primes), and-- a third on p.143 appears to have applied parentheses incorrectly in describing Skewe's number.None of these, by itself, affects the main thrust of the book. Still, they leave me wondering about every fact I read. When I find such errors, I have to wonder how many I didn't find, ones that I don't have the information to check.Because of the book's emphasis on the people dedicated to the hypothesis, there is no one place where the hypothesis' history is laid out in full and in order. That's small enough loss, if you accept that the book's topic is really mathematicians and not mathematics. The author does give a brief and clear statement of the problem itself - that takes math at the level of high school calculus to understand, but the reader won't be punished for skipping past its details.This book has real nerd appeal (I like it). It's a readable case study of a famous problem and of the people tracking it down. It won't really expand anyone's intellectual horizons, but there are lots worse ways to spend a few hours. Despite flaws, I found this book quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Riemann Hypothesis: the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics","review":"Leaves the reader somewhat disappointed.I picked up this book with great expectations, having read the publisher's publicity. To be frank, I was left disappointed. The book tells the reader very little about the wonderful and mysterious character of the Riemann hypothesis and leaves both mathematical novices and those who know about the intricacies of higher Mathematics dissatisfied. This is indeed a pity!Having said this, Mr Sabbagh's story is eminently readable and enlightening. The book has many sections that are in effect a diary of the conversations with various Mathematicians. These give an insight into the thought processes, passions, motivations, and rivalries that exist in the select community of Number Theorists. The pen portraits of the main protagonists is quite interesting even though it sheds little light on the character of the Riemann hypothesis and how it enthrals those working on its proof.The toolkits covering a set of brief synopsis of Infinite series and the Euler identity should be useful to the lay (but Mathematically capable) reader, but the appendix on the De Brandes proof is rather obscure.Overall, an OK book if the reader wants a gentle introduction to the subject and act clever in passing conversation at parties, but, sadly, this book fails to educate and enlighten in the real sense!"},{"Title":"The Riemann Hypothesis: the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics","review":"I have not yet read PRIME OBSESSION which at least one reviewer recommends instead of this book, but I at the very least enjoyed this one. Unless your math background includes calculus and at least an introductory level course in complex analysis, you are not really going to understand what the Riemann Hypothesis says in any deep way. That's just the way it is. (Similar problems exist in any book written about quantum theory, say.) However, I thought the author did a good job of giving a non-mathematical reader a feel for what the hypothesis is with his &quot;addresses in New York&quot; metaphor. The fascination of this book is its introduction to a wide variety of mathematicians who are working on proving the hypothesis and a realistic idea of a) how much time it takes to &quot;do math&quot; and b) the one-mindedness that a problem like this creates in the people who study it. This is a relatively low stress popular math book intended for the general reader who might otherwise never pick up a book about a math problem. I thought the author succeeded in reaching that audience quite well."},{"Title":"The Riemann Hypothesis: the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics","review":"I have an undergraduate degree in mathematics from a long time ago, but haven't done a whole lot with it. Nevertheless, I gained something of an appreciation for the subject and am always interested when something important enough happens that it gets into the popular press. So naturally enough, I have been aware of the number one unsolved problem of mathematics, the Riemann hypothesis, and have followed the sporadic claims of its resolution over the last few decades.Mr. Sabbagh's popular treatment of the problem in this book was a delight for me to read. He explains the hypothesis very clearly in a way that really doesn't even require any specialized knowledge of any arcane area of mathematics. Though great, this is not the primary virtue of the book. Rather it is his effort to reach out to the dozen or so mathematicians who are actively working on the problem who might have a hope of finally, after about a century and a half, of proving it. The reader is thus led to some appreciation of the world of the professional mathematician, with all of its human hopes and jealousies, striving to achieve a legacy that will outlive themselves. Sabbagh interviews them, some of them several times, attends their seminars, and listens for the inside dope that might show that someone somewhere is onto something.The book is engaging, and I found it impossible to put down. It has lots of anecdotes, asides, and curiosities along the way to liven up the story. It is brutally honest in its portrayals of the principle characters. The writing style is lively, and the math is easy to follow. And it tells a story of man at his best--striving for progress, precision and truth. Quite the opposite of so many charlatans of the academy today, who seem to revel in ambiguity, imprecision, and political correctness."},{"Title":"The Riemann Hypothesis: the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics","review":"I'm halfway through this book and am getting very frusturated. The beginning chapters did a very good job laying out the foundations of the RH. You begin to think you may, finally, be able to understand what the RH is about. However, I am realizing that less and less of the book is actually about the RH or the RZF the farther I progress. An entire chapter will waste space describing a mathematician (physical appearance, quirky behavorial traits), his unrelated contributions to math, and either a vague description of the work he is doing to prove the RH or some opinion on whether it will be solved or not. The book has devolved into irritating tangents unrelated to my understanding of the RH/RZF...clever math poems, crap about Fermats theorem, etc. I would even be forgiving if he was describing the life and times of Riemann himself. There are plenty of cute little math stories here, but I didnt waste $14.00 on a book about the RH to NOT read about the RH. I want every single chapter to build on the previous, start slow, explain the concepts, and raise the bar. If you get stuck, too bad...research the web and pick the book up later. Thats what I wanted here, and this book is turning out to be a letdown.There is very good information for someone completely new to the concept of the RH or RZF, but this book is 4 chapters of useful material spread out into an entire book filled with math-related lore. I appreciate what Sabbagh is trying to do here, but lets be realistic. This is a very advanced mathematical concept; you can't hand-hold someone through this from start to finish. At some point he should challenge the reader and escalate the difficulty of the book, but this does not appear to happen. Instead we get a smoke-screen...a cliffhanger. Would I recommend this book? Only to those who have absolutely no understanding of what the RH/RZF is and want a springboard to something else."},{"Title":"The Riemann Hypothesis: the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics","review":"It would be very tempting for the mathematically-inclined to criticize this book for what is, to the adroit reader, its laborious treatments of some very basic mathematics. Many already have. But do not overlook this book's value, especially if you are not one of the mathematical elite. What Sabbagh has done is to take a rather unapproachable topic and put it in the terminology of the layman. Unlike many other texts which fail in this endeavor (by lapsing into terminolgy which has not been sufficiently defined or concepts which are not solidly built up within the volume), Sabbagh is thorough to the point of pedantically assuring that the reader can follow every step of the way. Some of this pedantry would be better directed to ensuring absolute accuracy, true, but the bulk of this book guides it toward achieving its author's intent.The sometimes amusing anecdotes are worth the price of the book, and let's face it - any book purporting to be accessible to the man on the street that contains an explanation of eigenvalues has got some guts behind it, and, in my view, \\"The Riemann Hypothesis\\" has a great deal of merit as well."},{"Title":"The Riemann Hypothesis: the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics","review":"This book is really about the author's view of how mathematicians think and live in the current day. There are oodles of little tidbits of &quot;weird mathematicians&quot;. You get some idea of what the RH is about, but it's not _really_ the point of the book. Unfortunately, the focus on De Branges overcorrects the math establishment's treatment of him, which, though unfortunate, is partly justified (he announced yet another proof today or yesterday - which may be correct this time). Not recommended overall, but definitely gives a slice of life from the sciences that acknowledges both human failings and sublime thoughts."},{"Title":"The Riemann Hypothesis: the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics","review":"Well, anyone willing to try to explain the RH to the \\"person in the street\\" deserves some credit, regardless of the success of the effort.In my view, Sabbagh's book will not give one much of a feel for the mathematical machinery involved with the RH, even at a very elementary level. There are some infelicities here and there and, at times, Sabbagh's own understanding is in doubt - even at his \\"non-mathematician\\" level. This is nothing to be ashamed of ... there are many professional mathematicians that are afraid of number theory and consequently have little or no understanding of the RH either.I'd recommend Derbyshire's Prime Obsession as a much more informative and better read for the novice. The next step up is a giant one and few are prepared to make it. For those interested, a reasonable and gentle book to consider is \\"The Prime Number Theorem\\" by G. Jameson. The latter is an excellent introduction to analytic number theory including the RH.

The book itself is very entertaining, captivating, and interesting. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the Riemann Hypothesis. It not only gives you some of the key ideas that are out there in the mathematics community for attacking the problem but it also gives you an account of the major players in this field. It tells you why mathematicians love working on problems against all odds. The book relates their excitement, frustrations, creativity, dedication, and mental stamina in a way that it feels as if it's you instead of Sabbagh who is interviewing the mathematicians.

Sabbagh's efforts are praise worthy and HIGHLY entertaining. I especially enjoyed what are for some apparently tangential if not unrelated questions like -Is Mathematics Invented or Discovered? What is Beauty in Mathematics? Reading some of the other reviews suggests that those questions are more incomprehensible to the nay sayers than the RH itself. This book provides enough information on Things Mathematical that even a rank tyro will be able to decide whether or not they want to really dig into deep technical issues in Number Theory and Complex Analysis. It's a GREAT read for the mathematically inclined or curious. There is PLENTY of Riemann Hypothesis here.

It is as if I buy a children's book on physics and complain about the depth of its concepts. Some wise pedagogue would say I was completely confused on what divulgation is about.If you think you can enlighten our small minds on this matter dedicating a couple hours, I suggest you send a manuscript to the press. I shall be happy to buy it and rate it afterwards.In scientific literature there ought to be room for books that can be understood by more than one hundred people.

In my case it has triggered the purchase of other deeper approaches.Well done Karl!!!"},{"Title":"The Riemann Hypothesis: the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics","review":"The book is really about the search for solutions to the Riemann Hypothesis, and contains lots of stories about mathematicians, and mathematical topics. It also includes a wide variety of tangential topics, such as the resolution of previously unsolved problems: the Bierbach Conjecture and Fremat's Last Theorem.While intended as an accessible account of the Riemann Zeta Function and the Riemann Hypothesis for the non-mathematician, it uses overly trite and simplistic descriptions of basic mathematical concepts such as prime numbers, complex numbers, and zeros of functions, while glossing over more advanced concepts, such as L-functions, Hilbert Spaces, and Random Matrices. Clearly, this was written by a mathematical novice."},{"Title":"The Riemann Hypothesis: the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics","review":"\\"Many people would say that the task I am embarking on by writing this book is doomed to failure.\\" That's the opening line of the book, and I wish one of those people had talked to me before I bought it. Fortunately, I only paid $6 for a used copy. I'd probably take $5, except that I've never resold a math text since my freshman days decades ago.Sabbagh has basically written a math book for those with neither mathematical knowledge nor the intention to acquire it from his book. It bears the title of the greatest unsolved problem in modern mathematics, but it has the flavor of a survey course for non-technical P.E. or liberal arts majors. He rambles at length about Lives of the Mathematicians, nibbles around the edges of peripheral topics like continued fractions, and spends entire pages on patronizing oversimplifications, like his description of the complex plane.On at least one occasion, he strays from sloppiness into explicit error: On page 288, discussing infinite series, he observes that the set of prime numbers, like the set of all whole numbers, goes on forever, \\"yet they can't both have the same 'number' of members (called terms) since one series is included in the other.\\" This is simply, howlingly, false, as it is a *defining characteristic* of an infinite set that it can be placed in one-to-one correspondence with a proper subset of itself. That is, the \\"number of members\\" in the set of prime numbers (more rigorously called the \\"cardinality\\" of the set) is denoted Aleph-one, the \\"smallest\\" infinity; this is also the cardinality of the set of all integers, or the set of all even integers, or the set of all integers consisting only of the digits '7' and '8.'So, even though it looks like there are only \\"half as many\\" even numbers as there are numbers all together, you can simply associate every integer 'n' with the corresponding even integer '2n' and thus every element from one set maps exactly to an element of the other, with none left over. Hence the \\"number of elements\\" or cardinality of both sets is equal. Less straightforward mappings work to show equality in the other cases.Sabbagh goes on for over three hundred pages, and nowhere coherently summarizes the whole Riemann Hypothesis and its mathematical underpinnings, which he could certainly do in maybe one chapter, and which I could probably do here ultra-briefly if I had a charge number for a couple of hours.I love math--and loved it recreationally back in junior high, long before I had any degrees or great knowledge of it. This is the first and only book written for adults I've found this useless. Think about a documentary on some obscure detail about the sex habits of a tribe you've never heard of on the other side of the planet, edited for a PG rating and broadcast in your second language. That's how much of the Riemann Hypothesis you get here."},{"Title":"The Riemann Hypothesis: the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics","review":"In this tome about one of the most celebrated conjectures in Mathematics today, there are actually more words attributed to some person not fathoming why the multiplication of two negative numbers yields a positive number than there are to Andrew Wiles and Fermat's Last Theorem. The author spends far too much time on basic concepts while ignoring the major aspects of the Riemann Hypothesis theory. If I wanted basic concepts, I would have read other books. Consequently, this book turns out to be a real disappointment. I returned my copy back to Amazon and instead ordered Prime Obsession. You will learn a lot more from Prime Obsession!"},{"Title":"The Riemann Hypothesis: the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics","review":"This book is only for those with no math background who have an interest in the Riemann Hypothesis. I would imagine this to be a small group. Unfortunately, those from this group will be in a nearly similar state after having read the book."},{"Title":"The Riemann Hypothesis: the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics","review":"Mr. Sabbagh is not a mathematician, so it's not surprising that in this book he says relatively little about the structure of the Riemann hypothesis and its connection to other significant math problems. Rather, this book is mostly vignettes about modern professional mathematicians who have worked on the Riemann hypothesis. I have known a few of those mentioned here, as well as many other mathematicians, and for the ones here whom I have known, I find Sabbagh to be generally accurate, although he has a tendency to place them on pedestals of mystery they don't belong on.This book is written at a level accessible to a lay audience, but I suspect it will only be read by people with some interest in math, some training in math, and a number of friends and acquaintances among professional mathematicians. For those of us who meet those prerequisites, the book starts numerous trains of thought about interesting topics barely touched on here that might be worth pursuing. (But a proof or disproof of the Riemann hypothesis is not one of those.)One aspect of the book that's unfortunate is the amount of space devoted to Louis de Branges' preoccupied pursuit of a rigorous proof of the Riemann Hypothesis. Some of de Branges' work is outstanding, but none of it seems likely to converge on a proof of the Riemann hypothesis, although it may be important for other mathematical topics. Unfortunately, de Branges writes so cryptically that even other outstanding mathematicians have great difficulty in following his trains of thought, so he gets little attention; in particular, I know nobody who thinks he will produce a proof of the Riemann hypothesis. De Branges is a classic example of the thought once expressed to his students by a top-flight mathematician under whom I studied: \\"If you want to become serious mathematicians, you must learn how to recognize quickly when a problem is too hard for you!\\"There are numerous views and minor remarks in the book that I could challenge, but I won't; I think every serious reader will come up with a similar list. However, I'll point out one possibility that the author doesn't consider or mention. Suppose somebody, or some deus ex machina, handed us an impeccable proof or disproof of the Riemann conjecture. It is quite conceivable that the proof would be so involved and use so many presently unfamiliar concepts and methods that no mathematician alive in the first half of the 21st Century could understand and verify that proof. Mathematics progresses through gradual exploration and conquest of many different domains simultaneously, and this process cannot be hurried; if present mathematical knowledge is not ready for something, it will not be accepted as an incomprehensible gem. For example, the crucial connections between multilinear algebra and algebraic topology would not have been understandable for any 18th Century mathematician. So it is perfectly possible that a solid proof or disproof of the Riemann hypothesis can be produced, but not until 50 or 100 years from now."},{"Title":"The Riemann Hypothesis: the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics","review":"There are a few mistakes:1) p. 133 In the smallest n-digit primes sequence, there are incorrect 8th and 11th members.2) p. 190 The values of the Mobius function are listed from one to ten, the 7th is incorrect (should be -1)3) p. 206 The inline formula for the gamma function is incorrect. It reads \\"Gamma(n) = n * Gamma(n-1)\\" but should read \\"Gamma(n) = (n-1) * Gamma(n-1)\\".There is also a fuzzy explanation which contradicts another explanation of T. H. White's \\"everything not forbidden is compulsory\\" (p. 185). Sabbagh claims that Gell-Mann says this is how the laws of physics work--that if something is predicted to exist by a theory, then it exists somewhere. Kip Thorne clearly explains in 'Black Holes & Time Warps' that this is not how the laws of physics work. From the book, \\"Many of the things permitted by the laws of physics are so highly improbable that in practice they will never happen.\\" (p 137) It may be that I misunderstood Sabbagh's writing or that Sabbagh misunderstood Gell-Mann. Nevertheless there is something going on here that doesn't match up.Other than that, the book was pretty good.

I ordered this book a couple weks ago, and fell ill this week -- so I had some time to spend reading.I didn't get very far before I found a rather glaring error. On page eighteen, the author explains one method for showing that there's no largest prime number. He asserts that:(2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 + 1) / 7is equal to2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 + (1/7)which is not correct.

The Israel Defence Army was officially created on June 27, 1948. But its precursor had already been fighting a war for the previous six months. And its origins were even earlier.As Allon explains, the first cells were formed as early as the 1880s. During the period between the World Wars, Arab pogroms led to the development of the Haganah. This army was founded in the 1920s, but began to acquire some skill with the arrival of Orde Wingate in the Levant in 1936. Wingate and Yitzhak Sadeh developed the Haganah into a force that turned the military situation around, so that the Arab attacks ground to a halt in 1939. Unfortunately, at that time, the Jews suffered a major diplomatic defeat. The British came up with the infamous White Paper which severly restricted Jewish immigration, and that put the Jews into a virtual war with Great Britain. In addition, the Jews faced threats from Germany and its allies as well as from Arabs. To counter all this, the Jews in 1941 formed an additional strike force, called the Palmach.Allon describes how the new army trained and how decisions were made to avoid open warfare against Britain and also to avoid terrorist attacks on civilians. Instead, the focus was on illegal (according to the White Paper) immigration of Jews. This activity required planning and coordination: it required ground forces as well as ships. The author explains that this experience helped prepare Israel for its war of liberation, which began on November 30, 1947.Allon then tells about the War of Liberation and the Sinai campaign of 1956. He explains that peace was averted after the 1956 war primarily due to the efforts of the United States, which forced Israel to withdraw from the Sinai but did nothing to restrain the Arab side.The author then explains the rationale in favor of Israel going to war against the Arabs in 1967 as a preventive measure. Allon successfully argued against this. As a result, Israel decided not to go to war unless its neighbors concentrated their forces in clear preparation for an attack or closed the Straits of Tiran (a clear declaration of war). Egypt did the latter, starting the Six Day War. Allon argued for an attack in May, before the Egyptians could organize their Sinai forces, but for political reasons, the strike was postponed until June.The author points out that Israel was slow to attack Syria, with the result that Southern Syria remained in Syrian, not Israeli hands. Had Israel forced Syrian forces back to the outskirts of Damascus, the Israelis might have been able to link up with the Druze people and help them form their own buffer state.The book concludes with over 150 pages of fascinating documents about the origin and early exploits of the Israeli forces.If you are interested in this topic, I'm sure you will find this book very rewarding."},{"Title":"The making of Israel's army","review":"Yigal Allon writes about the creation of the Israeli Defence Forces since its times as the Haganah, under the British rule in Palestine, until after the Six-Day war.It's a wonderful read, you can feel the honesty and good heart of this great man, a great, humble and intelligent Israeli Jew.The book is divided in two parts. The first is the actual telling of the story and the second (second half, approximately 150 pages) is a collection of documents that you may find more or less interesting. But only for the first part it's worth the read.Now I am interested in reading his \\"My Father's House\\"."},{"Title":"Backyard Self-Sufficiency","review":"This was my introduction to Jackie French's books, and a real breath of fresh air. Finally, a book which gives practical, realistic suggestions for growing food and using what your garden gives, without trying to convert or brow-beat, as so many books in this genre do.While Jackie acknowledges the positive environmental impact of her fairly unique gardening style, her primary rationale for growing food and using you garden is that it's fun.

We have always planed to write a book on the implications of our ideas for treatment. We never succeeded. We never had the clinical experience to take on the task of the kind of comprehensive treatment model which we envisioned as the only approriate one for this group of seriously handicapped youngsters.Where we fell short, Bleiberg succeeded. This is a truly important contribution. It covers the entire spectrum of treatment strategies from psychopharmacology to psychoanalysis and does so within a single coherent frame of reference that could easily guide clinical interventions for most difficult patients.Bleiberg is a child psychiatrist, psychoanalyst of great seniority. This book reflects exceptionally well on his rich experience as clinician-teacher-researcher. He has provided what is, above all, a practical guide. It is a wise book with hundrends of deep insights into difficult clinical problems and practical suggestions on how to managhe them. It provides a clear understanding of treatment challenges. The book is a must for all practitioners."},{"Title":"Treating Personality Disorders in Children and Adolescents: A Relational Approach","review":"Simply put, this work demands a place on the bookshelf of every compatent practicioner. For many years I have cleaned out libraries and the clinical guides belonging to colleauges and never have I found a book so comprehensive and insightful as Bleibergs.

My memories of working my internship in a youth detention center came back clearly. While the book does a great job in opening our eyes to the formation of severe personality disorders, I find the material extremely helpful in treating a good majority of all the kids that I work with.I am a big follower of Attachment Theory and appreciate the authors like viewpoint.

I have been a practicing child psychiatrist for 23 years. As a group, we child psychiatrist are reluctant to diagnose personality disorders in children and adolescents. There are many reasons for this. As we become primarily prescribers of psychotropic medications, which are helpful in many cases. we may have developed a bias toward diagnosing Axis I disorders which frequently do respond to psychotropic medications. This is not the case with personality disorders.i particularly appreciated the authors use of the term \\"dramatic\\" personality disorders because these individuals lives are filled with drama, often precipitated by their own behavior and emotional reactions.Like adults with personality disorders, these children do not function well in any environment and always blame others for their distress and dysfunction.As the authorr thoughtfully pointed out, they lack reflective capability. I thought the vignettes were excellent in making the author's point; he chose examples that are familiar to any provider involved in the care of these severely disturbed youth.I have not finished the book yet as I find myself re-reading parts over and over again. Thanks for an excellent reference for those of us on the front line."},{"Title":"The Invisibles Vol. 3: Entropy in the UK","review":"After the sometimes-underwhelming art of the previous two collections, Phil Jimenez's artwork in the first half of Book 3 of the Invisibles is sort of like a slap to the face: vibrant, detailed, masterful. Luckily, he later became the regular artist on the series, but here he only illustrates the opening arc, a three-part saga that details King Mob's torture at the hands of Archon agents, and which also provides this volume with its title.In a way, this is the true beginning of what the Invisibles would soon become known for: fast-paced ideas and action, and an onslaught of mysticism, fringe science, and conspiracy theories. I've never been sure if it was Jimenez's amazing artwork that lead to this, or if Morrison finally thought his readers were \\"ready\\" for the big time, but regardless, from here on out things happen, and events unfold at a maddening pace all the way until the final volume of the series.Having been captured at the end of Book 2, Invisibles King Mob and Lord Fanny are at the mercy of Sir Miles Delacourt, straightlaced and overbearing agent of the demonic Archons. Here, finally, we get to know a bit more about King Mob, as Delacourt invades his mind and sorts through his past. This is full-on psychedelia, as King Mob attempts to defend himself in the guise of fictional character Gideon Stargrave, a mod super-spy from the \`60s (and author Michael Moorcock's Jerry Cornelius in all but name; something Morrison readily admitted). This results in Delacourt waging a mental war against King Mob's psychic defenses, with the Stargrave segments providing some outrageous cross-dimensional action sequences. Very heady stuff, with lots of mystic ideas dropped, this arc is easily one of the high points of the entire series.After this storyline, the narrative slows down for a moment as we have a single-issue peek into Boy's background. Boy, the black female martial artist Invisible, was never Morrison's strongest creation. In fact, he eventually admitted this, and basically dropped the character toward the end of the series. Therefore, her spotlight issue, \\"How I Became An Invisible,\\" is probably my least favorite story in the Invisibles canon. It hints at interesting developments that later become integral to the series (shadowy government agents taking innocent black Americans prisoner, and shipping them off in mysterious trains), but Morrison ruins it all by having the characters speak in some of the most fake \\"black\\" dialog ever. You can tell he's out of his element, a Scottish writer creating \\"urban\\" dialog for inner-city black Americans. It doesn't really work.Things get back on track after this, with the narrative picking right up after the events in the opening arc. Though King Mob and Fanny have defeated Sir Miles, they're still trapped in a building that's crawling with enemy soldiers and ultraterrestrial beings. The remaining Invisibles cell (Dane, Boy, Ragged Robin) call in reinforcements, and fellow Invisibles Jim Crow and Mr. Six show up to help. This results in a multi-issue storyline that features all sorts of high-concept action, as the Invisibles wade through hell-on-Earth protective spells and defend themselves against cancer-inducing nanoweapons.The book ends with a single-issue look at Division X, the swaggering British counterpart of the X-Files (Mr. Six is one of the three members of Division X, incidentally). This story seemingly has nothing much to do with anything else in the series so far, until much later, when the themes brought up here are developed. The story does feature the first appearance of the impish, demonic Quimper, a frightening little creature who will cause the Invisibles much trouble in future volumes.As mentioned, Phil Jimenez provides the art for the first half of the book, with Steve Yeowell filling in the other half. This is pleasing thematically, as Yeowell started off the series, and his finishing up the first major arc makes sense. However, I've never been the greatest fan of his work. The Boy/Division X issues are penciled by fill-in artists: one scratchy, the other Todd McFarlane-esque.This trade paperback wraps up what was the first volume of the Invisibles comic run. After these issues, DC/Vertigo halted publication for a few months, and Morrison revised his approach to the story. After this, no longer would the story come off as methodically-paced as it had in earlier issues (the Marquis de Sade storyline in the \\"Say You Want a Revolution\\" trade in particular); instead, the series would feature nonstop action, sex, and ultraviolence. Some say this new approach was a \\"watered down\\" version of the Invisibles, but I say that's hogwash. The stories collected in this book are great, true, but the best was yet to come for the Invisibles."},{"Title":"The Invisibles Vol. 3: Entropy in the UK","review":"ENTROPY IN THE UK is a thought-provoking read, and a satisfying conclusion to this first major arc in THE INVISIBLES. It balances Morrison's usual rush of madcap ideas with solid plot advancement and continued character development, as Boy and Dane question their involvement with the resistance group and Fanny and King Mob try to resist psychic interrogation and torture.The book's opening arc, also entitled Entropy in the UK, is probably my favorite. One of the recurring themes of The Invisibles is the limits of human beings' ability to perceive their surroundings - the limitations imposed on them from the outside, and the limitations they place upon themselves. The interrogation sequence in this story is one of the finest explorations of this issue, especially in its discussion of the role of language. One of the drugs that Miles and his men pump into King Mob causes him to be unable to distinguish between a word and the concept that the word describes; as Miles uses it to warp Mob's perceptions, he talks about the limits of the English language and alphabet. It's a great sequence, one that illustrates the power of words, as well as their limits. Phil Jiminez's beautiful pencils display the dazzling, chaotic landscape of King Mob's mind and thoughts, while the narration and script lay out the dizzying ideas and mantras of the two combatants. It's very clever, very enjoyable stuff.The rest of the book is also strong, although I preferred Jiminez's work to that of any of the other artists here -- no knock against them, as I'm a really big fan of Jiminez. Morrison wraps up some threads from SAY YOU WANT A REVOLUTION and APOCALIPSTICK, and sets a number of others into motion -- so at the end of this, you'll definitely want to keep reading with BLOODY HELL IN AMERICA."},{"Title":"The Invisibles Vol. 3: Entropy in the UK","review":"Entropy in the UK concludes the story told in Vol.1 through 3. And what an ending it is...Broken down into parts, the first 3 issues detail the torture of King Mob, and his interesting way to counteract it. Morrison is forever writing himself into his stories, and he takes off with it, writing himself as Mod Spy Gideon Stargrave. Insanity ensues...The final issues show the Invisibles at work, fighting Ultradimensional monsters with Voodoo and Buddha. Morrison, while writing this, was struck with numerous sicknesses, cumulating in an infected lung and a serious life crisis. This shows in the story, as everyone is subjected to airborne nanotech cancer agents and King Mob suffers from a collapsed lung.This is great storytelling, but requires that you read the first two volumes to even come close to understanding it.A real treat."},{"Title":"The Invisibles Vol. 3: Entropy in the UK","review":"In the third installment the leader of the Invisibles finds himself battling against a brutal interrogation that wishes to know all the secrets of the Invisibles and their cells scattered all over the world. It's also focused on how Boy and how she joined the Invisibles as well as more on the rebellious, suconciously dream suppressed Jack Frost, the chosen Messiah who is likely the only one who can truly deal with the Archons, advanced beings that basically want to suck the life out of our world/reality and then destroy it. It seems that in every volume Jack begins to realize parts of his experiences have been submerged and are arising. Definite nods to the works of author Philip K. Dick's works (he even shows up in this volume) as well as alternate realities and even nods to mystical religions like Gnosticism and other philosophies that speak of a good and evil God that created this world or had a deep impact on its makings. Some of the ideas are convoluted and will therefore be chaotic in the eyes of some readers but if you like these ideas and stick with it you should find the ending satisfying enough. Mister Six is introduced at the very end as another Invisible in another cell who is seeking the mysterious Moonchild. To me the art is good but never great. I suppose that's partly because they were going to a different look that doesn't do a lot for me. This is considered one of the classics and was said to have shaken up a stagnant period for comics/graphic novels. BBC started a TV series but it never saw the light of day. This series may have very well influenced movies like THE MATRIX and other such types.

I like the story in the other comics but I get hung up on bad art work. I also think Lord Fanny is the greatest and seeing her more is just a plus."},{"Title":"The Invisibles Vol. 3: Entropy in the UK","review":"The third volume of The Invisibles--my personal favorite--opens with the brutal interrogation of King Mob. As his teammates rush to his rescue, Jack Frost, who deserted the team in the previous volume, goes home to Liverpool. Jack, driven over the edge by the memory of the soldier he was forced to kill in Vol. 2 and the knowledge that he is the next messiah, could care less about his friends. Yet when forced to experience the collective suffering of all humanity by the mysterious sentient satellite Barbelith (which is a whole other story......), Jack changes his mind. Finally accepting responsibility for once in his life, he decides to face his fears and help his friends.Jack performs some feats reminiscent of both Buddha and Jesus and, in the end, saves the day. At the beginning of the series, Jack was angry, disaffected, self-centered.... basically, he was a teenager. Now--and it's this growth of character within Jack that draws me to this volume of the series in particular--he's grown up, accepted his destiny, and is willing to put himself on the line for those he cares about. Jack's evolution as a character is the focal point of The Invisibles' first three volumes--after this, he takes a back seat. But all is well. Jack is simply taking everything in while the rest of the team has their crazy adventures. You see, Jack's been enlightened, and he doesn't necessarily buy all the rhetoric that the Invisibles are selling.......It's Morrison's willingness to push his characters to (and over) their boundaries and subvert even the subverters that makes The Invisibles a classic must-read."},{"Title":"The Invisibles Vol. 3: Entropy in the UK","review":"...and it remained my least favorite one, neck to neck with Kissing mr.

Since I didn't like it so much, well, get it only if you wanna see it through the end."},{"Title":"The Invisibles Vol. 3: Entropy in the UK","review":"After somewhat losing its pace in Apocalipstick (I didn't care much for Jill Thompson's artwork and Lord Fanny's origin story, but it was overall a good read) the Invisibles gets back on track with this stunning addition to the title. King Mob and Lord Fanny have been captured by the Archons and are being tortured by the ruthless Sir Miles. Meanwhile Boy, a (female) member of KM's Invisibles cell, searches for Jack, the next Buddha, and Ragged Robin meets up with the voodoo rapstar Jim Crow (he has the coolest gun!). It was when Boy found Jack that the Invisibles became my favorite comic ever. The part where Barbelith (I'm not going to try to explain that...charcter?) forces Jack to feel the pain humanity has gone through (the Holocaust, famine, disease, war) is the most touching and convincing scene I have ever read in any book. Paul Johnson's rough artwork is a perfect match for Morrison's writing in the issue. So buy this volume, and then buy them all, for the Invisibles is truly an experience."},{"Title":"The Invisibles Vol. 3: Entropy in the UK","review":"Oh... so what do you need to know, I mean come *on*...It's brilliant.

The first time I read it and finished the last page, I closed the book slowly and just sat there in silence for about ten seconds. The only thing I could think of was - \\"that was the best ending of any book I have ever read, in my entire life.\\"I put off writing a review, because I really just don't know what to say about it, and I wanted to read it twice first. I had the same feelings the second time. I've read three or four Hemingway books now, and I'm getting very accustomed to his writing style, and I love it. The emotions and characters come off the page with simple unobstructed prose. His words simply don't distract you with intricate words or complicated sentences. The work and effort it must take in order to make his writing so clear.. is just beyond me.This book, to me, seemed to just tell a plain old story, nothing all that exciting. There are memorable scenes during the course for sure... but the ending will just blow you away. If you start this book, you need to finish it. I don't expect that I will ever come across another ending which is as well written as this one. I simply could not believe the last couple of pages and how emotional and stunning they were.I also read this particular printing. I got it for $2 outside the Salvation Army in Cambridge during a book sale. The book itself was in very good condition. The pages are thick, the binding is decent, and the hardcover is nice. Older books have a different quality about them compared to modern printings, and I like the older books better. The feel of the book, the smell of the pages.... if you are to buy a copy of this book, opposed to a library checkout, this printing is a nice one to have. I'd prefer this printing over a modern paperback any day of the week."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"\\"'There is nothing as bad as war.

After many years of not reading Hemingway, the book reminded me once again of his brilliance.This classic war torn love story certainly isn't for everyone. I say that because many readers insist on the main characters being likeable people, and the main characters here, Frederick Henry, an American ambulance driver attached to the Italian army and Catherine Barkley, a Scottish nurse, are far from likeable characters. Henry, whose character is loosely modeled after Hemmingway, is a rather self centered and uncaring character, while Barkley is portrayed as a rather desperate and lonely woman willing to sacrifice her virtues for companionship. Neither are traits inspiring among leading character roles.This fact lends credence to Hemingway's masterful writing skills as he transcends the norm and presents rather unlikable characters into an extraordinary tale that will envelope most readers into the fabric of their stories. Hemingway accomplishes this by making his unlikable characters extraordinarily real. Like it or not, even the best of us humans have character flaws at some point in our lives and most readers will identify with aspects of reality we don't always aspire to present.Hemingway presents battle images that are truly brutal. When it comes to war, what we think of today as brutal today, often pales in comparison to the reality of the Great War. The story is beautifully told, masterfully constructed and moves the reader to feel the emotions that I think Hemingway wanted to produce which centrally included a bitter distrust of that war and war in general, and the complexity but power of a love affair between two fairly normal but relatively insignificant and imperfect people.I do not consider this Hemingway's best work, but it is essential reading nonetheless."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961) drew upon his experiences as an ambulance driver in the First World War to write this anti-war tale about love and loss in tumultuous times. Lieutenant Frederick Henry (Tenente) is an American serving in the Italian army in 1917. Henry is rather rugged and callous, and when he meets an attractive British nurse named Catherine Barkley his only thoughts are about using her for sensual pleasure. Soon, however, the two fall deeply in love. As war rages the two spend time together while Henry recovers from wounds, then they are separated only to meet again. Readers never learn much about their hometowns or former lives - perhaps this is done to show how war can blur identities and bonds with the past. Readers also see how Henry and his comrades are sick of the war's cruelties and injustices. That disillusionment eventually leads Henry to desert and try to flee to neutral Switzerland with Catherine.This moving novel, first published in 1929, has remained popular to this day. Hemingway's prose illustrates hope, tragedy, loss, and the affect of war on ordinary people caught up in events. I sometimes see Hemingway as over-rated, but this is clearly one of his best efforts."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I've heard it said before that you either love Hemingway or you hate him. In the past, I was a staunch supporter of the 'hate' side, but after reading A Farewell to Arms, I moved to the 'this is better than some things, but not what I'd choose first' side. In other words, I appreciate his talent and what his style did for modern writing, but it's still not something that's utterly enjoyable to me.A Farewell to Arms is written in classic Hemingway style: sparse, often drab, and littered with often confusing conversations which have to be read three times in order to sort out who said what. A Farewell to Arms is written from the viewpoint of Frederick Henry, a young American in the Italian army during WWI. The book follows Henry's relationship with Catherine Barkley, a young nurse, as well as his life in the Italian army.A Farewell to Arms is a grim book. I felt very 'gray' when reading this novel; the work in its entirety points to the brutal realities of war and the frailty of anything in the face of it. This novel is semi-autobiographical, as Hemingway himself served as an ambulance driver in the Italian army, and this personal experience seems to have lent Hemingway the ability to very clearly capture WWI.The parts I enjoyed most were the stream-of-consciousness passages, for which Hemingway has a particular talent. The genius of these passages is that Frederick Henry's drunken stream-of-consciousness is written much differently than his sleepy stream-of-consciousness.The main reason I didn't find this book particularly enjoyable is that I couldn't find a connection to the main characters. Frederick Henry came off as a bit stiff and average to me; there was nothing particularly engrossing about him to make me care whether he lived happily ever after or got blown to kingdom come. Critics have also pointed to Hemingway's lack of dynamic female characters, and I found Catherine Barkley to be no exception. Beautiful and submissive, she easily falls for Frederick Henry, who in my opinion is no prize.So there you have it. There is no argument that A Farewell to Arms is classic literature, and with good cause, but I maintain that if you're looking for something really entertaining, this novel is not the place to start."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I liked this book much more than I'd expected to. The prose was quite familiar, knowing and being somewhat indifferent to some of Hemingway's other work. The difference is with the story itself, one of the historical documentation of World War I and the possible varities of emotional crippling such a wide and vast conflict might inspire.Our main characters, a battle-scarred ambulence corps leiutenant falls in love with a damaged nurse who cares for him both before and after his injury. The romantic scenes are rather sweet, if also ominous in the childish simplicity these two express their innermost feelings to each other. Here is a story less of blissful true love (in itself far too fantastical to occur within the gritty realism of this narrative) and more of co-dependancy, that of two people who genuinely need one another and then seperated by the chance of death of one versus the opportunities for astrangment of the other. Each of these two characters are involved in both of these dialectics, each taking one side versus the other at random times. I was surprised by the force and the power of a story chronicling mostly the 'down times' of men-at-war. The scenes of battle themselves are almost a blur, no doubt rather reprsentitive of the actual confusion among participants in any sort of battle, whether organized offensive or defensive or coming under fire without actual warning. It is a brutal, raw, at times desolating book that dares you to care about these characters and then forces you to endure the ultimate failure of even their most noble of causes. Here is a book that must have made a forceful impact when it was first published, for alongside the man other famous works of fiction dealing with WWI, this one tells a story all the more straight-forward, ignoring much of the political complexities and social disorder of the era and focusing on the effects of this on one man's broken and hopeless heart. It is a thing of beauty, a fine example of a passionate opposition to war from one who has run out of justifications for fighting for human and individual freedom and who is barely able to function outside of another person's order.Hemingway, never one of my favorite authors, has gone up unquestionably in my estimation and this particular experience will, if not get me to re-read previous books and stories I have read, will certainly inspire me to pick up something else sometime in the relatively nearby future."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms is a stunning portrayal of the realism of love and war. War is not necessarily as glorious as some books make it out to be. War can be painful for all involved including civilians and soldiers. Lieutenant Frederic Henry, the narrator of the novel, is an excellent vehicle to understand the implications of the story. He is easy to relate to: he acts heroic when necessary, but is completely selfish. This realism was able to provide me with a clearer vision of what Hemingway was trying to portray to the reader.The relationship between Catherine and Frederic has been viewed as simplistic and boring. I disagree because the true love that exists between Catherine and Frederic is realistic. The way they treat each other is often the way that newlyweds act together. The tragedy that occurs at the end of the novel, and Frederic's subsequent reaction, is proof of the love the couple had for each other.To say the writing is simplistic is a misunderstanding of Hemingway's work. Hemingway tried to portray a vision on the theory of less is more. Sometimes by saying less, the message is conveyed in a more clear manner. This novel was one of the first that I have devoured and swallowed whole in a long time. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"How can love and war exist at the same time? I always thought it was not possible, but in the novel A Farewell to Arms it happened. Ernest Hemingway is the author that made what I thought impossible, possible. A Farewell to Arms is based on Hemingway's own life. The character Lieutenant Fredric Henry is a mimic of Hemingway's life in World War I. The novel is the best because of how Hemingway made a realist visualization of how war was; the dialogue brought me into the conversation, and it shows how strong love can really be.Throughout the story Hemingway describes life of fighting on the front lines. He made the war come to life. \\"Passing where the shells had landed I avoided the small broken place and smelled the high explosive and the smell of blasted clay and stone and freshly shattered flint\\" (24). While I was reading this sentence I could see and smell what he was describing. This is what made me want to read on. My interest grew rapidly to see what was going to happen next. I have never been over seas or in a war so it was interesting to me how he was describing everything.Not only did Hemingway describe life on the front line, he used a lot of dialogue which brought me right in on the conversations. When reading the dialogue it was like hearing a movie. There were times that I had to go back and figure out who said what line, but most of the time it flowed so well that it was obvious. Whenever Lieutenant Henry was talking to the soldier with the rupture in his leg, when they were talking the soldier said he was from Pittsburgh. He states, \\"Sure, in Pittsburgh, I knew you was an American\\" (35). This use of dialect made reading the story interesting.Reading about how horrible life on the front lines could be through the use of the dialogue was neat, but out of all the hate and anger surrounding Lieutenant Henry and Catherine. Yet they can still love another. This was love was my favorite part of the book. The love between them was so cute. At first, Lieutenant Henry was not in it for love, but then he grew to love her. This was my first love story I have read on my own, and I really enjoyed it.I would recommend the novel. A Farewell to Arms, for me was great. Usually I like nail biter books, but the romance in this book was good. It was just neat to see how love and war could exist at the same time."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"The harsh reality of the descriptions of war in A Farewell to Arms is lightened by the charming and sometimes amusing dialogue between various characters. Hemmingway has some very interesting and intelligent views on war and life in general. Through his portrayal of certain characters, it is evident that there are certain qualities that Hemmingway attributes to masculinity - loving women and wine, bold confidence and loyalty. Other ideas presented by Hemmingway through his characters are thought provoking, yet sometimes rather depressing. Perhaps one of the most intriguing concepts presented about war is that it is the upper class that wages the war, but expects the lower classes to fight it for them, a bitter truth that is found throughout the history of war. The fact that this book is set during WWI does not matter because so many of the themes and ideas found in this book are still relevant today."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I am a freshman in hs and I enjoyed this book emensely. It is a wonderful example of a classic love story. Granted, the ending is horribly sad, but all in all, this book is a fantastic read. I had never read a \\"classic\\" piece of litarature that I enjoyed until this. Applause!!!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Ernest Hemingway's \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" is a defining novel in American Literature. The story revolving around the love between a young nurse and a volunteer in the ambulance corps during World War I goes beyond the traditional boundaries of the genre. Hemingway provides an intense look into the human yearning for life and the brevity of our time on Earth. This idea is what brings the two lovers together.The complementary characters further enhance the idea of life and death. The soldiers faced with near certain death search for a distraction, something to take their mind off the war. These men turn to women and alcohol to try and distract them from their rapidly approaching death. Death is the inevitable end that haunts us all, as illustrated by this quote: \\"That was what you did. You died. You did not know what it was about. You never had time to learn. They threw you in and told you the rules and the first time they caught you off base they killed you ...But they killed you in the end. You could count on that. Stay around and they would kill you.\\""},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingway's &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; is one of 20th Century literature's most heralded books. Essentially a story about love in the midst of war, this novel tells the story of an American (Lt. Fred Henry) fighting for (and in) Italy in WWI and his romantic relationship with English nurse, Catherine Barkley. Henry meets Catherine through his roommate and the romance begins rather quickly. The story follows this romance and is interspersed with carefully wrought (albeit brief) descriptions of battles, Henry's injury, his hospital stay, return to the front, retreat and desertion, and the standard Hemingway (i.e., miserable) ending.Hemingway's scenic descriptions are as good as they get and the battlefield is vividly brought to life throughout the story. The major failing in this book is the dialogue and character development (this complaint is nothing new to Hemingway's work, but is most evident in this novel). Aside from some physical descriptions, little is known about what is inside the major characters in this novel (and even less about the surrounding cast--but make no mistake, this is a novel about Henry and Catherine). Psychological development is essentially non-existent. In other words, it is tough to figure out what makes these main characters act the way they act. The romance blossoms almost instantly and major decisions are often made with little indication to the thought process that led to them. Henry and Barkley aren't unlikeable, just difficult to get to know.Perhaps more of a complaint rests with the stilted, brief dialogue (almost all conversation is of the one-sentence variety). Clipped conversation rules the day and again, reveals very little about the characters doing the talking. And this takes away from what is a very engaging story.All in all, a good (and fairly quick) read, but not as emotionally powerful as it could have been and somewhat short on interesting dialogue. Recommended reading."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This book has never exerted the same appeal to me as Sun Also Rises. Everyone agrees it is great but something about it leaves one feeling a bit confused. Hemingways editor Maxwell Perkins saw the book as a war novel and wanted Hemingway to change the ending ever so slightly to make the ending once again attest to that fact. But Hemingway didn't want to change his ending. As it is the book is about both love and war. The love scenes show how war effects even that most personal part of life. The war scenes alone make this a great book especially the Caparetto retreat where Hemingway sums up with a few brilliant scenes and some very memorable paragraphs his view on war. But during that second retreat, Frederik Henry and Catherine's retreat to Switzerland, it becomes a little less clear where Hemingway is taking the reader. It seems that he is saying war can be left behind but not life. And the overall view of life in the book seems to be that war is tragic and best avoided but life too is tragic. I think the book is made up of great parts but those parts do not add up to a clear overall impression. Perhaps Hemingway is saying that war is bad and lives touched by war are forever scarred and therefore will end badly. Perkins wanted Hemingway to have the last tragedy of the book be more directly connected to the overall tragedy, war. I think that would have made this a more coherent book but Hemingway's instinct perhaps was right because the book transcends the war genre because of it. Perhaps the book is about life and its tragic nature and the war is just one way we become aquainted with that tragic nature, love another. Possibly. Every reader has to answer those questions for themselves."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This was the first Hemingway novel I ever read. Like one of the other reviewers, I don't pretend to understand and analyze all of Hemingway's symbolism, but with the help of Cliffs Notes and SparkNotes (online at www.sparknotes.com), I discovered how masterful Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms is. This is not difficult reading, but it is beautifully worded and the descriptions of places and events are spellbinding. This is one of the better high school required books I have read. If anyone wants to get into the classics, A Farewell to Arms is a good place to start."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"In this book the reader is taken to another world where, even though details are sparce, the mind can beautifully develop characters, places, and actions. If you have to have every single description written out for you then I suggest that you do not read this book. Hemingway gives you a lovely story that has its own \\"flavor\\". The mind is left to play with his words and create a thrilling saga. You, as a person, will grow along with the characters. It is, all in all, a story of love, despair, and beauty."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was a great story about love. Even though I would have prefered a book with a um..... happier ending.

I would recommend people to read this book and also other books written by Hemingway."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Though Ernest Hemingway does a fine job of coordinating events for the reader, it is difficult to follow the conversations between characters. At time surreal, some of the conversations plasticize the character, and some are just completely incomprehensible. Did people really ever talk that way to each other? I found the book mediocre for the most part, and I was able to follow along and keep up with the story, but couldn't get too excited about it. The ending, however, almost managed to pull the entire story together. It was a fabulous ending, not predictable at all until the last chapter or so. &quot;Tenente's&quot; ability to deal with everything so casually does seem a bit fantastic, but the ending saves this character from a life of dullness. Overall, the book did not leave me wanting to read any more of Mr. Hemingway's work. I would only recommend it during a reading slump, or when there is nothing else available."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Many years ago back either in High School or Middle School I read this book more as an assignment chore than enjoyment. Re-reading this book was now for enjoyment and that goal was accomplished this time around."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"As a teenage boy, I usually don't find any type of romance incorporated in books I read. However, I thought A Farewell to Arms contained a romance that I could easily relate to and actually kept me enthralled within the novel, wondering what was going to happen next. Not only did this particular novel have romance, but also blended action, brotherhood, and the real sense of war. I strongly recommend this novel to a reader of any age because it offers a plot that can change at any moment and the character's emotions can easily be felt by readers.A Farewell to Arms takes place on the Italian front in World War I and the love between an American, Henry and a British nurse, Catherine Barkley. Henry is a combat medic fighting for the Italian army and meets Catherine before combat starts. Their love is like a game of cat and mouse as the battle is ready to ensue. They eventually find each other to be soul mates for one another, but spending time with each other is soon cut off when the fighting begins between the Italian and Austrian Armies. He is unfortunately wounded in battle and is immobilized for some time in a hospital in Milan. After consuming mass amounts of alcohol to both reject the pain of his wounds and the pain away from his beloved Catherine, he falls in a state of bewilderment, not knowing what to do with himself and wondering if he should go back into combat.Finally after recovering, Henry is promoted to an officer position and is thrown back into combat against both the German army and Austrian army. After deciding that the war is futile and there is a better life waiting for him, he escapes to reunite with Catherine and finds himself living in a world of comfort and peace with her. Their peace is soon interrupted when Henry is informed of Italian battle police searching for him to be arrested. Henry and Catherine then escape on boat to Switzerland to further live their lives with one another. I'll leave the rest of the plot in suspension and speculation.To me, A Farewell to Arms was a novel that taught me love is one of the most important feelings in life and that love can persevere through the evils of war. However, you can find trouble and tragedy whether you're in war or not. Henry is a typical masculine, Hemingway character that wants something more out of life and he finally finds it in Catherine. As I said before, I strongly recommend this novel because it gave me a sense of intellect that only Hemingway can instill in a reader and made me feel emotions that I thought I could never find within myself."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I recieved this book in a timely manner.

If you are non of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms is frequently touted as the semi-autobiographical novel of Ernest Hemingway's life during World War I. While Hemingway was in the Italian Army in WWI and was an ambulance driver who was injured in combat, the similarities of Hemingway's life to the events of the novel probably end there, however. Hemingway did court a nurse employed at the hospital where he recuperated, it seems no long term relationship developed, unlike the romance between characters Fred and Catherine.While this novel does contain soldiers, shootings and sadness, A Farewell to Arms really isn't a story about the war at all. This novel is about relationships with people and their reactions to impossible situations. A Farewell to Arms doesn't glorify the exploits of an advancing army but rather focuses on the lives and challenges of the people caught in the grips of war.Personally, I truly loved Hemingway's stripped-down writing style. Hemingway didn't fill the pages with flowery descriptions, but rather relied on sparse descriptions that were reminiscent of a newspaper account. Take, for example, when Fred returns to the front in Chapter XXV:\\"The mulberry trees were bare and the fields were brown. There were wet dead leaves on the road from the rows of bare trees and men were working on the road, tamping stone in the ruts from piles of crushed stone along the side of the road between the trees. We saw the town with a mist over it that cut off the mountains. We crossed the river and I saw that it was running high. It had been raining in the mountains.\\"This scene is clear without any unnecessary grandiose filler. The writing is hard-hitting and to the point which seems to mirror what the character Fred would have been feeling at the moment. At this point in the novel, Fred is returning to the front and leaving his love behind. Flowery poetic adjectives in the writing would have been terribly out of place.Another aspect of this novel that was truly impressive was the character development in contrast to the war raging on everywhere. Fred and Catherine focus on hotels, food and what drinks are available, without much conversation and thought really given to the war at all. This irony is summed up in one of my favorite sentences in the book when in Chapter XXXVIII Fred muses, \\"The war seemed as far away as the football games of some one else's college.\\""},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Not my favorite Hemingway.

There are some periods of the novel where it tends to drag; however, most of the plot and descriptions are enough to get over the &quot;slow&quot; periods of the novel. Hemingway, as he often does in his novels, explores the theme of masculinity through the actions of the male characters, most specifically Lt. Henry.I found that what makes this novel a classic is the richness of Hemingway's characterization: how well his characters are developed. The reality of war is brought to life in Hemingway's words, and we see Henry's struggle to maintain a positive outlook on life and love while the horror of war is displayed.I felt this was a good novel for someone with an appreciation for Hemingway's novels; others may choose to begin by reading one of Hemingway's short stories before working up to this novel. At any rate, I hope you enjoy it."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Many people tend to think that &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; is an American Classic. I disagree; in order to be a great American novel, a book should represent the American dream. Instead, the main character, Frederic Henry, is a soldier in Italy during WWI who does nothing the American Armed Forces stand for. He is wounded while eating a bowl of macaroni - and receives a Medal of Valor for it - and eventually deserts his regiment in order to run off to Switzerland with his nurse.This book says a lot more than what's on its pages. Many people will toss &quot;Farewell&quot; aside, thinking the simplistic language will lack intellectual value. However, a book does not need big words to have substance. Hemingway creates very powerful messages and themes in the text by forcing the reader construct them himself. He supplies the reader with dialogue and actions, and assumes he will discover the meaning.Though not an American Classic, &quot;Farewell to Arms&quot; is well worth reading. A love story drives the book forward while Hemingway effortlessly shares his insight into the life of a soldier and explains why &quot;everybody hates war.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Ernest Hemingway is one of the worlds greatest writers, his books are powerfully and thoughtfully written. A Farewell to Arms is a perfect example of this, his ideas on subjects like love, war, and desertion leap from the page into the readers head. However sometimes his writting can be confusing to the reader, he jumps from place to place thought to thought, idea to idea very quickly, and almost too quickly.By the end of the book there are so many thoughts in your head that you, the reader, start to get confused. I can not tell if Hemingway supports war or hates it. Does he believe in love or think it a weakness of man? To add on to this confusing base there is the abrupt ending to which he gives the book. There is no resolution to the main charecters problems, they only compound at the end of the book. This is what I feel was the main flaw with A Farewell to Arms. There was no ending, I enjoyed the book very much but I wanted some sort of resolution in the end. It almost would have been better if Henery had ended up dying as well. At least then it would be a true tragedy, and not only a sad quickly ended book."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I feel that A Farewell to Arms is a very excellently written book, and it certainly brings up many points to be considered and reflected upon.The passage that most illustrates the central theme in the book is on page 327, and says \\"But they killed you in the end. You could count on that. Stay around and they would kill you.\\"This passage, though brought up towards the end of the book, is in action throughout the story. Rinaldi, Aymo, Henry's child, and finally Catherine. All these people were victims of the story, and had no power to stop what was to befall them."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Often times an author wishes to connect his readers to his characters and envelope the reader into the book making her unable to put the book down. I didnt get this here. I thought that Hemmingway did an excellent job in setting up the story line. However, I was not involved enough in the thoughts and expressions of his characters.The book was exceptionally well written as for its historical content and knowledge of Europe. It brings the country-side into the thoughts of the reader but I had trouble feeling the life and animations of the characters."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I thought this was a very good book. The quick and to the point prose made it easy to read while the dialog was excellent and plentiful. I don't typically give a book 5 stars just because it's considered a classic, but I thought this was very good. The setting is mainly in Italy during World War I. The main characters are Lieutenant Henry, an American ambulance driver in the Italian army and Catherine Berkley, an English Nurse who fall in love. Although this book has a love story as a central theme, it isn't the type that makes me want to retch. It's about people during WWI who happen to fall in love. It goes into philosophical detail on both war and love and the interesting juxtaposition love and war are."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"After having sampled Hemingway's book of short stories, I felt well prepared to take on one of his most famous tales. The story and the way it was told served as an impetus for everlasting change in my opinions, my values, and my style of writing. Hemingway's characters are so simple that they demand scrutinization. His story line so basic, that it defies the events occuring around his characters.A fantastic book, A Farewell to Arms is a must read."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"The book A Farewell to Arms by Earnest Hemingway was one of the most romantic realistic novels that i have ever read. The fact that the story takes place during World War One gives the reader lots of interesting facts. The details that Earnest Hemingway provided made it much easier to picture everything that was going on in the book at that time in your head as you are reading it. And then the love story between the two main charachters is timeless and irressistable. I deffinutly give this book two BIG thumbs up. Its a must read.

All in all I had no problems at all reading this book."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This is an excellent book. Frederick Henry struggles against war and its consumption of everyone and everything. Takes look into religion in war times. Hemingway looks into setting in great detail making you feel like you were there. Definately a book to read by in my opinion the greatest of American authors!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This book, in my opinion is the best work of Ernest Hemingway. It is about an American ambulance driver on the Italian front and his love for a British nurse. One reason I liked this book so much is because Hemingway creates pictures in your mind of &quot;the front&quot; with the words he uses so it feels like you are there taking part in the sotry. He is like a painter, painting pictures in your mind as if you are watching what is happening. I would highly recommend this to people who like romance stories and World War I history. My favorite part is the German attack on Caporetto, it was descriptive and suspenseful. It is a classic that you shouldn't miss out on."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingways A Farewell to Arms is one of the best books I have ever read.

When I first heard about Hemingway, I thought he was supposed to be great. This book was very boring and slow. I thought the characters could have been better. The ending was tragic at the end.

What I got instead was a bumpy ride. I'm not saying A Farewell to Arms was an awful novel, far from it in fact, but I expected so much more from one of America's &quot;great&quot; writers. First off, the dialogue was absolutely appalling - it was stilted, bland and uninteresting. The only reason why I became interested in reading a Hemingway novel in the first place was because some internet-goer praised Hemingway's ear for dialogue. The fool! What planet does he come from, I wonder? If you like great dialogue, read a John Steinbeck novel, watch a Billy Wilder film or see a Tennessee William's play, but what ever you do, don't bother looking in Hemingway's direction.Having said all that, there's much to admire in this book; for one, I enjoyed Hemingway's writing style, it's often elegant and poetic, not to mention his tactile sense is quite startling at times, but I think that comes from having been immersed in the horrors of war.If you're looking for a great novel, do yourself a favour and read John Steinbeck's GRAPES OF WRATH, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I bought this book because I read somewhere that it's considered a \\"great American novel\\". While I haven't completed it ... I have to say I'm a bit indifferent about it. It's OK. So, I'd give it the label \\"OK American novel\\". My review is greatly influenced by Hemingway's annoying use of paragraph-long, run-on sentences. In many cases, they don't even make sense. By the time a get to the end of these sentences, I've lost track of what he's talking about. It almost made me give up on the book during the first chapter."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingway is supposed to be one of the greatest authors of the 21st century, right? I read A Farewell to Arms this summer, and I thought it had to be one of the worst books I've ever read, and that's saying quite a bit. His brief descriptions and simple dialogue bored me. And his description of love! It wasn't love, it was sex. Clearly written from an immoral man's perspective, it was impossible for me to relate to the characters. And the ending, well, it was just stupid. There was no lesson to be learned, no happy ending, nothing that makes a great book great. The entire focus of the book was one man's unrelenting self-pity that eventually cost him everything he held dear."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I heard Hemingway is great so I read this book. In reality what I found out was that Hemingway was depressed. This book is nothing more than the tale of an alcoholic who's disease leads himself and others to destruction. The only amazing fact is that the war doesn't't get him first. In reality, it seemed the war had little affect on him. It was his own selfishness that did him in."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Shmoopy this. Shmoopy that. Too much shmoopy business. (Pages and pages of it.) Less shmoopy, less drinking det&agrave;ils and more gore, then I'd give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Seriously. It's his legs the main character almost has blown off, not his arms.All right, j/k, on with the review. Honestly, though, I read this book in school and I have to say that Hemingway's style of writing is not my cup of tea. The run-on sentences with overly simple wording felt to me either not challenging enough, or just not great writing. To be perfectly honest, the only part of this book I enjoyed at all was the ending, because it was the only piece in which I felt strong emotion. The loss of Catherine, and the man's thoughts and feelings directly before it, definitely intrigued me more than anything else in the book. Perhaps it's war stories, and not necessarily the particular author, that aren't my thing. Then again, I know that I can greatly enjoy a war story, so I'm tempted to think that I'm not big on Hemingway. Either way, \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" is not exactly what I consider a literary masterpiece and was one of my less favorite reads. Therefore, I can't personally recommend it; however, it's not completely horrible and I can understand where other people would not find it boring in the least. Clearly many such readers have made it as well-known as it is."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingway should have stuck to journalism. his novels read like depressing grocery lists.

This book has an interesting story line, and charachters you can't help but like. Unfortunately, however, this book is just not very well written. It is extremely choppy, and even contains blatant gramatical mistakes, Hemingway apparently never learned about subject-verb agreement. This book is very interesting, but would be much more enjoyable if it was written more smoothly."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Our book club wanted to read this as our &#34;Classics&#34; book this year. Hemingway is considered an American iconic writer and based on critics they thought this his best writing. We were not impressed. To many repetitive lines, boring and dull were some of the comments! And they found the main character to narcissistic. We're wondering if we shouldn't have picked A Sun Also Rises instead."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Boring, boring.

Luckily I was on a plain and had nothing else to distract me or I probably would have put it down. There are several points where I felt like he was writing just to keep writing, and not for any grand purpose in the book.

I would recommend this novel to those who enjoy reading \\"cheesy\\" romance novels. I would also recommend reading this novel if you enjoy reading novels about war.Ernest Hemingway is a very blunt writer; he takes no time to get to the point. It is the biggest weakness of this novel. Because of his bluntness it portrays the characters in a negative manner. \\"...You are a dear. I'd be glad to kiss you if you don't mind.\\"........ \\"I looked in her eyes and put my arm around her as I had before and kissed her......\\" (page 27).Ernest Hemingway also has the characters jumping into situations that would normally not occur or be said in that situation, in real life situations. For instance on page 30 approximately 3-4 days after Lieutenant Henry met Nurse Barkley he said this, \\"This is the third day. But I'm back now.\\".... \\"She looked at me, and you do love me?\\"...... \\"Yes.\\" These few lines shared between Lieutenant Henry and Nurse Barkley are just a few examples of many \\"cheesy\\" lines throughout the novel.On the other hand this novel has a strong and structured plot sequence, which is a strength. Not many novels can weave war, disaster, and love together in such a fantastic way.Although this novel was a bit \\"cheesy\\" it was worth reading. I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to those who enjoy reading \\"cheesy\\" romance novels. I would also recommend reading this novel if you enjoy reading novels about war."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This book really shows you what true love can to do somebody. Henry used to go out with many girls, but after he met the english nurse, he could not think of anyone else. When he is injured, all he wants is to do is talk and spend time with the nurse. When Henry is taken into custody, he breaks free and immediatetly goes to the nurse. I believe that his love for that nurse kept him going through the rough times."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"One of the greatest novels ever written by one of the finest novelists of all time. Ernest Hemingway was a master."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"When I first started reading this book, a couple of people told me how Hemingway's works did not interest them, or how they weren't his &quot;biggest fan.&quot; But I held my own opinion on this piece of literature and found that I was held in throughout the novel.I cannot say that I am appealed to the books that are in the War time setting. But &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; holds the war setting in sunch an interesting manner, I couldn't resist but be entertained. Ernest Hemingway was capable of this because his life reflects in the novel. Hemingway used his World War I experiences and literally gave them to a character in which the only difference between the two, was the name.The book, &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;, is highly reccomended by myself because of the ideas of life I got from this book. I know that even if the reader doesn't get entertained by the book, their focus on what happens outside of the wartime battle will be newly-formed or changed."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"~In Ernest Hemingway~{!/~}s A Farewell to Arms, Frederic Henry is an American ambulance driver who works in the Italian army.

Catherine is nothing short of the epitome of what every man wants in a woman. Of all the books I've read, this is the only one that brought me to a point of frustration and sadness I have never felt before. To be honest, the book's finale so upset me that I actually, involuntarily smashed myself in the forehead with the closed volume"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms is Hemingway's masterpiece about WWII where an Italian soldier finds love overseas in Europe. Henry, the main character, is an American serving in the Italian Army. One of his good friends, who also is a soldier, introduces him to a girl named Catherine Berkley. Catherine is one of the most beautiful women that Henry has ever laid eyes on, and they fall in love. Henry gets wounded in action and has to stay at a hospital for a few months. Catherine is a nurse, so she transfered to a new hospital so she could be with Henry. I really enjoyed reading about their experiences in the hospital. Henry wasn't able to do a whole lot, but since Catherine was a nurse, she could put him in a wheel chair and take him out on a walk so he could get some fresh air. Other parts of this novel that I enjoyed were when Henry and the other soldiers waste time in their bunkhouse. The time they spent over in Europe was spent either drinking or fighting. Usually they were doing more drinking than fighting, however, and that made the novel interesting. If you're looking for a hardcore war novel that goes in depth with blood and gore, this probably isn't what you're looking for. If you're interested in reading a story of romance with a war in the middle, then I suggest you read this. I love how Hemingway writes and have read a few other of his works. If you enjoy any of his other famous novels, then you should definitely try this one. It wasn't too tough a read, and it's not that long either. The novel caught my attention right away, and I couldn't put it down. I would rate it 4 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Ernest Hemingway's novel, A Farewell to Arms is one of the best books I have ever read. It is also one of the worst. Hemingway's style of writing is so beautiful and almost poetic. The book is simple to understand, but it's message of hopelessness lingered after I had finished the book. Hemingway paints the beautiful and horrific picture of WWI in Italy. I loved the romance between Lieutenant Henry and Catherine. They had so many obstacles to overcome and in the process, Henry deserts the army and Catherine becomes pregnant. I hate that their final obstacle, the pregnancy, proves fatal for both the baby and for Catherine. The book had seemed so uplifting, surrounding the love story of course, and then Henry's world is dashed away. The war setting even puts a grimmer atmosphere on the book. I feel for Hemingway after reading this book. He seemed like a desperate man who had lost all his hope in the war. I know in true life he had an affair with a nurse during the war and Henry's loss in the book is symbolic of Hemingway's own loss. All in all, the book is an excellent masterpiece, more than I hoped for and yet sadder than I thought."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This book has its goods and bads. The good thing of this book is that Hemingway makes it what it is by incorporating the dramatic dealings with love and war into it. I don't think that anybody could of told his story any better since love and war together can be pretty tough topics. Anyways, Hemingway shows how WWI is by giving the reader an up close view on what is happening either with the war as a whole or with Henry. Hemingways also displays the powers of love one can have for another and how they can consume one. The bad thing of this book, though, is in the end Henry ends up like he was before he ever met Catherine. But hey, what can you say. Some stories have to end bad while really to come to think of it, still making the book interesting.The main character, Henry, is in an American who is an ambulance driver for the side of Italy during WWI. After a while of going through the hardships of war he realizes that war itself is not a game and believes that he is in the wrong place. While out on a run Henry's leg get injured by a mind so he goes to a hospital and recooperates from his surgery. During that time he meets a British nurse and immediatly falls in love. Henry months later goes back to the war, and decides to runaway and come back to the one he loves because his love for Catherine is so great, and he knows it is the same for her. Plus, he knows she is pregnant, which makes him want to be there to comfort her in anyway. They somehow meet up and make the decision to escape the surroundings they are in. Although, that is not the whole ending, the reader will have to read what else happens to find out for themselves. Surely one will be shocked hungry for more to read towards the end.The book is very good, don't get me wrong. I just wish and I am sure others wish that there could have been a happier ending, rather than what it was. I believe that if you are a reader looking for a good love story with a little war in the mix its for you but otherwise I wouldn't suggest one to read it just to read it."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingway's book is not what I expected. I didn't like his writing style, I didn't develop a strong attachment to the characters, his book definitely lacked fluency, and there was only a modicum of interpersonal conviction among the characters. The only real saving grace for this novel was its semi-realistic qualities concerning the nature of war and the normative tragedies of life itself. To save time, I'd recommend renting the movie instead......"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"An incredible story with some moving imagery, particularly of the retreat. Descriptions of the chaos, despair and the ebbing belief of the troops are particularly compelling. The dialogue was the problem, boring in the extreme and so unrealistic (unless conversation was really that different then)- It could have been amazing, but in the end it was a relief to finish the last page!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingway's &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; is about a love affair between a man and a woman, and a love affair between a man and a war. Only someone like Hemingway would be able to find the right notes to combine these two contrasting themes in a sort of literary harmony, where each complements and augments the emotional force of the other, without resorting to contrived romantic overkill.The novel takes place in the last years of World War I, in which an American named Frederick Henry is serving as an ambulance driver in the Italian army. He meets and falls in love with an English nurse named Catherine Barkley; after he is badly injured in a mortar shell attack, he and Catherine consummate their love while he convalesces in a hospital in Milan. Using his trademark sharp dialogue, Hemingway shows how the presence of war in Henry's and Catherine's lives intensifies the rapid development of their relationship.When a crabby hospital superintendent suspects Henry is idly prolonging his convalescence, she gets him sent back to his ambulance post at the front. On his way to a battle ground to pick up wounded, he is arrested by Italian battle police who hear his foreign accent and think he is a German soldier disguised in an Italian uniform. He manages a daring escape and goes to a town where he finds Catherine again. When he is alerted that the Italian army is looking to arrest him for desertion, he realizes his only option is to escape to Switzerland under cover of night.The notion I get about Hemingway's writing of war is that, to him, it's a sport, a big game, that accepts physical suffering as a fair price to pay for the camaraderie and adventure; a game in which victories are celebrated with a lot of drinking, and losses are mourned with...a lot of drinking. This is not a criticism, just an observation; he writes with so much spirit and conviction on the subject of war that it's difficult to find fault with his style. This is exemplified most in Henry's decision at the end of the novel: At just a time when his life seems to be falling apart, he realizes he must &quot;get back&quot; to the war, not because he likes war, but because it gives him a will to live; it's in his blood as much as it sheds his blood."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"It wasn't too bad for a book I had to read for school but it lacked the reality of All Quiet on the Western Front and Henry didn't seem to accomplish anything through the story."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Here's another one of those books, like As I Lay Dying, that high school English teachers force upon teenagers. Sorry, kids, you're not ready for it yet. Wait a few years and try again."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I did not like \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" when I read it many years ago, when I was in my 20s, about the same age as Frederic and Catherine. At the time I found the two main characters off-putting. But, now in my 60s, I thought I should give it another try, since the novel is so highly regarded, since it is considered a \\"classic,\\" and since Hemingway won the Nobel Prize. This second reading and reconsideration have not changed my opinion. The dialogue is tedious and stilted, and there is far too much of it. And I wonder if anyone has counted up the number of times \\"darling\\" occurs in the text. Frederic is a shallow young man, with too much money, too little direction, no ambition, insecure, self-absorbed, and lacking in character. Catherine is giddy, flighty, and Frederic's equal in shallowness. The descriptive sections dealing with World War I in the Italian theater, and the dialogue which accompanies those sections, are well done, but they are sandwiched between longer sections dealing with the romance between the protagonists: and here the novel is more a lust story than a love story, as Frederic and Catherine come off as hormonally driven adolescents rather than as two individuals for whom World War I and their experiences as ambulance driver and nurse might have led to a measure of maturity. Neither is likeable, and while the denouement strives for tragedy, it achieves only bathos."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I can not understand how this has made it to so many top book lists. It was like reading catch 22 without the catch. I had the constant urge to skim the pages and be confident that I would not miss out on any important dialogue that would not be repeated again on another page or not be repeated on another page again. The love story conveyed love as well as a paper cut out conveys the moon."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I'd rather read tea leaves than ever read this book again. It's like smelly socks, sweat, and beer-stained undershirts: men stuff. A pre-schooler could entertain and enlighten me more than this goof Hemingway. Bitter men will enjoy it.

Honestly!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I find this book a difficult one to review. While the story itself isn't the most exciting, engaging, or fun to read, this is undoubtedly an excellent example of the literary skill of one of America's best known and well respected authors. Hemingway's sublime style of bare-bones, almost flat seeming, prose is able to evoke surprisingly powerful images and emotion. Certainly not flowery, with hardly an adjective to be found, it is nonetheless effective.In A FAREWELL TO ARMS, Frederic Henry (the narrator) takes you through a difficult and life-changing time of his life. A rather cold seeming young man, the musings of Henry present a very interesting glimpse into Hemingway's view of a young man's psyche. As you experience Henry's adventures in war and love, you come to see the brutality and unfairness experienced by so many during times like the ones described. While Henry himself seems quite distant and unemotional throughout most of the book, the reader really comes to empathize with the young man and while they may imagine themselves acting and thinking differently, sympathize with him.The tragic experience of Henry and Cat's love is at once intensely emotional and strangely shallow. Watching as true love develops in Henry is a great experience, while seeing his unthinking readiness to be untruthful (to himself and to Cat) is rather disturbing. The whole story is a very thought provoking and fascinating look into our emotions, the meaning of love and of life.Highly recommended for anyone interested in Hemingway, not for those looking for a thrill ride."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This is my second shot at Hemingway, having recently read The Sun Also Rises. Interestingly enough, I found the two reading experiences almost identical. As was the case with \\"Sun\\", I was initially underwhelmed, but around midway through the book, felt myself drawn into the story and by the end, was reluctant to put the book down.Hemingway certainly has his own signature style. Clipped, terse, single sentence dialogue that at times borders on the absurd. Perhaps it is the act of becoming comfortable and familiar with the style that results in his works starting slow and building to a strong finish, because at its root, this is simply a magnificent story, built upon a singular historical event. It was Hemingway's own experience as a stretcher bearer on the Austro-Italian front that provided the motivation and basis for the story.I've seen some label this an anti-war novel, but I simply don't see it. It is anti-war to the extent that it doesn't glorify the act of war, but it is not political. The front line soldiers certainly are not pro-war, but honestly, except in the case of the odd megalomaniacs and psychopaths, given the choice most would opt for peace. At its root, this is a love story set amid extremely difficult and trying circumstances. Finally, as with much of Hemingway, don't expect a happy ending."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Every once in a while you read a novel so supreme in the handling of its subject, that you can only read in awe as it unfolds. This is an anti-war book unlike any anti-war book I've ever read. This is because it's not even really about war, it's about a love affair between a soldier and a nurse. And as the book proceeds the reader will shown that even the subject of the book is not what it appears, there is something deeper still. Truly remarkable and an absolute must read."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"War is an absurd and random presence in the life of Frederick Henry, an American lieutenant of the Italian army. His silver medal, which Fred did not really want, will always remind him that he was wounded by an enemy mortar while chasing fistfuls of pasta with bad wine. An ill-informed hospital barber, who appeared in Fred's life for a few minutes to give him a shave, is ready to slit his throat, having mistaken him for an enemy officer. A friend of Fred's, a few yards away from him, gets killed, by their own troops that are retreating, scared, and shooting at anything that moves. When Fred meets the battle police, without much deliberation they are preparing to execute him, having mistaken him for an officer who abandoned his troops. He narrowly escapes execution and deserts. The only war dividend - the love affair between Fred and Cat - is short-lived: their son is stillborn and Cat dies in childbirth. There is nothing good about this war.Fred Henry is a signature, recognizable Hemingway character: with a double-masculine name (as is, for example, Robert Jordan in \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" or Harry Morgan in \\"To Have and Have Not\\"), without much of a past or any discernable future, in a position of some authority, in love, with a loving woman by his side. As is customary for Hemingway's male protagonists, every few pages Fred has a drink.In a typical Hemingway style, much dialog brings out vivid portraits of the main characters. Perhaps this is why, next to them, this war seems so inhuman."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This is probably the most realistic book I've read so far. Hemingway's style is very simplistic and here he digs into the trenches of war, the people who figght it, and the reality of life.The dialogue between the American soldier who is fighting in the Italian army and the British nurse on the Italian front is borderline silly but I guess this is Hemingway's best portrayel of life and love.A great book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms is a beautiful war-romance. Ernest Hemingway's style uses short sentences. These are very effective. Okay, I was trying to write this review in his style, but I simply can't. While I often write long, Conradian sentences, I can't help but envy Hemingway's terse prose, his beautiful simplicity. Females tend to shy away from Hemingway's hyper-masculine, tortured heroes and idealized heroines because they seem chauvenistic, but this is a fantastic romance set against the Great War. Hemingway's style is easy to read and this novel is very powerful."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Wars never make sense. Neither does an American ambulance driver for the Italian army during WWI. Hemingway can somehow make sense of it all and turn it into a classic piece.There is something really bizarre going on with this book. I believe it's the flat tone that the narrator tells the story with. It's all flat, whether he's telling about a meal being shared between war comrades, people getting blown to pieces, or pillow talk with his sweetheart. It's cool, calm, and calculated. The dynamics between the troubled era of the Great War and the self-control our hero exercises make this story a great read.I must admit that I hate romance in wartime plots, but this one is an exception. The love story between Henry (narrator) and Catherine a Scottish nurse is done in great taste and the whole novel revolves around it. This reinforces the idea that human beings will try to find affection regardless of the turbulent times.Henry's relationships with his friends, estranged family members, and other eccentric Italian or Swiss characters add to the main plot. The whole story is solid and when you finish reading it you will feel a sense of personal enrichment."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"The best of Hemingwayis in his stories.All his novels tend to sentimentality.The old saw about Hemingway not being able to create a fully credible female character has I believe something in it. Here too there is something very artificial mannered , cliche-like about the romance. In the stories Hemingway seems more authentic, and in the novels he often seems to be parodying himself. The characters are somehow not credible True the painful ending does move . The famous line ' A man should find things that he cannot lose' does send a shudder down the spine."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Many of you won't know this, but Hemingway changed the ending of A Farewell To Arms thirdy-seven times. It was the novel he spent the most time and energy on, and the result is fabulous. Just the first two pages of prose must've taken him ages. It's so beautiful. I'm not going to describe to plot. You'll read it somewhere along the line. Just one thought - I'm dissapointed at some of the reviews this novel has received up to this point. I really am. This is by far his best work. I know that taste differ, but only to a degree I might add. Trueart doesn't come from the level of enjoyment you've received from it, but from the way it moulds and shapes your various thoughts and perspectives. This is Hemingway as an artist, before he became famous and later more commercial. (and later suicidal) I would like to ask reviewers who duped A Farewell To Arms to read it it again with a bit more care this time. Maybe you'll see what the rest of us are seeing - a great work of American literature."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Ernest Hemingway has done it again with an excellent book. A Farewell to Arms is perhaps Hemingway's greatest work. The book follows the events concerning Henry, a young man who volunteered to work for the Italian army. But when he discovers his true love, he faces a major decision that could radically change the course of his life. The character development is second-to-none, and Hemingway used his signature style of the book, anti-climatic situations. One of my favorite parts of the book is the anti-climatic end of the third and most climatic part of the book, where the main character is laying down in as a stowaway in a train compartment. (Don't worry, I didn't give anything away). The only flaw of the book was that it was very difficult to understand the hidden symbolism mentioned in the book. I probably would not have realized many of the hidden symbolic pieces without reading Cliff's Notes. I surely recommend the book; yet there is a reading enhancement and a much deeper understanding of the book when read with Cliff's Notes."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I read this because I had not read any Hemingway to date. I was quite surprised at how modern it was, despite being written eighty years ago. It is a story of a man fighting for a country not his own, alternatively torn by idealism and selfishness. He becomes involved with a woman, eventually they escape to neutral territory and there's a melodramatic ending.In general I thought his descriptions of place - the first scenes are of the countryside disturbed by armies marching through - were compelling. His descriptions of people are not quite so vivid, although it is possible to imagine the rough and raw nature of army life - boredom, gore and terror- from his dialogue. I thought his description of the relationship, while initially promising, degenerated into conventional pretty quickly. The initial courtship seemed to have the right mix of pretence and ambivalence, but later on it seemed to be one dimensional.Overall quite a surprising book, however I suspect not his best."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Ernest Hemingway's &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; is certainly a landmark in the genre of war fiction. The novel tells the story of Frederic Henry, an American who serves in the Italian army ambulance corps during World War I. He falls in love with Catherine Barkley, a British nurse, and has a number of traumatic experiences.&quot;Farewell&quot; has a somber, haunting, and quietly compelling feel to it. In its ironic, naturalistic, and decidedly nonheroic presentation of war, the book seems like a fitting companion text to &quot;The Red Badge of Courage,&quot; another key American novel of war.Many of Hemingway's characters in this book express a dissatisfaction with or alienation from traditional notions of religion, morality, and heroism. Their outlooks are often darkly cynical, as exemplified by this quote: &quot;The world [...] kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.&quot; In the midst of war, however, love between two individuals remains a powerful force.There are a number of compelling secondary characters: Rinaldi, Henry's irreverent comrade; the young priest who champions &quot;traditional&quot; values; and more. As additional companion texts to this book, I would recommend Joseph Plumb Martin's memoir &quot;A Narrative of a Revolutionary Soldier&quot; and James Michener's Korean War novel &quot;The Bridges at Toko-Ri.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This is a great novel, a masterpiece, and part of the enjoyment is the drama; so, I have not described the plot elements and those should be left as surprises for the reader.I had read \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Hemingway and was reading an essay by Raymond Chandler, the famous detective writer and screenplay writer of the 1930s through to the 1950s. He made the comment in his essay on writing that \\"Farewell to Arms\\" set the standard for twentieth century fiction. With that encouragement I bought the book, read it, then ran out and bought most of Hemingway's other novels and a collection of his short stories. This novel from 1929 is his best work, and perhaps \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" would be his second best novel. Some of his other works such as \\"Sun Also Rises\\" does not have the depth and balance of the present work. This is Hemingway's best with a good balance of prose, story, characters, drama, and length.The Bloomsbury Guide has picked 375 top fiction authors, and among those 375 has picked 40 \\"masterpieces\\" and they include the present work. Hemingway's contemporary, F. Scott Fitzgerald did not have any of his novels among the top 40, and there is only a select group of American writers in the Bloomsbury guide - which includes all writers. Other masterpieces include Flaubert's \\"Madame Bovary,\\" Lawrence's \\"Sons and Lovers,\\" Tolstoys's \\"War and Piece\\" and Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" - as a sample.The story is based roughly on his own war experiences in Italy during the First World War. He was a reporter, then went into the ambulance corps in Italy, became wounded and was hospitalized as in the novel. The novel is more complex than his own experiences, and has much drama in later sections. It is written in the first person narrative. The protagonist is Frederic Henry, an American. He has a roommate, Rinaldi, who is an Italian surgeon and he meets an English nurse, Catherine Barkley.The prose is simply outstanding, and the opening of the book is unforgettable:\\"In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. In the bed of the river there were some pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels. Troops went by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the trees. The trunk of the tress were dusty and the leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops marching along the road and the dust rising and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling and the soldiers marching and afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves.\\"Part of the fun reading the book is the plot and I would avoid knowing any more than that until you read the book. The prose is exceptional and on par with Fitzgerald, Henry James, Bellow, and similar writers. The opening scenes, and then later in the book, a boat trip on a Swiss lake are among the finest writing that I have ever read.5 Star masterpiece."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"What can one say about Hemingway that has not already been said? His writing makes a person feel alive, or sometimes it makes one realize that there is so much in this world and you should not let life pass you by without participating in it.Hemingway wastes very few words. The story marches along with the unrelenting cadence of an infantry moving along a country road. Also, Hemingway has an uncanny, nearly unmatched ability to put the reader into each scene with the characters.Those who criticize this book either read it too quickly or prefer movies to literature. Though the dialogue may coerce one to read quickly, his writing is truly something to be slowly savored, not rushed through in a day or two. Read a few chapters at a time then relax and let what you've read sink in and take root. It is truly amazing stuff and it will leave you breathless if you only take the time to enjoy it.The criticism of the characters is unjust. Sure some of the characters behave strangely at times, but they behaviour is consistent. Their behaviour is a flaw in their personality, not a flaw in Papa's writing. We all know strange people; that strange people show up in literature is only natural."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Ernest Hemingway is a very \\"black or white\\" sort of author. Most people either hate him, or they love him. I am one of the few who finds some work mediocre, and other amazing.The thing about \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" is that it's a bit of a strange story. It's got some really good parts, it's well written, and the plot is rather interesting. Unfortunately, the plot is not superb and in addition to good parts there are also many annoying, tedious parts. While Hemingway sticks to his nice writing style, the plot here is just a little weak. Even his typical love story is kind of boring.It all depends on what you think of Hemingway. If you love Hemingway and his wartime stories with some random love it in, then you'll still probably enjoy \\"A Farewell to Arms\\". If you don't particularly like Hemingway then you probably shouldn't read this book. It would sort of be a waste of time.If you've never read Hemingway before and you're looking for somewhere to start, go for \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\". From there on you can decide which category you fall into. But don't start with \\"A Farewell to Arms\\", as it is not Hemingway's best."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Ok, I tried to like this book, I really did. But it just didn't do it for me.I had always considered Hemingway as somewhat overrated but I hadn't really given him a fair shot. Then I read A Moveable Feast which I really really liked so I thought, \\"Oh, I was being too judgemental in my 'youth' (14 y.o.)\\" so I picked up A Farewell to Arms and with a really positive attitude.At first I really liked it but the middle third I found so boring and overly detailed with things about the war and the clothes and what they ate and every inch they moved--things that didn't interest me and that I really didn't need to know. Then, while Hemingway puts so much energy into that part of the book other parts like characterization are neglected. I felt really distanced from the main character and the emotions didn't really resonate with me. First of all, the love interest, Catherine I found completely banal and annoying. She doesn't seem to be realistic about anything and all she can say is \\"darling, I love you. do you love me? we should get married. I love you darling. do you love me, darling?\\" It just struck me as really pathetic and really flat as character development.Having said all this I must add that Hemingway still manages to have some beautiful passages and scenes in this book. Some statements about life and death and love come to mind which really struck me. But, the rest of it still didn't work for me.I'm sorry to anyone who loves this book; it is a classic, afterall, but it just left me flat (and bored through the middle).I still plan on reading more of Hemingway so I'll reserve final judgement but I'm beginning to think my 14 year old self wasn't so far from the mark. (Maybe A Moveable Feast was a fluke? We'll see.)"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I re-read this recently. I don't know why. I guess a friend of mind is into Hemingway. Here's what I found: this seminal work of the American 20th century fiction reads like a chick flick or soap opera, especially the rather embarrasingly overwrought last chapter."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Ernest Hemingway's \\"A Farewell to Arms\\", may still rank second to \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" as his definitive war novel, but still it should be regarded as among the greatest war novels - certainly of World War I - ever written in English. Hemingway draws on his experiences as a World War I ambulance driver to tell a compelling tale about a doomed love affair between an American ambulance driver and a British nurse at the bitterly contested Italian Front during the waning days of World War I. Hemingway's terse, yet succinct descriptions of the sights, sounds and smells of the Italian front line remain among the most compelling ever written in military fiction; only Stephen Crane's \\"The Red Badge of Courage\\" and Erich Maria Remarque's \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" (probably still the best novel about World War I written by a German ex-soldier) may offer better, more engrossing fictional depictions of the horrors of war. The swift romance between Henry and Catherine Barkley seems all too believable, as both strive to find some love and serenity amidst the brutal, unyielding clashes between the Allied (Italian and British) and Central Powers (Austria-Hungary and Germany) troops amidst the mountainous terrain of northern Italy. This engrossing tale is told succinctly through Hemingway's splendid usage of lyrical, terse prose, propelled mainly by the dialogues of the two protagonists and other supporting characters. No wonder why it is still regarded as among Hemingway's best novels."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Maybe I would have enjoyed A Farewell to Arms more if I hadn't had such high expectations. This is Hemingway afterall. But I couldn't believe the dialogue. At first I thought it was awkward because Hemingway was literally translating Italian phrases into English (which was easy for me to notice having studied Italian for several years). But it eventually became apparent that this was not always the case. The characters' speech seemed fake throughout the novel, thus making the characters hard to believe.If you're like me and sad endings ruin a book for you, don't read A Farewell to Arms. The romantic sections when Frederic and Catherine were together were wonderful. But the tragic ending lead me to want to create a different one for myself. Then there were the chapters describing the war which seemed to drag on at times. I found myself continuing to read just to get to the parts where Frederic and Catherine reunite.It had it's moments, but I don't think it was consistently great."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Going through my bookshelf I picked out a &quot;A farewell to Arms&quot; both knowing nothing of the work and having great expectations because of its association with a Nobel-prize winning laureate.The work is a conflation of disappointment and incredulity. Throughout the novel I was put off by its eminently childish writing style with simplistic vocabulary and dialogue. I was turned off by the lack of an overarching or significant plot. I was disappointed that the novel didn't reveal great insights into the characters it portrayed. And, simultaneously, it serves no value as a document of the War.But, the magic, grace and ephemeral quality that one derives from the brilliance of the special moments in the book are not to be dismissed. Make no mistake about it, &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; is an easy book to read - it's short, simple and eminently readable. But, the magic of the work comes together at the end. It comes together with brilliant use of foreshadowing. It comes together in that it displays more about the reader's interest in character, reveals more about the reader's clich&eacute;d expectations of what a novel is &lt;i&gt;supposed to be&lt;/i&gt;.And in that it succeeds, admirably."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I'm a tough sell on the romances and the historical aspect of this story didn't really win me over either, though it was my first and (so far) only Hemingway, maybe it was just that this story has been reworked so often?

This is a hard book to put down."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Ernest Hemingway writes a great story about love and war. It takes place durring World War 1, about a young man named Frederic Henry. Frederic is an American citizen who is serving in the Italian army. While he is near the Austria-Hungry border he falls for a girl by the name of Catherine Barkley. Catherine is a nurse at an American hospital and when Frederic was wounded in the war he was sent to her hospital. The more time he spent there the more serious the realtionship gets. When he was healed he returns to war where things go wrong so Frederic tries to flea from the Italians in search of Catherine. The book gets better as you go on as your emotions are always changing. I recomend it to anyone who likes love stories or anything to do with war."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms was an amazing story during a terrible war. The hidden love affair between Lt. Henry and Cathrine culminated with tramatic results such as the War itself. This is a story that can not be left half finished. This is one of the great books of Ernest Hemmingway that can not be forgotten."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I enjoy this book very much. Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961) had been an ambulance driver in the Great War (1914-1918) in Europe. The book he has written benefits from his first-hand experience in its subtle understanding of human nature under duress. Henry Frederic is an American ambulance driver in the Italian Army stationed on the Austrian Frontier. Catherine Barkley is a nurse from Scotland whom he meets there. First and foremost, this is a love story between these two people. The war provides an exciting backdrop. First Henry is severely wounded by a mortar shell. The second adventure is during the retreat of the Italian army. And the last adventure is when Henry and Catherine escape from Italy to Switzerland. Humour plays an important role in coping with stress, and Hemingway has many funny moments. My favourite is when a barber mistakenly thinks that Henry is an Austrian officer. &quot;Ho ho ho,&quot; the porter laughed. &quot;He was funny. One move from you he said and he would have--&quot; he drew his forefinger across his throat. &quot;Ho ho ho,&quot; he tried to keep from laughing.&quot; If you are interested in exciting wartime love stories or Ernest Hemingway, this book will be interesting to you."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I cannot even begin to describe the feelings and emotions that filled me after reading A Farwell To Arms. Ernest Hemingway is my favourite author, and this was, I believe his best novel ever. The symbolism and forshadowing used at unbelieveable. I believe that what Hemingway was trying to portray, was the inevidable fact that Love is stillborn. War is stillborn. No matter what you do, and after all the fighting and suffering, in the end, it is dead. You are dead. I recommend this book to anyone who loves to read about war, because this book is detailed. I think the fact that Hemingway lived this life, makes it that much better. He knows."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Required high school reading 25-years ago, I found the book to have more meaning from an adult perspective.

I must pause because I've always heard mixed reviews about books written by Hemingway. Some people feel his work has no real plot, or is dated to the particular time period he writes about.I found this book developed the characters well... as long as you can through all of Hemingway's &quot;I love you more&quot; &quot;no, no, no I love you more&quot; &quot;no you don't ... do you? Tell me how much you love me&quot; &quot;will you love me forever?&quot;Once you're through all that I feel you'll have a good time with it ... besides if you don't, at least it looks good on your bookshelf.

A white page might be stained with a dried brown puddle of coffee if you accidentally spill the coffee you drink in an effort to stay awake while reading this book. The ponderous oncoming words on the seemingly endless pages of this book flow ponderously as they keep coming on each page, white page after white page of script in black ink. Coffee is good and necessary for anyone who reads this book. Coffee, good and necessary, and lots of it."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms has a sad air about it that is difficult to miss. Surely, this is not a book of triumph, or happiness, or joy. It's the melancholic yarn of a certain Captain Henry (though narrator of the story, a very quiet man) and Patricia Barkley, a nurse.Their romance seems to be altered by the war taking place. Captain Henry, an American lieutenant on the Italian front, has to choose between his lover or the inevitable war - much like something from a Richard Lovelace poem.A Farewell to Arms is not the best book there is, and it's not an edge-of-your-seat page-turner, but it is a wonderful and sad story that tells of the power that war has over a man's life, and the mercilessness of that war itself."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"One of Hemingway's best, and one of the best war/romance novels of all time. Sparse and beautiful language, great detail, vivid characters, tragic end. An excellent novel."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farwell to Arms was the first book I read from Ernest Hemingway. It seemed like a book written for a male mind. The whole book was about love and war. It was hard for me to understand because it was dull and too easy to read. I thought Hemingway chose a horrible way to end the book. After all of the love that was built up between Frederick and Catherine I thought the end was a huge disappointment."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingway obviously does not understand the true essence of a woman. His portrayal of women in this novel is completely off course. In A Farewell to Arms, Catherine is a man's perfect woman. She is obedient and willing. The other women in the novel are harsh and hateful. Hemingway's women are either one of these ways or the other; however, most real women are a combination of both. He does allow Frederick's personality to change as the story progresses though. In the novel, the main male character is dynamic and the female character is static, while in real life women are the ones more apt to change and men stay the same. A Farewell to Arms is an unnatural love story blanketed by a war tale.Despite my criticism, Hemingway is a very talented, accomplished writer. If you like war and women, definitely read this book. However, if you would rather read about life and experience or something at least partially relevant to real life and real people, do not waste your time with A Farewell to Arms."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"After horrific WWI trench warfare with Baumer in Remarque's ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT and stomach-churning imagery in such recent WWII flics as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, Hemingways F2A leaves the impression that I have been robbed of the true horror of the World Wars and spoonfed with an idealistic, glorified lovestory. Secondly, I am truly disappointed by Hemingway's lack of regard of the loss of human life in certain instances - such as the lack of compassion for Aymo's fate, no remorse after shooting the fleeting deserters, and the referral to the &quot;freshly skinned rabbit&quot; in the last chapter. Finally, the frequent alcohol abuse not only forshadows Hemingway's own professional decline but yet again emphasises his tendency to glorify evil.However, if the reader is in search of a beautifully written fictitous account of a couple's triumpth over their sadistic surroundings and their unconditional stand for each other amidst the ravages of war and wants to endulge in an excellent potrayal of beautiful pastoral Italy and become encaptured in Hemingway's unique ability to capture his readers by exceptional, well-planned, crafty wording, and can learn to tolerate such run-on sentences as this one as well as confusing dialouge, F2A is an exellent choice.I have to confess, if it had not been for the last chapter of the book, I would have given it fifteen stars out of five and would have found nothing negative to say about it. Truly great until the end! Now, I'm interested in how the OLD MAN AND THE SEA will turn out! If it ends anything like F2A, I promiss: it will burn!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I read this book in eighth grade. It's been a couple years since then, but every time I'm looking for an example of a book with terrible dialogue, I pull out &quot;A Farewell To Arms&quot;. I was actually beginning to become interested in Ernest Hemingway, but reading this book totally put me in direct opposition to him. First of all, the story is weak. Some books with weak story lines have outstanding character developement and a profound moral truth hidden in them - suffice it to say that this book has neither. All I can say is please stay away from this book... you'll glean nothing of value from it."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This book, while portraying realistic portions of World War I, seems more of an attempt to boost the author's ego than to entertain. The way he (the author) has the nurse systematically slobbering over the wounded soldier is nauseating, at times to the point where it is more rewarding to skip the entire section.

Hemingway's simple and direct prose can be decieving, because underneath there is powerful emotion. I found myself thinking about passages from the novel for days after having read it. It will make you happy, but unfortunately, it will also make you cry. The story of Henry and Catherine will grab you and not let go until the tragic end.

His combination of intensity of emotion and eloquence of language creates a story so beautiful that I do not begrudge him my tears but laud his genius in making me feel something so deeply."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I cannot believe it took me so long to get around to this book. It is phenomenal. The main story surrounds two lovers: Frederick Henry and Catherine Barkley. Much of the book takes place in World War I in Italy.

I closed this book and had to take a couple moments of silence. Hemingway just left me to face the death on my own, to come to my own conclusions about life and death. It was time for bed when I ended it but I felt instead like going out and doing something special, of savoring the moment. The next morning, I still had the character's death on my mind and I had to cope with that on my own."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I just read this book for the first time in my college Humanities class and I loved the mix of humor and seriousness that Hemingway mixes so well. My favorite line was, &quot;I was blown up...eating cheese.&quot"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Perhaps I have an affinity for Hemmingway that prevents me from giving this book the three stars it probably deserves, but there were extraordinary moments of literary greatness in this book. I think the reason this book catches a lot more flak than some of his others is because of the subtitly in which he delivers messages about life in this book and a lot of people just miss the point entirely.For those that don't know, this is a story about love and loss and the painful reality of being at war for reasons you once justified but no longer understand.However, for all the moments of greatness in this book, there is a certain lack of depth that Hemmingway creates for the main characters in the beginning of the book that continually hovers over them throughout the rest of the story. We care about what happens to the characters, but not to the extent to which I believe he intended us to care. There is this instrinsic lack of meaning and purpose behind many of their actions so that we don't understand and even care about some of the things they do.For all this book's shortcomings though, it still is a vivid, lively, and beautiful portrayal of a man coping with the harsh realities of his life that he created for himself."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I just finished reading &quot;A Farewell To Arms&quot; last night, and this was my second book by Hemingway. I am a total fan of his work! This particular story is moving and touching, and the characters have the potential to continue to haunt one's imagination.Hemingway wrote in a style that is hard to get used to. He didn't write in a way that involved a lot of over-descriptive phrases or indepth character studies. It seems he left his readers to use their imaginations and not be told every single detail of a story. For some people this works and for others it doesn't. But if it works for you, then this story will envelope you and take you to a distant time and place. Even though we are not told very much about Fred Henry and Catherine Barkley, the two seem to become very intimate and familiar. Perhaps from developing them in one's own mind.Perhaps the storyline could be considered somewhat tired. What wartime romance isn't? However, Hemingway wrote this book in the 50s, and it is easy to get the feel that he was writing about himself. (Hemingway was an ambulance driver in Italy during WWI) That touch of possibly revealing himself to the reader makes this book even more touching.I would not recommend this book if it is the first Hemingway some one is to read. Start with one of his shorter works or his short stories to get used to his style of writing. Work your way up to this book and you most likely won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I read this book when I was real little--maybe ten or eleven, or even younger--but the beauty of it has still stuck. Hemingway's style is pure and simple, but its amazing the pictures he paints with his words. The characters are more real, and more human than those conjured up by any other writer. Heminway's writing depicts life uncluttered, transcended, and purified into something clear and beautiful--yet still REAL. It's like an Ansel Adams photograph--the photo of a true master--except what's really amazing is that Heminway does it all with words (and not many of them!) Read it, if only to SEE the world in a clear focus, in a sharp directed color. I am thankful to have Farewell to Arms floating around in my memories because I have not only seen beauty, I've read it."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I finished &quot;A Farewell To Arms&quot; in two nights of reading. The story may have been a bit different than the writing I am used to reading. After understanding a little about Hemingway and realizing the trueness of the story, I can only say I am in love with his works. The beauty and simplicity of orcastrating words intertwinging love, war, and alcohol.(too much) This story has left an impression in my mind like no other. It only leaves me wanting to read and know more about Hemingway. I think he must have been the person we all know, and just did not know what they were seeing in us. He has a way of showing. It is written almost as if it were a journal. Yet, each word begging for the reader to know more!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Earnest Hemingway's, A Farewell to Arms, is a masterful novel based on war and love. The book was very well written as well as easy to read. The book is about an American ambulance driver who is battling in war and at the same time finds the love of his life. A Farewell to Arms presents realistic characters, problems, and practical motivations that one can easily relate to.To summarize the book without revealing too much about the stupendous novel, is that it is about Henry, the American ambulance driver, who finds himself in true love with a nurse, Catherine. As their love grows for one another the passion to leave the war and pursue this love also grows. The two love birds battle against injury, the enemy of war, and the tough times war presents. Their love becomes so great they decide to illegally escape the war to Switzerland where they can pursue their love for one another. The book does an excellent job presenting situations and ideas the reader can truly understand and relate to.This book is one that once you begin to read it; you refuse to put it down. I really liked and enjoyed the book because the author writes descriptive scenes of the gruesome war. He demonstrates the emotions of Henry and Catherine so well I actually felt like I was in the story. Hemingway does an excellent job in writing this novel, he shows how true love can fight and survive war, tough times, and even disease &amp; injury. This novel is one I wasn't able to put down after I began to read it. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a story of love, war, and devotion. The book shows and demonstrates how love can surpass all and survive even the harshest of times. The novel is definitely two thumbs up and one you should read."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingway is anything but a boring writer. Don't get me wrong. I LOVE stories with description. But I also like variety. That is why I chose Hemingway for once. After reading The Old Man and the Sea, I thought, hey, this guy is pretty good. He describes more than any other author I have ever experienced by locking his deeper meaning in the depths in between the lines, and you must divulge the secret to yourself.This novel is based on his life. It is mostly a romance novel. I personally, cried. I always thought men were such disgusting creatures with no feelings. But when I read this, I realized not. There are so many themes to discuss. Why did Hemingway write this? If you want to experience his beuty, read this touching love story that will make you cry and leave a stamp on your heart and brain for all eternity."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I work in the field of Leadership Development and often have to trudge through books that are about as fun to read as watching paint dry. This book was a welcome respite from the management and corporate lingo I normally have to suffer through. This book reads like a fine wine goes down, soft and smooth. Hemingway will just come out of nowhere and you think you are reading the greatest paragraph ever written. When thinking about issues such as should we go to war or not, this book deals with the pros and cons and the human toll war places on all participants. The love story between Catherine and the Lieutenant is a classic, but more so is the writing about the War.This book is a classic and can be read in one night, it is just that good. Hemingway is so simple, yet, deep, not many writers can even come close to achieving what he does in this book. I look forward to reading another Hemingway novel."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This is the first Hemingway novel that I have read, and I think it is marvelous. Despite some other reviewers' opinions, I loved the writing style and thought the story was engaging. I can't wait to continue on with other works by this author."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I found A Farewell to Arms very difficult to read all the way through. I thought this book was rather slow and jumped from thing to thing all the time. Although I did like the ending, the rest of the book just didn't seem worth it. I think it would have been better if it wasn't spread out over so many pages. If it would have been condensed then it might have gone faster. I know Hemingway is supposed to be a great author and everything but I don't think I could read another one of his novels because this one just wasn't very interesting from the very beginning. I could tell in the first couple pages that it wasn't going to keep my attention. Maybe I'll read it again in a couple years and see what I think of it then!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I read this in one sitting and found the style and story to be very gripping - Hemingway draws the reader along with his terse prose, not allowing a pause. Some here have complained about the terse dialogue, which is true, or lack of character development. I found that these criticisms lent the story a directness and Hemingway was able to strip it of all sentimentality. For me, this made the narrative more powerful. The characters tell it how it is. Highly recommended.I intend to now devour more Hemingway: next The Sun Also Rises and a Moveable Feast."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"The novel, A Farewell to Arms, was a captivating story that comprised all the key elements required in a story about love and war. The author, Ernest Hemingway, exploited many of his own experiences from World War I, and essentially based the whole novel on this familiarity. The novel's protagonist was Frederic Henry, a young American ambulance driver, who served the Italian army. The setting was the time of World War I and the Italians, allied with the British, the French, and the Americans, were fighting the war against Germany and Austria-Hungary. In the novel, Henry, who speaks Italian and English adequately, is a part of the Italian Red Cross. Even in the beginning of the novel, Henry feels detached from the war because he does not believe it has anything to do with him. Circumstances change, however, and Henry is hit in the leg by a trench mortar shell. Henry is immediately sent to an American hospital in Milan where he reunites with Catherine Barkley, an English nurse, and they fall deeply in love. Catherine becomes pregnant and soon Henry returns back to an unusually chaotic Italian front. The Italian army captures Henry and two other drivers in this uproar, but Henry makes a run for it and reunites with Catherine in Stresa. They move to Switzerland to avoid arrest from the Italians, but they enter even more trouble and tragedy when Catherine is to give birth to their child.It is clearly identifiable that Ernest Hemingway has created a masterpiece. I believed this book was an astounding novel that included the entire essence of what a novel should resemble. This novel contained solitude, love, war, happiness, and tragedy. Having been drawn largely from Hemingway's personal experiences as an American ambulance driver for Italy, this novel contained many accurate descriptions to the setting, his injury, and the atmosphere of the novel. These descriptions in the novel allowed myself to be drawn into the story and made me feel as though I was a part of Henry's life. Hemingway's comfortable style of writing also helped to reveal the sincere atmosphere that Catherine and Henry created when they were alone together. Their love was absolutely genuine and veritable. This was evident in the way they spoke to each other. At one instance in the novel, Catherine said, \\"What good would it do to marry now? We're really married. I couldn't be any more married. There isn't any me. I'm you. Don't make up a separate me.\\"(p. 107). Conversations similar to this allowed myself to understand how much they loved each other and what Henry was going through. They also showed me how strongly two individuals could love each other. The last scene of the novel was also very touching. The tragedy of Catherine dying while giving birth to her child was sad enough, but the inclusion of the scene where Henry tries to bid farewell made the novel even more depressing. In the novel, Catherine dies due to an unsuccessful Caesarian section and Henry is not by her side when she dies. He walks into the room and tries to say goodbye to his love, but cannot because he feels like he is saying goodbye to a statue. He leaves the hospital to walk back to his hotel in the rain. This scene was ingenious. It was very heartrending and displayed the significance of Catherine to Henry. These strengths made the novel an enjoyable story to read.I believed that there were not that many weaknesses to this novel. However, if I were to change one element in the story, I would have added more action. It seemed as though the war only affected Henry twice throughout the entire novel. These two occasions were when he got hit in the leg and when the battle police captured him. It seemed like the war was of no importance in the novel, and this may have been done purposely due to the title of the book. However, I feel that the book may have been even more exciting if Henry happened to get into more trouble with the war. This type of excitement could have balanced out the segments containing war and love evenly so that the reader could enjoy descriptions of both components. Other than that, I believe this novel was truly flawless in its context.I believe this novel can have a variety of people for its audience. This book is for anyone who wishes to read a good book. I recommend this novel to teachers, students, parents, and basically everyone. I believe no one should miss out on the opportunity to read the love story of Henry and Catherine. The seriousness of their relationship followed by their tragedy clearly maps out an interesting love story that may bring tears to some readers. This novel shows readers that love can heal pains from wars, but that it will never change the merciless cruelty of life. It truly is a masterpiece of a novel!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I first read A Farewell to Arms three years ago. It was the first Hemingway I'd ever read, and I fell in love with his style and stories. I have since read every novel he has written and most of his short stories, and A Farewell to Arms remains my favorite. It is a wonderfully written, beautiful story, and it evoked more emotion in me than any other book I've read. Whether it will engender the same reaction from a different reader I can't say, but it seems that A Farewell to Arms is a highly personal novel, which may or may not affect the reader deeply.I highly reccomend A Farewell to Arms, or any Hemingway for that matter, if only to get a sense of his writing and to decide whether it is for you. You may not be a Hemingway person, but you HAVE to give him a try. I hope you are able to get the same enjoyment from Hemingway as I have."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I went into this book thinking about how Ernest Hemingway is supposed to be one of the greatest writers who ever lived and set in a time period I love to read about. A Farewell to Arms was a disappointment.It wasn't all that bad, but in no way, shape or form does it reach the level of one of the all time greats! I could never get any kind of handle on Catherine. Who was she besides some sort of mindless automaton?I think what disappointed me the most is that the story of two emotionally wounded desperate people enduring and then escaping the horror of WWI has so much potential, but that potential is never fully realized."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"&quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; was my first 'Hemingway Experience,' and I hope that I have many others. His beautiful writing and the emotions evoked are so unbelievably real--one feels like he has known Frederic and Catherine his entire life. Though the novel was written long ago about an event that was even longer ago, you really feel like you were there, in spite of the fact that probably none of us today who are reading this book were in the Great War. And, make sure you have some kleenex with you, for you will cry. I will definitely be reading this one again!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Super, Super Quality, I love it!!!!

Definitely not one of my favorites."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Excellent read about the impact of war on individuals and the importance of relationship between individuals over the things we go to war about. Read this then read For Whom The Bell Tolls"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Many have shared opinion, both praise and criticism regarding this novel, right? So why read this review? Maybe it's to share a desire of encouragement, to curious readers or share insight to enlightened seasoned readers a deeper profound understanding. We share a common thread, reading Mr. Hemingway nurtures our literary awareness. His insight to connecting to the human spirit is and was a gift he shared through his work. Regardless of the opinion, reading this novel is like getting a graduate level education. Few authors of his day could demonstrate such knowledge and world view, combined with a deep understanding of nature. One may gain an appreciation for Hemingway's vast knowledge of world affairs of the day and feel the desperate struggle for the frailty of life. Many professional teachers require at least one of his novels in the curriculum to broaden a students understanding of literature. One could argue this may not be his best work, but regardless its worth a persons time. Especially if one couples the use of the internet using imagery software or maps to follow the action. Propelling the reader into a realm of understanding difficult to put into words. And for those who cannot travel, using programs like Google Earth literally flies one there were the author was describing. Oh yes, A Farewell to Arms is emotional and intense. But, the only authors that I do not recommend are ones who cannot penetrate a readers emotional or spiritual self. That really would be a waste of time!!! Good Luck and hope you grow."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I am a huge Hemingway fan and if I had to pick one Hemingway book and call it my favorite Hemingway novel this would be the one. Set mostly in Italy during WW I the book is largely biographical. Divided into five sections the book is powerful on many levels. It is both a war story (anti-war) and a great love story. I think that the chapters in Switzerland represent some of the best \\"love prose\\" ever written. His descriptions from beginning to end are magnificent. A five star American novel. Don't miss out by not reading this classic."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This is a fantastic novel that is very easy to get into. Hemmingway's short, descriptive sentences offer a style uncanny to any other's and they clash very effectively with his seemingly endless sections of solid naration between characters.The story itself is absolutely astonishing but is almost forgotten amongst the overwhelming love story between Catherine and le Tenente. I found myself, having finished the novel, looking back on what had happened to the tenente and realizing it had all passed while I was only worried about Catherine. An absolute masterpiece by Hemmingway.My only problem was that the novel was written so close to the end of WWI that Hemmingway simply assumes the reader is familiar with the geography and the history of the war. I found myself having to refer to a map periodically and looking up other WWI events on the internet as the happened in the book.None the less, this is a can't miss novel!!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Although I haven't read Hemingway in depth before, I had an idea of what to expect from this book. Actually reading it, though, surprised me. Hemingway has always been known for his compact yet descriptive writing style. He tells us what we need to know and adds enough details to paint the picture, but doesn't see any need to elaborate. The writing style alone could keep me entranced in the book, although there were times when I craved more emotion than the bare facts Hemingway presents us with.I was also intrigued by the plot. War scenes in any book tend to bore me, but these were placed carefully among Henry's interactions with Catherine, his love. The effect was one of tremendous balance. The love of the two seems quite sincere, but it is overshadowed with so much tragedy that we can't get too wrapped up in their romance.Hemingway is not one for happy endings, and he kept true to this in the book. The ending left me with an empty feeling I didn't want, but I can only suppose that's the feeling Hemingway tried to portray.I'd strongly recommend the book. It's a quick read and has the balance between love and war necessary to entrance any reader."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I was excited about reading this particular book not only because of the time period it was written during but because I simply adored the movie starring Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes. I was not disappointed by the book.The story is well developed and interesting. Some might scoff at how quickly the main characters fall in love but in the world of Hemingway's war, it makes complete sense. The two are lonely and feel that their time is short and therefore they cannot worry about details. They fall in love and let their emotions grow throughout the novel. Love in the time of war is simple because human emotions cannot exist running on only depression due to loss. The characters seek the love and compassion in each other in order to stay sane and survive. This element is left to the audience to discover; many people do not and label the relationship between Henry and Catherine as lust.The descriptions of the locations during and after the war scenes are incredible and sometimes a bit overwhelming. The concentration on simple things like wine and cheese only further illustrate the need for enjoyment in the lives of the soldiers.Although Hemingway did not always stick to this particular storyline in all of his stories, his style of writing comes through. A Farewell to Arms is a wonderful addition to the world of literature."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"For those who are starting to read this book, do not be so quick to put it down. After the first 20 some chapters the book starts to get interesting. Ernest Hemingway's story is good but not exactly classic. His potrayal of the war description is good too but not excellent. Catherine and Frederick's relationship on the other hand is very confusing. At times it seemed like she loves Frederick, and at other times it seems like she doesn't want people to know that they are together. Overall the book was not that bad, although I do not recommend it, I give it three stars."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Farewell to arms stands and delivers, an engrossing story of love and loss in backdrop of WWI. Henry, the narrator, falls in love with Catherine, an English nurse. The prose is taut, and straightforward. Without preaching, without fancy wordplay, Hemmingway presents a picturesque description of war and retreat, places in Italy and Switzerland, of wartime hospital and military mess. The undercurrent is anti-war, and the novel does its bit to expound the myths that war is glorious and patriotic. Conversations between Henry and Catherine are delightfully simple, and endearing. This book is also a tale of heroism, where courage of a man and woman are highlighted in the bravado shown in their daily life."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms reads fairly easily and is a breeze to follow along with. Hemingways writing style is fresh and dream-like.The story follows the bitterweet romance of an ambulance driver and a brave, young nurse. The book focuses in on the brutal truth of war, separating it apart from hundreds of other glorified war-romance books. Symbolism and meaning are clear, not too hard to grasp onto. Overall, this book is thoughtfully and beautifully crafted."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I'm a Spanish language speaker, but I decided to buy some books in their original language (english), and A farewell to arms was one of these. I found the story not much involved with the world war 1, neither presented to me as a great love story, since the love that arises is quite infantil. The rest of the characters appear in a too second plane, without further involvement. I think the worst part of the novel is definitively the dialogues between the couple: they seem to be the conversation of two 15 year old kids, who the only thing they can say to each other is the nicest and sweetest things ever; all they say to each other is \\"you are awfully nice to me\\" and stuff like that, and that, at least to me, lacks of interest to the reader. The story could have been much better, much more delightful, if this aspect had been more polished. The best is the end, and the inner thoughts of Henry, though is not the end we would have wanted to read."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This book, quite simply, was very bland. For one thing, it is too easy to dislike the protagonist (why should I like him?). I agree that the sentence structure and grammar is, at times, quite bizzare. Can anyone tell me why Hemingway always, always uses a contraction? I paid very close attention to the entire book and I found only one time where he did not use it (probably a mistake on his part). The story easily disinterested me, but there are some segments within the book that have some action, and can provide for some relief. Bottom line -- I hate the main character, story [was bad](granted, at times it is a little interesting) , sentences bad."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Many people tend to think that &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; is an American Classic. I disagree; in order to be a great American novel, a book should represent the American dream. Instead, the main character, Frederic Henry, is a soldier in Italy during WWI (actually, an ambulance driver) who does nothing the AmericanArmed Forces stand for. He is wounded while eating a bowl of macaroni - and receives a Medal of Valor for it - and eventually deserts his regiment in order to run off to Switzerland with his nurse.This book says a lot more than what's on its pages. Many people will toss &quot;Farewell&quot; aside, thinking the simplistic language will lack intellectual value. However, a book does not need big words to have substance. Hemingway creates very powerful messages and themes in the text by forcing the reader construct them himself. He supplies the reader with dialogue and actions, and assumes the reader will discover the meaning.Though not an American Classic, &quot;Farewell to Arms&quot; is well worth reading. A love story drives the book forward, and Hemingway effortlessly shares his insight into the life of a soldier at war."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"In Ernest Hemingway's &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;, World War I is used as a backdrop to the tumultuous love affair between an American born, Italian ambulance driver and an English nurse. The affair between Henry or &quot;Tenente&quot; as his friends call him on the war front and Catherine, is vividly depicted through many events. Through the use of vivid description and a first person narrative, Hemingway is able to show the reader how a person can lose their self identity and take on the identity of someone they love. This novel could not have taken place at a different time, without having the same effect that it did. If it had not been for the war, Henry and Catherine never would have found each other. It is ironic that amid the trenches of war, two lonely people fell in love. Amongst the chaos, Henry and Catherine's lives are changed forever One may notice Hemingway's style of writing begins with an immense amount of description and then opens up into riveting narration. His unique and renowned style of writing provides the reader with essential facts for understanding the novel, while allowing some room for the reader's imagination."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingway is experienced at evrything he writes. In this book, his descriptions prove to you that he knows how to drink, that he knows how to eat spaghetti. . . He is the master of not letting us into his life too far, yet somehow just far enough. I think the element of light and dark (as well as dry and wet) are key in this novel. Pay attention to the first chapter as well as the last. The first is almost a chronological outline of the book, and the last ties in well with the first. A must read!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingway protrays a love story in a time of war. The tedious conversations between the two lovers in the story are pure nonsense and the depiction of the settings in the story are a bore. I also did not find myself involved in the plot, as if the reading was a chore. But the final pages finally got my undivided attention. In the end, I found that the tragic ending made the whole story pull together."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"One of Hemingway's best novels. The characters incorporate the desperation of youth, the insanity and traumatization of war, and the strategy of living day-to-day rather than striving for anything like achievement or satisfaction, which is the effect of the madness of war upon the human soul. It is profoundly sexual book, but it also presents a love story between two individuals that has more depth and sensuality that one would expect from Hemingway. In addition, insights into the behavior of the military, both the allies and the &quot;enemy&quot; are fascinating, marked by the idiocy of human beings caught in any dramatic effort. It is a war story that touches on the humans involved and the devastating effect of battle on the individual. It is a love story that ends in tragedy because it is a passion born of war, not sincerity. It is a commentary on the madness of politics and the indulgence in mass slaughter in order to accomplish nothing. A very meaningful novel from an author in his prime."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"&quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; is a rarity in American literature; a piece that offers more and more after every reading. Hemingway's classic style of writing-- sparse and brief while rich in detail-- is in top form here. The basic underlying themes of Hemingway's best-written novel (war, love, and the weight of both) have rarely been captured in American literature. Many have attempted, but few have succeeded. If &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; was enjoyable to you, I urge you to peruse Tim O'Brien's &quot;The Things They Carried&quot; and Norman Mailer's classic, &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot;."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This is one of the best, if not THE BEST novel I have ever read. It portrays humanity for what it is, and it is romantic and sinister all at once. It is just far too good. Hemingway is my favorate author ever. Read this book and see why his style propelled American literature into the twentieth century."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell To Arms is an excellent book. Hemingway kept me interested in a story about love and war, two things I usually don't like to read about, because of the style he uses. He is able to describe scenery and events using a minimalist style which creates a story that doesn't stumble over it's own descriptive language as many other books do."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This book was very good, however I felt the action of the book dragged on putting the reader to sleep. The story would have been better had it been shorter....I do give Hemingway a very strong credit though! The overall stroy was excellent!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"As Heminway is an aficionado of bullfighting, I am an aficionado of his novels. With great prose and a stunning, beautiful storyline, Hemingway's portrayal of love, war, and ironic tragedy touched me. I picked up the novel on Sunday and immediately lost track of the time. A few hours later, I was speechless. This book exceeds all other of Hemingway's works I have read, and has made me very anxious to read his greatest novel ever. I have high hopes For Whom the Bell Tolls will surpass this."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"The best literature will make you realise your humanity."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingway sets a mood nonpareil in 20th Century literature in the first paragraph of this novel: &quot;In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders...water was clear and swiftly moving in the channels...and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling and the soldiers marching and afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves.&quot; The first chapter of FTA sets a mood of doom that pervades the rest of the novel. I have a real problem with Hemingway's metaphysical musings (the world breaks you, et. al.), but for clarity and objectivity in prose, Hemingway stands as a giant in literature. This is a great book, abeit a supremely depressing read. Read it for the style, not the substance."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hadn't read any Hemingway for 30 years. I remember his writing as to-the-point and without unnecessary embellishments - a style I like. I was really surprised by Farewell To Arms. I found the main characters unlikeable and the dialogue between them excruciatingly twee. Some of his literary devices seem clunky - e.g. the lengthy sentences at the beginning with many, many clauses linked by 'and.... and .... and'. The narrative got going with the retreat - finally some substance. Otherwise, the war was a picturesque backdrop to an endless succession of meals and drinks. A very disappointing read."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This would have been a wonderful read, but unfortunately the ending is rather dismal.One felt the characters growing with each page and the dialogue, though at times awkward, did seem authentic enough - between the soldiers and the new lovers. Also it is a good travel or \`road' book and well paced - going from a battle zone to a hospital and back to the front.There is not the same diversity of characters as in \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" but there are beautiful passages ranging from cafes to wartime conversations. The love scenes are surprisingly erotic as Hemingway uses well the adage \\"the less said the better\\". There are some humorous passages during some confrontational scenes.But -again - the bleak ending is ruination. It is like Hemingway found no way out except to kill off his characters."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms is a sentimental downer, reread after the onset of adulthood. It's a tale from which teenagers can learn depressing and disorienting notions of heroism and futility. This is the very same edition I read in the late 1950s, when I was a teenager. I liked it moderately well then, though I thought it was affected and manneristic in style. I've liked it less every time I've looked at it since, but it is the best of H's novels and will continue to excite new readers into the foreseeable future. I hope they will be wise enough to see through the mystique."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms is considered a \\"classic\\" of American literature. And rightly so. This novel is an excellent portrayal of the horrors of war (World War I in particular), in which the main protagonist, Frederic Henry, becomes involved in an ambiguously \\"loving\\" relationship with an English nurse named Catherine Barkley. Not to spoil any important plot elements, let's just say that their relationship ends...weirdly (and, in a sense, disturbingly) and leaves the reader feeling a million feelings at once (sadness, confusion, contemplativeness, reflectiveness, etc.).Again, Hemingway pulls the reader in with his minimalist approach and his understatement (sometimes, incredibly \\"under\\"). The book's plot basically involves Henry's time spent on the Italian front that is being challenged, at the beginning of the book, by the Austrians, and by the end of the book, by the Germans. Henry experiences every nuance of war: from intense hunger and starvation, to the anxiety of escaping death, to the death of a comrade, to injury to himself.Overall, the book as a war novel is excellent, as a love story: excellent, and as a classic in American literature: legendary."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This is Hemingway's classic, quasi-autobiographical tale of love and war set in northern Italy during WWI. Many of the events and characters in this story parallel the real life of EH himself. Like the author, the main character of this story, Frederic Henry, is an American volunteer ambulance driver taking wounded Italian soldiers from the front line to field stations and then to hospitals in the rear. During the course of his duties, he falls in love with a British nurse. The story relates how they try to pursue and develop their relationship with all the turbulent events of the war surrounding and buffetting them. This is probably the novel that best defines EH as an author, and while a very good tale, is probably not his best novel. In particular, this story is not nearly as rich nor as well developed as \`For Whom the Bell Tolls' (my personal EH favorite). Most of the text is dialogue between the characters who speak in a terse, direct prose (i.e. the typical Hemingway style). There are quite a few unexpected twists and turns in the plot, and I must admit that I was surprised by the ending. Like Robert Jordan in \`For Whom the Bell Tolls', the role of Henry as a volunteer allows him to question (really as an outside observer) his relationship with the military and the cause he is fighting for as he is not fighting for patriotism or nationalism. This is definitely worth buying and reading if you have any interest in American literature. Unlike many so-called literary \`classics', this novel is neither ponderous, obtuse, nor unnecessarily long. It is an easy, enjoyable read. If you are new to EH, I would recommend that you either start with this novel or some of his short stories. If you've already read some other EH works and enjoyed them, you will almost certainly be pleased with this one. The Scribner hardcover edition is a few dollars more than the paperback, but certainly worth the few extra pennies if you plan to keep the book as part of a collection."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This book, A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemmingway was a real eye opener for me. It gave me so many different feelings through out the book. In the beginning when it's just going through the plot and stuff I thought it was going to be another boring war book. I'm not really into those kind of books, but I kept reading anyways. I soon figured out that there was way more to this novel than just war. The book is based on Fredrick Henry who is in World War I. He gets injured soon after meeting his wife Catherine. After he is okay there is an incident that happens, and he leaves his men. Everyone is looking for him, most likely to kill him for leaving them, but he escapes. Him and his wife make a new life in Switzerland, and she has a baby there. She passes away while giving birth which devastates him. These are all the reasons for why I felt such emotion during this book. It was a very good read. It told more than just about fighting, and what was going on in the war. It talked about his wife, and in the end it became more about her pregnancy than anything. Even though he left his men, he seems like a genuine man. He cares so much for his wife Catherine in this book, it almost brought me to tears. The way it describes how sad it is at the end when she passes away, how he walked in the rain back to a hotel because he couldn't handle it really meant a lot to me."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Ernest Hemingway's Farewell to Arms is a story of love in such a hostile time as war. Frederick Henry, the main character, is an American who serves in the Italian Army as an ambulance driver in the First World War. Henry is severely injured early in the book in a battle when a bomb shell hits him and the other drivers. Henry is sent back to hospital where he meets his future love, nurse Catherine Barkley. In his time spent at the hospital Henry and Catherine become very close.Henry has to transfer hospitals and Catherine goes with him. Eventually, he is sent back to the front to work as a driver again. Very shortly after he returns the Army is called on to retreat. During the retreat the cars get stranded and Henry decides to desert the Army and go find Catherine.The novel gives a great insight into the struggles of being in love during a war. The reader follows Henry as he will do anything to be with the one he loves. Most of the story was very good and it was an interesting novel. I was not a very big fan of all the short choppy sentences and Hemingway's misuse of run on sentences and fragments. I would recommend this book to anyway who likes a the stereotypical love story. For those of you looking for this book to be about the war, most of it is not, but the parts that are, are very descriptive and interesting reads."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This novel was far more interesting than I had expected it to be. Hemigway's personal problems were all over the place. The main theme of this book, as gloomy as it is, is that misery is part of the human condition, and that war is just one form of this. He purposely makes the end so depressing to illustrate that the tragic death of a love is even worse than the horror of war. Highly recommended, especially if you've been very concerned with the war right now."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"While Frederic Henry is serving in the Italian army during World War I as an ambulance driver, he meets a beautiful nurse, Catherine Barkley. While spending time for an injury suffered in battle, Frederic and Catherine grow closer together and their relationship stimulates. However, since it is a war time, many hurdles arise in keeping their relationship strong. Frederic is sent back to the front lines in harms way, while Catherine stays back at the hospital. While the Italian lines are retreating one day fromt the German troops, Frederic and other ambulance drivers take back roads in an attempt to retreat. However, they run into German forces and a couple of the ambulance drivers are killed. When Frederic returns to Catherine, the novel starts to get extremely interesting and take an unimaginative twist.This novel was a fabulous read. It was a cross between a love story and an interesting war novel. A nice mix for both men and women to enjoy. Throughout the whole novel, I had trouble putting the it down in anticipation of what was going to happen next. The end of the novel blew my mind as I had no idea what was going to happen. Hemingway was a genius in writing this book, in my opinion. The way he combines the love part of the story with the war part of the story is excellent. No complaints about the novel, except that by reading it, I could not put it down at all. I would highly reccomend this to people of all ages to read, man or woman."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I think at times the comprehensive relationship between Catherine and Henry bogs down Hemingway's overall objective of the novel. He wants to leave the reader with a feeling that war is wrong and that history shouldn't repeat itself. It is important for him to show how love and war coexist with each other and how they shape each other. But sometimes, in the book, the love affair gets boring to the reader, and we lose sight of Hemingway's anti-war message.There is a deeply underlying theme of diversity in this book that is very interesting. It certainly would aid the entitlement of the Nobel Prize. This diversity exists in several different ways throughout the novel, and one must think about the fact that World War I is the time period. Henry is an American who joined the Italian army who falls in love with Catherine, who is British. Catherine's best friend in the novel is Helen Ferguson, a Scot, who expresses in the beginning of the novel how Scottish people do not like the British. There is also a priest who Henry befriends, even though Henry is unemotional and not a very religious person.In conclusion, throughout the novel Hemingway puts an awful emphasis on tragedy and destruction. We see the brutality from the Italian military police, and the destruction from the different battles. Hemingway's perspective on the Italian front in World War I is certainly a uniquely interesting one, posed from a very neutral angle. This neutrality in the book is shown more when Catherine and Henry move to Switzerland; it being the only neutral country in Europe.With the depressing themes of death and war in A Farewell to Arms, after reading it one could definitely be left with a bad taste in one's mouth. This is not an uplifting book in any way, shape or form, but this is exactly Hemingway's point. Like I said before, this book is a historical account of what war can do to people and their relationships. After reading it, it certainly makes me have anti-war feelings. Overall, A Farewell to Arms is a book that makes you think and makes you wonder about the world's future. It really makes you wonder what could happen in the world if we don't stop and think about what has happened. It is those underlying themes and Hemingway's ability to show them in such an intricate manner that warrants Ernest Hemingway a Nobel Prize winning author."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"The story itself wasn't too bad, not exactly origional, but I've read worse. I found the characters to be rather flat, there was little development throughout the book. The dialogue, however, is the worst I have ever read. In fairly long conversations, the same thing is said ten times and the conversation as a whole never says anything new, or interesting. Not a terrible read, but I wouldn't recomend it, or ever read it again."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This is a profoundly beautiful love story set in World War I in Italy. Frederic Henry is an American, driving ambulances for the Italian Army. The reason for that he gives is because he was in Italy and he spoke Italian. Catherine Barkley is a British nurse. It is their story with the war as backdrop. It is very sensual in that I could taste ever dark beer and cool glass of wine. I could feel the damp rain and see the snow. In the end you are left drop dead stunned and deeply sad - yet happy for all of his beautiful words and the surprising ways he sometimes puts them, such as the description of the wine shop he entered one morning for coffee, &quot;It smelled of early morning, of swept dust, spoons in coffee-glasses and the wet circles left by wine-glasses.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I admit I am but a fledgling Hemingway reader..Definitely not yet an aficianado of the canon!There are times when I still falter over his simplistic style, his reporter-like, almost point-form and unembellished narration. His pithy dialogue which seems at times so unusual that I am jarred into the realization that I am holding a book in my hands.But this book, A Farewell To Arms was a fantastic read and has given me a new appreciation, I guess, for Hemingwayism in general.Genre-wise, it is somewhat of a historical romance, perhaps.Set squarely in WWI Italy and Switzerland. Lots of war, lots of rain, lots of gore, lots of pain.I hesitate from saying too much about the novel, story-wise, because truly there are many ways that one could ruin it, by saying too much, especially as regards its increasingly-paced and unforgettably moving final sections. [The novel is broken down into five parts, books, or sections].For me as a reader, one of the key things [feelings] I am left with is an overwhelming sense of the simultaneous dual-existence of meaninglessness and meaningfulness. I feel that this is a theme or thread running the length of the novel.There is the meaninglessnes of war. The seemingly arbitrary way that beautiful things can be so quickly taken from us, be they dignity, or love, or life itself. The suddenness of bone-crunching shrapnel in the midst of friendly camaraderie... bombs putting an end to meaningful conversation. War is a perpetual mess, needing to be cleaned up.But alongside this \\"meaninglessness\\" [what I am calling meaninglessness for lack of a better term], Hemingway paints a searing portrait of love and the meaningfulness of intimate relationship.Lt. Henry's [solidly requited] love for the Scottish nurse Catherine Barkley is like flashes of color thrown into the clattering frames of a black-and-white newsreel. It was meaningfulness, inserted into mayhem.It was something beautiful, growing, thriving and enduring in a field of ugliness, disaster and loss.The novel ended with the tears of two men.Lt. Henry's.And mine.I could say so much more about #74 on the list of the 100 Best Books of All Time, but I won't.I will simply ask a question and then answer it:In A Farewell To Arms, does Hemingway show us that the meaningfulness of love and goodness and hopes and dreams are altogether something too good to be true?No.He shows us that all of these things are too good, and true!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Being on the kick of rereading novels that are considered by the critics to be classics, I recently revisited Ernest Hemingway's A FAREWELL TO ARMS which is touted as the greatest novel to come out of World War I. It is the story of the love affair of the American Frederic Henry, who is an ambulance driver on the Italian front, and the British nurse Catherine Barkley. The novel was published in 1929, the same year as two other American classics, Thomas Wolfe's LOOK HOMEWARD ANGEL and William Faulkner's SOUND AND THE FURY. No two novels could be more different. Hemingway's spare, elliptical language would have been as foreign to these two masters of the complex, convoluted sentence as the Great Wall of China. Hemingway does not waste one word, proving that sometimes less is more, leaving much to the imagination of the reader. For example, there is a scene in the novel when Henry and Catherine or \\"Cat\\" as he lovingly calls her, are trying to decide how to spend a snowy evening in the quarters they have rented in Switzerland:[Henry:] Now do you want to play chess?[Catherine:] I'd rathe play with you.[Henry: No.] Let's play chess.[Catherine:] And afterward can we play?[Henry: Yes.][Catherine:] All right.It is left up to the reader to picture how these two lovers will play; and in many ways, the scene is far more erotic than if Hemingway had told us a la D. H. Lawrence everything that occurred. Supposedly the Boston police seized from the newsstands the edition of Scribner's magazine that published the second installment of this novel, something that is impossible for those living now to fathom, post-Updike, post-Mailer, post-Vidal, post-Ginsberg et al.The ending of the novel will haunt you in a way that few novels do. It is almost a cliche now to discuss Henry as a \\"Hemingway hero,\\" but he is: strong, understated, tough and unflinching as he faces his destiny. Then there are his beautiful words words often quoted: \\"the night can be a dreadful time for lonely people once their loneliness has started. . . If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially.\\" (All this with only one comma!)Such a fine and fair novel. The critics are certainly right this time."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I am only a freshman in highschool, and I know I don't get everything (or at least not as much as most) other, better educated individuals do. I do know that this is a great book. It is a love story and a war story wrapped together. Catherine Barkley(a British nurse)and Frederick Henry (an American ambulance driver in the Italian army)are a beautiful picure of love within war time. The lovers go through much to have a simple, peaceful life. They do accomplish this for a time. However, like other Hemingway novels the ending isn't \\"happy\\". Even though, I can't imagine it ending any other way. If you will take my advice, read this book.

I can understand how some may get frustrated with the \\"terseness\\" of Hemingway's sentences - honestly, I liked it; and I can empathize with those reviewers who were not fans of the ending - I was a bit troubed by it, too. The story - of an American serving as an ambulance driver in the Italian army, his wounding, falling in love and ultimately his disillusionment with the war - kept me interested, but it was the writing style that had my attention.It is easy to see, after reading his book, why Hemingway has such a following. His imagery was vivid, to the point of almost having the tale become a memory of your own. His narrative and dialogue are brilliant, giving the sensation of the reader as an invisible observer to conversations. I did have some difficulty with the way in which he wrote women - epecially \\"Fergie\\" - her blubbering, over-emotional reactions and irrationality frustrated and irritated me (which, I suspect, was Hemingway's intent: again, he is a master.)This is Hemingway's best work - and among the best of the last century - not so much for the story, but for the style."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A great novel, with great writing. My only complaint is the scene where Frederic Henry shoots and kills in cold blood two officers who are running away, going AWOL. But they are not in combat. They are in the middle of nowhere, so what's the real harm in them running away? It's a rotten, cold thing for Henry to do in that scene, and F. Scott Fitzgerald advised Hemingway to cut that scene. Hemingway branded Fitzgerald a wimp for wanting to cut out the violence, and left the scene in. But I think Fitzgerald was right. It's a brutal act, commited by a character that does not exhibit brutality elsewhere, and so doesn't fit. The rest of the book is great, though."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"If you are not a very good reader (as is the general public) you will not enjoy or understand Hemingways work. The best things are left unsaid. That is Hemingway's style and it is the best way to write. I know, I read a lot of books and studied them. People who are fans of todays authors will not like Hemingway because he doesn't hand you everything on a silver platter. You have to think to truly read Hemingway. People no longer like to think, they only want to be entertained. You can see this by watching television. If you are young you will most likely not like Hemingway. You simply haven't been alive long enough to understand it. What is so moving about his writting is the emotions he reveals within it. If you have not read the ending to A Farwell To Arms then you are not qualified to judge it. It is very poinant and demonstrates a love that most people may fail to understand. It is in my opinion the greatest love store written in the 20 century. His dialoge can at times be boring. This is only because it is real. He has been referred to as the master of dialoge. Was the conversation you had at work yesterday with the guy in the next cubicle all that interesting. I doubt it, but it was real. His dialoge is also dated. Remember this book was published in 1929. This book is rich and layered with many different themes. EX. The pupose of war, religion,and love, just to name a few if you don't understand it I sujest getting the Cliff Notes. They seem to be the answer to all the classics.(I'm being sarcastic)"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I'm a 8th grade sudent who is studying at International School Bangkok. This was my first time that I picked up the Hemigway story, &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;. It was challenging for me to read it because I've studied English for only 2years. A Farewell to Arms is Anti-War literature, a masterpiece that is write with a themes about the vanity of war. It also shows us the essence of Hemingway literature. But I didn't really like the way that the author created the maincharacter as a hero, and there was too much dialogue, but the affectionate love of the story between Henry and his girl friend gave me warm and sad emotions."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A FAREWELL TO ARMS is one of Hemingway's earliest novels. With much of the material loosely based on his own personal experiences as an ambulance driver during World War I, the story captures in great detail the conflict in all of its horror and barbarism.The book invites us to imagine all of the brave soldiers who went into the war in search of glory. What they found instead was the endless stalemate and hideous prospect of trench warfare. Perhaps more than any other war in the history of warfare, the first World War changed the traditional paradigms of how wars were fought and what the objectives of engagements were. Hemingway, who was there himself, serves as a perfect instrument to portray what it was really like.The plot centers around Frederick Henry, an American ambulance driver for the Italian army (a job Hemingway performed himself). Henry is a typical masculine Hemingway male persona who falls in love with a beautiful, long-haired &amp; impetuous British nurse named Catherine Barkley. Henry is an exemplar of the WWI soldier who gets more than he bargains for in the war; betrayal and ignominious soldiering of the Italians in the wake of defeat.The tragic irony of this novel is what makes it so memorable. Henry, as a wounded man who withdraws from the battle, as well as the whims of the Italian Army. However, he does so only to find that life is full of tragedy whether you're in a war or not.I would highly recommend this novel to all fans of Hemingway, American literature and World War I period historical and literary works. It is with the subtle prose of Heminway that we can be effectively transported back to that epoch of our world history."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Seven decades after the intial publication, A Farewell to Arms now seems to be the Hemingway novel that gets the most attention and many readers new to Hemingway are probably drawn to it for their initial exposure to the author. Normally, starting off with a writer's best book might be a good approach, but not in this case. A Farewell to Arms, while Hemingway's greatest work, also offers the uninitiated reader the greatest challenge. This is as terse as it gets, and if you're not familiar with Hemingway's style, you may find yourself wondering what all the fuss is about. Worse, you may become one of those millions of intelligent, well-read people who think he is a horrible joke. Start with a few of the short stories. Read some of the criticism (positive and negative). Do a little research on WWI (if you feel you need to). Then go for The Sun Also Rises. At that point, you will be hooked, or you will write the guy off forever. If you find yourself in the former category, you will really appreciate the opportunity to read incredible this book."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This wonderful story by a young early Hemingway is perhaps, along with \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\", one of the finest anti-war novels ever written. In it we are introduced to a young and idealistic man, Frederick Henry, who, through love, experience and existential circumstance, comes to see the folly, waste, and irony of war, and attempts to make his own peace outside the confines of traditional conformity. For all of his obvious excesses, Hemingway was an artist compelled to delve deliberately into painful truths, and he attempted to do so with a style of writing that cut away all of the frills and artifice, so that at its heart this novel is meant as a exploration into what it means to confront the world of convention and deliberately decide to choose for what one feels in his heart as opposed to what one is expected to do. Of course, in so doing, the young ambulance driver becomes a full-grown adult, facing his trials with grace and courage. Still, what we are left with is a modern tragedy, one in which the characters must somehow attempt to resolve the irresolvable.Yet in all this emotional turmoil and existential 'sturm-und-drang' of two star-crossed lovers caught in the contradictions, deceptions, and brutality of the First World War, we are also treated to Hemingway's amazing powers of exposition at the peak of his prowess. Indeed, as with other Hemingway novels, it is Hemingway's imaginative and spare use of the language itself that wins the reader over. Unlike his predecessors, he sought a lean narrative style that cut away at all the flowery description and endless adjectives. In the process of parsing away the excesses, Hemingway created a clear, simple and quite declarative prose style that was truly both modern and revolutionary.In what may be one of the most quoted passages in modern fiction, in \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" Hemingway gives us his personal view of the world's inevitable negative impact on all of us: \\"If a person brings so much courage into the world that the world must kill him to break him, so of course it kills him. The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those it cannot break it will kill. It kills the very good, the very gentle, and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these things the world will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.\\" Here the human beings are caught in the murderous crossfire of brutal forces fighting to death, and they must flee to save themselves and their hopes for a better future away from the madness. Their journey towards safety is full of the poignancy of all such fragile ventures, and someone must pay the cost of their bravery, gentleness, and love.What one encounters as a result is a story seemingly stripped to its barest essentials, superficially more like the newspaper man's pantheon of who, what, where, when, and why, and yet somehow transformed into a much more accurate and imaginative effort, one leaving the reader with a much more artful account of what is going on. One reads Hemingway quickly, at least at first, when one learns to slow down and drink in every word and every detail as it is related. For me and for millions of others, the true genius of Hemingway is to be found in his artful use of language. This book was one of Hemingway's finest successful forays into the world of letters, and the result of his collected works truly changed the face of modern fiction. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Ok folks. I had no intention of writing a review of A Farewell To Arms, but what's been written on this page necessitates a response. This is not an anti-war novel. Well, I suppose it's anti-war in the sense that there is a war and wars are bad. There is no definitive literary content in this novel that suggests that Hemingway was making an anti-war statement. In FACT, the only work that Hemingway unequivocally dubbed \\"anti-war\\" was For Whom The Bell Tolls. There really are only two grotesque war scenes (the shell exploding in the drivers' tent and the man bleeding to death in the ambulance) and that hardly constitutes the book's classification as an \\"anti-war novel\\" or \\"anti-war allegory\\" or parable or masterwork or whatever you want to insert to justify yourself. Sure, one cane make the assertion that the man bleeding to death in the ambulance was indicitive of the slow, callous slaughter of the world's young healthy males during WWI, but it would have been impossible for Hemingway to have written the entire book without making SOME reference to the grotesque nature of the war. A Farewell To Arms, however, is not Guernica. It is not a Dadaist painting. It is certainly not that old Mel Gibson movie where he dies at the end (remember that?).The point is, this book has thematic elements that hardly relate to war. Take love, for instance. But love, unto itself, is more a compication than anything. At it's simplest, the novel is about strength. Strength, unabashed and unflinching. It is about the eternal struggle that every strong man and woman fights until their (untimely) death. It is the struggle with the world and the universe, which so callously torments the strong until they succumb to the weight of the unforgiving cosmos.The most fallacious aspect of calling A Farewell To Arms a \\"war novel\\" is really the fact that it undermines what Hemingway wanted the reader to take away from the book: the fact that war is simply one of many trials and tribulations that slowly and painfully break us. It is yet another painful step towards death, which is, according to Hemingway, the definition of finality. It is in death that we all end and that the trials finally cease.Now, in terms of what's been written on this page, I have very little to say. A Farewell To Arms, whether you care to admit it or not, transcends anything and everything written on Amazon.com or any other site that presents the book simply as a commodity and a merchandisable memento from a writer whose image has been bastardized by a lack of public understanding. Catherine, for her part, is a pristine character: she is unquestionably strong and her jubilance (\\"cheesiness\\") is a reflection of her unflinching loyalty to Henry. What people often fail to realize is that Henry is not really the \\"man\\" of A Farewell To Arm. Catherine fills the role that, in any other Hemingway novel, would be filled by a man. She is not simply a sad, helpless woman whose death is an unfortunate occurance in Henry's life. She is a bastion of stength and earthly defiance.Now, Clearly this novel is not for everyone. However, insulting it because of it's \\"simple language\\" or lack of action or simply it's supposedly stilted dialogue or whatever else you care to come up with is positively absurd. Hemingway's style was not simply an iconoclastic stab at trying to make something new and weird. It reflected the focused effort that Hemingway made throughout his life to defy the established literary community by rejecting the overwrought floweriness of past novels. This act of defiance and rejection, however, was not important unto itself. If a man simply writes a story using basic verbiage, he has accomplished nothing. Hemingway did more. A Farewell To Arms is but a primer- the basic, pure outline of a massive concept that governed Hemingway's life. The book's significance lies in implication and subtleties. Hemingway often likened his novels to icebergs, in that they were primarily obscured. It is unfortunate that so few modern Hemingway readers are willing to penetrate that obscured mass that lies beneath A Farewell To Arms.It is beneath the immediate novel that one finds the truth: The inevitable approach of death. The inherent cruelty of God. The unfortunate way of the strong. The beauty that lies only in our interactions with the ones we know and love. This is not an action story. This is not some trite Chicken Soup garbage feigning truth and meaning.And on that note, don't get me started on Chicken Soup For The Soul. I thank God for books like A Farewell To Arms, which exist in polar opposition to all the self-help garbage that is being vomited up by modern, brain-dead \\"writers\\". The more self-help books a person reads, the more he becomes senseless and blind. He becomes filled with a trite, meaningless happiness derived from stupid falsitudes. The first step in understanding truth is abandoning the rediculous contrivances contained in modern self-help literature, which exist only to shelter us from life's uncomfortable truths. A Farewell To Arms might be \\"depressing\\", but it is at the very least candid. It is real, and it has a depth that surpasses that of most modern literature. If you don't like it, go pick up your Dan Brown novel and be thankful everyone is happy at the end. Philistines."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This book is well worth owning and reading even if you only read the opening paragraph (one of tbe best paragraphs ever written, I feel.) But to stop there would be a pity as this is one of Hemingways best works and one of the better works created by an American author in the past 100 years or so. The novel, which is indeed semi-autobiographical, takes a hard look at war and a hard look at young love. From my own point of view though, the story is secondary. Hemingways style and skill as a writer is the true allure of this work. Hemingway stated that American literature started with Mark Twain. That may be true, but it certainly got a strong shot in the arm when Hemingway himself came along. Much of the writing we see even to this day has been strongly influenced by Mr. Hemingway. I cannot recommend this work high enough. Recently it has become an \\"in thing\\" to bash both Hemingway the man and Hemingway the author. I am note sure why or what is going on here, but I do not that most of those that are throwing the stones would be lucky to get job writng Wal-Mart ads in a local paper. Do purchase and do read this work. You will be much richer for the expierence."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I read this in high school about twenty years ago, and recently decided to revisit this work. I think this is an important thing to do. As our lives change, quite often the meaning of great books change to us also, and we can gain an even richer experience. I am sorry to report that this is not the case with this novel. At the risk of sounding sacrilegious, I would suggest that this book is a long way from resembling the great canon of work that is Hemingway's.Now don't start screaming yet. Please bear with me. To begin with, don't we seem to have a rather idealized version of our hero's girlfriend? She is blonde, slender and beautiful; falls in love with him immediately; and without any complications. Every time she is with him, everything is just \\"grand.\\" Isn't this just a little too perfect? We know she is Scottish, but what else? She has no brothers, sisters, or mother and father that we know of. What indeed, is she doing in Italy, other than simply being available? She's not much of an idealist. After all, it didn't take much convincing for her to leave the war, just as our hero did. Who is she?For that matter, what about Mr. Henry? He is an American fighting in the Italian army as an ambulance driver during World War I. Yes, I know this is true of Hemingway's life, but as fiction, we need more clarity. Isn't this a little unusual? Why is he there? He never explains. He's there, he gets wounded, he fights again, he gets sick of it, he leaves. Even more annoying, his family always seems to send him money when he gets in a jam. The perfect out. Who are they, and why do they do this?Even worse is the contrived ending. I won't give away the details, but wow, he sure comes away clean. As George Carlin said in a comedy routine: \\"Boy, you ARE a good sport!\\" It is a bit much.Don't get me wrong. Hemingway was a great writer, and there is a lot of good stuff in here. His relationships with the Italians and his description of the retreat ring true. But there is too much missing for this to be considered a great novel on its own. If you want the best of Hemingway, you have to go further. Start with \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls,\\" if you don't believe me, or any of the hundreds of great short stories he has. Even this one is a very good read. But remember, he wrote it at the tender age of 30, and clearly, his best work was yet to come."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I had a misfortune to listen to the &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; audiobook before I attempted to read the novel itself. Unfortunately, a bad speaker is apt to spoil the otherwise good novel, as this case indicates. That should also teach me to never attempt to listen to the book if I am not aware of the contents. Ever since, I follow the first things first strategy. As far as this particular book by Hemingway goes, I think the title is one of the most charming, ever.Set in the last years of World War I in Italy, &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; is a classic novel about the side effects the war imposes on the young, 'beardless warriors', to borrow a phrase from Richard Matheson. Apart from those who find combat their duty they can't shirk from, there are young, idealistic men who are attracted to the idea of the war as a symbol of a point in timespace that will allow them to show the qualities they possess, anywhere from patriotism to bravery out of range. It is a truism that many of those young volunteers have been scarred for life by the war experiences, if they happened to outlive their enemies, that is. While &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; does not center on the psychological aspects of combat, it does emphasize the phenomenon of young people's navet&eacute;, and how fast they mature in the circumstances. Needless to say, their idealistic spirit, while being not entirely compatible with the wartime conditions, makes them easy prey for both the enemy, when they let themselves involved in situations they are not able to handle on their own, and to young women who accompanied the army. Rarely is there a more dangerous mix than love and war, as this novel beautifully illustrates. If not for minor quirks specific to Hemingway's style of writing, and A Farewell to Arms is one of the best examples of this style at work - one might regard this novel as a grand wartime love story. Unfortunately, considered as such, it does not really hold a candle to Erich Maria Remarque's wartime novels, and &quot;Arch of Triumph&quot; in particular. When a young, idealistic protagonist finds himself in a hospital, his beloved takes care of him often enough in addition to the miniature army of nurses, and perhaps it's the fault of the audiobook I listened to, I admit, but the dialogues, the verbal lovemaking and twirling they exchange couldn't appear more artificial. Is that how people in love behave? Are they also so cold, frosty, even? I seriously doubt so. There is no passion between these two young people, not that I could detect any. But perhaps it's just me, and I demand a little bit more from love.These little unimportant quirks notwithstanding, I heartily recommend &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; for a few reasons. It's a good way to approach Hemingway's larger works of prose, it's a good way to introduce yourself to the literature of the 1920s, where the memories of the World War I were still fresh, and not overshadowed by the monstrosity of what happened just a decade later. The next major World War changed the world much more than it is usually perceived, another major event of this type in recent history might be only the Anti-French Revolution and the following Napoleonic Pax Franca. Last, but not least, as indicated above, this novel provides a very interesting outlook on the idealism of the youth. All things considered, if you are in your teens, I recommend this book with a firm conviction, and if you are older and have not yet explored Hemingway beyond some short stories, or not even that, &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; will be a good point of entry to the Papa's World."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I disagree strongly with the \\"official\\" review of Slattery's reading/performance of this great and very important novel. Slattery does both Scottish and Italian accents just fine; what's more, he adopts the casual and bantering tone that is so key to understanding the nuances of the relationships in this story, including the narrator's voice.Having ordered this CD in spite of the review included on Amazon's page, I felt it was important, as a college teaching professional and as someone who studied acting and directing, to include a review that emphasized what a high quality this recording is. The accents will NOT annoy you! And if you are a student studying this book, it will help you immensely to hear it read."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"It's interesting to me how fictional books written with the backdrop of World War 1 differ so greatly with those written with the backdrop of World War 2. The WW2 books almost universally focus on the struggle of good versus evil: the heroics of the Allies, and the despicable nature of the Nazis and those who supported them. A WW2 Ally soldier had no reason to wonder why he was fighting, and what the objective was. Afterwards, the soldier need only look at the Holocaust to know that he did right to kill his enemies on the battlefield, and that the loss of so many fellow soldiers was part of a noble effort. (\\"Gee, I wonder if it was wrong to shoot that Nazi,\\" would probably never be a line in any novel).Not so with WW1. In that war, it seems that no one was quite clear why they were fighting or what, exactly, the objectives were. Like any war, it was kill or be killed, but for what purpose exactly? (The same can be said from the point of view of the American soldier in the later part of the Vietnam War).In \\"A Farewell to Arms,\\" Hemingway sucessfully captures the futility and madness of the War, and the absolute insanity that people fighting in it were driven to. Since the two main characters are an ambulance driver and a nurse, we see the horrible injuries and deaths suffered by soldiers on the battlefield, and get a good introduction to the wartime practice of medicine in the early 20th Century. Hemingway drove an ambulance during WW1 himself, and clearly knows his stuff.Don't ask me how, but \\"Farewell\\" is the first Hemingway book I've ever read. For some strange reason, I managed to avoid his work through High School (I recall that I perhaps was supposed to read \\"The Old Man of the Sea,\\" but I either forgot it entirely, or read the Cliff notes). I have to say that I certainly enjoyed \\"Farewell,\\" and plan to read more Hemingway in the future, but I struggled, at first, to get used to the writing. In the first 100 pages or so, I found the terseness and simplicity of the sentences to be a distraction, and wondered if, perhaps, the author was vastly over-rated. I also found the dialogue stiff and, on occasion, down-right bizarre. For instance, often the characters (especially Fred Henry) would respond to each other with a flat sounding \\"all right,\\" which I thought didn't flow at all.But after awhile, the Hemingway style started to make an impression on me and I appreciated it, not only in the war scenes, but also concerning the romance between Fred and Catherine, which, although incredibly corny at times, worked for me. You could see the tragedy at the end a few chapters away (the blissful moments in rural Switzerland simply could not last), but it effected me even so. Frankly, I still prefer authors who use more complex sentence structure, but, as I kept reading this book, I grew more appreciative of what Hemingway was trying to accomplish with his style.PS: A good companion to \\"Farewell\\" is \\"All Quiet on the Western Front,\\" which is from the point of view of a WW1 German soldier. Apparently,the other side had no clue why they were fighting that particular war either."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I think everybody should read this book. I'm 15 and it was the most amazing book i've ever read. The story of love between Frederick Henry and Catherine Barkley was a lovely thing to witness. The story of war was equally heartbreaking. Although at some points I had to force myself to pick it up and read, I was never disappointed. When I read the last sentence, I started to cry, not because it was sad, but because I was amazed by it's beauty. You will not be disappointed by this book!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingway's greatest novels (and I am not includding The Old Man and the Sea here, that is a novella, not one of his epic emotional works) start with The Sun Also Rises and end with For Whom the Bell Tolls. Sandwiched in between is the book that can be seen as transition piece (though, techinically speaking it was written right after The Sun Also Rises, and so is still part of the 'early' Hemingway that brought him fame and exceptance by the literary establishment). Like in The Sun Also Rises, he focuses on a couple main characters and their emotional bond. But also, he comments extensively on war and society, as in For Whom the Bell Tolls. This is where we start to see the pOlitical Hemingway arsise. But unlike a lot of 20th centurary literature with a social conscious, it does not sacrifice human thematic elements to push forward an agenda. No, Hemingway manages to condemn war, while still transcending the mundaness of it, the who's right and who's wrong and instead focuses on the lives that war touches and ruins. In Fredric Henry and Cathrine Barkley, he gives us two tragic heros who's lives, while becoming intertwined in love, are ultimately destroyed. Like all Hemingway, A Farewell to Arms is a true experience unrivaled in any other literature."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"It seemed that most people enjoyed this book, but several people had complaints about a thing or two, some justified, others? Well...Justified Complaints:1) Stilted Dialouge2) Not Much ElseSomewhat Justified1) Lack of PlotUnjustified:1) Simplistic Sentence Structure2) Lack of Characterization-- Now, the three complaints I'm going to address all can be answered by a two word phrase \\"ICEBURG EFFECT\\" Now, for those of you who already know of the Iceburg effect, you might want to skip the next couple of sentences. THe Iceburg effect, plainly put, is only showing 11 percent of whats there, the rest being under the surface, this is acheived by simplistic sentence style, and sparse outward clues to motivation. The reason for this effect is to give the reader something to think about, at the same time allowing multiple ways to look at the same thing.-----Now, on to simplistic sentence style. One woman said that her three year old nephew used bigger words than Hemingway, BUT, look deeper into what her nephew is saying, and you'll probably find something along the lines of (Cricket Chirp). (That is, of course, unless her nephew is a genius of some sort, though judging from her aunt powerful review I don't believe this to be the case)-----I'm sorry if someone read this in hopes of it being a book review, I'll get to that.-----This book is probably one of the finest to come out of the First World War, and like many books of the time, (One Example: All Quiet on the Western Front) it carries a strong anti-war message(This may throw off some of those who ardently beieve in fighting for a cause, so I'll defend the pacifistic message by saying \\"You gotta understand, World War One was actually a bigger cluster (Add certain Word Here) than even the vietnam conflict (Ever notice when America loses its always called a conflict?)).-----Its the story of Lt. Henry and Nurse Catherine, and argueably the best American love story ever written. (Second would probably be Lolita). As I said before, this novel works best under the surface, so thinking over what you've read and what certain things mean is quite rewarding. But if you're not into that and you don't think that using nickel words is a sign of stupidity, I still (reservedly) recommend this book because this, like several other Hemingways, works on the most basic level also."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"When I was in college, I took writing classes. In my group there was a girl who used to write very long clauses, with many whos, wheres, thats... One day, a Professor suggested her to read Hemingway paying atention to how he wrote sentences so short and at the same time so complete, with many information. So, everytime I read Hemingway, I bear this in my mind! He always gets me over! And it's very efficient. Short sentences aren't tiring or boring. I think that is one of the reasons I like and admire his work.When it comes to A Farewell to Arms, readers complain about a lack of character development - mainly before the war- and psychological analysis. And I agree. There isn't much of it through the narrative, but it seems to me this is not an accidental omission. My feeling is that the writer wanted to show us when you are at War - as the characters - it doesn't matter where you come from, what you've done, or what are your preferences. You are only one more soldier (or nurse, as he also portraits). And that's why we barely know what happen to them before the war had broken out.I liked the book both as a love story and as a war novel. The love affair between the soldier and the nurse is very touching. And it kept me rooting for them all the time. The end of the novel got me down."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I am in love with Hemingway's prose. His style, though often copied or imitated, is that of a master -- never duplicated. I almost believe he could write about the most mundane of things and it would be prose more worth reading than a good 75% of the books published.Here is a story about love and war. Old subjects, and thank God the writer knows that, and treats them as such. Back the the prose thing again.To dig just a bit deeper, Hemingway gives us a harsh and ugly world full of beautiful people. The war is senseless and awful, to be escaped, it seems the entire nature of the universe is to break and kill beautiful things. But inside of that, there are good people. Everywhere our hero goes, he finds decent, honest, giving, selfless people worth knowing, maybe even worth dying for. Maybe this is called existentialism. Personally, I disagree -- I see a beautiful, inherently good world full of selfish and broken people -- but Hemingway's worldview is, to say the least, poetic.There are a lot of different reasons to read books. One legit one is to escape -- but few, if any, would read, say, Dostoyevsky to escape. I usually read fantasy or sci-fi to escape. But I found this book, mostly because of Hemingway's enchanting prose (I just can't shut up about it) as an incredible mechanism to escape.A sample of that amazing prose:&quot;I could remember Catherine but I knew I would get crazy if I thought about her when I was not sure yet I would see her, so I would not think about her, only about her a little, only about her with the car going slowly and clickingly, and some light through the canvas and my lying with Catherine on the floor of the car. Hard as the floor of the car to lie not thinking only feeling, having been away too long, the clothes wet and the floor moving only a little each time and lonesome inside and alone with wet clothing and hard floor for a wife."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"If you like the Hemingway writing style, this is a great book. I enjoyed the story setting and resolution. Hemingway also has the ability to let you believe you are close friends with every story character. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Re: The MW Encyc. of Lit. synopsis.Brilliant move. Thanks a lot"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell To ArmsSet in the environment of Word Ward II, this novel, anti-war novel per excellence, conveys the story of love between young lieutenant Frederick Henry and the young English nurse Catherine Barkley and the inexorable happenings thereafter. Henry is an American ambulance driver at the Italian front who gets his legs and head wounded by a trench mortar- and decorated for that- on the Isonze north of Plava, north of Gorizia and is therefore hospitalized in Milan. It is in the latter that the love among the two youngsters starts to develop beautifully until his convalescence leave is over and he has to go back to the front. The story goes on but as many reviewers have already done their job at summarizing this novel I so will only concentrate on Hemingway's writing style.His writing style is modern and unprecedented, definitely a landmark style where from the first person singular or plural narrations of events and feelings are put into paragraphs and dialogs with concise, short, straight to the point precise sentences, with almost lack of punctuation and not one \\"surplus\\" word nor sentence. In addition the use of adjectives and adverbs is therefore minimized. However, Hemingway accomplishes to convey both the uttermost feelings and actions of the protagonists involved and the outstanding descriptions of the sites and happenings related to WWI. In particular, is it a masterwork in itself the description of the happenings surrounding the retreat of the Italian Army due to the German attack on Capporeto with lines of tired men marching in the rain, in utterly disbelief, hungry, demoralized, dispirited, exhausted, weary...As for Hemingway's anti-war comments, they are all throughout the novel, especially in the dialogs of Lieutenant Henry and his friend Dr. Rinaldi, the priest and his subordinates. Nevertheless there is a paragraph towards the end of the novel that struck me the most- and really got me heartbroken and I will transcribe part of it below:\\"Once in a camp I put a log on top of the fire and it was full of ants. As it commenced to burn, the ants swarmed out and went first toward the centre where the fire was; then turned back and ran toward the end. When there were enough on the end they fell off into the fire. Some got out, their buddies burnt and flattened, and went off not knowing were they were going. But most of them went toward the fire and then back toward the end and swarmed on the cool end and finally fell of into the fire...\\"The novel is a master piece of work and I certainly look forward to reading more of this Nobel Price winner literature titles... It is well worth the read and definitely a breakthrough in writing style."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This is the best of the three Hemingway novels I've read, the other two being The Sun Also Rises and For Whom the Bell Tolls.This is a novel of youth, best exhibited by the young nurse. It's also a novel of idealism--the ambulance driver committed to the war even as a non-combatant. But it's also a novel of reasoned youth tempering the more typical impetuous romanticism of war. Perhaps this is symbolized in his being an ambulance driver, dangerous enough, and not a combatant.The events leading to his disillusion and consequent farewell to arms, occur not as typical youthful epiphanies, ricocheting from one extreme (idealism, romanticism) to another (disillusionment, cynicism), but as an almost inevitable and slowly acting corrosive as the war continues to unfold in front of him, brought into final play during the retreat in the Battle of Caporetto.The description of the retreat is the highlight of the novel, beginning with its orderly nature to the joining in of refugees and its progressive disintegration into panic and lawlessness. It's brilliant and completely convincing. You can see and feel it unfold right before you.Everyone points out that Hemingway was a former newspaperman and his use of short, terse sentences.Sure, but the fictional prose value of most newspaper people is nowhere--just surface description with little else. Not so for Hemingway. Embedded in his short sentences is feeling, emotion, and, in few words, vivid, deep description. It's what gives the substantial meaning and value to his work well beyond the superficial surface of the news report, even while in the heritage of that style.I mean, how many reporters win the Nobel prize for Literature as did Hemingway. Read this book and you'll have an idea why."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Classic Hemingway: terse, good story, straight-forward writing, courage and grace in the face of pessimism, sad ending.It's the story, based on Hemingway's own experiences as an ambulance driver in France during WWI, of the love affair between an American lieutenant,Henry, and a British nurse, Catherine. Both already altered by what they've seen and experienced, they drift into a relationship that neither intended to become serious. But serious it does become, to the point that Henry becomes a deserter to be with his pregnant lover. Things go steadily downhill after that...and the ending becomes inevitable.A classic war story with the Hemingway signature."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This book clearly deserves more than five stars.A Farewell to Arms is the semi-autobiographical tale of an American lieutenant in the Italian army near the end of World War I. Though the book's action, you will see the gradual distintegration of the hero's commitment to the conflict and his faltering attempts to create a new personna. While this is clearly one of the greatest anti-war books of all time, it transcends that genre to look more directly at the nature of life's challenges and how we meet them. As such, A Farewell to Arms ranks as one of the greatest of all American philosphical novels as well. For Hemingway aficionados, you will be fascinated to see his ornate writing style before he developed his eventual, much-admired spare form. This is stream of consciousness Hemingway at its best.Lieutenant Henry is a man caught in the drift of events, without knowing what he stands for. He does his duty, but often out of habit rather than principle. When the full force of man and nature turn on him, he reverts to his instincts for self-survival. He wants little to do with the world, except in taking those delights that most please him. In the course of realizing and trying to overcome his emotional weaknesses, he simply isolates himself in new ways. Even love can only touch him when it is defined solely in his own terms.Hemingway sees personal progress as only being possible through extreme pain. &quot;The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places.&quot; That's the good news. The bad news is that &quot;those that will not break it kills.&quot; The world kills &quot;the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially.&quot;This theme is carried out by the challenges of being a lieutenant in the ambulance corps, then being wounded in a mortar attack, going through surgery and recovery, dealing with a murderous retreat, and ultimately falling in love and dealing with loss. Lieutenant Henry is increasingly overwhelmed, and finds himself willing to attempt less and less. Although the story does not carry him forward through the rest of his life, you imagine that he remains an emotional cripple from these experiences for the rest of his life . . . having little faith or interest in his fellow humans.All of Hemingway's characters are emotionally crippled in one way or the other. Even if a shell does not hit them, they will never be the same from their war experiences. Whether they are driven by fear, love, or duty, the result is the same -- a disillusioned numbness that limits their ability to be alive. When pressed by the exigencies of the moment, each retreats to lick his or her wounds . . . cut off effectively from support. Whatever fine or infamous human emotion drives them, also condemns them.One of the particularly haunting aspects of the book is the portrayal of war as unending and inescapable. A modern reader naturally knows when World War I ended. At the time, people wondered if it would go on for a hundred years. That despair is well captured here. Another unforgettable feature is raising the question of who the enemy really is. Lieutenant Henry discovers that those be befriends, his allies, and nature itself can be even more dangerous to him than the military enemy ever has been. You get a chilling sense of the dark side of civilization that few novels even attempt to portray.Hemingway left Illinois at 17 to join the Kansas City Star as a reporter. He volunteered with the Red Cross in World War I at 18, first serving on the French front and later with the Italians. He was severely wounded in Italy, and was awarded the Italian Croce di Guerra. The first third of the book probably mirrors his own experiences very closely, and you will find a youthful vividness in those pages that will effectively put you amongst the battles and the boring sameness of waiting in between.Many have considered what man's inhumanity to man really means. World War I was one of the greatest examples of this terrible tendency. Reading this book provides a good opportunity to reconsider your own views about the meaning of such times in human history, and what the right things are to do. Imagine that you are any of the characters in this book. What could and should you have done differently? What would have been the probable consequences? What would have been the meaning of your decisions and actions? What lessons can you apply from this today?Basically, this book argues that moral progress only occurs through suffering. How else have you learned? How else could you learn? What does that mean about Hemingway's thesis?Look for the best . . . as well as seeing the best in the worst."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This is one of, if not the greatest novel written in the 20th century. Hemingway makes every step unpredictable and even exciting. This book has many twists and turns that shocked me. Every book has its flaws though. I am repulsed by the World Wars; contrary to many of my friends and families beliefs. This is the only major flaw in this novel, in my opinion. I would suggest that every household in America should have a copy on their bookshelves."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"It was good except for the dialogue.

His use of language is powerful and shows his skill as a writer. The integration of theme, subject, and setting make a novel that is an example of Hemingway's ability as a writer. It is not difficult to read or understand. The settings and characters are well done. I would highly recommend reading it."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Does A Farewell to Arms stand the test of time? Hemingway's autobiographical, dark vision of war is perhaps more in step with Post-Vietnam sensibilities than other World War One literature; the banter between protagonist Lt. Frederick Henry (a tribute to The Red Badge of Courage, whose hero is Henry Frederick) and his roommate, Rinaldi could easily have come from Hawkeye and Trapper. Yet it is the tender love story between Henry and Catherine Barkley which is the soul of the novel, and what keeps readers returning to it for 60 years now. The lustful scenes of nurse Catherine climbing under the covers with her recuperating patient (the details discreetly omitted) seem quaint by today's standards. And Catherine as &quot;fallen woman&quot; no longer plays to today's reader. Yet what could be more romantic than Henry and Catherine fleeing across the lake under cover of darkness to the sanctuary of Switzerland, or more gut-wrenching than Catherine's battle for life on the delivery table? Its often said that you either love Hemingway or hate him. A Farewell to Arms is Hemingway at the top of his game--if you don't love it you clearly fall into the latter category."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This book is worth the read, especially if you're they kind of person who has trouble with words more than two syllables long. I liked Hemingway's method of character analysis, finding it particularly refreshing after slogging though jigsaw-puzzle-esque writing by Faulkner. But the diolague sometimes left a little to be desired. Reread the conversation when Catherine tells Frederick she's pregnant and you'll see what I mean. But overall the book's ok."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"&quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; is truly a masterpiece. It leaves you asking questions. An answer to questions is sometimes thrown casually into the narration here and there. The narrator truly shares his experiences with you and does not simply tell a story but takes you into his thought and leaves you to draw some of your own conclusions of human nature and emotion. The first half of the book is about a man in war and the meaningless things that he practises as escape or to duty. He and the book make a transformation to a much more conscious state of emotion and drags you along for the ride. Hemingway's expert descriptiveness puts you into the stage of the story so that you can visualize all of it and he does it with an amazingly minimal amount of words or useless information that so often takes away from many authors effectiveness to convey the feeling of the story. It is beautifully composed so that you want to experience it yourself because you become so entangled in the character's emotions. One of the best pieces I have ever read."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Farewell has such a tragic ending I sobbed, not cried with tears but just sobbed as if I had lost something irrevocably. The last third of the book is quite powerful, but I certainly thought For Whom the Bell Tolls was a better book. The comments here about thinly developed characters certainly strike me as valid, and I wonder if Hemingway meant to do it deliberately (why?). Sometimes Hemingway juxtaposes images of love and innocence with images of the cold and hard cruelty of life all in one paragraph. This can be enlightening and depressing at the same time. Again, though, the delivery in For Whom the Bell Tolls was smoother and less heavy-handed."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I read this book for school, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. It was extremely sad and touching at the end. However, I would not rate A Farewell to Arms as one of the best books of the century. Hemingway has his talents, but I feel Catch-22 is a much deeper and more powerful read than A Farewell to Arms. Read Catch-22 first, then read A Farewell to Arms. The two have some interesting parallels (escape from the insanities of war, refuge in a neutral country, heroes in similar situations etc). But Catch-22 will keep you thinking for longer. It is by far the greater book."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I've read all of the reviews, good and bad, of this novel, and I can pretty much agree with all of them. The ones that praise it highly because it is a commentary on life and war are justified, but so are the ones that lambaste it based on its inane and tiresome dialogue, and weak characterization. It's a very easy book to read, and its fairly entertaining, but it didn't hit me like most &quot;classics&quot; do. I don't know what that exactly means, but I found myself critizing the book as I was reading it, instead of enjoying it, which can't be good :) It's worth the time to read it (especially since it shouldn't take you more than a week) because of its anti-war thesis, but it wouldn't be the kind of book I'd buy to keep on my shelf."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"well, hemmingway sure was in his right mind when he wrote this novel. A masterpiece, if you will. although it was very hard to get into at first, the books plot, and characters made me stick to it."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"It's been a long time since I've read Hemingway, so it took me a few chapters to get used to his writing style and to get into the story. The depictions of battle weren't as brutal as, say, All Quiet on the Western Front, and Henry's romance with nurse Catherine Barkley delivered a nice reprieve from the front line action. This novel definitely delivers commentary on solders' disenchantment with war, especially with Henry's role as an American officer in the Italian army. It also illustrates the presence of tragedy off the battlefield as Henry's idyllic life is shattered. At times I found myself bemused at his detachment and indifference in the face of personal misfortune. Overall, this is a classic novel that has endured for a reason."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"\\"A Farewell to Arms\\" is a classic piece of literature from one of the most well known authors, Ernest Hemingway. Set in Italy during World War I, Frederic Henry - an American volunteer ambulance driver for the Italian army - falls in love with nurse Catherine Barkley and their love affair grows.Hemingway is famed for his short, terse prose that somehow evokes emotions through declarative sentence after declarative sentence and \\"Farewell\\" is one of the most shining examples of his style. Initially the dialogue may leave some readers wanting, as each line of dialogue is only a sentence or two at the most. The character of Catherine Barkley is interesting in that she seems to have no feelings or goal in life other than to make Frederic Henry happy - and she will do anything to make him happy."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Although a very well know author I had not read his books. It was an interesting writing style. However, the female main character was overly sweet - in the current era we'd probably call 'ditzy.' I found her very tiresome during their meeting, later escape and life together in Switzerland. The tragic ending to the story was unexpected."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"As the title indicates, I enjoyed this book. It was written in a to-the-point way that made the story move along at a nice pace. Although the main character seems pretty heartless the way he descibes things, even personal tragedies.Anyways, the book arrived soon, and in perfect condition. Which was wonderful, since I get a little OCD about bent book pages. So yep, the shipping was good, the book was fine, and the price was lower than it was in my local bookstores."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Henry is an ambulance driver during the First World War. He, like most young men, enjoys parties, drinking, gaming and women. He also witnesses the casualties of war at first hand. But then he meets Catherine, a beautiful English nurse, in Italy and all bets are off. Well, not at first. He sees her as nothing but an adventure. He doesn't love her, nor does he think he ever will. Plus, she is kind of intense and oftentimes seems almost mad. But the horrid images of war could lead a man to escape the harsh realities in different ways. There is alcohol, but there is also romance. But harsh realities could be found everywhere. You don't have to be fighting a war to encounter tragedy. Henry finds this out the hard way.For many years, Ernest Hemingway was not a favorite author of mine. His novels are what I'd call \\"guy lit\\" -- with lots of masculinity and debauchery. And why is it that novels set on WWI are automatically considered to be literary and great? There is also the matter that most of his male leads are alcoholics. I realize that his novels, or at least several of them, are pretty autobiographical, but I've never been fond of his characters doing things like forcing a nurse to sneak alcohol into his hospital room or waking up in his own vomit. Having said that, I enjoyed A Farewell to Arms the second time around. I was able to get into Henry's mind and the things that transpire between him and Catherine. The novel has some ironic twists and wonderful symbolism, and my heart goes out to these characters. So, yes, now I see why Hemingway is one of the most respected twentieth century American authors. I look forward to rereading The Sun Also Rises."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms is one of Hemingway's masterpieces.The story focuses on the love affair between anAmerican medic and a British nurse during the Italian campaign in WWI. Hemingway was a medic inItaly whose first love was with the nurse who was assigned to him. It is replayed in the Jake Barnes- Britt Ashley relationship in The Sun Also Rises and is at the center of this novel with the Fred Henry and Catherine Barkley relationship.This relationship is compelling and one cares about both people though one senses that it will not turn out well in the end, The military aspects especially the Italian retreat from Caporetto are also realistic and well done and I confess that Ilike Hemingways terse laconic style and his tough dialogue so that is also a major plus.Irecommend this novel highly. Hemingway was no pacifist but the novel shows the folly of WWI a war that could have been avoided with some intelligent diplomacy and leadership among the heads of nations who started the conflict"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms is a very moving story. I like Hemingway's style of writing very much. I can read and re-read his books. In the meantime I also bought the audible version of A Farewell To Arms and hearing and reading at the same time is a wonderful experience. So I did with this book and I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I'm sure like a lot of people, \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" was required reading back in high school. I'm also sure there were enough students from this group who, like myself, walked away from the reading with little appreciation for this classic. Well, I recently re-read this Hemingway masterpiece and was astonished at how good it is. Ah, the cluelessness of youth.Even though the book was written 80 years ago, it still comes across as decidedly modern. Part of this emanates from the prose itself, sparse and readable yet shocking with what it says without actually saying it. Granted, the modernity of this prose stems more from writers today adopting Hemingway's style than Hemingway being prescient about the ways of future writers, but it's still a sign of greatness. And the one trait which definitely illustrates how ahead of its time \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" is lies in the way in which Hemingway puts across his thesis on the absurdities of war. For post-Vietnam War American readers, tales of the horrors and the atrocities of war are nothing new. Today we're more apt to read a story (fiction or non-fiction, it doesn't matter) about a military defeat or brutal war crime as we are to read about a victory or a glorious action by a noble soldier. But imagine a person in 1929 reading the scene from \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" describing the rout of the Italian army. Or the scene where Lt. Henry is taken prisoner with other officers and threatened with execution by his fellow soldiers. At a time when the horrors of the Marne were a generation past and the terrors of Omaha Beach or Chosin or Khe Sanh were still generations away, what must have been those readers' reactions? And how different were they from those of someone from these jaded times?But Hemingway's prose and antiwar sentiments are talked about by everyone who reads \\"A Farewell to Arms,\\" and they are not the only themes involved. Another overwhelming aspect that I picked up on revolves around Lt. Henry's detachment from everything in his life. The man is clearly moving through the world with zero emotion whatsoever. The poignancy in this is revealed by the fact that most of the novel centers on his purported love for Catherine. Why the dichotomy? Is it simply a continuation of the \\"war is hell\\" theme, showing that men one step away from death are just mentally incapable of dealing with anything else? Or is it something autobiographical, with Hemingway drawing from his wartime experience to show a different side of the all-encompassing machismo inherent in most of this stories? Or maybe it simply adds another layer to the Frederic character, shining a light for the reader on some classic universal truths? It definitely makes you think. The thing is, Catherine is just as bad as him. In order to maintain the illusion that he is a suitable replacement for her dead fiancee, Catherine must engage in a level of detachment equal to, if not greater than, Frederic's. Only through such detachment can she ignore the glaring problems within the man she claims to love. In the end, it leaves you with the uneasy feeling that these two couldn't care less for one another, yet are perfectly suited for one another.I'm sure there are other aspects to \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" that I missed on this re-reading. What was the point of the Rinaldi character? Or Count Greffi? And what about all the game playing? All of these elements point to some larger picture, but it's still too subtle for me to pick up. Sounds like a third reading is in the near future for me."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"In A FAREWELL TO ARMS, the texture, pace, and content of the social interaction is absolutely spot-on when Lieutenant Frederic Henry, Hem's protagonist, mixes with his fellow officers, the soldiers in his command, various bartenders, and several nurses who mother him. While Frederic shows a slightly different face in each group, he is generally succinct, generous, self-aware, and subtle in his social mastery. IMHO, this Frederic is a genuine literary achievement and a reason, by himself, to read this terrific anti-war novel. At a minimum, AFtA certainly demonstrates that Hemingway has a fabulous gift for capturing manly rapport and virile presence.At the same time, Hem doesn't seem to know how to handle Catherine Barkley, his only significant female character. In her presence, Hem seems out of his element, and the interaction between the sexes seems to contain only empty expressions. \\"You're awfully nice,\\" is typical. Maybe Hem is saying that love is doomed during war and that lovers are reluctant to probe their commitment. Still, a couple together as much as Frederic and Catherine would enjoy some lighter or more natural moments, wouldn't they?Nonetheless, the force driving this novel is The Great War, with the war-weary Frederic serving in the Italian army, suffering a serious wound, enjoying a discreetly sexy convalescence, returning to battle, and then making his separate (but tragic) peace. As told by Hemingway, this story abounds with male sports--mess hall razing, military duty, battle, and bold survival--that bring out the best in his terse style. When mortar shells explode in Frederic's shallow trench, for example, a writer who describes through sequences of quick impressions can be completely true to the moment.AFtA achieves its status as a classic of American literature in Book III, when the Austrians and Germans break through the Italian lines and the Italian army undertakes a pathetic retreat, where the biggest threat is friendly fire. Then, the arbitrary dimension of war comes into perfect but non-polemical focus as Frederic, ready to regroup to make a stand, tries to cross the wooden bridge at the Tagliamento River. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"In order to express his dislike for war and clearly demonstrate the devastating effects of it, Hemingway wrote A Farewell to Arms. The book has had a lot of fame behind its name; and its contents stand up to its title. Hemingway successfully conveys the stark aura of any war through his depressing diction and images of bareness.The book's plot moves very fast, bringing forth more interest from the reader. It is set in an Italy during World War I. The main character Henry arrives at the war front with an easy attitude. But then the war came; he falls deeply in love with a nurse and the couple attempts to escape the devastating war, failing miserably in the end. It is within mere pages that the main character meets his girlfriend and falls in love with her. This fast moving plot, however, does not mean that Hemingway left out any details. Almost every chapter contains a description of the environment--the deteriorating image of the trees and rivers near the war region. But it is wrong to assume that the book is all about war and killing for there is a good deal of humor and love that constitutes to the plot of the story.Unlike other stories, which are either all Utopian or dystopian, A Farewell to Arms is a hybrid of the two kinds. The ending is very realistic; it is neither sad nor joyous.The Farewell to Arms is a good book to spend the time for. Its being related to war enhances the plot line and makes the book more interesting for the reader. It may not be the best book ever written but it is still rewarding to read the book."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I don't have much time to read books and this is my first book of Hemingway, and I just finished reading it tonight. Well, I have to say that the whole book just immersed myself into the story which leads up to the final few pages that make me feel that all this pages of writing pay off in the end. It is a great book that might seem a little boring at times, but don't be disppointed at that point, because that's how a good story should proceed before it reaches the climax. You will realize that without reading all the events and knowing how these two are loving each other before the ending, you couldn't have felt what the author is preparing you to feel.So be patient, and you will be gald that you were. Terrific book, unforgettable ending!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms is a story of love, war, and the inevitability of the terrible. It is told in a distinctly Hemingway style that confused me when I first started reading it. The writing is terse, though occasionally descriptive, and the story is told through Lieutenant Henry. This style complements the plot, but can lead to confusion. Henry's distance from the war in the beginning of the novel can be immediately seen in his description of the war in the first chapter, but when reading this it is nearly impossible to feel what the soldiers must have felt. Only by utilizing the imagination can one enter the soldiers' minds and the minds of other characters. If the Hemingway style is appealing though, A Farewell to Arms can be read with minimal frustration. For readers not particularly interested in the horrors of war, the love affair between Catherine and Henry can make the novel interesting. Though he does not often describe his passionant love, Henry's actions show that he is deeply in love with Catherine. Fans of Hemingway should read A Farewell to Arms, though those who are overly-sensitive, easily confused, or enlisted in the army probably should not."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"While I knew that Hemingway would not give me a heart-warming tale, I kept hoping against hope that this novel would have a &quot;happy&quot; ending. Alas, it does not. This is to be expected. However, the novel is gorgeous not only in its style but also in its story. While the story of Henry and Catherine does not end happily, the events contained between the two covers is beautiful. It is a classic tale of undying and complete love. Why, if such a glowing review only four stars? Easily answered: I was depressed by the ending. While I knew it was coming, I didn't want it to. I would have much rather had the book end with the two lovers entering Switzerland. But, this would have been uncharacteristic of Hemingway."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"In reading A Farewell to Arms, one is able to truly understand the many passions that abound within the souls of men...Hemingway's masterpiece, which details the epic struggle between life and death, between love and courage during the Great War, induces in the reader a whirlwind of emotions, beginning with trepidation and ending with an emptiness unrivaled in modern literature...It is, in its barest and also in its most complicated form, a passionate love story interrupted by spells of reality..By way of the author's customary, journalistic-type prose, and his conscious omission of superflous verbatim, the emotions of the characters and those of the reader become one...at the very end of the tale, however, the spirit of the lovers is abruptly retracted, and the reader is left sitting alone, forced to contemplate what just happened...that the novel can seem brief while simulateneously depicting a long, arduous war march, is certainly a credit to the author, and is partly what makes A Farewell to Arms one of the great novels of the Twentieth Century."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Seven decades after the intial publication, A Farewell to Arms now seems to be the Hemingway novel that gets the most attention and many readers new to Hemingway are probably drawn to it for their initial exposure to the author. Normally, starting off with a writer's best book might be a good approach, but not in this case. A Farewell to Arms, while Hemingway's greatest work, also offers the uninitiated reader the greatest challenge. This is as terse as it gets, and if you're not familiar with Hemingway's style, you may find yourself wondering what all the fuss is about. Worse, you may become one of those millions of intelligent, well-read people who think he is a horrible joke. Start with a few of the short stories. Read some of the criticism (positive and negative). Do a little research on WWI (if you feel you need to). Then go for The Sun Also Rises. At that point, you will be hooked, or you will write the guy off forever. If you find yourself in the former category, you will really appreciate the opportunity to read this incredible book."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"i feel sorry for all you people who thought that this book was bad. this is one of the best books ever written. anything written by hemingway is going to be an excellent book. if you like hemingway there's no way that you won't like this. it's classic hemingway and it is a great love story. it's one of the saddest books that i have ever read."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"&quot;Fairwell To Arms&quot; was no easy reading because the development of the story was very slow. I think that Hemingway was trying to express the sadness of war, and also the loneliness that accompanies it. Even though Henry thought that Katherin would give him happiness and to forget about the war, he was still alone and sad at the end. It shows Hemingway's pessimistic view in life. Throughout the book, Henry was always drinking. I wonder if Henry drank all the time was because he didn't want to feel the pain of war and to think at all. His complete indulgence of Katherin was also another escape for him to avoid feeling anything about the war. It is a tragedy."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"As I read the first chapter I didn't imagine myself finishing the book. The repetitive descriptions were uninteresting. However, the more I read the book, the more I found myself enjoying Hemingway's work. I got caught up in finding the outcome of Frederick's love affair and the war. As always when reading a book you learn to look at certain thing at a different perspective."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"As the first hemmingway piece I have read, AFTA was interesting and entertaining at some parts, banal and boring at others. Though it combines a captivating love story and the Great War in Europe, I found the novel leaving me alittle flat at parts. I enjoyed many of the characters int he novel, such as the super-stud Rinaldi and the young, confused priest. However, after Book 3 of the novel, we lose some of the more entertaining characters and are barraged with less-described figures. The dialogue in the story was also a bit distasteful in its simplicity, and I found myself confused at parts becasue I had read it too fast. But the simple text also allows the book to move a bit smoother at parts as well. Overall, AFTA was a relatively entertaining novel, despite its flaws. If you enjoyed it, I would suggest reading otehr Hemmingway pieces. If not, read &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; by Harper Lee."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Every person needs to read this novel by Ernest Hemingway. This book has everything. For all of the &quot;action&quot; people, there is a war. For all of the &quot;romantics&quot;, there is a love story. And for all of the &quot;others&quot;, there is everything else.This book uniquely expresses life from the male point of view. Frederick Henry lets us into his life while he participates in World War I. We grow with the characters and start to experience their emotions.This was the first Hemingway book I have read and I loved it. His style compelled my interests and it left me wondering what was going to happen next. Hemingway creates a suspense that lets our imaginations explore the situation.I recommend this book to anyone. It was excellent and a good learning experience. Hemingway truly has a style of his own."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms is perhaps the most tragic love story of the novel format, written by the master himself. (For those of you who think Hemingway can't write, please send me a copy of your Nobel Prize and your comparable achievements to The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms, and The Old Man and the Sea, as well as any and all war correspondance you may be the author of. I am awaiting anxiously.) The simplicity of the language, as always, only highlights the dead-on choice of words and descriptions. I won't spend much time on the plot - the romance takes place during World War I, mostly in a military hospital - but the last few pages are as masterful and devestating as anything I have ever read. What a book!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This was one of the most boring books I've read recently. I'd only read a few of Hemingway's short stories before this, and I liked them, so I wasn't prepared for his novels to be such a step down. I'm not denying he was brilliant, but at short stories, not the longer form. I'm even willing to read more of his books to see if it's true that not all of his books are as flat and boring as this one and certain others. I think the most advanced word in this book is \\"silhouette\\"; the rest reads like a story a third grader could have come up with, though even a third grader could write a more complex story, with more complex words and emotions. The only exciting and involving part of the book for me was after page 200, when Henry is escaping from being shot together with the other soldiers, holding on to the piece of driftwood and floating through the river. After he reached the hotel it got boring again, and there were still a bit over a hundred pages left to go.I felt absolutely nothing for these people. They had about as much depth as paper dolls, and it doesn't help matters any that they rarely say more than ten words at a time to one another. Catherine talks like a two year old, \\"Ooh, I love you, do you love me? I love you, darling. Why don't we get married?\\" Even a Barbie doll would have more depth of emotion if it came to life! At best I felt bad for the baby for maybe five seconds at most. A thirteen year old couple in love could do a better and more mature job of expressing their feelings for one another. And the prose just drags; nearly every passage reads something like \\"It was cold. It was dark. It was raining again. The train began to move. I was cold. I poured myself a tenth glass of cognac.\\" Not exactly prose that leaps off of the page and makes you feel emotionally involved with the characters.The love story was also a far stretch. Wasn't Catherine going with Henry's pal Rinaldi when they first met? And already on their first excuse of a date they're declaring they love one another, even though Henry admits to himself he doesn't really love her. I rolled my eyes; not another love story lacking discernable motivation, like the ones in 'Anna Karenina' or 'Doctor Zhivago'! (Although at least I felt emotionally involved with those characters, even though their love stories weren't given much explanation in the way of motivation.) God forbid there might have been any sexual or romantic tension instead of having characters fall into one another's arms after barely saying five words to one another.There are some nice descriptive pieces in here, and I really liked the part where Henry is escaping, but other than that it just falls flat. After this disappointment, it will be awhile before I choke down another Hemingway novel. I hope it's true that not all of his books are as boring and lifeless as this one was."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"While there are aspects of this novel that I liked, it mainly caused me to remember why I put down \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" half unread many years ago in high school--I am not a fan of Papa's writing style. What I did enjoy was re-visiting some sights in Northern Italy and Switzerland as they likely were in the early twentieth century, and in this Hemingway's reporting has the ring of truth. And some of the dialogue is witty; I especially enjoyed the advice of the local Swiss on which city is best for winter sports. The religious theme that threaded the novel was well done and lightly drawn. But the lengthy dialogue between Freddie and Cathy is leaden as a fishing weight. These two are not Beatrice and Benedict, and unfortunately, the success of this novel depends on giving these two lovebirds at least some appeal. They had little to me. Also I lacked the patience to sort out many of the characters who pop in and out of the novel; most are just window dressing for our handsome lovers' great romance. OK, maybe Papa intended this to be the backdrop for an anti-war story, and as one, it is not bad. Moreover, the finale had real and painful poignance. Unfortunately it was preceeded by two chapters dripping with saccharine-laced Swiss chocolate as our two proclaimed their bliss in a chalet for a few months, unfettered by work of any kind, with money to burn. I can recommend this as a window into the views of a TR-style American aristocrat with a matured Boy's Life view of the world in the early twentieth century. But as a piece of literature, I cannot place it highly."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"The first Hemingway I read, as university freshman. Was reading during a boring English class, came to the part where blood drips onto the hero's head in an ambulance, and then I passed out temporarily. It got me out of the rest of the English class.I read in a biography that Hemingway wrote so accurately both historically and geographically that some Italian historians believed he'd witnessed the fighting in and above the Isonzo/Soca Valley personally. He didn't, he got no further east than the Piave Valley. The fighting described takes place in the Slovenian Alps, then Austria, east of Tarcento, and very far east of Belluno. In Kobarid, Slovenia, in the valley of the fighting, we visited a small war museum in 1997, maybe the world's most impressive: photos of soldiers with faces half shot off, and other carnage, very effective in curing any foolish notion that war is romantic. Nothing in the book reflects the horror of the war like the displays in this museum, which contain photos of soldiers, emplacements, and fighting far above the treeline in the Alps in the dead of winter. At the entrance of the museum hangs an enormous poster showing Hemingway's face, and you can buy A Farewell to Arms in any of five languages there.The worst fighting of the war between the Austrians and Italians took place in the Isonzo Valley. The book remains one of my favorites, in memory. For a somewhat comical \\"Heimat\\" film made after the war, showing the fighting between the Austrian Kaiserj&auml;ger and the Italian Alpini at Col d' Lana in the Dolomites, see \\"Berg in Flammen\\" staring the popular mountaineer Luis Trenker. This fighting took place at the same altitude as the war in the Soca Valley, on very steep, high, ice and snow covered rock. You can get the video from amazon.de, but you will then need an international video player to view it (Europe uses 50/sec, not 60/sec frequency AC current)."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"It's World War I. There's death and dispair and darkness everywhere and yet amidst all the anguish, there comes the tale of two lovers and their sad struggle to live a complete life. It's the daring anti-war classic from the late great Ernest Hemmingway- A Farewell to Arms!Sounds pretty promising, huh? Let's see how it REALLY is.First things first, the Lovers-Fred Henry is an American in the Italian army. He begins the story feeling rather mildly about the war and life in general until he accidentally falls in love and things begin to change. He is a totally self-absorbed, unsympathetic dick. He narrates the story and yet somehow we get little insight into any of his deeper emotions or motives. I literally hated him by the end.Catherine Barkley is a beautiful English nurse who Henry falls for. She's still healing from her last lovers death when she meets him. At first she seems like she might turn out to be at least somewhat intresting, but the hope vanishes everytime she opens her mouth. She is shallow, moronic, ridiculous, and one of the most unrealistic and dislikable females characters I've ever read. Henry, however, falls desperately in love with her and her thick head of blond hair.Next we have the plot-As you know, it's WWI. Things aren't going so well. Henry mets Catherine. Henry gets injured and falls in love with Catherine. They spend almost all their time remarking how \\"sweet\\" and \\"fine\\" the other is and reassuring eachother they're really in love. Then they have some sex and Catherine gets pregnant. Henry cares somewhat. He's then forced to go back to war, however, but not before Catherine tells him she feels like a whore when he takes her to a hotel. This is the only intresting thing she ever says but she quickly retracts the statement as to not upset dear, darling Henry. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Henry deserts the army. This is one of the few exciting parts. Unfortunately, though, Henry soon goes back to Catherine. This is where is book takes a turn for the worst. The lovers breifly share happiness until Catherine has her baby, the baby dies and at last Catherine dies. Tragic.My Opinion-The book is dull. When Catherine died I was just glad the book was over. The prose in this novel is some of the most boring and terse I've ever read. The dialouge is some of the most irriating. Between Henry's emotionless \\"Yes\\", \\"No\\"s, and \\"All right\\"s and Catherine's pointless, opinionless chatter, I'm not sure how anyone could be grabbed or moved in the slightest. Neither character had much going for them and I couldn't care less about their miserable fates. Hemmingway could have turned this into something so much better if only he gave his readers some likeable people who we could love and relate to. I don't know about the rest of you, but I thought his was the biggest waste of an idea ever. Cheers!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Classic or no classic, this book is boring. The only thing that was fairly interesting was the description of the war, and that's about it. The characters, ahm, what characters? Are these people for real? Lt. Henry (a two-dimentional robot in need of AA) and the nurse, oh please, she must be about 10 years old and bland as a spinach on top of that. And when these two get to talk, oh my, I had more fun reading transcripts of communications between control tower and the airplanes at the airport.As to writing, well, this is a second book of Hemingway's thatI've read (the first was Garden of Eden) and they both could have been written by a 5th grader. Folks, there is really nothing to it, YOU can do it too. In your spare time or on coffee break. The only problem is, no self-respecting publisher would actually publish such prose in today's day and age.Overall: don't bother with this book. Try F. Scott Fitzgerald (surprise, this guy can ACTUALLY write!), or Steinbeck or Faulkner or just about anyone else. At least that will be a time well spent.I gave Hemingway two chances to improve. He hasn't. I won't bother with him anymore."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I also read this because I have heard a great deal about Hemingway. I have previously read The Old Man and the Sea, and really enjoyed that. But this book was torture.Someone else mentioned the dialogue, and they're right. It is the worst dialogue I have EVER read. I dare you to find people who talk like that! I know the book was written in the 50's or so, but there's no way people have ever spoken like this. Maybe the characters all had shell shock...And the whole love affair seemed strange. The girl hardly knew the central character, and was talking about love on the first date, all the while the guy didn't seem to care about her. I found myself hoping they would break up, just to move on. But, they don't. So, I skipped half the book and read the end. I suggest the same.Anyway, if you are looking to read Hemingway, I can only advise you to skip this book. Life is short, read a good one."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This has to be one of the worst books ever written. I don't understand the mystique surrounding Hemingway. There is no character development, the dialogue is juvenile and stilted and there is very little plot.

He is unrivaled in his descriptive style and his ability to make the reader see, hear, taste, smell, and feel everything he is experiencing at the time of writing.

I feel as though I am suddenly taken aside and caught in a war. Fighting not with my home country, or even for myself at times. Even when I am at my lowest, which can be quite often, I see an image of beauty that holds me right. A 'nurse' to my mind and spirit. Throughout the night my mind returns to this story of passion as depicted by Ernest Hemingway. I feel as though I were the one running away from the Italian army and seeking a quiet place to just feel the warmth of Catherine, my life. I am Henry, for A Farewell to Arms is so well layed upon my mind, I remember the story as it were my own past. May I never forget"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This pellmelled story was not only dissapointing but highly sad. My brain could not take the boredom come on Hemingway this story made you go down the drain. I highly recommend that you take a nice sedative before engaging in this book. Otherwise it will reak havoc on your brain. The story ws dumb the relationship between Henry and Caroline pointless. I do not recommend this story to anyone."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I only started reading Hemingway a couple of years ago, yet I have become a huge fan of Papa Hemingway. His brutally economic writing style is simply fascinating. A masterful command of the English language!\\"A farewell to arms\\" is the unforgettable story of this novella's protagonist, Lt. Frederic Henry (often referred to as Tenente). He was an American who during the World War I volunteered to serve for the Italian Army Ambulance Corps. He becomes the first American to be wounded in the war, and later receives the \\"Medal of Valor\\" for his deeds. Co-protagonist, Catherine Barkley, a beautiful British nurse, was working at the hospital where Tenente was later admitted after getting injured in the war.Shortly after Catherine and Tenente met, they started their affair. In the beginning of their affair, Henry was thinking of this purely as a way to pass time, and did not plan to get serious at all. But we all know that feelings can't be planned nor controlled, and soon enough their affair turned serious for both of them.Seldom is there a more hazardous combination than love and war. It is the love story that drives this novel forward, combined with the account of the war. It is easy to detect Hemingway's first hand familiarity with the World War I. This is Hemingsway's story, his endeavour to put into words the emotions he experienced, the environment that he was surrounded by, and the people he got to know.All characters are very well developed. The fact that every character is so very well developed with Hemingway's brutally spare style, makes it even more impressive. One of my favourites is Henry's friend, the priest Rinaldi whom believes in traditional values and who constantly suffers from the other soldier's teasing because of his beliefs.This novel represents a landmark in the genre of war fiction. It held my attention from beginning to end. It is a timeless classic, and I couldn't recommend it higher!A great read!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Poor Ernest! Rather than retaining his modernist importance, his &quot;unadorned with a vengeance&quot; style and macho persona have fallen the way of parody and this, his &quot;best&quot; novel, clearly shows why. As with so many stylistic extremists, one finds oneself focusing on the writing and not on the written (the former bizarre, the latter dull and unconvincing). And his adoring women, &quot;hot&quot; for the hero, remind me of an old Mae West movie where the men, for no better reason than they were written that way, are constantly praising the invisible charms of our heroine. Time has moved on; so should we."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This is not a great book. It is not a good book. It is not even a fair book. This is a poor book. The plot is dull and pointless. The characters are hollow. The sentence structures are uninspired. I could not finish the book. Life is too short. Hemingway writes sentences like this. They are short and bland. Noun-verb-noun. Noun-verb-adjective. One dull sentence after another. Some sentences occur with no context to the surrounding text. It was raining and I drank some vermouth. After a while this becomes annoying. Wouldn't you agree? Do you feel your eyes just skimming the text? Not impressed with the writing? Not caring what will be said next? That's how I felt.Arrrrrgh ... (Breaking out of Hemingway-English.)My three year-old nephew speaks in longer, more complex sentences than this &quot;giant&quot; of literature, and he also has more interesting things to say! I stopped reading this book near the halfway point, after suffering through one shallow, directionless chapter after another. Despite conventional opinion, Hemingway did no great service to American literature in popularizing a style of writing such as this. Give me Melville; give me Twain; give me Poe or Hawthorne or Steinbeck or a hundred other American authors who wrote memorable stories with true style. But PLEASE don't give me any more &quot;Papa&quot; Hemingway."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I really don't like reading things that are classroom books or because it is historical... (*yawn*), but this book was definately good. I was living in Italy at the time a lady gave me this book, and practically forced me to read it. I am forever grateful. Being in the military gave me a little perspective of why the main character went AWOL for love. But on one note, I was lost a couple of times by the way it is written."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"After reading Ernest Hemingway's short stories viz \\"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\\" and \\"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\\" (which were just tooooooooo good), I was a bit disappointed to read \\"A Farewell to arms\\". I have no intention of sounding contrarion, however for some reason, I found it mediocre from start to finish(The only reason I completely read it was because it was a Hemingway).Story seemed very plain & straight forward. The love between Henry & Catherine seemed very boring. The war was poorly captured. Some part of story seemed just too unreal. For example ... the chapter in which Henry & other folks retreat from war front and head back, they kill their own captain without any remorse(how is that possible?). Later on one of their own guy gets killed by their own people(Italians). Again no remorse is captured.I just find it totally unreal. Any human being in the above situations would have felt/exhibited intense remorse(hmmm ... or was it my expectation based on the war movies I have seen ...)All in all, I was not that impressed with \\"A Farewell to Arms\\". It could very well be due to my high expectations. Or could be that we live in a different world now and thus it is difficult to identify with the story.None-the-less ... I would say, read it just because it is a Hemingway and for no other reason.-Sachin"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"\\"A Farewell to Arms\\" is an intriguing, classic tale of love and war. Written with an autobiographical spin by Ernest Hemmingway, he introduces the main character, Frederick Henry, an American, who serves as a lietenant in the Italian army during World War I. In the midst of the fighting (accompanied with Henry's pessimism and hatred for the war), he meets a beautiful British nurse by the name of Catherine Barlkey. Now, one cannot truthfully say that it is love at first sight for the couple, as they are constantly playing games with their emotions toward eah other. I found this section of the novel rather amusing and it seemed a pretty acurate representation of many young lovers. When Henry is injured on the front lines, however, he is sent to Milan for proper medical care where Catherine is transfered to, as well. The two engage in a steamy affair. I had to smile when the book told of Henry pulling Catherine into his hospital bed to make love with her and Catherine's constant fear of being caught. However, if you do the math, where there's a cause, there's also an effect. Catherine soon found herself pregnant with Henry's child. The two decide to move in together and somoetimes speak of getting married to make the baby legitimate. I'll leave it at that, but this is not where the novel concludes. The ending, however, certainly threw me for a loop. While I can't say that I'll be putting this book at the top of my list, it was a delight to experience. I'll end on a note about Hemmingway's writing: some say it's poetic, but I thought it was rather annoying until I got used to it and had it grow on me. Pick up \\"A Farewell to Arms\\"--see what you think!!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I was actually looking forward to reading this but from page one I couldn't keep my eyes open. The characters had all the personality of wood chips! Infact, it would be more interesting to sit and watch the dog poop in my back yard petrify! I have never read such a boring book in all my life. It was EXTEREMLY hard to finish. It actually took me 1 month! And if I had to hear GOD'S name in vain one more time I would have burned the book, but it wasn't mine so UNFORTUNATLY I couldn't!

I'm prejudiced against Hemingway anyway (for which the US may hate me for) but this book was filled with ridiculous characters and sexist themes. Hemingway just doesn't impress me--his short, superficial sentences seem to impress people in a world of silly television sitcoms, and that says a lot in itself. But I have read books of his that I liked better than this one. The romance is simply mush disguised by Hemingway's manly style and by including at least one different alcoholic beverage on each page."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Note that my evaluation of this book is that of a reader--not an English professor, or a lit/crit grad student, or historian. I am sure the book has many merits from those perspectives, where it fits in as far as the canon of American Lit., war books, etc. However, as a novel to be picked up and read for enjoyment, it must rank as one of the most boring and stilted I have come across. It goes nowhere. Nothing much happens for pages at a time. The dialogue is uninteresting, and the characters are surprisingly predictable and one dimensional."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I choose to read A Farewell to Arms, because my grandpa said it was a good book. He also said it was very well known. So I thought I should read this well known book...The main character is the narrator. He has been wounded in World War 1 and has been moved to Paris. There he is serveing as a corespondent. He is fighting for the Italians, which is weird because he is English. While in Paris he has met a nurse named, Cathrine, who is in love with him....

And I have to conclude that if a main character dies in a book, and you actually feel good about it, you can safely say that the story was more than a little lacking.Let's stop kidding ourselves. This is an awful book, and frankly, Hemingway isn't a great writer either. To heck with this being a &quot;classic&quot;: It's dull, borderline-pointless, and worst of all badly written. Numerous times I was reading the book, I thought to myself, I could write something so much better than this!The main character, Frederic Henry, is so lacking in a personality that I'd be hard-pressed to list five character traits that he possesses. Catherine, his love interest, isn't any better. The dialogue is so mundane and repetitive that you'll wonder what in the world ol' Ernest was thinking when he penned it. Perhaps he took one too many swigs at that whiskey or vermouth or cognac or the 273 other alcoholic beverages that are named throughout the novel.I gave this two stars simply for Rinaldi, the only halfway-entertaining character in the entire book. Do yourself a favor and move onto bigger and better things."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"As I continue to read books that I probably should have read in HS I am constantly surprised by how much I dislike them and am convinced that the people who make these selections have no idea what it is like to be an average American male student. There is a reason why 15-18 y.o. boys generally dislike English courses in HS and I am of the opinion that it is because the people who think these selections are brilliant enter the field of education and continue the cycle of selecting books that have little or no appeal to the average male.Farewell to Arms is a dreary, monotonous, diary of inane conversations that only serve to introduce Frederic's tale of woe. The only interesting part is his escape from the police on the bridge and then their escape to Switzerland. It was a wonderful inducement to a good night's sleep for quite some time since I only read a few pages each night before falling soundly asleep."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I bought this book thinking it was going to look like the product in the images. I am was wrong. The book, is green with weird gold designs on it. Not what I was expecting or what I wanted. False advertising."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingway never ceases to amaze. His simplistic, yet profound prose proves to be a paradox in and of itself. While the sheer simplicity of his laconic dialogue may disappoint those hoping for some intensely complex and bombastic verbiage, it does, however, impress those among us who can appreciate the genius expressly confined in such brevity. What his often maligned simplicity lacks in its..well...complexity, Hemingway more than makes up for in his customary singular proclivity for superlative dialogue. Hemingway, in effect, revolutionized the art of dialogue in American literature - and, after reading A Farewell to Arms, it's easy to see why.A Farewell to Arms emanates forth the perplexing and provocative dualities of war and peace, true love and sex, hope and despair, & idealism and cynicism - to name a few. Tenente(as I prefer to call him over Frederick) is, of course, a rough transference of Hemingway himself onto paper. One can, without a doubt, see a lot of Hemingway's characteristic brusque gruffness in the protagonist throughout the novel. Tenente undergoes a stark and rather pronounced transformation, or epiphany if you will, that undoubtedly makes A Farewell to Arms one of the truly memorable works of the 20th Century.Although I wanted to throw the book against the wall after the tragic ending, I nonetheless refuse to denounce Hemingway's undeniable greatness as witnessed in A Farewell to Arms."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Having forced myself to finish Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms I wish I had put it down when I had initially lost interest. I could have read something much better.Maybe when the novel was written Hemingway's style was new and refreshing for those that read it at that time, but by todays standards its nothing special at all. On the one hand you get long winded descriptions of the environment in the story while you get little to nothing about the characters. Events take place leaving the reader confused about the specifics of characters and why they acted/reacted the ways that they did. The biggest problem, however, is the conversations between Catherine and the main character Lieutenant Henry. These conversations are quite numerous and extremely unrealistic, not to mention boring and repetitive to the point of obsurdity. It seems to be a trend for Catherine and Tenente to say everything three times. The unrealism creates characters that are not believable making the novel nearly worthless.The two parts of the story that interested me the most were vague at best. Also, it can be stated that the novel is an obvious anti-war one that has a good message. Maybe Hemingway's other works are more note worthy but stay away from this one."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I'm gonna get right to the point: this book is far from being a &quot;classic.&quot; First, look at the convoluted, obviously artificial dialogue. I almost cried because the dialogue was sooo bad. Who talks like that? I challenge anyone to defend that. Second, Hemingway's characterization in this book is by far the worst I've seen in literature. Nearly all his books are plagued with this problem, but not to this extent. Who is Henry? Who is Catherine? At the end of the book, the reader is no closer to the main characters than they were at the beginning. Catherine, for example, is the most one-dimensional character I can think of. She exists only in Henry's world. She seems like a mindless woman, who has no life of her own; I believe my old college prof. had it right when he said that Catherine was Hemingway's depiction of his &quot;masturbatory fantasy&quot; of women--namely, sex objects who lavish their men with praise, and have no lives themselves. Needless to say, since the MAIN characters aren't developed, the supporting characters seem non-existent. Can anyone name that many of them? There is Rinaldi...but all we know about him is he thinks he has syphllis. There is...Uh...Count Greffi...but I think he had too small a role to count. There is...wait, what was the name of that Spanish guy who got shot by his own side? I can't remember for some reason...he he he. I love classic literature as much as anyone. However, I would shy away from this shallow, simplistic, one-dimensional novel. Try not to be fooled by the romantic, entrapping image which Hemingway cultivated for himself-- you'll be disappointed when you see what he actually had to say. Oh, and if you want characters who will blow your mind away, read Faulkner."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Considering myself reasonably well-read, but never having delved into Hemingway, I picked up &quot;A Farewell to Arms.&quot; I was disappointed. As a 20th Century novel, it pales beside the works of Evelyn Waugh, Mikhail Bulgakov, Somerset Maugham and even John Barth. &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; has not withstood the test of time. It is shallow, dated, predictable and characters are not well-formed. For a much better novel on the World War I era, try Ford Madox Ford's &quot;Parade's End.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway is a dreadfully boring novel. The characters Catherine and Frederick, are mindless nits wrapped up in their love affair, while enlisted in World War I. I thought the book lacked a single intelligent thought throughout its contents.To me a good book is one that is thought provoking and makes one think, and when coming near the end gets a feeling as if they had befriended the characters. In a Farewell to Arms, the only thing I thought about was the frivolity of the characters and how they were devoid of any verisimilitude. I only wished that the end would come quicker so I wouldn't have to read another drawn out conversation on the reassurance of their love for another. I strongly urge any reader of books on compassion and intelligence to stray from opening A Farewell to Arms."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Frankly, I dont know what to say. I waited for a few hours after I finished it before starting to write the review.I liked the book as an old fashioned love story at certain times. The sweet cuddling in the Swiss cottage, where the simple joys of life gave it meaning, overcoming the banality of an isolated life, was beautiful (reminded me of the existential Godard masterpiece \\"Breathless\\" at times).Catherine seemed cute at times, although I could not stand her for a large part of the novel. She came across more as a chauvinistic man's fantasy woman (the faithful slavish kind that the domineering men wanted) rather than a real woman. And sometimes her \\"oh Darling, do you really love me\\" gets on your nerves.Henry as a lover and a man,comes across as hollow and again, extremely chauvinistic. Hemingway, I believe loved creating his males in this old-fashioned, dominating, virile, brave Western hero mould.Disgusting!For this reason alone, I would probably not read another Hemingway ever. He is probably the greatest misogynist I have come across in all literature. For a man at the beginning of the 20th century, such shameless display of male chauvinism is unpardonable.Also, I am less than impressed by Hemingway's \\"revolutionary\\" style. While it worked better for a smaller fast paced action packed novel like \\"Old Man and the Sea\\", for a love story, and a more layered novel such as this, I would prefer the old style much better (Yah, I know tha academic blah blah about how he ushered in a New Age in literature etc. but personally, it does not appeal to me at some places).Now, finally some nice things. This is a beautiful anti-war story.Few people have been able to strip war of its valor and patriotism, and see the human tragedies that it afflicts. Like Remarque, Hemingway's portrayal of common men, caught in the whirlwinds of political struggles, about which they care the least about, is wonderful. And, in fact, coming from a man who values the old fashioned ideals of manliness in such a fashion, it is quite surprising. If there is anything I would remember this novel for, it is the reflections about war, that the different characters have expressed at several places in the novel."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I really enjoyed reading this novel. Once you get through the slow beginning and really get into the plot, it becomes easy to read. Hemmingway has a unique way of telling the story of a young soldier in the war who falls in love. Hemmingway uses a variety of thought and snap shots that paints the picture of this soldier, Tenente, who falls in love with one of the nurses. The two faced many trials and still managed to keep their love alive. During the war it was typical of soldiers to be with many women. Although Tenente has previously been with many women he is completely taken by the nurse. The tale is like that of any other love story although Hemmingway gives it unique twists and turns that separate it from any other. I really liked the book because I feel it was extremely well written. The way Hemmingway leads you through this typical romance of the time and then gives you an unexpected and yet realistic ending is intriguing and keeps the reader interested. You easily get involved in the soldier's life, experiencing his ups and downs, highs and lows, with him. You travel with him as he escapes the army with his true love. And, yes, by the end, you cry with him, too. Anyone desiring a trip to the world in warfare and the struggles that a young couple in love face would greatly enjoy this book. I recommend it to all hopeless romantics."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I think this has to be the best work that Hemingway ever produced, and the best book that I have read. It covers everything that you want in a book. It has war, it has alcohol, it has sex, and it has a wonderful relationship between the two characters. It is a book that is good thru and thru. it is a book that I will read again and again."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A farewell to Arms, by Ernest Hemingway is in my opinion one of the greatest works of prose I have ever read. The story of two young and love struck individuals with a war all around them, and all they have is each other. Truly one of the greatest and most demanding books you'll ever read, the story not only involves the reader, but makes you feel for and with the characters and the ending which is the climax and best part of the book is indeed an emotional strain and feel for the characters. I'll even dare to say you'll enjoy every page of this book, because I know I did. The beginning is a bit slow but still very engaging and different events and characters only add to the splendor of the work. Indeed this is a very good and well-written novel, and I openly say that there would be no regret if you were to read this book, a novel that pleasantly surprised me and for that, I enjoyed it greatly."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"As the first Hemmingway text I have read, AFTA has been enjoyable and enteraining at some parts, redundant and boring at others. Though combining a captivating love story and the Great War, certain parts of the novel left me feeling alittle flat; particularly the long, miandering descriptions of the countryside and daily routines. Many characters were very interesting, such as the super-stud Renaldi, and the confused, young priest, but despite the fact that they are important characters early in the novel, Hemmingway doesn't go into great physical or psychological description of any of these important figures. Another interesting argument is the fact that though the book is written from a first person account, we still feel distant from Fredrick, the main character, in that he never gives direct descriptions of his thoughts or his emotions; only his actions are mentioned. i found myself a bit ditatched and often confused by the lack of description, but then again, it allowed the book to move a bit more smoothly. I particularly enjoyed the battle scenes, but even they seemed to lack action, in that Fredrick never truly sees combat, but instead nearly gets his leg lopped off my a AP mortar, which I found a bit distastful, and sneaks around what could either be Italian deserters or German Infantry, was suspensful until the anti-climactic escape, when the reader is expecting some real fighting to begin. In conclusion, AFTA is a novel I would recommend reading, adn if you enjoy, to read otehr Hemmingway works, and if not, read &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; by Harper Lee."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"If you like reading books which are straight forward and to the point, this book may be for you. What I did like about the book is that it realistically portrays war and that it is one of the first written, truthful tales of the horrors of war from the perspective of a soldier. The plot itself has all of the criteria needed to make a great novel. In its pages there is love, great action, and depth. There are many important issues which come up, especially those surrounding the senselessness of war. However, I simply did not like Hemingway's style of writing. There is very little description and the sentences are short and choppy. This makes the novel very bland. I am looking forward to seeing the screen adaptation"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"As a 14-year-old eighth grader, &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; was the first true classic I've ever read. It's the best written World War book that I have EVER found. Its powerful aura wouldn't let me stop reading. The symbolism in it was incredible. It really put the concept of life right in front of my face through sadness and devastation. I only wish Hemingway was alive for me to thank him"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I'm about two thirds through this book, and it's one of the most dissapointing reads of my life. If your introduction to Hemingway was The Old Man and the Sea, my advice to you is to read him no further, because you've read his best work.Firstly, his much touted writing style is horrible! His prose is flat, toneless, jarring, passionless and distant. Frankly I'm amazed by how he can make the most simple and childlike descriptions so turgid and painful to read! Secondly, the dialogue, as has been rightly pointed out by the more honest reviewers here, is incredibly boring and repetitive, and contrary to some opinions, totally unrealistic. Thirdly, the characters are two-dimensional and uninvolving, making it harder still to bear their awful dialogue!Just because Hemingway was spartan with his prose does not mean that he had an impressive style! Just because his style forces the reader to engage their imagination more than other, more descriptive authors does not mean he was a great writer, just a clever manipulator. To suggest that readers find his style dissapointing &quot;because they are more used to Stephen King&quot; is arrogance in the extreme! I find his style of writing dissapointing simply because it is bad!!All in all, I feel that Hemingway is totally overrated and undeserving of the praise the literary establishment sees fit to lavish upon him. He is, however, the perfect post-modern author!! The birth of the reader is the death of the writer, it's the reader that attaches all the symbolism and meaning, which is perfect for Hemingway, because he conveys SO LITTLE with his writing! He leaves all the work to us! What an artful con, permeated by those who suffer from The Emperors New Clothes syndrome...Wow, I really hate this book..."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This is a book about the war.It is a fine book.Reading this book was grand.But then came the parts that were not fine and reading them was not grand.It began to rainI asked the waiter to please bring me a vermouth.Charlotte said \\"Darling, will you please, please, please, please, please, please, please stop saying please?\\"\\"And promise me you wont lie to me anymore, darling.\\"\\"I promise\\", I lied.The waiter brought choucroute.It looked like a skinned rabbit.I walked back to the hotel in the rain.OK everybody has their faux Hemingway and that was mine. Now that it's out of the way, here's my review. I first read AFTA about ten years ago and thought whoa, this reads like bad Hemingway. And probably the best bad Hemingway I've read by which I mean the prose seems like a caricature of his famous style. Since then I've read a number of books on WWI and some more Hemingway. It occurred to me that maybe I had been too harsh on Papa and gave AFTA a second read. Verdict: It's worse than before. This isn't really a good war story or love story. I don't really know what it is. It's Hemingway using his war experience to write like Hemingway. But then, he's a writer and this is what they do.My Reccs.1) If you want to learn about WWI, start with non fiction i.e. \\"A.J.P Taylor or John Keegan. Don't start with The Guns of August- nice book but arcane, idiosyncratic and tangential. Plus it only covers the first month.2) If you prefer novels, try Pat Barker's trilogy, Faulk's Birdsong or even Anne Perry's 5 part series starting with \\"No Graves As Yet\\". Historical fiction at its best.3) If you prefer memoires, try Sassoon' Memoires of an Infantry Officer, Robert Graves \\"Goodbye to All That\\" or Blunden's \\"Undertones of War\\".4) If you want to know about combat from the soldier's view, try Under Fire, Storm of Steel or The Somme.5) If you want to know what the ambulance driver's life was like (which Hemingway was), I prefer \\"Not so Quiet\\". For the nurse's view, try Britton's \\"Testament of Youth\\" which I haven't read but has great reviews.6) If you want to read the first novels written about WWI, \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" is excellent.Lastly, if you just want to read Hemingway, try The Sun Also Rises or any of his first 50 short stories.The only two reasons I can think of to read this book are: a) you're taking a course and its on a required reading list; or b) your tastes are different from mine (entirely possible) and you are swayed by the 5 star reviews, in which case you might like the book."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This incredible historical novel delivers a compelling, emotional story of the harsh realities of war, pain, and its brutal effect on lovers caught in the terrifying trap. An American ambulance driver on the Italian front falls in love with a beautiful woman, who is a Nurse. Their passion for each other grows as they try not to have it destroyed, while confronted with the horrors of the battlefield as a struggle continues between loyalty and desertion. The story tugs at the heartstrings throughout, the characters are unique, and the story grabs your attention in the first few pages. Stunning, Brilliant, and Entertaining. Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Rather than have Catherine die in the last chapter of A Farewell to Arms, I wish Hemmingway had spared us all, and ended her life in the first chapter.A Farewell to Arms is an antiwar novel and a love story but it is the love story that falls short of expectations and drags this classic novel into mediocrity. Fred's romance of Catherine is painfully dull. Neither one of them has anything interesting to say. When they are together they have conversations that are maddeningly tedious and insipid.The war story is another matter. Hemmingway conveys the chaos, confusion, and horror of war in simple straightforward language. The Italian retreat from the front is especially compelling. The retreat starts out as a relatively orderly exercise but regresses soon into a state of chaos and civil disorder. Fred doesn't provide much emotional insight in his narrative but as the retreat progresses we see him become more and more disillusioned with war and with humanity.Much is made of Hemmingway's sparse prose. I can't say that I'm a big fan of Hemmingway's terse writing. All in all, there is an emotional element missing from A Farewell to Arms that I attribute to Hemmingway's simple, repetitive prose and stilted dialogue.A Farewell to Arms may be a classic antiwar novel and Hemmingway is unquestionably one of the most important writers of the 20th Century, but personally I think this novel would have been much stronger without a tedious, superficial love story dragging it down."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Boise is about to embark on \\"The Big Read,\\" where everyone is asked to read the same book. Seminars and decorous discussions to follow. I chanced upon an audio version of the book while browsing through the library, and decided to get a head start.I hadn't read a lot of Hemingway, but was well acquainted with the influence he had on 20th Century writers: The manly man of short, declarative sentences. I remembered how the dialogue in his short story, \\"The Killers\\" influenced me to write a short story of my own, with which I'd had some success. I remembered how The Old Man and the Sea had taught me about obsession and how to gently wake a sleeping person. Perhaps A Farewell to Arms would teach me something, too.Hemingway's spare style has become common among contemporary writers, so I learned little from that. I could see how it set him apart from his contemporaries, but there was no particular illumination there. I probably expected much to much from the book. It was an eye-opening story about war in its time, but our eyes have been stapled open by war for so many years now by fictional and real images that Hemingway's descriptions seemed tame, almost nonchalant.This time his skills with dialogue struck me as not nearly as sharp as they were in that short story I had long ago admired. Every character speaks in self rebuttal, making a statement in one sentence, then denying they meant it in the next. What might have been a clever character device was lost when applied universally. And, did people really talk that way? Catherine Barkley, the feminine half of the tragic romance, calls her soldier lover Frederick Henry \\"darling\\" so often, you just know she spends all her spare time reading Harlequin novels.One must remember the novel is 78 years old. It is unfair to judge it by today's standards, many of which it set in motion.Yet, how can we not? Readers today are accustomed to the literature of later generations. Yes, we can appreciate this important stone in the foundation of our prose, but would we find ourselves compelled to read it if it were not assigned? Would the manuscript under another name get past an unsuspecting intern on the screening desk of a major publisher today? No, and no."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"No pint commenting on the novel itself. It's a 20th centiury classic. The inclusion of alternate endings that Hemingway tied out is fascinating."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"My daughter needed this for her English class. It was perfect and she was able to write all her notes in the book as required by her teacher."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I read this book because everyone has heard of Hemingway and I decided to finally read a book by him, and it sucked, or I picked the wrong book. The novel is split into \\"books\\" and I only liked the last two. The female character of Catherine was--to me--annoying and unbelieveable, which might be a reason for my dislike of the novel. This book was \\"Alright,\\" which means \\"Not Good.\\" I don't know if I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingway is an acquired taste. I had acquired the taste as a 15 year old, but then I lost it. Now I was just curious to see if it has come back. I fully expected to be very negative, but surprisingly I am not totally put off.With this WW1 book, the subject supersedes my concerns about the language and the attitude. The man's sentences are often lifeless to me. Here and there they are looking suspiciously like awfully bad writing. Often they are just flat nonsense.There is a lot of good fiction about WW1 in the market. This novel may not be among the best of the crop, but there is strength in it. That is, as long as the actual war is the subject. We are on the North Italian front, on the Italian side. The other side is Austria. The battles fought in the book are in the region where Italy and the former Austrian Empire touched. This part of the world is now Slovenia.Narrator is a young American lieutenant (Fred Henry), who has joined the Italian army before the US entered the war. He serves in an ambulance unit. There is initially little action and much silly talk among the officers, the manly talk kind. There is some flirtation with nurses.Henry has an affair with an English nurse. Henry's thoughts sometimes border on imbecility. Neither he nor the girl say anything interesting. He has good talks with the common soldiers though. They seem to be far more intelligent than the officers. More serious for sure.When action starts, it reaches trench hell strength in no time. Henry is wounded and starts making sense. The war scenes are strong. The hospital phases are better than the mess phases. He is lucky and gets transferred to a small clinic in Milan, and he is double lucky as his girl friend, the English nurse, makes it to the same hospital. There is lovely silly lovemaking until the treatment and reconvalescence is over and he must go back to the front. His next experience turns into a nightmare: the front collapses, and a messy retreat leads to a situation where he finds himself a deserter.If Hemingway could just have cut out the rubbish conversations and the bar and horse race course scenes, I would like this book much better.Not all the officer's conversations are empty trash though. Some of the talk approaches the philosophical touch of War and Peace. A disillusioned English major says this:We are all cooked. The thing is not to realize it. The last country to realize that they are cooked will be the winner of this war."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This book is one you won't want to put down. It is a personal look at war and human relationships during this most difficult time. Love prevails even during heartbreak. A must read and a true classic."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Its not as epic as For Whom the Bell Tolls, but it is a true romance novel in Hemingway fashion. Hemingway's grasp on the trueness of human interaction is displayed at its prime in this novel. A must read classic of a phenomenal author."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms is Ernest Hemingway's story of war and love set in Italy during World War I. Hemingway uses his earnest sparse journalistic style to tell the story through the perspective of volunteer ambulance driver Frederic Henry a young architecture student from the United States. Frederic is a young man who noticed the landscape around him the fields, the mountains, the humidity, the crops, the buildings and the roads and rivers. He has an easy camaraderie with the soldiers around him. As Frederic returns from leave he states:\\"I left them working, the car looking disgraced and empty with the engine open and parts spread on the work bench, and went in under the shed and looked at each of the cars. They were moderately clean a few freshly washed, the others dusty. I looked at the tires carefully, looking for the cuts or stone bruises. Everything seemed in good condition. It evidently made no difference whether I was there to look after things or not. I had imagined that the condition of the cars, whether or not things were obtainable, the smooth functioning of the business of removing wounded and sick from the dressing stations, hauling them back from the mountains to the clearing station and then distributing them to the hospitals named on their papers, depended on a considerable extent on myself. Evidently it did not matter whether I was there or not.\\"He soon meets a young Scottish nurse named Catherine Barkley and they begin to fall in love during the difficult wartime setting. It is interesting that Hemingway who has such dynamic conversations between comrades in arms has such banal and saccharine conversations between the two young lovers. Through hardships and difficulties they never seem to progress beyond smoochy, smoochy.With Hemingway's spare style he has chiseled Catherine down to a shell. She doesn't exist as a solid being without Frederic whose voice we constantly here though rarely do we here his name. It is surely written in full no more than five times in the book. And yet in his commentary on war, we read that it is indeed the names that are concrete and real:\\"I did not say anything. I was always embarrassed by the words sacred, glorious, and sacrifice and the expression in vain. We had heard them, sometimes standing in the rain almost our of earshot, so that only the shouted words came through, and I had read them, on proclamations that were slapped up by billposters over other proclamations, now for a long time and I had seen nothing sacred, and the things that were glorious had no glory and the sacrifices were like the stockyards at Chicago if nothing was done with the meat except to bury it. There were many words that you could not stand to hear and finally only the names of places had dignity. Certain numbers were the same way and certain dates and with the names of the places were all you could say and have them mean anything. Abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, or hallow were obscene beside the concrete names of villages , the numbers of roads a, the names of rivers, the numbers of regiments and the dates.\\"When one examines the plot, it is quite wonderful and exciting, with the daring and dangerous escapades one expects of a war time story, combined with the angst and yearning of young love. While it may not be an antiwar novel in the truest sense A Farewell to Arms certainly provides a realistic look to the confusion of war along with a look at the common valor which goes with being a soldier.While it may not be everyone's cup of tea for a variety of reasons, A Farewell to Arms surely deserves its place among the classics."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingway's tale of a couple within WWI cries \\"welcome to the new world, welcome to nothingness\\".The characters and story are distinctively Hemingway: simple, direct, engaging, familiar and somewhat appealing. Their many layers are revealed on the journey. The leading man and woman are modern, worldly, aware, decent and privileged. The noble and heroic side of war is missing, replaced by a realistic portrait of men and women on the sidelines of war. The institutions of government and religion are deemed ineffective, mere observers. Science is a double-edged sword, raining terror from the sky and healing the casualties.Individuals sense a loss of purpose and control. The low rumble of war and thunder is in the background. In a climactic scene it is reckoned that \\"they\\" will get you one way or another, only the manner of death varies. The actors play their roles in the war drama, but do not affect the outcome. Their maps provide weak guidance. Advances and retreats are equally chaotic and hazardous. Random chance is the greatest character, dealing happiness or tragedy.The leading couple reacts to this environment. They find puppy love. They go with the flow. They invest time in hedonism -- light. They find some satisfaction in day to day life, activities and interactions. They don't find a solution.This fine novel captures the appeal and tragedy of escapism. If Cabaret, Waiting for Godot, The Accidental Tourist or the pop song Que Sera Sera resonate, you'll be moved by this modern tale."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"It is almost embarrassing to say I'm 36 and only reading 'A Farewell to Arms' now. In some ways I think it is better that I waited. There is something about the effects of war, love and loss that has to be experienced in order to fully understand. This was an amazing novel to read last night, when the night was cold and dark and the houses outside looked cold. I think I should go eat some cheese."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingway once again takes a plot that most writers would fail dismally at and manages to keep you intrigued to the end. The last 7 pages you think all is going well but he still has a surprise ending waiting for you. It's an anti-war novel to be sure, but that doesnt necessarily mean Hemingway is a pacifist. I was able to get through this book quickly and that says something for the smooth writing style of one of the greatest...Ernest Hemingway. For Whom The Bell Tolls is the best I've read of Hemingway, and I've read four altogether, the other two being Sun Also Rises and Old Man & The Sea."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I have been in the military but never in combat, so I can't necessarily relate to that experience. But I was young and idealistic once. Without getting into the whole story it chronicals the experiences of a young American soldier serving in the Italian army during the first world war. Wounded at the front, he falls in love with a beautiful English nurse, herself heartbroken, while recovering from his wounds.Although they both seem to view love, live and death rather cynically, it is clear that they are both in a loving realtionship. Again without getting into too much detail they learn that sometimes love can lead to greater loss. One of Hemingway's best."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"EXCERPTED FROM \\"GOD'S COUNTRY\\" BY STEVEN TRAVERS...The \\"lost generation\\" was marked by the work of American writers who journeyed to France to write in the 1920s. They included Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein, who once said of Oakland, California, \\"There is no there there.\\"Hemingway was a reporter for the Kansas City Star, a man?s man of gruff, Midwestern sentiment. He came from a family of some local prominence. Perhaps because he did not face great hardships growing up, he felt the need to test himself. In this regard, Hemingway and Teddy Roosevelt have much in common. Hemingway went looking for his manhood in World War I and found it. The experience formed him. He saw action fighting alongside the Italian allies and sustained wounds. According to his own account, he had a \\"life-after-death\\" episode. While recovering, he fell in love with a pretty American nurse. When the war ended the romance did not take, in part because Hemingway had a stubborn streak of jealousy. But he used these events to launch a career of great works, writing in a tone of melancholy wistfulness, imbued with American patriotism and the manly need to face danger, romance and adventure with courage and idealism, tinged by ironic cynicism.\\"A Farewell to Arms\\" was his semi-autobiographical account of World War I, including his lost love with the nurse. Hemingway captured the \\"lost generation\\" in \\"The Sun Also Rises\\", which detailed American ex-patriates in Europe who were mentally and physically scarred by the Great War. His main character is unable to consummate a relationship with a beautiful woman who pines for him, because he sustained injuries in the war that prevent him from sexual functioning. The woman goes on to a career of carnal conquest with a variety of men, none of whom fulfill her. Amid much drunkenness and debauchery, the book addresses anti-Semitism, a relatively new theme in the 1920s, although Hemingway is not wholly sympathetic to Jews. When the book was made into a film in the 1950s, Daryl F. Zanuck cast a handsome young Jewish man, Robert Evans, as a Spanish bullfighter. When Evans approached \\"Papa\\" Hemingway at Yankee Stadium, the old man rebuffed him. He was furious that one of his beloved characters, a Spaniard, be portrayed by an American Jew."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This book is extraordinary for its description of the fog of battle and for its ability to capture the disgust for war that prevailed in the U.S. and in much of Europe after World War I. Most impressive is Hemingway's ability to portray the courage of his protagonists without glorifying war. The decision of the hero, Lt. Henry, a volunteer in the Italian army assigned to ambulance duty, to walk away from the war is symbolic of the choice of an entire generation. And his discovery that this choice hardly ends death and suffering is also powerfully symbolic.Also impressive is the famous Hemingway style of spare descriptions and terse dialogue. The scenes Hemingway sketches are remarkably vivid. The book is one of his finest.An important flaw in the novel, however, is the love story that is at its core. This is a glaring flaw and perhaps explains some of the negative reviews. For me, the initial meeting and lovemaking between Lt. Henry and the English nurse, Catherine, is neither compelling nor even credible. The love simply happens, suddenly and inexplicably, like the \\"zipless f**K\\" imagined by Erica Jong 50 years later. Falling in love can be inexplicable, but a great writer can convey the matter without the reader having to suspend his disbelief. No one, for instance, questions the love between Daisy and Jay Gatsby in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" or even the (albeit frustrated) love between Barnes and Brett in \\"The Sun Also Rises\\".In \\"A Farewell to Arms\\", the reader is left to question the sanity of Catherine. Lt. Henry's motivations are less open to question, given male sexuality, though one is left wondering if Catherine is a figment of the male imagination.In any event, the dialogue and dealings between Catherine and Henry become more believable as time goes by. There is a certain compelling intimacy conveyed between the two as Hemingway sketches their ordinary day-to-day concerns and conversations. And their flight from the war and difficulties experienced thereafter are believable and moving.Hemingway's ending of the novel is abrupt -- and the better for it. No maudlin dwelling on the tragedy, just a walk back to the hotel in the rain."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I loved this book. It was surely a page turner. I would recommend for everyone to read. It was well worth the time spent."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I comforted myself by saying that this novel was not based on real life...just a novel. How can a life be this sad? Finally,nothing's left to Frederick and I'd cry for him all day. I'll always think about him when it rains......"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I've had some problems with Hemingway before, especially &quot;The old man and the sea&quot; but I realized that his kind of writing is the kind you grow into understanding. To say this or that about it before understanding it is not only dumb but also a way of pushing it in front of you since Hemingway wrote so true and so cold and due to that, he wrote with emotions and that's what makes &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; worth five stars."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"When I read this book, I was working on an ambulance, and my signifigant other is a nurse. It made the story that much more vivid. On a less personal note, I found Hemingway's prose to be beautiful, and his story is just wonderful. Unfortunately, he did foreshadow the ending a bit (I won't ruin it for those of you who skipped the encyclopedia entry above), but this may have quickened the pace of my reading a bit. Read this when there is no grade attached to it, and enjoy every word!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I loved A FAREWELL TO ARMS, even though Hemingway's overmasculine approach hurt Catherine as a character. I simplyenjoyed the story a lot, Frederck and Catherine trying toescape from the war. Its was beautiful and tragic. Thelanguage used by Hemingway is very simple and easy to read. Infact it goes very quickly. The end was simply gut renching, butforeshadowed."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"The reviews and literary criticism of A Farewell To Arms could, in themselves, make up a longer book than Hemingway's masterpiece. I have not read that body of criticism. This review is straight from my heart, based on my first reading of this novel.This novel is a look at war. As the novel and the war progress together, the varnish of honor, duty, adventure, and patriotism drift away from the lives of the Lieutenant Henry and the supporting characters. What's left is fear and disillusionment. The pampered royal families and officers away from the front want the fight to go on but the grunts at the front are done. For me, this aspect was a warning about the lies from vain and bored leaders that start most wars and the deadly futility facing those that actually fight them.As Henry goes through this metamorphosis in his outlook on war, there is another, simultaneous, metamorphosis. Henry moves from gleefully chasing hookers to falling deeply in love with the English nurse Catherine Barkely. I can't quite grasp Hemingway's intent on the love story. Barkely ultimately dies young. It could be that the love story also begins with enthusiasm and then strips down to bare death, like the war. It could be that focusing on love in one's life makes it hard to then be gung ho about a war. I'm just not sure but I do enjoy turning it over in my head.There is one other aspect to share about my reading of A Farewell To Arms. I read Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises before I read A Farewell To Arms. I now see A Farewell To Arms as a necessary set up to understand the empty existence led by the characters in The Sun Also Rises. Those characters are spending the rest of their lives recovering from their war experience. Reading A Farewell To Arms gives you a look into that war experience and sets the stage for a deeper understanding of The Sun Also Rises.I appreciate the clarity and simplicity of his style. He delivers from his gut to yours without trying to show off. I love that. You must read this book."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"What beauty. What excellent prose. There is little I can say that has not already been said about Hemingway's style. So, I will keep my review short and blunt. This is one of the select few finest American literary works of the twentieth century. If you have any interest in Hemingway's writing, this novel is a must-read."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Well, being the 363rd review listed here on Amazon for this book, there probably isn't too much that hasn't already been said by the average reader about this book. Having read this and other Hemingway novels for my 10th grade honors English class (and a subsequently painful paper) I can honestly say I enjoyed this a lot more than I did back then at age 14 or however old I was at the time.My \\"little\\" book group read this one--we'll read anything, and take turns picking stuff out, and this was not my pick, but it is kind of an unspoken rule in this group that if someone wasnts to read something like this, we'll all do it. I was pleasantly surprised. Hemingway's writing was as spare a I remembered it, but also much more readable than I recalled, despite the run on sentences, giving an almost stream of consciousness feel to the dialogue. It really served to lend itself to the desperation of these lonely souls trying to find solace anywhere during a war that is clearly un-winnable by all sides.Not a romantic love story--Frederic Henry and Catherine Barkley find each other and cling to the idea of their relationship, even though anyone can see that outside of these terrible circumstances, theirs is not a relationship that would last. She is clearly no Mrs. Henry. It is a relationship about sex and comfort, and little else, sadly.The most prominent feature that stood out for me about the whole novel is that it is so clearly a very modern feeling anti-war novel. Our little group was surprised at the familiar \\"this isn't our war\\" sentiment that hovers over Lt. Henry's person.Full of some great moments, this book should be read by all college bound students and all Americans."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"The only justification for WWI, if there is one, is that it serves as a great backdrop for this marvelous novel, the story of wounded ambulance driver Frederick Henry and his nurse -lover Catherine Barkley as they try to survive that ignoble war (which began with dancing in the streets of Vienna and ended in the pointless slaughter of millions. Remember?). Early in the book, Frederick says of Catherine, \\"I thought she might be a little crazy.\\" Well, Yeah! Is it any wonder considering she has treated about a thousand casualties with injuries ranging from self-inflicted foot wounds to splintered limbs and assorted other dripping war wounds? Together they make the only sane decision they can make under the circumstances: they escape to neutral Switzerland where they manage to make a life for themselves, away from the war--but never really free from its underlying curse. Out of a time when kings and keisers (not renegade vice presidents) made war, Hemingway, the master of macho angst, creates the premier anti-war novel. If only Bush had been reading it to the kids in Sarasota the morning of 911 instead of the lamb book, what a different world it might be today..."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms is Hemingway's famous novel of a WWI love affair. Drawing on his life experience Hemingway introduces us to Frederic and Catherine. Frederic is an American ambulance driver in the Italian army (as was Hemingway himself), and Catherine is a nurse behind the battlelines. The two fall in love, are separated by war, reunite through a mutual act of desertion, and eventually go through a pregnancy and it's consequences together.Hemingway's prose is spare and to the point. There are absolutely no unneeded adjectives. Some would argue that there are a few adjectives left out. His dialogue at times seems wooden and strange, not following a way that &quot;normal&quot; people would talk. Yet, this is the brilliance of Hemingway's style, for these two people are not &quot;normal&quot; people talking. They are two people in a strange country, in the middle of trench warfare, grappling with insanity and chaos all around them, steeped in the strangeness of finding love in such surroundings. There is nothing normal about anything in this situation, and Hemingway shows that with subtle ease.A Farewell to Arms is a slim novel without any difficult language that slows down other classic works of literature. The temptation to the modern reader is to go through it quickly, looking for the plot, suspense, and resolution. If the reader does this, they will be left wondering what all the hype is about. Instead, read each chapter individually, one at a time. If the reader does that, they will be transported into WWI Italy, and experience what Hemingway intended, the horrors and heroism of people attempting to live with grace and dignity in a disgraceful and undignified situation."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Ordered these books for a teenagers summer reading project.

Inexpensive and fast deliver."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Such a delightfully story about war and characters involved in the story. A flawless writing . Joy to read. It is a beautifully written novel by probably the best American writer"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"The cultural impact of the Great War is brought home so well by Hemingway in this novel. The interplay between Hemingway as an American and the Italians he serves with is quite interesting in the least.When Henry gets his medal, the Italians automatically decide it's because he's an American. The Italians do not know what they are fighting for, Henry seems to want t be in the action, and then Catherine gets pregnant. He then only cares for his lover. Yet, the tragedy of Henry is the tragedy in microcosm represented by the entire war.The absurdity of the war is further brought out by the fact that the Italians are being defeated and killed left and right. I do not think that the Italians win a single engagement in the war, and yet they win the war. It is the Italians who get to dictate to Germany and Austria, yet the Austrians and Germans never lose to them. The absurdity and mass killing leads to a 'lost generation', this novel demonstrates the lost generation, and even though every bad thing is foreshadowed throughout, we continue to read and are captivated by it. That is the power of Hemingway's prose.To grasp the cultural impact of the First World War, one needs to read this book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I'm not sure what I was expecting from this book, but whatever it was, it wasn't exactly what I got. The back cover information suggests that the book contains an unforgettable description of war, while Hemingway's publisher's website calls the passage describing the battle at Caporetto \\"one of the greatest moments in literary history.\\" Really? Sure, it's all marketing hyperbole, and everyone is used to that, but I just wondered how I could have had such a different reading experience from the one for which the marketers want you to buy the book. This is not to say I didn't enjoy the book; it just took me a while to enjoy it, and I enjoyed it for different reasons.Hemingway writes in a spare style, whether about fishing, war, or love. There is nothing flowery here. More than the madness, horrors, or drama of war, however, A Farewell to Arms describes the ennui of war. The narrator, in fact, doesn't spend very much time in the mix of the fighting itself. What drives the story is the relationship that develops between the narrator (an American ambulance driver who, like Hemingway himself, volunteered for service in Italy during the First World War) and Catherine, a British nurse he meets shortly before being injured. The result is that the two overlapping stories--the war story and the love story--continue on in a sort of syncopated rhythm until the point where the war recedes and the romance carries the rest of the novel. The part about their stay in Italy and Switzerland toward the end of the war drags on a bit without much happening, including any development of their relationship. Indeed, I found the last one-third of the book pretty unsatisfying (hey, just because it's Hemingway doesn't mean it's always going to be great). Some of it is as interesting as: \\"We walked to the elevator. We got in the elevator. We went down in the elevator. We walked out of the elevator.\\" I guess there's a purpose for all of this beyond getting the characters to the ground floor, but it must have escaped me. The story is touching, that much is true. Not profound, far from brilliant, but touching nevertheless.But then. Then Hemingway comes back in about the last 15 pages with great power and effect. I guess that's what the previous 90 pages or so were all about--to get to the point where the last few pages would make sense. OK, I get it. And the last part worked very well indeed, and redeemed the rest of it for me. In the end, I guess I would have to say I liked the book. I liked The Old Man and the Sea much more. In its simplicity it is a book of uncommon power. But I'm not sorry I read this one. It's not bad to be introduced to this side of Hemingway."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This is Hemingway at his finest, but you might not think so for the first quarter or so of the novel. I found the first part of this book very difficult to get through. It was tedious at best. Push through it though, it will be well worth the struggle! This part of the book describes several characters in moderate detail, without any background on them whatsoever. There is a lot of information about the war from the perspective of the main character, but not much more about his life before the war. For instance, why was this American fighting for the Italian army?What I realized later in the novel is how well Hemingway weaves his way through the characters in describing exactly what individuals would be dealing with as the war rages on. Once our main character meets his love interest, the books pace begins to pick up substantially. The second half of this novel is fantastic. Hemingway shows us the tragedy of war and how our main character deals with his circumstances.The novel changes as the two main characters leave on their own personal journey.

Find your way to the end of this novel, it is well worth it."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"As described. Prompt delivery. On time. Clean sharp paperback. No complaints. Will b e a nice easy read. Not hard cover so perhaps not the best choice for a school, but, fine for one who handles books gently."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Very interesting novel. The author participated in WWI and it is possible that some of the descriptions are factual.The outcome.....Please read it."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I fell in love with Hemingway after reading the Old Man & Sea. This novel is not as refined. It's main theme - the futility of life - is well developed and grippingly illustrated. The writing style is far from perfect, however. Hemingway writes in a continuous narrative prose, more like a reporter, and somewhat reminiscent of Camus. Feelings are expressed only indirectly, in conversation. Where he excels is in the detailed description of the war, his writing serving as a potent warning against getting enmeshed in pointless warfare. Where he fails is in the characterization of Catherine, who appears shallow. The endless conversations between her and Henry are repetitive and boring.\\"Will you leave me?\\" \\"No I will not leave you\\" \\"You can go ahead and leave\\" \\"No I will never leave you\\" ... ad nauseum.While his style may be considered terse in comparison with flowery 19th century prose, this book's writing is not streamlined by modern standards. I can point to countless repetitive sentences, words that can be cut out, words repeated multiple times within a few lines, statements that add nothing, etc.What disturbed me most is the author's attitude towards alcoholism. Hardly a page passes by without someone downing a drink. While that may be fine for thirsty soldiers, I could not stand the passages when the pregnant woman was drinking, encouraged to do that by her doctor, no less. The ending came as no surprise in light of this, along with their barbaric medical practices. War or no war, one cannot as easily blame \\"they\\" for \\"breaking you\\" when one oneself has such a suicidal attitude to alcohol. I know alcohol use was meant to be the symptom rather than the cause, but, to my 21st century perspective, the point of the novel is weakened."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I taught a Hemingway unit, and a student who took my course remarked to me about a year later words to this effect ... \\"Hemingway is odd. He's easy to hate at a distance. But when you're actually reading him, you can feel his greatness.\\" She remarked that her favorite was \\"Macomber,\\" and second, \\"A Clean Well-Lighted Place.\\" I remember wrapping the unit one year by saying to the students, \\"You may never read A Farewell to Arms ... if you do read it, forgive me ... but I'm going to read the ending aloud to you.\\" The childbirth, the death, the stepping into the rain ... I'm a competent but not startling performer, but the only sound you could hear in the classroom, aside from my voice, was the sound of students (juniors and seniors) sniffling. Hemingway has power. The \\"personal lifestyle\\" has done much to destroy his reputation, but \\"the closer you get\\" the more you feel that power again. \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" is not an easy book. Start with the short stories, but don't fall into the trap of hating him at a distance. You'll miss something important if you do."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I had not picked up anything from Hemingway since high school and I am sorry for the lost time. His writing style suits me perfectly: pithy, direct, and occasionally acerbic. The plot revolves around an American serving as an ambulance driver for the Italian army during the First World War. There is no explanation for his presence and service in Italy, but we do know he comes from wealth and is estranged from his family. It is a soldier's story but a lukewarm one. The American has so many personal connections and such an endless supply of money that his war experience is very different from the other soldiers, if not unique. Indeed, compared to other war memoirs Hemingway's American comes across as a tourist. Nonethless, the tragedy of war is never absent. Against this backdrop, the American strikes up a romance with a British nurse. This relationship dominates the latter sections of the book and evokes the most powerful emotions. The final scenes where the couple struggle with the consequences of an unplanned pregnancy pack a serious punch. An easy read but not a light one, I am glad I rediscovered this guy and look forward to more."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Farewell to Arms is a love story set amist the horrors and pointlessness of World War I. This book has many autobiographical elements and it shows at Hemingway is really writing from the heart here.Personally I feel this is an \\"atmosphere\\" book which pretty much means you either \\"get it\\" or you don't. It probably depends on how much you can relate to the two main characters and their situation. They find each other and create something beautiful amongst the horror all around them. There isn't much in the way of plotting so you have to appreciate the relationship aspect of the story. The writing is classic Hemingway and he puts you right into the story with the best of them.This book is more than just a love story and like most Hemingway it touches upon various themes of man, love and futility. This book isn't as complete as For Whom The Bell Tolls but it's one his best nonetheless. It's easy reading and the story is linear and straightforward. It's appropriate for 16 year olds and up and you don't have to have read many classics to \\"get it\\".Bottom Line: Those looking to explore Hemingway might want to start with this book as it is a good intro into this amazing author. Also this book shouldn't be read by anyone clinically depressed as it can be extremely sad at times."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This book was a great example of the writing exhibited by Ernest Hemmingway. The story was one of great tragedy that followed a young man through his tour of duty in Italy during WW1. There was a slight hill in the book where one was lost in details of him in the hospital. However, for the most part the book was exciting and kept me interested. It is a great book and truly an interesting view on war on the European front. Hemmingway used this man's view to depict his views about war from when he served during WW1. For as the main character goes through pain and suffering in the war Hemmingway seems to be showing some of his own experiences in his tour of duty. Overall this book is a good read and can shed light on an interesting topic while keeping you attached to a strong story as well."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingway has proved himself as a short story writer--his are some of the best ever written. He won the Nobel for The Old Man and the Sea. And he showed us his skill at creative nonfiction with A Moveable Feast. But I hadn't yet read a full-length novel written by what is one of the quintissential American authors. I chose to start with A Farewell to Arms. And this is a wonderful book. It's a beautiful, though tragic, love story set during WWI--on the front lines. We get to watch this love unfold. And Hemingway gives us what has been called the definitive antiwar novel without ever preaching. I did find a little fault with only one thing. Hemingway's language is just a little simplistic at times. But even still, it is a beautiful story."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This is an easy, fast paced book to read which follows the bitterweet romance of an ambulance driver and a brave, young nurse. The book focuses in on the brutal truth of war, separating it apart from hundreds of other glorified war-romance books. Written in Hemingway's easily identified tight prose, and it is easy to get the feel that he was writing about himself. (Hemingway was an ambulance driver in Italy during WWI) That touch of possibly revealing himself to the reader makes this book even more touching."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Frederick Henry is an American enlisted with the Italians as an ambulance driver on the front lines when he meets Scottish born Catherine Barkley working in the hospital where he is stationed. Their love story juxtaposed against the deprecations of war and the injustices of life goes a long way towards explaining Hemingway himself. How could a man hold up under these kinds of circumstances?I could never get into The Old man and the Sea ... both times I got to page 15 and was distracted away from it. Imagine my surprise when, after only about half an hour I had read 78 pages of A Farewell to Arms. This is an easy, fast paced book to read and I have really come to appreciate his writing style. More than that, I have come to appreciate the dark cloud that I have always seemed to associate with him.Classic Hemingway: \\"That is what you did. You died. You did not know what it was about. You never had time to learn. They threw you in and told you the rules and the first time they caught you off base they killed you. Or killed you gratuitously...\\""},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I am in the middle of an attempt to cultivate my interest in literature.Hemingway's 'A farewell to arms' is rich and simple. Not only will you be able to relate with the characters but feel every emotion they experience too. It's a wonderful book to read, it will make you appreciate more the people you love around you. It made me cry."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Ernest Hemmingway captures both the brutality of war and the tenderness of love in the novel \\"A Farewell to Arms.\\" Hemmingway does an exceptional job of portraying warfare though due to his own experiences of it during World War I. While Hemmingway does give a great amount of detail about a person's life during war he also does show what effects love can have on their life. He also shows the struggle a young person deals with during times of hardships, which give many meanings. Some of the dialogues in this story seem extremely fake which makes it hard to believe at times.A young ambulance driver for the Italian Army named Frederic Henry is the story's main character. Early in the novel he meets a beautiful young nurse named Catherine Barkley and quickly falls in love with her. Throughout the rest of the novel Frederic is faced with many troubles trying to survive the war, which he despises, and trying to be with his love, Catherine. The events that occur between those two characters have such meaning behind them that they make up for the rather simple plot. The themes are so realistic that almost anyone who reads them can relate to a sense and will understand Hemmingway's intentions behind them.I recommend this book to anyone that wants to read a fairly simple yet emotional romance story. This novel appropriately shows the life of a young person affected both by war and love and how their lives are changed forever because of them. This is one of Hemmingway's great novels and anyone who enjoys his style of writing would have trouble setting this book down."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingway's style may have been original and may be imitated more than any other style but that does not mean this is a good book. The style makes for an easy read and some great descriptions but the story, character development and dialogue are lacking. Maybe it is that I heard this type of story a million times, but it was just not very interesting to me. In one review that praised the character development they mistakenly called the priest Rinaldi. Rinaldi and the priest were the only two characters in the whole book that I enjoyed. The interactions between any one else in the book were annoying to say the least. There was so little character development with three of Henry's companions, Aymo and the two anarchists, that I couldn't keep them straight. The dialogue was awful to say the least. Rinaldi and the priest were somewhat interesting but the conversations between catherine and Henry were awful. The only conversations that we see them having are about what he was to do and that she will do whatever he wants to do. Was this Hemingway's idea of love? Probably, but it is not mine and therefore their love was meaningless to me.Read this book, because it changed the way author's write today not because it is a wonderful novel."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"The book A Farewell To Arms was great. It had a great plot filled with many suprises. The wonderful story of the book made me rate it 9 out of 10. A Farewell To Arms involves a great love story of Lieutenant Henry and Catherine Barkely during WWI. Lieutenant Henry is in the military during the war and Catherine Barkley is the nurse during the war. When Henry gets injured during a battle, he then goes to the hospital and meets Catherine. As Henery is in the hospital curing up, he then starts liking Catherine. They both fall in love but dont marry yet because they're still in war. Later these two lovers get into problems which may cause them to break up. To find out what happenes to Henery or Catherine, read A Farewell To Arms. This book has a great intersting story, not like other books which keep on talking about love. This book contains action, romance, and mystery. I would recommend this book to everyone. I hope you read this book and find it intersting."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"An experience sharing the emotion of those in war.

I was expecting some stupid war love story, but there is so much more to it than that.

His heroine is one of his most liberated. Although in most of his books the women were weak there is nothing wrong with this one. The last lines remain etched on my mind forever, Thanks Ernest!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I do not understand Hemingway's genius. I agree he can tell a story masterfully with an economical use of words. (He probably could have written Conrad's 'The Heart of Darkness' in 500 words or less). But his characters seem so unemotional and he overuses certain words. How many times did he use the word darling? I liked ' Farewell' much better than ' The Sun Also Rises', which I despised. Frederick and Katherine were likable charcters thrown into situations that they could not control. I have not given up on Heminghway and I plan to read some of his later works."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This book is magnificent. It is poignant, engaging, and moving. When reading it, it is important to be aware of Hemingway's writing style. One of the best ways to imagine the novel as you read it is in a b/w movie. I know it sounds strange, but it really helps. Many people say that they read the novel fast. It is important to concentrate on what Hemingway writes and to read in between the lines. He rewrote the ending over twenty times, appreciate what is there :)."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I am 17 years old and I had to read this book for a report. At first I wasn't really excited to read it, and I wasn't expecting much because I hadn't heard much about it. But, once I got into the story I got pulled into it more and more. I absolutely love reading love stories, and this is much more than a love story. It is filled with excitement and many things that are true to life and really make you think about things. Even though I was forced to read this book, I am glad I did, and I would read it again just for pleasure."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I am a young reader only of 15, but I have to say that he really knows how to attract readers. Although conversation between Catharine and Henry was strange and confusing at times, it adds to the mystery of figuring out Hemmingway's thoughts as he wrote this book. It allows you to place yourself in every situation with explicit details of the surroundings. He never leaves out the littlest detail when it comes to describing every emotion, pain or hunger."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Although the love talk back and forth between Catherine Barkley and Henry becomes a little strange at sometimes; their love toward each other stays constant throughout the novel. Hemingway wrote a great book, fiction and a hint of autobigraphy of his expriences.

His style and works have delighted and influenced countless people. This book is one of my favorites. it's story is well conceived and written. the characters are enjoyable and real. Hemingway weaves a storyline that in amazing to read."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms, written by Ernest Hemingway, classically combines love, misery, seduction, and sorrow all in one historic novel. This wonderful novel depicts the harsh realities of war among two lovers entangled in the mist. The main character, Lieutenant Frederic Henry, and his lover, Nurse Catherine Barkley, initially have a relationship consisting of games, illusions, and fantasies. This cleverly ties in with the war that currently encompasses Henry, World War I. The blending of these aspects results in one of Hemingway's greatest novels.Lieutenant Henry lives his daily life as an ambulance driver for the army. Disillusioned by the war, he meets an English nurse, Barkley, who mourns for her dead fianc&eacute;. They commence a game of seduction, each with their own reasons for playing it. Barkley, psychologically damaged from the death of her fianc&eacute;, struggles to push the history behind her while Henry tries to stay as far away from the war as possible. After a little while together, Barkley brings up the game they play by saying, \\"This is rotten game we play, isn't it\\" (31)? Henry retorts that he \\"treated seeing Catherine very lightly\\" (41).Embodying the stereotype of the testosterone-fed male, Henry also looks for sex from Miss Barkley. He yearns for pleasure in a world filled with despair and death. As the novel progresses, his accounts of the war decline in quality and quantity. Accounts of the war decrease and become less detailed, showing that he continually bothers less with the war. Henry changes from a man living with the war to a man only interested in himself and anything directly related, including Catherine Barkley.The relationship between the two lovers changes as time passes by as well. Their relationship progresses from an illusion to actual feelings of love. \\"We were never lonely and never afraid when we were together\\" (249). Apparently Henry believed love existed when two people felt as they did together. It indirectly affects the war for Henry because as the relationship consumes more of his life, his unwilling grip to war weakens. The importance of it decreases as Barkley's significance increases to him. As time goes on, Henry turns into a man who prioritizes a greater love for Catherine. He throws away his integrity and runs from the army, showing the shifts in his list of priorities. War only existed as something in his way.This anti-war novel clearly convinces all about the unsympathetic truths of World War I or, more simply, war in general. \\"The West front did not sound so good...I did not see how it could go on\\" (118). Throughout the course of the novel, Henry faces the deaths of many of his companions. Upon realizing his love, Catherine Barkley, now must stand at the brink of death, Lieutenant Henry grimly accepts the truth. \\"They killed you in the end. You could count on that. Stay around and they would kill you\\" (327). In all his days in the war, he never realizes the death surrounding him until the person he cares for most begins to slip from his grasp.Hemingway, in his novel, teaches others the psychological features of people, interweaving it with the innuendos of the darkness of war so readers cannot forget the environment and setting that the two main characters feel trapped in. He gives others a refreshing breath from society by denouncing materialism. The idea of denouncing materialism ideally fits in psychologically with the ongoing war. He urges others to reconsider their materialistic priorities for something more genuine. Hemingway never made these materialistic possessions important. Nature, one of the things he embraced, clearly shows its importance when he felt it necessary to write, \\"The first cool nights came, then the days were cool and the leaves on the trees in the park began to turn color\\" (133). He felt it necessary to describe the colored canvas produced by the changing of the surrounding trees as autumn came.As Richard Schickel once said, \\"A great novel is concerned primarily with the interior lives of its characters as they respond to the inconvenient narratives that fate imposes on them.\\" Throughout the novel, Hemingway remains constant in keeping up the realistic atmosphere he introduces in the beginning and how it affects Henry's life. This romantic literature never ceases to be unfair to the readers' high expectations of works by Ernest Hemingway. As a highly popular and recommended novel, it lives up to the just raves. Pick up a copy of this thoughtful, beautifully written novel. Another book I need to recommend -- completely unrelated to Hemingway, but very much on my mind since I purchased a \\"used\\" copy off Amazon is \\"The Losers' Club: Complete Restored Edition,\\" a somewhat raw, but oddly engaging little novel I can't stop thinking about."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I love Ernest Hemingway's writing, and have read a number of his books. This is probably one of the books that he is most well-known for. The story is set on the Italian front of World War I, and it tells the story of two star-crossed lovers. Hemingway's themes for each of his books are so realistic because he experienced a lot of the things he wrote about himself. That's what makes his books so wonderful. Hemingway did not have a good opinion of war, and these thoughts come through loud and clear in this book. The story is about Lieutenant Frederic Henry, an American who has volunteered to serve with an Italian ambulance unit during World War I. Catherine Barkley is the nurse whom Frederic nicknames \\"Cat\\", and who he falls in love with. Hemingway's other characters are all equally well-drawn. His plot and his description of scenes is also wonderful Hemingway uses his descriptions of place as allegories to human well-being and luck. Hemingway associates the plains and rains with death, disease and sorrow, and the mountains and the snow with life, health and happiness. His two lovers experience happiness and safety in the mountains, but they cannot stay there indefinitely, so when they go back to the plains, bad things happen to them. A Farewell to Arms appears to be a bleak tale, but it delineates probably more than any other of Hemingway's works his fatalistic attitude to life and death. Hemingway is a wonderful author, and his works are well worth reading."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"The writing style is 'The New Yorker''s wet dream: self-conscious, overwritten, and smart. At novel length, over-written becomes, to me, truly over-written. \\"The Snows of Kilamanjaro\\" ranks in my top 5 short stories. I love his style; I love his writing. But this novel goes on and on and on. I hadn't read it before, and though I recall loving \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" long ago, I had to start skimming about 3/4 way through \\"A Farewell to Arms.\\" It was too repitious. I don't mean it isn't wonderful in many ways, but how much of the same tone, style, content can we read before it begins to feel tedious?Per the other comments, and official review: I'm surprised by this being called \\"sparse prose.\\" One of the more striking and interesting elements is his use of run-on sentences -- truly, run-on sentences, complete with many uses of the word \\"and.\\" He does this in such an interesting way, it's really sort of awe-inspiring. Very interesting.I wouldn't call Henry detached or nihilistic as others have; I think he's stoic. I think his greatest personality trait is his stoicism in the face of great adversity. This, in conjunction with the writing style, makes the book.I much prefer the war chapters to the \\"love\\" chapters. Since I didn't feel Henry falling in love, I felt little for their interaction until the end. Though, again, all elements become rather tedious. The chapters go something like this: war, war, hospital, love, war, war, war, love.... So I skimmed (I hate skimming). Then, at the end, the last few chapters are genuinely suspenseful. The end is breathtaking. The person who reads detachment here, I believe, is missing the emotional impact.But -- this same end, this same style, can be found in his shorter works, and one doesn't need to skim or become bored. So I recommend buying a book of short stories, if you've become Hemingway-dismayed after reading this book, yet still hold out hope. The dialogue is far more interesting to read when not novel-length, in my opinion. (Agreed, too much alcohol for my taste -- but, it is what it is, and I always value the time in history, the place and person from where the art came.)Four stars for sheer talent. And for documenting WWI through fiction."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This was the first time I read a book by hemingway, and I loved it. Don't mistake me...this wasn't an easy read. Hemingway has a style that isn't that easy to adapt to. He uses very simple words and phrases, and is a master at using dialogue. But no matter how you try to argue, a good book is a good book.This book tells the story of an ambulance driver, Lieutenant Henry, and his love affair with the nurse, Catherine, while being involved with World War One. They suffer many bumps in the road, and we are also shown the bad side of war, and how it is pointless.This is a wonderful novel. I will definitely try Hemingway again, but only after a little break. Yes he wrote well, but it's not easy reading."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I can't even begin to emphasize the tremendous merits of this novel. Hemingway's writing style, to begin with, is ridiculously good here. This was written at arguably the pinnacle of his career, and it shows; his writing has never been more genuinely innovative and dense. Hemingway's writing is known for the minimalism and tough sentences, but there's an incredible amount of depth behind the phrasing. Also, the themes of the novel (war, loss, courage, loyalty) are expressed so vividly that one can't help but sit in spellbound silence when you read. As an anti-war novel, &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; succeeds wildly (particularly effective is the encounter with the other Italian troop), and as a love story, Henry and Catherine's romance is devastating.&quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; and &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; were both fantastic, but &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; is even better. Picture all of the varying emotions of those novels intensified beyond belief, and add a writing at the apex of Hemingway's output, and you've got a genuine masterpiece on your hands. This is astonishing - arguably one of the best novels ever written."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"For a writer at the tender age of 30, Hemingway sure knows how to set the stage. The problem is, he doesn't know how to what to do with his characters. Lieutenant Henry and his love, Catherine, were so intangible that I hardly shed a tear at the novel's &quot;tragic&quot; conclusion. I just couldn't make myself relate to them. I also find that the whole &quot;love story&quot; was a little far-fetched. After knowing each other for over six months, Catherine asked her lover whether or not his father was alive. You would think that after such a long time, the two would have plenty of time to discuss things of such importance. Although Catherine's devotion for Mr.Henry was pretty convincing, his output seemed a little short. One wasn't sure where he made the transition from not planning to love her at all to wanting to be with her all the time. (If you want to read a really convincing love story, read Erich Segal's poignant work, &quot;Love Story&quot;). Not only was the couple in question rather questionable, but the minor characters lacked, well, character. It was difficult to distinguish Mr. Henry's &quot;war buddies&quot; from one another, having only dialouge to rely on.Having that said, &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; was overall a good read. Despite the fact that I was unable to sympathize with the characters, I found myself to be entranced with Mr. Henry's tale. It was quite exciting, and I always waited for his return to Catherine, and for their playful,(although somewhat silly) dialouge. Up until the end of the tale, I was satisfied. Only after the &quot;tragedy&quot; did all the minor problems come shame-facedly to the surface. I would recommend this book to any lover of classics, but if you're looking for a war story, this clearly isn't the book for you."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingway's third novel (following The Torrents of Spring, 1924 and The Sun Also Rises, 1927), A Farewell to Arms is an engaging yet bleak account of the Italian front during World War I. The story begins with Frederic Henry, an American serving as an ambulance driver in the Italian Army, questioning his involvement in a war that he does not believe in nor fully understands. First faced with the ravages of war and later in a battle to be with his true love, Henry struggles to maintain his identity and purpose while grappling with the conflict that surrounds him. Early on, he is injured on the front and subsequently falls in love with a British nurse, Catherine Barkley, while convalescing at a hospital in Milan. Henry returns to the front only to join the retreat following the historical Italian loss at the Battle of Caporetto. Henry soon finds himself at odds with Italian loyalist extremists and is forced to flee into the Italian countryside. Later, he struggles to reunite with Catherine while avoiding the extremists, each eager to lay blame for the Italian loss on officers, deserters, and foreigners - all of which describe Henry. Although a great example of the timeless war novel for which Hemmingway became famous, A Farewell to Arms is more a story about the trials of love and Hemmingway's own pessimistic view that happiness is fleeting and loss and death will always win out in the end.Hemmingway's style is unmistakable - a sparse, almost mechanical brevity that he apparently learned while a reporter during his early career. This brevity is deceptively simple in that his often short, somewhat choppy sentences evolve into complex paragraphs and chapters that truly become greater than the sum of their parts. A gripping example of this in A Farewell to Arms is when Henry, following a narrow escape from armed captors, finds himself safe but worn, hungry and alone:\\"I was not made to think. I was made to eat. My God, yes. Eat and drink and sleep with Catherine. To-night maybe. No that was impossible. But to-morrow night, and a good meal and sheets and never going away again except together. Probably have to go damn quickly. She would go. I knew she would go. When would we go? That was something to think about. It was getting dark. I lay and thought where we would go. There were many places.\\" p. 223.Hemmingway doesn't have his characters say what they feel. He makes the reader feel it the way the characters feel it. We as readers experience how exhaustion and fatigue strain Henry's body and mind and we can feel his longing to be away from that moment by envisioning a near-future with the one he loves. This style has been said to characterize American writers since Hemmingway, but none that I have encountered seem to master the art in the way he did. A Farewell to Arms, being Hemmingway's sophomore attempt, is not the striking success of The Sun Also Rises, nor the epic war novel For Whom the Bell Tolls. Never the less, this story is a gripping, and ultimately a heart breaking but readable tale, in the style that would come to define a great author.On a more personal note, it is well known that Hemmingway struggled with depression, identity issues and alcoholism throughout his life. These themes are vividly evident in his writings. Hemmingway's works have been criticized for romanticizing war, an underlying theme of misogyny, and a sentimentality out of touch with a changing world. I find these characteristics more a charmingly human quality rather than a fault. To see these problems and to see their roots in a troubled writer, opens a window into the human struggle and opens a mirror to our own personal struggles with life. For these and other reasons, Ernest Hemmingway is perhaps one of my favorite authors and one I reflect on in my own endeavors - not as someone to emulate, but as someone to learn from and appreciate."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingway uses love and war to find a bit of truth. Life breaks you--it kills you--if you're &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;very brave.&quot; Nature washes over humanity like a flood, merely moving over anyone that lays down for it, but crushing people who stand against it. Hemingway pits Catherine &amp; Frederick against the tide, while taking note of those just swimming along, like Count Greffi. At ninety-four, the Count has survived so long because he, like other old men, did not &quot;grow wise...[but]careful.&quot; He hasn't &quot;become more devout&quot; either--perhaps he doesn't care about anything enough to be broken by its loss. He values life because it's all he's got. Catherine dies in the end standing against the flood: she was brave and good and gentle, and those qualities are the antithesis of a world that produces such a meaningless war. Frederick had the honor the bow out of that war when it became obscene to him, and loved Catherine so much she took away his loneliness. He was broken by her death, and I wonder if it will kill him in the rain on the way back to his hotel. Hemmingway wrote a romantic story, and a realistic war novel, but he also wrote something about the difference between living and just existing. That's why this book is great."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I read this book because John Keegan recommended it in his book on WWI and because it was Hemingway and the only other writing I'd read of his was &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; when I was in high school 30 years ago, so I felt unwashed.I read the first paragraph of the novel about six times. Great writing! A wonderfuly simplistic yet portentious description. From there the book wavered back and forth for me.His descriptions of the battlefield were certainly as realistic as I've read in fiction. But I'm sorry, I really didn't get the relationships he had with his friends. The prose was just too sparse and I just don't understand the lingua he used. I'm convinced that the hip language Hemingway used is not easily understood. Much like some of the first talkies in the early thirties contained language (read Jean Harlow) that was so hip for it's time but not very clear now, the way he talked to Catherine and she back was just too coded for me.Who was this character? After reading the book I new almost nothing about who he was, what he cared about and why he loved Catherine, though I became convinced that he did. Altogether, I found this to be somewhat puzzling, as it is reported to be a great romantic novel. Hemingway's writing was often beautiful and faultless. His way with words and phrases awe inspiring. But the hero was a schmuck."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"It is World War I. the fighting between the allied and enemy forces throughout Europe has worn on for months. Almost everyone is tired of the fighting but continue to serve for the good of their countries. For an American serving in the Italian Army, who lacks the patriotism for the country he serves, it becomes quite difficult to focus on the importance of the cause at hand. The discovery of love by Fredrico Henry proves to be a major distraction that ultimately affects the remainder of his presence (or lack of presence) in the war and his subsequent lifestyle. Ernest Hemingway left A Farewell to Arms, although with many sub-themes, with a focus on the classic theme of love and war. The focus on these two themes is evident in the way the two affect each other and in the organization that Hemingway used in the novel. Because the main character narrates the story himself the reader has a keen insight on his true feelings on both love and war. We find in the beginning of the novel that Henry has no incredibly strong viewpoint on the war itself, he seems not to like or dislike it. It is not until the presence of a person who creates love and passion in his life that a true standpoint begins to form. It is the desire to return to love that gives him the inspiration to break from his present situation later in the story. The other major character that could be considered more static, as compared to the dynamic nature of Henry's character, is Catherine. With her love and dedication she produces the inspiration in Henry that creates the changes in his character. The presence of the conflict of war in the novel is used to show the changes that it too can have directly or indirectly on a person's outlook on life. The novel is organized in a manner that seems to separate the effects of love on a life and the effects of war on that same person. The primary chapters of the book deal with the terrible images and injuries that Henry encounters during the fighting. Hemingway does an excellent job at painting a picture of the horrifying aspects of war during a specific battle scene early in the story. He also does a great job in later parts of the story at relaying the way that Henry and Catherine feel about each other. He does this with detailed inner monologues on the part of Henry, and complex but easy to understand dialogues between the two lovers. At the very beginning the novel is somewhat hard to get into because the narration starts by trying to pull the reader into an event (the war) that has already started. There is though some action that pulls you quickly into the plot, and is then followed by the basis of Henry and Catherine's romance. The book is organized in to chapters within books one through five. This separation of parts of the book, and the flow of the writing proves to make A Farewell to Arms an easy reader. One difficulty that a reader may encounter while experiencing this reading may be the complex dialogues. Sometimes the dialogues carry on for so long that it becomes hard to keep track of who is talking at what time. At times it may be necessary to go and read back through the text to understand exactly who is speaking in order to retain its significance. The plot overall is not hard to understand or hard to follow and creates a quite rewarding experience in the end. While reading this book it became quite easy to get close to the characters. Characterization is utilized well by Hemmingway to achieve this true knowledge of both Henry, and Catherine at times. The message of the book can be looked at as one that stresses the importance of love in trying times of chaos. This novel also gives an insight to the softer sides of the war. Although brutal at times, it gives outlooks into the slower and less action pact parts of fighting that are not often seen in a war novel, such as time spent with other soldiers in the mess hall, strong friendships, time in the hospital and the bliss of residing in a country neutral to the war."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"It's always daunting to try to review a piece of great literature. I've read others of Hemingway's works, and never managed to appreciate them - all those bulls and cigarettes and male camaraderie and machismo. A Farewell to Arms could not be more different, and in my estimation, for what it's worth, this is his masterpiece. A story about 2 people, strangers in a strange land, who manage to find love and build a life together amidst the chaos and trauma of war, A Farewell to Arms is a testament to the spirit of all men and women who can find reasons to hope and to live decently no matter what the circumstances. If Hemingway had written nothing else, he would probably still be remembered for this glorious work."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"One of Hemingway's most popular books; I would say it is his best. The characters and the story are true to life and are written in a deceptively simple style. With Hemingway there are subtle signposts that prefigure each character's destiny and this book is no exception. It follows the experiences of an American ambulance driver in Cadorna's army (based on the author's own experiences in WWI Italy).Lieutenant Frederic Henry serves on the blood-soaked Isonzo front, although the book makes only minor mention of his work there. Instead, it is about his love for Catherine Barkley - birds of a feather flock together. Both the characters have left prospering homes in search of adventure (or rather escape from boredom and convention).The love story is the main theme of the book. And during their moments together the characters say all the same trite, often contrived, things to each other. It is real, but is it also a subtle mockery? And we get to share Henry's innermost thoughts and questions regarding Cat. Henry gets wounded and is sent back to Milan to recoup. Cat rejoins him there, and they live an almost domestic life together in the hospital. After several months, his body has recouped, but he no longer wishes to tempt death in the war. Nevertheless, he rejoins his unit in time for the Italian army's headlong retreat during the Caporetto offensive.Henry's retreat is, in my opinion, far and away the most intense and exciting part of the book. Henry's unit, along with the rest of the Italian army, largely melts away and his story becomes one of desperate and daring personal survival. He manages to get back to Cat and escape to Switzerland with her. But there is a still another catch."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Although it took a hundred pages or so for me to re-acclimate to Hemingway's terse, spartan style (having read several others of his prior to this), I eventually came under that old spell all over again.Hemingway here, as in all of his novels, uses clean, seemingly simple yet astonishingly precise language to express complex emotional and dramatic situations in a way that somehow seems to evoke more vivid pictures in my mind. It's as though he knows how to understate things in just the right way to push all the right buttons in his readers.At first, it strikes me as odd and even hollow the way he gives only succinct spoken dialogues and the barest snippets of the character's innermost thought processes yet manages, the further you read, to create such indelible impressions.It's the same with his prose, we get simple reports of weather and atmospheric conditions, geography and topography and that's about it. Hemingway give's your mind's eye the tools it needs to create its own vision and interpretation - his genius is in how he lets us paint our own pictures.This book is certainly a \\"page turner\\" and plenty compelling, so no worries there, but the extra measure of pleasure comes in letting yourself flow with his wonderfully crisp language and cadences. Hemingway is always like a fresh-pressed linen sheet. High thread-count and plenty good, but plain bright white. Hemingway is refreshing.The usual Hemingway educational seminar on drinks and drinking is present (there ought to be a drinking game for Hemingway readers) and there are some pretty gory moments (like any good war movie of the screen or mind), so it'll be familiar territory, but you'll love it."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Ernest Hemingway beautifully manages to take us through the ordeals a young man experiences in life. I am 14 and recently my dad past away, and as I read the book I was touched and amazed by Hemingway description of death. Especially at the end I found it impossible not to commiserate with narrator's ordeal with death."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"If I had the money, I would go out and buy a copy of this book for everybody I know.To date, this is one of the finest Hemingway novels I have read. More than just a war-torn romance story, it's a very real depiction of the horrors of battle. While this formula has been come to be viewed as vintage Hemingway, those reading the book for the first time will see it as a fresh and original story. I had no idea what would happen from one chapter to the next and the ending of the books comes as a harsh surprise (although a throughly logical one.)This is one of the most important novels about World War 1 and the effects it had on the people involved with it."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Growing up I heard many people talk about Enerst Hemmingway being one of the great authors of our time. After reading A Farewell to Arms and many other I truly believe he is. In the novel the main characters life follows closely that of Hemmingways life. The main character is Lieutenant Frederic Henrey who is an American ambulence driver for the Italian Army in World War I. It begins in the late summer before winter comes, so battles are winding down. He goes out in tours Italy until Spring arrives and he comes back to the front of the war. He then meets Catherine Barkley, an English nurse who is the love interest of his friend Rinaldi. Though Rinaldi fades out of the picture as the story goes on and an intriguing game of seduction forms between Henrey and Catherine. This started to show the conflict of love during time of war. To add gas to the fire Hemmingway tells that Catherine had a fiance who died the year before in the war. Catherine is confused and longs to feel love again even if she just has to pretend, but the war has left Henry cold and detached that he'll settle for anything. Over time the love becomes real and conquers all in this tale. There are not many bright points throughout this novel, but thats how some people few life as being. Thats not to mention the tragic ending, which I found typical for most of Hemmingways writings. That was just negative I guess you can say besides not relating to any one character. It gives a great depicition of man's will and courage under pressure countless ways, while facing so much loss at such a little cost. Nevertheless, I see it as being a token of respect to the value of human life and love throughout the world."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hands down, bar none, this book is incredible. I can't do it the justice it deserves, but here's why I LOVE this book.I'd never read Hemingway before, but after I got over his (famous, as I now know) writing style, I was captivated by the story that unfolded before my eyes. Hemingway's stark prose truly lends an air of bleakness to the events surrounding the lives of Henry and Barkley.From a historical standpoint, Hemingway's account of the retreat from Caporetto is fantastic in its description of the morale-impaired Italian army, where execution by lot-drawing was accepted practice.The story is wonderfully engrossing, as the love affair between Henry and Barkley grows from casual to desperate amidst the terrible circumstances of the First World War.Absolutely, positively, the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms was the first book I've read by Hemingway. Seeing as he's such a well known author, I figured I'd try reading one of his books. But, I'm not exactly sure what to think about this book. I'm not sure if I really understand the main theme of the novel. At first it seems to focus on Henry's, the main character, time as an ambulance driver in Italy(although he's American himself), but after he gets hurt the novel makes a sudden change and focuses on his relationship with the English nurse Catherine Barkeley, whom he had met previously. But, the relationship between them seems to rushed. They claim to be in love with each other, although they've known each other for only days. Although I don't think it's impossible to love someone after only a few days, it seems as if the relationship wasn't given enough time to develop, perhaps maybe to get the novel moving. Anyway, after Henry's injured, he decides to flee with Catherine to Switzerland and his journey to get to her(while facing danger since he is apparently deserting the military) before they flee together and their journey together takes up most of the book. One thing I found particulary strange about this book was the dialogue, mainly between Henry and Catherine. It consisted of fairly short simple sentences and they never seemed to have real conversations. Also, and this may sound kind of weird, they seemed to agree too fast. I mean, it seemed as if as soon as one of them suggested doing something or going somewhere, the other one quickly agreed with out any discussion or protestation. They way in which they always were so willing to do what the other one wanted just seemed too simple and unrealistic. Also, often I found their conversations, mainly what Catherine said, to be comical, but I don't think that was the author's intention. The only part of this book that really touched me, was the end, but of course I won't mention what happened and ruin things.Anyway, I'm glad I read this book just to see what Hemingway's work is like and although I didn't enjoy the novel a lot or see clearly what the point to it was, I'll admit that perhaps it's one of those novels you'd have to read more than once to really appreciate. The book was fairly easy reading and if you read at a good pace and are interested in this book, or you're a big fan of Hemingway's, I think this book is worth reading."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I have read this book four times over the past thirty years. To that end, I appreciate it more with each reading. Hemingway is a powerful writer. He says little but suggests so much with his prose. This book is about love and war on the Italian Front in World War I. It is also a canvas of words rich in colors and full of emotions. Hemingway is one of America's greatest writers and &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; is a national treasure."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"As I get older, I am reading more and more books that people have deemed classics; there is definite reason for their being named as such. This book, A Farewell to Arms, exemplifies a classic that is classic for a reason.For the first half, Hemingway describes the spoils of war in Italy. The second half turns somehow into more of a love story. Both halves are good, but together they are excellent.I thought at first that I wouldn't enjoy this book. My mom had told me that she tried to read The Old Man and the Sea, and that it was boring despite its short length. However, I was so influenced by A Farewell to Arms that I've discovered my writing style changing to reflect Hemingway's.Obviously, A Farewell to Arms is worth the time."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I'm 14, and I had to read this for school. It was the first book by Hemingway I'd read...and probably will be the last, at least until I'm forced to read another.I thought this book was dull in the extreme. It was full of huge passages of irrelevant small talk and pointless details. I also found the main characters, particularly Catherine, the female heroine, unconvincing as well as unlikeable.Although I didn't really enjoy this book, I respect it, and I realise that others might find Hemingway's style easier and more enjoyable to read than I did. Just don't expect it to be one of those unputdownable passionate war novels which you remember for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms is the story of WWI as told by main character Lieutenant Fredick Henry, an American ambulance driver in the Italian army. Through a friend of his, Rinaldi, he meets Catherine Barkley, and at first is not at all interested. But soon they are spending every night together, hiding their affair from most, and avoiding marriage. Before long, Catherine is pregnant and Lt. Henry comes down with sypilis. When he and his commandees are convicted of treason because they retreated, he hides in a river to avoid being exectuted.Everyone knows that you get more out of a book if you read it for pleasure, and not for required reading. However, i don't think that makes much of a difference in this book. The characters are poorly developed, and they change their minds repeatedly, without a clue from Hemmingway as to why they made an uncharacteristic decision.Henry's character is so emotionally detatched, its hard to believe that he is a human, or that Hemmingway even actually modelled him after one. He may have modelled him after himself, but all that says is that Hemmingway was pretty boring. Henry does not care that his son dies, and just leaves the hospital without any trace of emotion.Overall, this book just stinks. As far as war books go, if this is supposed to be one of the best, then there is absolutely no point in reading the others."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I looked forward to reading this book but was very disappointed by its plodding clipped style. The dialogue between the 2(poorly developed) main characters is tedious and uninspired. The well touted passages about life at the front seemed to bog down in the mud that was being described. Maybe reading S-Faulk's &quot;Birdsong&quot; first, raised the bar of my expectations too high?"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This has got to be one of the WORST books I've ever read. A number of us in our book club wondered how this book is considered a classic. The writing is terrible (For example the dialogue is not clear when the characters are having a conversation - you lose track of who's saying what. Also, some sentences are a half page long.) Hemmingway must have been high while writing this book."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Is \\"A Farewell To Arms\\" an anti-war novel? I say no.Like others note, there's not a lot of actual violence here. The protagonist, Lt. Henry, is nearly killed while eating cheese, and has to spend much time in a hospital where his convalescence is something akin to Club Med. He doesn't have to be in this war, as he is an American and his country at this point in World War I (early 1917) is still neutral. When one doctor tells him his knee requires time to heal before it can be operated on, Henry says no, do it now. He wants to go back to the front.Later, his mind changes, when the Italian Army finds itself in headlong retreat and the bloody \\"Battle Police\\" start shooting officers. Yes, bad things happen to him, and his lover Catherine, by book's end, and Henry's powerful narration offers sentiments like this: \\"I had seen nothing sacred, and the things that were glorious had no glory, and the sacrifices were like the stockyards at Chicago if nothing was done to the meat except to bury it.\\"But the worst thing that happens in this book happens not in war-torn northern Italy but peaceful Switzerland. My sense is that Hemingway thought of war as another one of those things men do, no more a cause for censure than driving without a safety belt. He didn't glorify it, but he doesn't seem to bemoan it, either. It's an adventure like any other, with its necessary share of perils.I think the power of this book comes not from its depiction of war but of life and love. The war zone where Lt. Henry and Catherine plight their troth is a metaphor for life lived under any circumstance of pressure. Love is the great killer, not war, because it gives people real value and thus elicits real sorrow from their demise. When Henry has his final epiphany, and talks about how \\"they killed you in the end,\\" he's talking about the unseen masters of human fate, for whom saving or not saving souls in peril is akin to watching ants burning on a log.Hemingway's religious views here are most interesting; he's quite nearly an atheist here, but not exactly. His protagonist seems unwilling to entirely let go, seeking the counsel of a priest and telling an old man he will pray for him. Of course, he's also boozing it up, living in sin, and pretty dismissive of religious values as a whole, but it's not a dead issue, and his discussions on the subject are engagingly bipartisan.There's greatness throughout this book. The opening, where Lt. Henry wiles away the winter lull in combat with his agreeably eccentric companion Rinaldi, pulls you in with its swift, alkaline portrait of camions and kings rolling across muddy roads to the front. The ending is great, too, and I very much like Henry's stay in the hospital; Hemingway at his most romantic, comic, and even hopeful.People have problems with Catherine being Henry's boy toy, and it's true she becomes more docile as the story goes on. But its because she represents an ideal, a hope for human happiness based on a real-life nurse whom Hemingway had a brief, unsatisfying, but haunting encounter with. She's utter male fantasy; even when she tells Henry to \\"shut up,\\" he notes she says it \\"as though you didn't want to offend anyone.\\" (She agrees.) But she is the means by which the book creates real human involvement.Alas, not complete involvement. I know Hemingway's a great writer, better than I'll ever be (and I'm trying), but he leaves me cold at times in this book, as he samples the various wines and discourses at length about various things in that clean, terse way that excites admiration but repulses identification. There are pages and pages devoted to things like horse races and cafe idylls that just go nowhere, and my tired eyes scan over the tight sentences like so much gravel in a stream bed.Another reviewer here says \\"A Farewell To Arms\\" is a novel with great moments, but isn't great. I agree. It's tremendously readable, and parts of it are worth memorizing, but overall, the effect is less for me than \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" \\"The Old Man And The Sea,\\" and Papa's many great short stories. It's a solid book worth reading, but not his greatest work."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This is a must read for every person. Hemingway captures all the emotions of love and war without the grandeur many writers like to insert. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I'm sorry but someone actually said the CATHERINE was what women want to be like. May I starve in Somalia first. (Actually, that's hyperbole. I would rather be a stupid peice of cardboard with no taste in men than die. But only just.) This book has a grand total of two things to recommend it. One, it is required to get an A. That's a reason right there. Two, it has a vocabulary a third grader could understand, thus getting the torture over with quicker."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I literally forced myself to read this book... and what a waste of time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The way Henry and Catherine express love you would think they were 15 years old. If you really want to read a GREAT book about love, friendship basically all the things that really mean something in life please try &quot;Three Comrades by Erich Maria Remarque&quot; and if you want to see what it was like during WW1 please read &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front -- by Erich Maria Remarque&quot;Bottom line: stay away from this book!!!!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"All the people here who criticize Hemingway have never written a book, and never will. You know how they are. At first, they all admire his style and then try to copy it thinking it is going to get them published. When they find out how worthless what they've written is, they blame Papa instead.Hemingway's prose is filled with imagery and an abundance of details, all stubbornly shoehorned into a flowing, succinct, rhythmic style. If you have no imagery you know how to depict vividly, no feel for writing dialogue that is both witty and actually looks good on paper, and understand nothing about the human condition, then trying to copy Hemingway's style is futile. Give it up.Hemingway had a lot to say and he doesn't beat a reader over the head with it. He lets it wash over you. His works are, as someone else here has said, 'to be savoured.'"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"The book, A Farewell to Arms by Ernist Hemingway, is an emotional story about a young American ambulance driver who finds himself stuck in the middle of World War One fighting with the Italians. After being wounded in the front, young Fredric Henry is shipped to the hospital where his lover is stationed. From there he takes a long and dismal trip through self hatred, as he is constantly on the edge of lossing control and completly flipping out. The book as a whole wasn't the most attention grabbing book I've read. The writing style which Hemingway used, the short fragmented choppy structure, is not one that I am fond of, but the way HE writes it it makes it seem like a master piece. He seems incapable of doing wrong in his writing and that is what truely lead me to reading the book. Hemingway captivates your imagination into thinking beyond what you are actually reading and that to me is what makes a good book. The 3-star rating is because of the topic of the book, not one I'm fond of, but still the writing style is what kept me reading.To me this book shows a good exaple of what it means to be an American. Fredric Henry is an American fighting in an Italian dominated army, beside people who he has never met and will probably never see again. The fact that he isn't fighting with America just proves that as Americans, we feel drawn to fight for the rights of others, and by fighting with the Italians, in World War Ones, Fredric Henry is doing just that. Once he is ingered though, he is only thinking about the day he will return to the front, which to me shows the determination of the American spirit. We will fight for what we believe to be right even when it means we might be killed or hurt in the process. This book overall shows the bravery of the human spirit as a whole, but is represented though that of an American fighter."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"the two most boring \\"lovers\\" ever written. a complete absence of passion/feeling. totally flat characterization. \\"dialogue\\" that would embarrass a budding high school author. what on earth did either see in the other (would ANYONE else be attracted to either of these cardboard images?)WHY were they in love? how did it happen? the glowing praise of this \\"love among the ruins of war\\" escapes me entirely. who cares what happened to these two individuals?....give Hemingway credit for his geographic descriptions; on the other hand , it's not thought to be a \\"travel\\" novel.Greatly over-rated, and as Harold Bloom has noted elsewhere, Hemingway's novels (as opposed to his short stories) are coming to be seen as period pieces, not enduring literature. that's even generous for this book."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Did anyone else notice that the idiot named \\"gnossie\\" didn't read the book?

He kept saying how much he loved his girlfriend who did anything and everything for him. But he seemed not to care about the baby she was going to have and paid little attention to her feelings and her health while she was pregnant.

I can't say that I care much for his writing style in AFTA. He uses run-on sentences and sentence fragments. The dialogue is unbearably unrealistic, when you can figure out the speaker. Reading AFTA was like listening in to conversation at a party, through a partition, where no one introduces themselves. I could not connect with any of Hemingway's shallow characters. I already had my daughter's discarded copy of AFTA, but I chose to purchase the 'Library Edition' because it ballyhooed its inclusion of early drafts and 39 alternate endings. By the time I was finished with the book, I was looking forward to the drafts only to see what the profanities were that the publisher, Scribner, replaced with dashes in 1929. That part of Hemingway was not to be revealed by the 'Library Edition.' There might be some collaborations of Hemingway and publisher that are worth the investment of my time.

The novel encapsulates Hemingway's philosophy on life, death, human dignity and disappointment. It can be uplifting and very depressing but always gripping. That it has to do with one man's mission in the Spanish Civil War is almost beside the point. It is a book I recommend to anyone, perhaps a little more for men, who can identify the passion of life compressed into a few short days at a pivotal point in 20th Century western civilization."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This story is not too terribly difficult to write about because the reason it is so good lies in a couple of very subtle things. One of the most interesting things I found with the story is how relentlessly I wanted to understand more about the two main characters. This seemed to be planned from the beginning and as the closing chapters Hemingway has us rooting for their success. I fail to say more about the plot because there are about 5 or 6 total scenes in which the book takes place and I do not want to spoil anything.If you like Hemingway, you should certainly read this. If you are coming to this book for the first time and you're wondering whether to read it or some other Hemingway, I would recommend it highly. Either way you will get a good sense of what Hemingway writes through this, and some of my skeptical friends say that once you've read one, you've read them all."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This is one of the better classical literature books I have read. I enjoyed it more because of my interest in the World Wars. Hemmingway writes about his experiences in Italy towards the end of the war showing what the war was like from the American prospective before we entered officially. It is well written and the story flows from page to page. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Has it been decades since you read this book? Perhaps you last picked it up in college, or even high school. If so, you owe it to yourself to read it again. When I first read it (in college), I think I probably paid the most attention to the love story--or that, at least, is what the margin notes in my old paperback suggest. When I read it this time, forty years later, the love story receded and Hemingway's indictment of war came to the foreground. It's a good time to reread a novel that is an unsparing depiction of a war that solved nothing."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This book is one of the best i have ever read. Hemingway writes with short and persice sentences that give the book a seemingly simple and straightforward feel, yet he has such a grast on emotions and real life that what he writes is so true and so real that its notquite so simple.This book will make you smile, it will make you laugh, it will make you lonely, it will make you happy, and it will make you want to cry, but after you read it you will certainly be happy you did and hope you can find a book that is as good as this one."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This is one of my favorite works of American literature. I think it's a novel that has something for everyone. There's action, suspense, and romance. The imagery is powerful, but Hemingway never has to resort to flowery prose and metaphors to make his point.The story is loosely based on Hemingway's own experiences as a soldier in World War I. Lieutenant Henry joins the Italian Army to be a part of the war, but he doesn't see a lot of action, just a lot of sitting around and waiting. While at war, he meets a nurse and falls in love. As he gradually becomes disenchanted with a soldier's life, he starts to see just how pointless the war is, so he leaves the military in search of happiness, only to discover that you can't hide from tragedy.There are two portions of the book that always stick with me. The first is the description of a military retreat, where Henry's vehicle gets stuck in the mud and the rain and he's forced to travel on foot. The second involves Henry and Catherine fleeing to a neutral country in a row boat. Both portions of the book are written perfectly and Hemingway manages to leave a powerful image in the reader's mind."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"It's amazing how he does it. He writes those short, whittled down to the bone sentences, and he's every bit the \\"artiste\\" that Picasso is, or Cezanne, he said. Hemingway wanted to write like Cezanne painted, he said. I would like to recommend A FAREWELL TO ARMS and THE SUN ALSO RISES, but in that order. I would also like to recommend \\"Big Two-Hearted River\\" (short story)."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms is a tragic story by Ernest Hemingway, a first person view of an American fighting for the Italian Army against the German empire in the climax of WWI. Frederic Henry is an Ambulance Driver, a job Hemingway experienced first hand during his time in WWI, giving the reader an epic and historically accurate story of love and war. He meets and immediately falls in love with Catherine Barkley, a beautiful English woman. In a tragic turn of events, Henry falls victim to serious leg injuries as a result of a mortar rocket accident. He is soon moved to the same hospital that Catherine is working as a nurse at, and their relationship blossoms.Hemingway's ability to write compelling and emotional novels using only the most basic prose is something alone to seek after in his writing. His descriptions are short and quick, and the way the words read themselves off the page draw up a lot of emotion. The simplicity and authenticity in his writing are what make this story so completely immersive and depressing: the way you can feel the character of Henry himself decaying as his mental state of sanity runs along the edge of loosing it, and you can really relate to the way he feels at the end of the story. He is wound so tight and his life has been affected so greatly by the war that you can't help but feel his struggle.A Farewell to Arms excels not only in Hemingway's ability to describe emotions, but in his historically accurate description of what WWI did to Europe, and what it did to the individuals directly affected by it's reign of destruction. Hemingway gave us a completely immersed first-person view on the complete details of the war, right down to the emptiness and surreal tragedy of death. The fact of it is, there was not anyone in Europe that was left unaffected by the war, and whether or not we ran from it we would fall victim. Hemingway gave us an insight to the way wars worked, and the way they will spread like a virus; leaving everything it touches to decay and slowly fade away.\\"If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry\\"To Hemingway, the war was just a tool for the world, and how it breaks you into who you need to be. Those that were kind or exceptionally brave and unbreakable, those who could not give up their soul, were killed. In A Farewell to Arms, Henry tries to resist being broken, and witnesses those around him dying and all the evil of the world. Not even he himself can avoid breaking at one point or another, and as Hemmingway so clearly put it, we will always come to an end at some point or another. In fact, Ernest Hemingway shot himself in the face with a shotgun one afternoon, even though he has repeatedly spoken of suicide in his writing as wrong.Overall, Hemingway's ability to reflect on the individual part of a larger evil brings the book to our level. Other writers talk about distant conceptions or write about the idea of war as a whole, which Hemingway does reflect on as well. However, he expands on this, and centers in on the personal effects of such a horrific war. The numbness Henry eventually reaches is tragic, and the way he is eventually broken to just give in and not care is additionally depressing. The way Hemingway ends the book would have had less of an impact had Henry cried or grieved, but the way Henry can't even fathom the amount of grief he is left to deal with, and the way Henry represses his emotions and simply keeps on living is what gives the reader such a powerful impact."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"In recently reading Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms, I was quite pleased with the reading experience it provided. I had read The Sun Also Rises, so I decided to read another Hemingway novel because of my satisfaction with the first work I read. I normally enjoy tales about war from a first person point of view, but who doesn't like a good \\"war story?\\" Also, it is always beneficial when a love story is intertwined with the courage and bravery required by the war. People usually hear more about WWI than about WWII, so I was indulgent to learn from the novel as well. There are many aspects, though, that are particularly intriguing about this novel.First of all, Hemingway excels in his use of foreshadowing. Lieutenant Frederic Henry and Catherine Barkley's hidden love keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the novel. The flirtatious nature of the just keeps you wondering the whole time whether that is just their personality or if there is a little something more there. The fact that his comrade Rinaldi possesses a love for Catherine adds a bit of tension to the situation as well. The fact that Catherine was left brokenhearted by the loss of her fianc&eacute; and Henry is left cold and emotionless by the war creates a significant conflict between the two's approach to their relationship. Blinded by the love, the two playfully flirt and carry on as Henry recovers under Catherine's care. Soon thereafter, though, the two are reminded of the desolate situation the two are involved in. Henry had originally received leave, but the superintendent of the hospital revoked it because of an accusation, and Henry is sent back to the front line sooner than expected. Leaving his now pregnant girlfriend behind, he returns to the front lines to an army that is so close to accepting defeat.Because of his discouragement in the worsening standing of the Italian forces, Henry chooses to return to Catherine without leave from the army. The events that are followed by this return were part of an outstanding ending. Though I was saddened by the turnout of the story, this novel was very entertaining and a better plot couldn't possibly be accomplished. This work is definitely, overall, an exceptional read."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"_A Farewell to Arms_, by Ernest Hemingway, is a realistic depiction of war's carnage and confusion, a compelling adventure, and a love story.We see the fighting during World War I through the eyes of Frederic Henry, an American in the medical corps of the Italian Army, engaged against the Austrians and Germans in Northern Italy. The war is a juxtaposition of the ordinary - the men are especially concerned with eating and drinking - and sudden, devastating violence. To the men who fight it, the war has no great purpose, and Lieutenant Henry is disgusted by attempts to romanticize it:\\"I was always embarrassed by the words sacred, glorious, and sacrifice and the expression in vain. We had heard them, sometimes standing in the rain almost out of earshot, so that only the shouted words came through, and had read them, on proclamations that were slapped up by billposters over other proclamations, now for a long time, and I had seen nothing sacred, and the things that were glorious had no glory and the sacrifices were like the stockyards at Chicago if nothing was done with the meat except to bury it.\\"After the defeat at Caporetto, Henry leaves the army and he and his fianc&eacute; pursue what seems from the beginning to be a doomed romance. This part of the book is not as successful as the first. His finance, a British nurse named Catherine Barkley, doesn't seem to have a thought in her head, and the dialogue between the pair is saccharine: it's darling this and darling that. It's no wonder that Henry always has a drink in his hand."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Every person needs to read this Ernest Hemingway novel. This book has everything. For the &quot;action&quot; people, there is a war. For the &quot;romantics&quot;, there is a love story. And for the &quot;others&quot;, there is everything else.This book uniquely expresses life from the male point of view. Frederick Henry lets us into his life while he participates in World War I. We grow with the characters and start to experience their emotions.This was the first Hemingway book I have read and I loved it. His style compelled my interests and it left me wondering what was going to happen next. It created the suspense where your mind is open to explore the situation.I recommend this book to anyone. It was excellent and a good learning experience. Hemingway truly has a style of his own."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I have to admit that I haven't read much Hemingway; infact, aside from his short stories, I've read only two of his books: The Sun also Rises and A Farewell to Arms. One of these books I adore, the other just annoyed me; lets just say that I love The Sun Also Rises.A Farewell to Arms, on the other hand, is clunky, especially with regards to the dialog. Many of the descriptions are beautiful, but the fact that this book is heavily dialog based pushes Hemingway's beautiful descriptive prose into the background.The story itself is alright and typical Hemingway; I think that it would be safe to say that Hemingway wrote one book and spent the rest of his life trying to revise it, A Farewell to Arms being only one revision.Aside from all of this, this book isn't a bad read. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could, but I just can't bear to give it four."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This book is absolutly wonderful! I loved soo much, its definatly one of the best books i have ever read. It has a love story but it also is suspenseful. I was so moved at the end I cried and hoped for a love as strong as theirs. I definatly reccomend this bokk, there is wonderful writing that allows you to picture everything Hemingway talks about. Definatly read this!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Fans of darkly intense war novels like The Triumph and the Glory or The Thin Red Line will like this book. People who liked The Devil's Teardrop will like this book. People who liked The Last Day or The Naked and the Dead will like this book. A Farewell to Arms has everything one could ask of a book. A vast range and scope of human emotion and experience is encapsulated into Hemingway's fiction, in a very eloquent manner. Don't miss A Farewell to Arms, it is unforgettable."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I had to read &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; for an English class and have found it to be believable - Hemingway puts the reader in Europe during WWI when the American ambulance driver falls for the British nurse and they end up in love and bed, next a baby is on the way...the ending is also realistic, life sometimes happens this way."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This has to be one of the best books I've ever read, it's up there with &quot;A Seperate Peace&quot; and &quot;To Kill a Mocking Bird&quot;.

It's very touching!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Well, I was given this book to read for English class and I thought, &quot;How good can this book be...it's required reading!&quot; But I must say, I was pleasantly surprised! It's one of those books that is wonderful because of the way it was written, not so much the actual content of the story. I think Hemingway did a magnificent job portraying Henry's emotions, feelings, and struggles. My advice to you...read it!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"When I first began the book i did not expect it to leave such an everlasting impact on me. It has just got to be one of the most brilliant pieces of literature ever writen, i absolutly loved it!!! And the way Hemingway writes, its jsut so real, the conversations may seem repetetive at times but its beauty is in its simplicty of language. The love depicted between the two charachters n the way it develops is so close to real life. And its one of of those books that anyone can read, women or men , some may see it as a war book, but i thought it was one of the most beautiful love stories i have ever read. Speacially the last chapters n certain lines, are so touchin , u can almost feel thier emotions, sypathise n rejoice wth the characters. Its jsut one of those books that conintue to haunt u long after u've read em. i would highly recomend it!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Some reviewers here have been disappointed by the simple style and repetitive conversations of the book. Perhaps this is because they are more used to the Stephen King style of writing - books that tell you directly what to see, think and feel. Hemingway's characters speak the way real people do - simply and redundantly, saying little. The message they're communicating to one another isn't in the words, it's beneath them, in the moment that Hemingway is showing us. One has to adjust one's expectations to Hemingway's style of writing. That is why this book elicits &quot;best novel ever written&quot; reviews as well as &quot;this guy is overrated&quot; comments. Hemingway is underappreciated these days, if anything - his genius doesn't appeal to critics looking to use literature as an excuse to repeat well-known political viewpoints. His simple style brings events and feelings to life in a way that no other fiction writer has managed."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, my first Hemingway but definitely not my last. As a septuagenarian college student majoring in English (Writing), the first person past tense narrative was of particular interest to me. Writing a first person narrative successfully is extremely difficult and I learned quite a lot from reading this one, for example, the exquisite balance between detail and action. I felt I was standing next to Frederick Henry as he told his story.But what I found most intriguing was the insight into the early 20th Century privileged class visiting Europe during the most horrific war of their time. What must it be like, I wondered, to live in Frederick's place. He does not use his wealth to eschew danger, but it certainly makes it possible for him to navigate through this complex and complicated experience. I was amused to realize and contrast the differences between his reality in 1915-17 Europe and our expectations now in the 21st Century.Of course, I cannot review a book without singing the praises of Kindle for PC. Aside from all it's wonderful features, I found a new thing to rave about. I also bought a literary analysis of \\"A Farewell To Arms\\" and found it both easy and useful to read the chapter summations up to my place in the book before going on with the novel, especially when some time had elapsed between readings. After I finished the novel, I read the character analyses and the write ups about the plot devices. It was almost as good as a class or book-club discussion. By using bookmarks, I find it easier to navigate through a Kindle e-book than the old fashioned paper ones. Not only are e-books more durable, think of all the trees who remain happy firmly rooted to their precious Earth!By the way, that $9.99 version referred to by another reviewer is not available in the United States. I felt this book was well worth the price I paid for it."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Having recently read this book for the first time, I can confirm there's a reason why it's considered one of the very best war novels. It's a brilliant history on love and war, with fantastic pictorial descriptions and some of the best realized characters I have ever seen in print. Other reviewers have pointed out how hard it is to find a page in this book that's not perfect. I have to agree.The narrator of the story is the lieutenant (\\"Tenente\\") Frederic Henry, a volunteer ambulance driver from the United States. As many other Hemingway male heroic characters he shares a love for life, traveling, drinking and woman. He eventually falls in love with the the lovely Catherine Barkley, and the story follows their attempt to find comfort in each other in a crazy war.This story with it's perfect plot, it's beautiful writing and incredible characters will stay with you for years. You see the line of soldiers retreating through the night, the frightened peasant girls and the grand Milan nights filled with laughter and love. In short a excellent portrayal of love, humanity and war and one I will surely read again."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"For a long time I didn't appreciate Hemingway because I had been reading mostly post-modern authors who are heavy on adjectives and irony and hyper-stylistic phrasing, and because of this Hemingway's narrative seemed rather oversimplistic and stylistically flat. But eventually what you come to realize with Hemingway is that his pared-to-the-bone style has it's purpose, and that purpose is for the reader to discover the subtext between the lines which envelopes the story's conciousness. Hemingway doesn't control our imagination with vast flurries of adjective phrasing, rather he lays out the essentials of a situation and allows, as in poetry, our imagination to do the rest. For example in this book Hemingway doesn't describe his main characters in great detail. The narrator's tone and the way characters react to his authority suggest he is about thirty, yet the nurses all call him a &quot;boy&quot; suggesting he is the same age as most of the soldiers, 18-22. Catherine often seems the same age as the narrator, but we learn that she has had an 8-year relationship with an Italian, suggesting she's somewhat older than the narrator. Eventually you figure it all out but the thing is Hemingway seldom hands these details over, he leaves it to the reader to glean such things through dialogue and character interaction. For example, there is a particular point in the story where Catherine has some &quot;news&quot; for the narrator, but a reader who has figured Catherine out, the way she talks and the way she beats around the bush, will realize this news before the narrator's character figures it out. Anyway, I do think simplification is an underappreciated skill in Hemingway's hands, at least among his critics.This is much more of a love story than a a war story. Yes, it is set in WWI, but the war is essentially a backdrop for the devil-may-care romance. (I've heard this described as an anti-war story, which is silly. Hemingway served in WWI and WWII and seemed to feel quite strongly that there was a genuine purpose for war...) As a love story, though, there is plenty of tension. We are pretty sure of the narrator's sentiments toward Catherine but Catherine seems somehow too perfect for the narrator, so that we're always expecting something to go wrong... and the ending keeps us on a real tightrope."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This was a difficult read for me. I felt no continuous connection with the hero - I barely want to call him by his name, Frederic Henry, because he barely seems to HAVE a name. As for the heroine, Catherine Barclay, well. I felt that I knew her better, but technically, if she called him 'darling' one more time... I wanted to go back in time as Maxwell Perkins and edit out all the 'darlings'.There are passages in the book; observations, that have such strength and beauty -- I'm thinking of the opening, where the description of soldiers' feet marching by the house brings in a sense of foreboding. When the hero is wounded and carried to safety; his ride in the ambulance - these scenes are brilliantly alive, and real.SPOILER ALERT: SPOILER ALERT:I didn't think Catherine's deathbed scene had any great pathos. It could have been shortened, I think to greater effect. What she says seems most unrealistic. I've been through childbirth, not to the point of being in extremis, but I don't think a woman who's just been through hell to give birth and is now dying from hemorrhage would say, \\"you won't do our things with another girl, will you\\". That's a guy-thought. Although when he says, \\"it was like saying goodbye to a statue\\", after her death, that rang true.:END OF SPOILERCatherine and Frederic don't live for me. It's not that they are frequently unhappy, discouraged, emotionally wounded characters. To me they remained the author's fictional creations, they don't linger in the reader's memory, with their moments all alive. I just don't know how to express it. Yet in a completely opposite direction, the brief appearance of the aged Count (I think he was), the 93-year-old aristocrat, in the scene with the hero where they play billiards together -- HE was a living character - a fully realized person, even so briefly. This character didn't remain a fictional creation.In sum, although I admired some sections individually, I can't say I admired the work as a whole. My advice is that it's not the Hemingway to start with - examine his short stories, or The Sun Also Rises, first."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"First of all, let me say that I am a Kindle lover. Having said that, lets look at the pricing here. I can pay $12.99 for the Kindle edition, or I can pay $9.60 and get an actual book? Let me think... Honestly, if Kindle and e-books are ever going to last, they have to price the e-book version CHEAPER than the physical book format. I would never pay more for an e-book than I would for the physical copy."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"In their balance, flow, and elegance, Ernest Hemingway's sentences are among the most pristine and beautiful creations of mankind. This volume has some you've never read before. That alone makes it worth the price of admission. It doesn't matter whether they are unfinished and were ultimately rejected. They're still beautiful, like unfinished scraps of Mozart compositions or rejected Faberge eggs. Beyond that you get to look over his shoulder and watch him \\"get the words right,\\" crossing out, starting again, writing the sentences that only he could write. None of the fragments have seen publication in widely available sources, so you get to enjoy what only scholars have previously seen. The book has basically three parts: introductory material by Ernest, Patrick, and Sean Hemingway, the text, and manuscript materials. This structure makes the volume similar to that of the recent A Moveable Feast: The Restored Edition (2009). The book itself is well executed, attractive, handsome and solid."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Both a love story and a war story, Hemingway manages to mesh the two opposing ideals in a powerful novel. The protagonist, Henry, is surely no hero. His existentialist outlook on life and his rejection of ideals of honor and glory contrast sharply with a typical romanticized war hero. Heny is neither an eternal optimist nor pessimist, yet his stark, realistic outlook on love and war are both refreshing, as well as depressing. In the end, it seems, the world will either break you or kill you, be it in love or war. There is no happy ending in life, for life is just a sequence of events, seemingly without rhyme or reason.Hemingway uses a direct, no-nonsense approach in his writing. There is neither flowery prose nor endless paragraphs of illustrative descriptions. Hemingway's words are power-packed and provide the most poignant imagery in the least amount of words. From his almost journalistic account of his lover's last breath, to his detached depiction of a land ravaged by war, Hemingway does not mince words. It is his direct style that is, perhaps, his greatest asset, and that which has gained him fame.This novel is at its best in the war chapters, especially in detailing the Italian retreat from the Austrian border. In these chapters, Hemingway masterfully describes the ravages of war in simple, yet powerful, words. The grim reality of war, devoid of any grandiose ideals, permeates into the soul of the reader. There may be a worthwhile cause to war at times, but certainly not in this war, and certainly not for the lives lost.The weak point of the novel, though, would be the depiction of his relationship with his lover, Catherine. Although she does convey some feelings of hopelessness and despair for the war, she is overly melodramatic toward Henry. Her self-deprecating manner and vapid comments prove to be a distraction. In contrast with the chapters focused on the war, the love story is slow-moving and tedious. Fortunately, the war chapters are intermixed with the love story. But then again, I shouldn't fault Hemingway for not portraying their relationship as compelling as the drama of the war.The bottom line: if you are looking for a gripping World War I novel, choose \\"All Quiet on the Western Front,\\" for Remarque's work is superior to Hemingway in describing the horrors and meaningless of this war. However, if you are looking for a war novel plus a love story, then you can't go wrong with \\"A Farewell to Arms.\\""},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"[NB: review contains spoilers]There are some truly admirable sections in this book-mostly involving descriptions of men at war, in various phases-but these are not matched by the treatment of the central relationship in the novel, that of the hero and heroine. For all Hemingway's attempts to render the general human affliction of armed conflict something more personal and specific via the wartime romance between his two principal characters, the end result of &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; is that the reader is left less with a new appreciation of something profound and terrible than with an odd (and unfulfilling) sense of detachment from the human condition. One simply asks at the end: That's it?The conclusion of the novel is clearly intended to be tragic: after surviving a series of wartime perils, the hero escapes to Switzerland with his pregnant common-law wife-only to see her die there in childbirth. Yet the feeling that we have never been allowed to know much about this character, Catherine the nurse-and therefore aren't in any better a position to mourn her loss (or learn from it) than is the benumbed hero, Lt. Henry, who simply walks away from her corpse-is almost as irritating as it is inescapable. The palpable tension of the striking war sequences and the couple's desperate flight to peace and freedom is thus followed (not to say trumped) by a deflatingly feckless conclusion that offers no more illumination of the great issues at hand (war/peace/life/death) than one gets from a vulgar bumper sticker. Do we really need Hemingway to tell us that Sh*t happens?This just isn't, by any measurement, much of a love story. It has only a beginning and an (abrupt) end-its internal plot never thickens, it has no arc. The lieutenant enters the relationship with no intention whatsoever of falling in love; nurse Catherine, for her part, likewise seems more interested in companionship than love as such (having lost a fiance to the war earlier). But what ho, human nature does not yield to vain design, and the two somehow do fall in love-and in pretty short order. Fine, okay, the reader can live with the fact itself. The problem here is that neither the transition to nor the expression of the resulting (and all-consuming) love affair is developed or described in any real sense. The principals simply decide they are in love, and proceed to profess this feeling to one another in curiously disjointed (and sometimes painfully stilted) dialogue for the remainder of their time together in the novel.The lieutenant specifically forbids himself thoughts of his beloved when away at the front, so we get no account from the first-person narrator of any growing feeling or new commitment toward her. Catherine's character lacks the dimension of interior monologue, of course, so we know nothing of her thoughts; adding to this distance, moreover, she is given a background even sketchier than that of the nearly-anonymous lieutenant, and her interaction with secondary characters fairly defines the term superficial. In short, we see nothing of Catherine save externals-and not much of those.What we get when the two are together, alas, is not mutually-assisted self-exploration, or even mutual relationship development a la Rocky and Adrian (\\"We fill each other's gaps.\\"). Nope, what we get is a great deal of chatting around things in place of talk about them: Henry does not articulate to Catherine either his feelings about the campaign horrors he has just been through (though she asks him to) or his feelings about her as such. We get a lot of very specific food and drink orders (especially the drink; hey, it's Hemingway) and a number of discreetly-placed scene omissions (when they're, y'know, doing it)-but virtually snot about why this is happening or what any of it means to either party.Perhaps inarticulateness is the point-or at least a point-that Hemingway is trying to make: war renders every one of us less human, and the participants' reduced state (Be...less than you can be!) incorporates a kind of dumbing down of our desire and ability to communicate with one another, first on the level of nations, then as individuals. While this sounds good as a rationale, it contains one great whomping inconsistency: in his relationships with various secondary characters (the priest, several soldiers, Count Greffi), the hero clearly tries to articulate his feelings on a number of great issues. He will not let war silence his humanity. With the character he is supposed to love, however, and whose death is meant to affect us profoundly as the culmination of the novel, the lieutenant hasn't tried to articulate jack. He's just there. She's just there. It's a war. They're in love. They escape. She croaks anyway. That's a wrap. Strike the set. Chinese for lunch?If the two lines above sound like a movie pitch-bingo. I doubt Hemingway set out to write a screenplay, but let's face it: movies thrive on striking externals, and this is a novel chock full of \`em. Thrilling war scenes major and minor; a handsome young American in picturesque foreign locations; a tall, beautiful, and tragic (or at least \\"tragic\\") heroine. Color in a few of the omitted love scenes and you're ready to start shooting. You may even win some awards: there's just enough to think about here to raise the whole enterprise safely above criticism as exploitation-and even, in the eyes of some, to the level of art. If you're a producer, what's not to like? The surprising thing is that Hollywood has made this movie a mere three times to date (1932, 1957 and a mini-version in 1966). How long do we have to wait, I ask you, before we get to see Keanu and Uma in &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; for the new millenium?In sum, this is not a great novel, but rather a novel with greatness in it-and a great imbalance between its strengths and weaknesses. If this imbalance finds redress in another medium (I haven't seen any of the films), swell. As a novel, in any case, A Farewell to Arms surely deserves to be read, appreciated and criticized on its merits, not as a proto-screenplay. So read it, appreciate it, criticize it. At the very least, its men-at-war scenes will grip and move you, as they have doubtless gripped and moved others for generations.All told, I give it two Italian hand grenades up."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms, written by Ernest Hemingway, classically combines love, misery, seduction, and sorrow all in one historic novel. This wonderful novel depicts the harsh realities of war among two lovers entangled in the mist. The main character, Lieutenant Frederic Henry, and his lover, Nurse Catherine Barkley, initially have a relationship consisting of games, illusions, and fantasies. This cleverly ties in with the war that currently encompasses Henry, World War I. The blending of these aspects results in one of Hemingway's greatest novels.Lieutenant Henry lives his daily life as an ambulance driver for the army. Disillusioned by the war, he meets an English nurse, Barkley, who mourns for her dead fianc&eacute;. They commence a game of seduction, each with their own reasons for playing it. Barkley, psychologically damaged from the death of her fianc&eacute;, struggles to push the history behind her while Henry tries to stay as far away from the war as possible. After a little while together, Barkley brings up the game they play by saying, \\"This is rotten game we play, isn't it\\" (31)? Henry retorts that he \\"treated seeing Catherine very lightly\\" (41).Embodying the stereotype of the testosterone-fed male, Henry also looks for sex from Miss Barkley. He yearns for pleasure in a world filled with despair and death. As the novel progresses, his accounts of the war decline in quality and quantity. Accounts of the war decrease and become less detailed, showing that he continually bothers less with the war. Henry changes from a man living with the war to a man only interested in himself and anything directly related, including Catherine Barkley.The relationship between the two lovers changes as time passes by as well. Their relationship progresses from an illusion to actual feelings of love. \\"We were never lonely and never afraid when we were together\\" (249). Apparently Henry believed love existed when two people felt as they did together. It indirectly affects the war for Henry because as the relationship consumes more of his life, his unwilling grip to war weakens. The importance of it decreases as Barkley's significance increases to him. As time goes on, Henry turns into a man who prioritizes a greater love for Catherine. He throws away his integrity and runs from the army, showing the shifts in his list of priorities. War only existed as something in his way.This anti-war novel clearly convinces all about the unsympathetic truths of World War I or, more simply, war in general. \\"The West front did not sound so good...I did not see how it could go on\\" (118). Throughout the course of the novel, Henry faces the deaths of many of his companions. Upon realizing his love, Catherine Barkley, now must stand at the brink of death, Lieutenant Henry grimly accepts the truth. \\"They killed you in the end. You could count on that. Stay around and they would kill you\\" (327). In all his days in the war, he never realizes the death surrounding him until the person he cares for most begins to slip from his grasp.Hemingway, in his novel, teaches others the psychological features of people, interweaving it with the innuendos of the darkness of war so readers cannot forget the environment and setting that the two main characters feel trapped in. He gives others a refreshing breath from society by denouncing materialism. The idea of denouncing materialism ideally fits in psychologically with the ongoing war. He urges others to reconsider their materialistic priorities for something more genuine. Hemingway never made these materialistic possessions important. Nature, one of the things he embraced, clearly shows its importance when he felt it necessary to write, \\"The first cool nights came, then the days were cool and the leaves on the trees in the park began to turn color\\" (133). He felt it necessary to describe the colored canvas produced by the changing of the surrounding trees as autumn came.As Richard Schickel once said, \\"A great novel is concerned primarily with the interior lives of its characters as they respond to the inconvenient narratives that fate imposes on them.\\" Throughout the novel, Hemingway remains constant in keeping up the realistic atmosphere he introduces in the beginning and how it affects Henry's life. This romantic literature never ceases to be unfair to the readers' high expectations of works by Ernest Hemingway. As a highly popular and recommended novel, it lives up to the just raves. Pick up a copy of this thoughtful, beautifully written novel. Another book I need to recommend -- completely unrelated to Hemingway, but very much on my mind since I purchased a \\"used\\" copy off Amazon is \\"The Losers' Club: Complete Restored Edition,\\" a somewhat raw, but oddly engaging little novel I can't stop thinking about."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I love Ernest Hemingway's writing, and have read a number of his books. This is probably one of the books that he is most well-known for. The story is set on the Italian front of World War I, and it tells the story of two star-crossed lovers. Hemingway's themes for each of his books are so realistic because he experienced a lot of the things he wrote about himself. That's what makes his books so wonderful. Hemingway did not have a good opinion of war, and these thoughts come through loud and clear in this book. The story is about Lieutenant Frederic Henry, an American who has volunteered to serve with an Italian ambulance unit during World War I. Catherine Barkley is the nurse whom Frederic nicknames \\"Cat\\", and who he falls in love with. Hemingway's other characters are all equally well-drawn. His plot and his description of scenes is also wonderful Hemingway uses his descriptions of place as allegories to human well-being and luck. Hemingway associates the plains and rains with death, disease and sorrow, and the mountains and the snow with life, health and happiness. His two lovers experience happiness and safety in the mountains, but they cannot stay there indefinitely, so when they go back to the plains, bad things happen to them. A Farewell to Arms appears to be a bleak tale, but it delineates probably more than any other of Hemingway's works his fatalistic attitude to life and death. Hemingway is a wonderful author, and his works are well worth reading."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Despite criticism of its &quot;harshly realistic&quot; dialogue and the rather simple outer layer to the plot, A Farewell to Arms has emerged as one of the greatest war story ever written. Known for his wealth of experience gained in the brutality of battlefields, Hemingway gained instant fame with his highly autobiographical tale of a tenuous love caught in the sweeping wave of WWI.Set in Italy, the story unfolds when a young American ambulance driver, Henry, meets a gorgeous English nurse, Catherine Berkley, for the first time. Perhaps it was due to the powerful binding hands of the war that Berkley confides in Henry of her tragic love and places instant faith in him. At first, Henry regards Catherine only as an unwonted addition to his foreign &quot;episodes&quot; after he convinces himself that this feeling of strong attraction is only the ramification of war, of loneliness, and of the desire to share one's misery with someone else. Yet as their affair progresses, especially after Henry was wounded and put on covalence leave, he begins to see the sparkle of his passion for Catherine expands into this glowing fire of love. War is a vital component in Henry and Catherine's relationship as they plot their future together with war as their perpetual constraint; they only lean on one another more when Henry was forced to return to the front after learning Catherine is pregnant. The irony of their love is the shared conviction that their affair is in some way a representation of matrimony; refusing to marry Henry after he has learnt of her pregnancy, Catherine urges Henry to go back to where he belongs. During the retreat, Henry deserts the army in order to escape the persecution that awaits all officers. Fleeing back to the side of his love ready to sacrifice his life in order to be with her, Henry prepares Catherine for the journey of their lives. The ending, set in a Swedish hospital, is by no means a reconciling &quot;period&quot; to the long sentence with few commas even.Hemingway's own tragic romance is beautifully depicted by the movie made from Agnes Wiensky's novel, In Love and War. In some way, despite occasional righteousness and victors' justice, war is an opening to the broader side of nature's hideousness. Wars are not meant to be sweet and gentle, even if they are enshrouded with the divine touch of patriotism and of love. Henry and Catherine had grace under the soaring siege of WWI because they didn't just observe the on-going war as a superfluous event, but as a contagion of fear from which they must flee. And in fact they do flee to freedom. Through Hemingway's laconic and rough narration, few insights emerges above the surface; yet, what his pen doesn't convey on the surface is an even deeper well that awaits discovery and understanding, and that is the reality apart from the polish plane of prose.Some asks if the setting has been different, could A farewell to arms have been culminated by a more jovial ending that may in some way capture the triumphant nature of love. After all, we as a species do rise above history, more often triumphant than not. But Hemingway is not only a survivor of two wars, he is also the keeper of poignant memories of his own love loss. It doesn't necessarily mean that Henry and Catherine's love was killed by war-it was finished by fate. Their love never died, it is immortal in the sense that their tale is an on-going story without end. Their love is as great as love can be even without ornamental phrases fictional lovers whisper in each other's ears; one gesture, one glance, one word is enough to convince each other as well as the readers how strong the war has made them to be, as one.Men make war, true enough for most of Hemingway's works, but also, more significantly, wars make men. Hemingway is one of those who were certainly made stronger by not only triumph, but also losses in the hands of fate and of Self."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Of all of Hemingway's works, I had only previously read &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; (a masterpiece) when I started this novel. It is a crude, dispassionate and cold testimony of the life of an American soldier on the Italian front in WWI. Henry, an ambulance driver just like Hemingway himself was in the same theater of war, gets wounded and is taken to a hospital where he spends several months. He eventually falls in love -thinly at first- with the British nurse who takes care of him.But falling in love in the middle of a war is not an easy thing. Henry's psyche is, understandably, shattered by the devastating experience and he tries hard not to fall too deep for the nurse. But love is also a strong passion and at some point he decides to desert the Army in order to pursue his love. The ending is moving and at the same time disturbing, showing how war kills even those who survive.In spite of being well written, I take a star away from the book for one single reason: even though I can understand the stressing circumstances under which this love develops, thorughout the novel I felt that Henry was still a shallow man, without the resolve to take a firm course of action. Neither he nor the nurse are very likable, and the novel is permanently permeated by that sense of nothingness, by the nefarious existentialism that influenced much of last century's literature and which, I understand, is a characteristic of much of Hemingway's work. The novel is good but character-development fails and in the end, it is just a sad, crude story. Compare this with the manly, deeply moving attitude of &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;'s main and only human character towards life and you'll appreciate that Hemingway was capable of a better tale."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I will never understand how this book became a classic. If I slaughtered the English language the way Hemingway did I wouldn't have graduated high-school. As far as reading level goes I hold A Farewell To Arms right up with \\"See Spot Run\\". However, the difference between those two books is that the latter did not contain endless run on sentences. Also, I personally feel that Spot is a much more compelling character than the protagonist in A Farewell To Arms. Many tragic events happen to Hemingway's character but you never once get a glimpse of how this affects him emotionally. The other characters in this book also fail to be anything more than names on a piece of paper. The dialogue is stiff and void of emotion. I seriously doubt that people in the 1920's talked like this. This is basically what the dialogue is like (this is not an actual excerpt):Catherine: \\"You do love me don't you, Darling?\\"Henry: \\"Yes\\"\\"I love you, Darling.\\"\\"I know.\\"\\"You really do love me though don't you, Darling.\\"\\"Yes.\\"\\"Do you love me as much as the other girls you've been with, Darling.\\"\\"More.\\"\\"How many other girls have you been with? Don't tell me I don't want to know, Darling. How many though, Darling?\\"\\"I had the gonorrhea but I did not have the syphilis.\\"\\"I wish I had the gonorrhea so I could be like you, Darling.\\"\\"Rinaldi believes he has the syphilis.....\\"I am not making up that part about Catherine's reaction to Henry's gonorrhea. I remember it clearly because it was probably the juiciest part of the book. Having said all that I have almost forgot why I gave this book more than one star. Here it is: Hemingway really was in WWI and he does give us a glimpse of it though shallow and uninspired."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"When I began to feel a certain indebtedness towards my country to read the supposedly greatest novel to ever come from it, I began preparing myself for a strong opinionated novel. Something groundbreaking. But what I found in it's place was just a simple but flowing love story. Hemingway places no set rules for loving someone, I believe his sole purpose was to give an example of something pure, and simple, and good in a time of great doubt of the morality of humanity. By placing obstacles in each of the lovers way and describing their triumph he exemplifies their devotion to a worthy cause. Despite each of the characters physical and mental abandonment of the things they had previously known, Henry finds himself beaten when Catherine and their child are taken away from him in an unlikely and tragic death. Could this mean that because of the world's general coldness and unfeeling nature it will allways destroy such innocent themes as love and devotion, or is this story to say that past actions will never be forgotten and someone will allways be held accountable for them? Hemingway doesn't say, that is the beauty of it. He presents a story in a compelling and drawing-in manner whithout giving any absolute views. A great writer, I believe, is one that can present facts to a reader and make him think about them. Hemingway accomplishes this to no end in A Farewell to Arms."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I give the Kindle version of this book 1 star -- less if I could. Hemingway's book definitely rates at least 5 stars.I like having Kindle versions of books because they are easy to highlight, I can change the type size when my eyes are getting tired, and it is easy to carry a lot of books on one Kindle. But I have serious problems with the Kindle version of Hemingway's book: it is difficult to navigate to specific chapters in the book, it is overpriced, and it doesn't even include everything the printed version has.The printed book has chapters but no Table of Contents, but it doesn't really need one since you can just flip though the pages of the printed book to find a particular chapter. But the Kindle version suffers from the lack of a Table of Contents. I had to go through and bookmark each chapter to help me navigate through it since I was reading it for a class and the instructor kept referring to specific chapters. Besides having chapters, the printed book is also divided into 5 \\"books\\" but the Kindle version completely leaves them out.I suppose I might be more understanding if the Kindle version was reasonably priced but, in fact, it costs several dollars more than the paperback version -- it sure feels like somebody, probably the publisher, is greedy and doesn't really care if they sell an inferior product since no effort was made to make this a Kindle \\"friendly\\" book."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Like several other reviewers, I have just re-read this \\"high school classic\\" after, gulp, 40 plus years. The passage of time, plus the world events that have occurred in the interim have made parts of the novel much more understandable. For example, attacks by Croatian units, that I had never heard of, and no, Bosnians are not Christians (well, as we know now, many of them are not). This novel was written during the period when World War I was still called The Great War, and only 10 years before the Second one started. It is based on Hemingway's own experiences in the Italian Army. During the \\"Great War\\" Italy was on the side of the allies, and the actual fighting described takes place on a front only lightly covered in books written in English, the one between Italy and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Hemingway invariably refers to the later as simply the \\"Austrians,\\" although the troops could be from Bosnia or the present day Czech Republic.The book has been billed as the anti-war novel of WW I, and with statements like: \\"There is a class that controls a country that is stupid and does not realize anything and never can. That is why we have this war.\\" (p 51) There is little doubt that it is that, a statement that unfortunately wears all too well with time. The futility and stupidity of the war shows throughout the novel. I would have to remove the definite article however, since there were numerous other anti-war novels produced, with \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" perhaps the most famous, but also Jules Romains' \\"Verdun\\" and Graves' \\"Goodbye to All That.\\"Other passages are equally relevant today: \\"Perhaps wars weren't won any more. Maybe they went on forever. Maybe it was another Hundred Years' War.\\" (p 118)The novel has also been billed as a love story; in fact, in an extreme bit of hyperbole, the blurb on the back of my Scribner Library copy called it: \\"one of the most moving love stories ever written.\\" The purported love is between two foreigners swept up by the war in Italy, the American, Tenente Henry, who is serving in the ambulance corps, and the Scot, Catherine Barkley, who is serving as a nurse. The love seems to bloom when Henry is wounded, and in one of the clich&eacute;s of war, is nursed back to health by Barkley, who becomes pregnant in the process. Hemingway is famous for his laconic prose, but in the case of this relationship, I found it falling flat, more like the inarticulate grunts of \\"Joe Six Pack.\\" Barkley's insipid \\"coo-cooing\\" should be an embarrassment for any woman (or man, in touch with his feelings, as the expression goes) to read. It simply did not work for me.Henry did what soldiers in other pointless, futile wars (and aren't they all?) dream of doing, from scenes in \\"Dr. Zhivago,\\" to Tim O'Brien's \\"Going After Cacciato\\"; he simply walked away. He made his own \\"separate peace.\\" Other reviewers have stated his reason was his love for Barkley. I found this to be only tangential - the real reason seemed to be the treatment received by the retreating front-line Italian troops by what we called REMF's in Vietnam, the Rear-Echelon M... F... But his subsequent life seemed as improbable as O\\"Brien's \\"Going After Cacciato,\\" which was at least written as a fantasy (and one I shared!) It is so nice to not have money worries, and for mysterious checks to always show up on time, three standard deviations outside the norm for actual troops in a war.Overall, Hemingway led a life of variety and adventure, capturing much on paper, and introducing a new style to novels. This novel may be the more famous, but I personally found \\"To Have and To Have Not\\" to be the more realistic and well-written, and thus will only venture a 4-star for this one."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I won't try to dispense any cheap psychoanalysis on this novel; or take any pot shots at Hemingway the man (he had frailties and insecurities like every human being), but some, particularly feminists, love to pick on him). I will say that this is, simply, a great novel (his greatest being For Whom the Bell Tolls) and the ending, like most of his novels, is devastating in effect. Despite the hard prose, you see a writer who chooses a subject to confront his own emotional wounds, no matter how cleverly he tries to disguise them."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This, one of Hemingway's first, is said to be the best American novel to emerge from World War I. Against the backdrop of a war-torn Italy and soldiers on the front-line tired of fighting, Hemingway presents a love story between Lieutenant Henry, an ambulance driver, and Catherine Barkley, an English nurse. What amazes me the most is the way Hemingway's short prose manages to convey so much pain and anguish. The characters' disdain for the war really does bleed through everything. And the prose never shifts its pace or diction - Hemingway uses the same short, descriptive sentences to describe a scene and to describe the death of a character.I'm not sure I can see many weaknesses in this novel except one thing - the sheer annoyingness of Catherine. There were so many instances when I wanted to slap her for her constant repetitiveness. I would argue there are few heroines who come across as irritating on the page. And yet, regardless of this, you ultimately root for the two characters as they retreat from the on-coming German army and then flee into Switzerland.I only wish more writers today were writing stories as wonderful (and ultimately tragic) as this one.Some great quotes:\\"You're my religion. You've all I've got.\\"\\"We never get anything. We are born with all we have and we never learn. We never get anything new. We all start complete.\\"\\"No, that is the great fallacy; the wisdom of old men. They do not grow wise. They grow careful.\\""},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I have spent a political lifetime arguing that the nature of modern society has turned on the dramatic and deadly events that became what we know in history as World War I. A Farewell to Arms is Ernest Hemingway's attempt to come to grips with that notion in novelistic form. He combines the two themes that he is noted for and accomplished at writing about - love and war- and demonstrates how hard that combination is on the love side of the equation. Here we find the first flourishes of that angst, desperation and sense of futility in the persons of the main characters, a young fancy-free American officer and a British nurse who had recently lost her fianc&eacute; in battle, that would characterize the survivors of the war- the \`lost generation'.When I reviewed Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises I argued that Scott Fitzgerald had the truer ear for the pathos of the \`lost generation' after the war. I also noted that Hemingway had a much better ear and style for the love and war combination. Here Hemingway clearly wins. Maybe it is the trauma of war that makes his sparseness of language and stripped emotion work. Maybe it is his eternal quest for honor and the other attributes of machismo closely associated with the war experience. Maybe it is because he could just flat-out write a hell of a war story. But, damn, you had better read this novel if you want to know what writing is all about."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms, written by Nobel-Prize winning author Ernest Hemingway, is an enticing drama focusing on the tragedies of love and war in the 1900's. Amid the war front scenes, hospital visits, and seductive bedroom talk, Hemingway does an excellent job portraying love and life throughout World War II.Hemingway ties his life into this story, as he continues to transform his war stories into the life of Tenete Frederic Henry. During the first World War, Hemingway played an active role as an ambulance driver just like Henry, the main character in A Farewell to Arms. While Henry was visiting the war front, he was hit by trench mortar and transported to a hospital in Milan. Once in Milan, Hemingway underwent many surgeries on his foot and leg and it was months before he was able to walk with the aid of crutches. He was then diagnosed with jaundice, which prolonged his stay at the hospital. Each of these events happens to Henry, and in the end, both the author and his character returned to the war front and continued as ambulance drivers. The plot Hemingway created continues to grow as Catherine Barkley becomes a very prominent character in the book.Henry and Catherine met in Gorizia, Italy. They seemed to detest each other during their first few encounters, and this is shown when Catherine hits Henry. Henry narrates \\"I leaned forward in the dark to kiss her and there was a sharp stinging flash. She had slapped my face hard\\" (26). Catherine continues to say \\"I didn't mean to hurt you. I did hurt you, didn't I?\\" (26). This shows that she does care, but wanted to make sure her actions spoke to Henry. Throughout the entire story, Catherine continuously asks Henry's opinion of things. She feels as if she must always be the best she can be to him, and by saying things such as \\"You see, I'll make you a fine wife\\" (280). His opinion of her mattered greatly, but he continued to love her more and more as each day passed. He said, \\"But we were never lonely and never afraid when we were together. I know that the night is not the same as the day: that all things are different, that the things of the night cannot be explained in the day, because they do not then exist, and the night can be a dreadful time for lonely people once their loneliness has started. But with Catherine there was almost no difference in the night except that it was an even better time. If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them\\" (249). The couple became pregnant with a child that neither of them seemed to want. They were not legitimately married yet, so both of them felt ashamed and had planned on waiting until the birth to commence their ceremony. In the end, this was the most fatal mistake these characters made.Mistakes make characters real, allowing the reader to make a personal connection with them. Hemingway created very amiable characters that are very easy to relate to. The love in this story is very fairytale-like. It is also something that many people dream of attaining some day. The war taking place only adds to the power of Catherine and Henry's love. The overall feeling at the end of the story is remorse and sadness, but because of the vibrant love Catherine and Henry shared, the reader is also left with a sense of happiness.Hemingway's technique of throwing in details where they are un-needed may seem unnecessary at first, but when the book is finished, it is those details that help with the overall understanding of the story. Also, his informal style and easy-going vocabulary allow the book to be accessed by many different age groups and genders. Hemingway does and admirable job tying war and love together. A Farewell to Arms is a tear-jerking, heartbreaking romance that gets into the heart of it's readers. Not only does it go into detail about the War front, but it tells one of the greatest love stories of all times."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"None of Hemingway's work including A Farewell To Arms should be touted as &quot;Classic&quot;. Hemingway caught a ride on the coat tails of F. Scott Fitzgerald and without him as a predecessor Hemingway's body of work would have died the timely death it deserved. A Farewell To Arms is yet another example of Hemingway's inability to forward narrative in an interesting manner or to develop characters that anybody could care a whit about"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"An obvious jagged line of disagreement pervaded my AP Liturature class after reading this book: the boys seemed to love it, and the girls hate it. For one thing, Hemingway writes action. No sentiment, no pity, no abstract ideas, no emotion allowed, only the brutal physical truth of war and of love. The storyline revolves around the (naturally) physical relationship between an American ambulance driver Frederick Henry and the British nurse Catherine. The book showed a horribly dark side to love and life that I had never considered before, but I'm afraid that Hemmingway's laconic style, along with his assumption that the reader knew exactly what the author ment, bothered me. 30% of the book is dialogue, and the dialouge is mostly monosylables. Thumbs up to subject, thumbs down to style. I'll stick to Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This New Years, I only made one resolution: to read at least 25 books by my 25th birthday (October 24, 2005) and fifty books by the end of 2005. After finishing Last Exit to Brooklyn for book four, I was at a bit of a loss on what to read. David was still reading Ulysses, and there weren't any books on the list really calling me to read them. Then, I awoke one morning two weeks ago to find that one of my favourite living authors was no longer living. Hunter S. Thompson was a fan of Hemingway, and rumour had it that he actually typed out an entire Hemingway novel when he was younger in order to learn the style. Hemingway was considered one of Dr. Thompson's inspirations, and if it's good enough for Hunter, it's good enough for me.There are many things I could say about Farewell to Arms, and I'm not sure where to begin. Don't waste your time might be one. There are about 70 pages of good text dispersed throughout the 250+ pages of texts, the remainder being filler material to illustrate a really annoying and demented love story and a rather boring war. Lt. Henry runs about as a World War I ambulance driver, eventually becoming wounded and deserting the army due to the horrors of war-horrors that don't show up until you're about 70 pages from the end of the book, mind you. The rest of his war time is spent getting drunk and laid, but not in a very interesting or exciting way.Critics have called the style terse. I call it boring.His love interest, Catherine, is about as annoying as females in a male-centric world get. She's a blonde air-headed nurse whose idealised ideas and strange, light, flowery dialogue borders on psychotic at points. Later, Hemingway tries to defend his heroine by having her say that she was \\"a bit crazy\\" when she met Henry-the understatement of the year.Predictable is another word that springs to mind. Maybe it is because Hemingway has become such a standard in literature copied by so many writers that what was once fresh and new has become dated and cliche, but I really cannot imagine the ending of the book ever was anything but predictable. It's one of my main criticisms of Hemingway, from the first piece I ever read by him (the short story \\"Hills Like White Elephants\\") to this novel. Not only is his prose sparse and utilitarian for no apparent reason other than defining a style for himself, but there is no forward momentum to keep my interest piqued. Usually, I can read a book of 250 pages in a week or less. This book took me three weeks because it simply wasn't a pressing concern. Reading Last Exit or Norwegian Wood for this 50 books project, I was constantly compelled to read, sometimes sacrificing meals and sleep to read because I wanted to know what happened. Who lived? Who died. There's really no way to empathise with Hemingway's characters, and it is in this way that the book falls short.Detachment is another applicable word. Everything is detached. As an American fighting in the Italian army, Lt. Henry is not attached to the war, which his country has not entered yet, nor is he attached to the troops he fights with. He develops what I can only call a superficial love with Catherine, for no matter how much he professes his dear, undying love for his girlfriend, it never feels genuine. It all seems to be a show, part of an elaborate farce that Hemingway is putting on for himself.There were times when I wanted to just call it quits, to throw in the towel and say I simply couldn't do it. I couldn't go on. I cried over this book, not because I was so emotionally involved in the story, but because each page I turned was physically painful to me because the story was not rewarding my efforts as a reader. I felt stupid. How could I, an English Literature student who has been reading since before she was two years old not finish Hemingway? It's a classic. What kind of idiot was I? What was wrong with me?Then I realised there was nothing wrong with me-it was the book that was the problem.If there is any reason to finish the book, you'll find those reasons from page 192-193, between 210-215, and on the last page of the book. These are the places where Hemingway's style really comes through and you can see his influence on writers such as Thompson. Otherwise, there are much better anti-war novels out there which are much more accessible. I definitely recommend Slaughterhouse-Five instead of this novel. If you're interested specifically in anti-war literature surrounding the first World War, might I suggest the poem \\"Dulce et Decorum Est\\" by Wilfred Owen. Either of those will show you that war is hell, and with more emotion and urgency than Hemingway could ever muster about even the most powerful of subjects."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Well written book as most of Hemingway's books are but the ending is just so sad!

In my opinion, if your interested in war novels, then yes I could give it a chance. But for my own interest, i'm not into war novels. Fredrick Henry was the protagonist of the novel; he was a ambulance driver for the Italian Army. You see many sides of Fredrick, but not enough for me to get into his head and relate to him. Fredrick meets a nurse Catherine whom he falls head over heals with her seduction, and loves instantly. The reader follows Fredrick's decisions as in leaving the war, his friends, and everything he was involved with behind for Catherine. Catherine and Fredrick go through many obstacles together, and find themselves moving to Switzerland until they got arrested by the police, but got away.

It showed how horrible war can really be. I would recomend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Three cheers for the American Red Cross and its recruitment efforts during the Great War and beyond. Hemingway volunteered and left from New York in May, 1918, to serve as an ambulance driver attached to the Italian army, only to be wounded shortly thereafter on July 8th, as are so many civilians during all wars. During hospital recovery, the young Hemingway became amorously involved with a Red Cross nurse from Philadelphia, Agnes von Kurowsky, the picture of Midwestern wholesomeness, who started rejecting him in 1919 and eventually married someone else she met in Haiti while on Red Cross assignment in 1928.The novel \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" (1929) is, in part, Hemingway's answer to Agnes. He remakes himself into a soldier in the Allied Italian army, but avoids the class stigma of the enlisted in favor of officer status. Henceforth, protagonist Frederic Henry is simply referred to as \\"Tenente,\\" or lieutenant, though the anti-war tone of the novel soon has one character ask \\"Tenente? Who's a Tenente? A basso gli ufficiali! Down with the officers!\\" Henry is, of course, an officer who largely refuses to keep a professional distance from his men, preferring that they see him as a one-of-the-guys friend.To his credit, Hemingway uses the novel to downplay his \\"bravery\\" medal awarded during his brief exposure to combat conditions. Henry's friend Rinaldi mentions to him that \\"they say if you can prove you did any heroic act you can get the silver. Otherwise it will be the bronze. Tell me exactly what happened. Did you do any heroic act?\\" Henry's answer is consistent: \\"No,\\" I said. \\"I was blown up while we were eating cheese.\\" Hemingway's intention is, of course, to debunk all forms of bravery, spirituality, and patriotism: \\"I was always embarrassed by the words sacred, glorious, and sacrifice...I had seen nothing sacred, and the things that were glorious had no glory...\\"So what does Frederic Henry believe in? Spirits. Well, on just about every page he believes that he should seek out alcohol so that it's embedded into every facet of his life (too bad for later college freshmen who were force-fed this novel). As a movement incubator, Hemingway certainly qualifies as a drug-oriented forerunner of both punk and Gonzo, if not the father of. After all, Prohibition was well underway in America when the novel was being written. Always good to take sides in a controversy. Did Hemingway become an ex-patriot so that he could drink himself freely into oblivion, a slow march toward his eventual suicide?At one point, during what appears to be a cowardly mass retreat, Henry and other officers are held accountable by military officials who seek to re-establish discipline and patriotism. The \\"battle police\\" asked questions like \\"Why are you not with your regiment?\\" and \\"Do you not know that an officer should be with his troops?\\" One officer flatly laid it out to the miscreants: \\"It is you and such as you that have let the barbarians onto the sacred soil of the fatherland...Italy should never retreat.\\" Of course, all of this means little to Henry who is neither Italian, nor an advocate of higher values of any kind.Hemingway's style in the novel is to be commended, however, because it attempts to simulate the adumbrated, laconic rhythms of everyday speech, much applauded by foreigners reading English for the first time. He's the master of adolescent letter beginnings such as \\"How are you. I'm fine. Hope you're fine too.\\" Yes, the common man triumphant in the Hollywood era of the strong, silent type. Seems to work well with those in an alcoholic stupor, putting one foot (or word, in this case) in front of another. Capably mirroring those in the field, Frederic Henry is bereft of the big picture and historical context."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I read this book in high school and I fell in love.

It is honest and sensitive, while at the same time depressing and dark. There seems to be no hope at all in the lives of the two main characters, and this lack of hope leads us to expect the ending. The review on the back of the book says that this is the best novel to come out of WWI. I suppose it fits in that category--mirroring the modernist mentality of isolation and disconnection. It's not hard to read and you really can't put it down once you begin so be prepared."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Ernest Hemingway's Farewell to Arms is a good book that offers a worthy love story that takes place in central Europe during World War I. The main character, Frederic Henry, whom is an American fighting for the Italian Army, tells the novel. At the beginning of the book Frederic falls in love with a young nurse, Catherine Barkley. Throughout the book the two fall deeply in love and begin to meet often. As their affection for each other increases the intensity of the war also increases. Foreshadowing throughout the book leads the reader into a dramatic ending. Even thought the book offered a developed plot and descriptive characters it was hard to follow the enhanced theme. The use of Italian during the book adds for a more confusing story, but attaches deeper character in the story line. Although the novel was nice it had was a drawn out love story that did not interest me totally. If you are looking for a all out war story this is a decent book but it is geared more toward the person in line for a dramatic tragedy."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I get why Hemingway is seen as such an important stylist. His terse, declarative sentences are a breath of fresh air after the florid, overwrought style of a lot of 19th century prose (Victorians, I'm thinking of you). And I understand that this is an important account of an often forgotten part of an often forgotten war. In spite of those things, I have to say, I was pretty bored for most of this. It was dull to me for the same reason that John Wayne is dull to me. Namely, because this sort of blunt, tell-it-like-it-is macho crap takes out half of the nuances that make life interesting. Even Henry's disillusionment and Cathrine's pathetic co-dependency issues have this flat, cocky quality to them. I think I'd need to be the sort of person who is at ease around large caliber hunting rifles and has a rumpus room decorated with dead animal heads before I could really enjoy this"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I enjoy \\"the classics\\" and have read most of Hemingways works. This isn't up to par of the others and I would skip it. I had to force myself to read it."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemmingway was not one of my favorite books to read, however, it was not the worst. It had a well developed theme, but I did not like the pace or the ending of the book. First, let me tell you what I liked about this book.Basically this book is about an American in the Ialian army(Lieutenant Henry)who falls in love with an English Nurse(Catherine Berkley). Henry and Catherine both enjoy their jobs but when they fall in love, their work makes it hard for them to see each other. This theme is a combination of two elements: love and war. These two elements battle each other in the novel. Henry and Catherine want to be together but the war often separates them. This is a well developed theme which occurs throughout the whole book. A good example of this is after Henry's knee heals up, he is ordered back to the front. Neither Henry nor Catherine want to leave each other but Henry must get on the train to the front. Henry and Catherine end up not seeing each other for many days. However not being able to see each other leads to Henry and Catherine abandoning the war and running away to Switzerland.What I personally didn't like about the book was the pace and the ending. While reading it I often was bored. I felt that there could have been more events that happened to Lieutenant Henry. I also felt that what took Hemmingway a couple pages to write could have been summed up in a paragraph or two. I thought that Hemmingway dragged the story out. I also did not like the ending. I'm sure everyone wanted the story to end happily but of course it didn't.Overall, I would say that this was just an &quot;ok&quot; book. It did not hold my attention and I would have liked it to have had another ending as most people probably would have liked. However, Hemmingway does a great job of portraying the theme of love and war in this book."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Hemingway's A Farewell To Arms is often hailed among his best works and is often called the best World War I novel. The latter I disagree with, as All Quiet was a more complex story about dehumanization and death, and the horrors of war; the former I would not know, as this is all I have read by Hemingway. As far as the novel goes, however, it is a fine account of life and death, love, glory, and loss. Its protagonist, Lt. Frederick Henry, is an Italian Army ambulance driver. He meets a British nurse, they share an affair, and Henry even decides to desert for Catherine. Despite its longevity, this book is a poignant look at a doomed affair, an examination of the futility of war, that are still timely today. I guess the only objection I have is the typical Hemingway deal: Hemingway and Fitzgerald were once friends, but the relationship suffered from mutual envy: Fitzgerald envied Hemingway his success, Hemingway envied Fitzgerald's style. It is plain to see, when reading both of them, that Fitzgerald is clearly in his element in writing beautiful and moving pieces of literature, just like a bird singing. Hemingway's style is a bit more forced, and he likes to use a lot of exposition so as to make his imagery more vivid. None of this detracts from the substance of the story, yet the style is a substance all its own. In the Catcher in the Rye, Holden Caulfield, in a literary analysis, decided that The Great Gatsby is a far superior book than A Farewell To Arms for the sole reason that Henry is a phony. If you have read that book, you might be tempted to take this with a grain of salt, but when you consider Hemingway's background and the fact that he and Henry share initials, it is easy to assume Holden is talking about Hemingway himself, and that he is forcing his writing for success. The quote is Salinger accusing Hemingway of selling out. In any case, the book is not truly one of the best ever because of its failure to address any universal human truths. Nevertheless, it is an enduring and interesting book and, although I did not think it among the best ever, I have talked with some that loved it. I would suggest reading it for yourself, as you might think differently"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"The world is convinced Hemingway is the master of the English Language. He is, I will agree, in the SHORT STORY. Hemingway's minimalist structure and technique is perfect for a ten-twenty page story, but just becomes repetitive and obtrusive in a novel. Farwell to Arms feels like Hemingway took a short story idea, S-T-R-E-T-C-H-E-D it, and wrote the book. Of course, it's very easy to read and understand. But, it is DULL and extremely tiresome to read. Hemingway's characters probably are the worst thing about this book (and 99.9 percent of all Hemingway). Some praise his examples of the 'lost generation', I laugh. All his female characters are cardboard pieces, continually demure, and in need of men. (Note most of Hemingway's dialouge for women can be transferred into this sentence(s): 'I need you, I love you, and I will do whatever you want.) His male characters ('the lost generation') are all the same in every single thing he writes, for Hemingway mastered the formula character. If you want a good example of Hemingway, don;t bother reading this long short story, read 'The Short Happy Life of Frances Macomber'&lt;an actual short story&gt;. The rest is just formula."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms is a World War I epic that ties in closely with Hemingway's personal experiences as an ambulance driver in Italy. Lieutenant Henry tells the story in retrospect. It follows his experiences as an American who drives an ambulance for the Italian army. While in Italy Henry meets a nurse's aide, Catherine, and is immediately taken by her. After Henry gets hurt in an explosion, Catherine is transferred to the hospital he is staying at and their love intensifies. After leaving the hospital Henry must go back to the front where he has a few bad experiences and decides to retreat from the army to be with Catherine.Hemingway writes this book to show a great love during the horrors of war and yet neither the war, nor the great love is believable. Hemingway's choppy writing style is very precise, but its blandness does not match the passionate affair he tries to create between Henry and Catherine nor does it match the brutality of the war. The heaviest description occurs in the first two chapters of the novel where Hemingway sets the scene of battle in a rural area. This rather intricate description of scenery does not provide a good hook and should have been used instead to describe the more important element of the book, human relationships. The majority of the novel is dialogue and may have been easier to follow had the book been set up as a play. Some of the banter, however, is amusing; especially the parts that display the more eccentric characters such as Rinaldi and Fergy. The novel as a whole is mediocre and I would not recommend it to first time Hemingway readers."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I'm consistently amazed at how revered Hemingway is, and at his status in American Literature. I've read three of his books and have never cared about a single character. In this novel especially, I find the dialogue wooden and tedious, often extending to lines of blunt interchanges with no hint at the way words are expressed or received. I don't expect a character to be handed to me neatly analysed and labelled on a plate, but some key focal points from which the reader can form an interpretation are essential in creating a relationship with that character. I find the central characters in this novel impossible to visualise.There are many more subtle and dramatic war/ anti-war novels, and countless better love stories.I just don't get it!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I read this in high school and now again as an adult in my mid-40s. I am baffled that critics call this a classic (and I was a lit major). The characters lack any complexity, the story has little dramatic tension, and the characters' development is not insightful or even interesting. There are extended conversational passages that lead nowhere and just communicate the main emotion of the book: an ennui--perhaps caused by war, perhaps by the main character's own alienated personality.The only part that really had some insight and even tension(hence the two stars) is the first third in which Hemingway describes war itself and the sensation of being badly injured. This is clearly autobiographical and is much more alive than there rest of the book--after that, it's all predictable and uninteresting."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Okay, I don't mean to be critical of Hemingway's writings. I mean I can hardly call myself an expert since I've only read A Farewell to Arms. And to tell the truth it's all I desire to read. The only reason I picked it up was because it was on my high school summer reading list. I know he's well known for his writing, but I found it rather asinine. I'm sorry, but his short, choppy writing style just didn't work with me. Maybe I like it when books go into deep detail and take awhile to say one thing, or maybe it's just that I haven't let Hemingway grow on me yet. The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 is because I thought he did a wonderful job at portraying a love story during the brink of war. So if you must read this book, read it for the story line and not the author."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Very good book.

He had this....but passed it on to a friend, and I assume it is appreciated by anyone interested."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"The ladies in my book club and I all read this MANY years ago, it was interesting to read it again after so long.The dialog drags a bit because of first person narration, but once I adapted to the writing style, it was an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"*** This review contains spoilers ***'A Farewell to Arms' is the story of the American Frederic Henry, who serves in the Ambulance Corps of the Italian Army during WWI. There he meets and falls in love with an English nurse named Catherine Barclay, and after a disastrous retreat by the Italians where Lt. Henry is implicated as a traitor, he and Catherine escape to Switzerland. Catherine, now pregnant, and Frederic spend an idyllic winter waiting out the war and for their child to be born. Tragically, neither mother nor child survive the birth, and the book ends forlornly, with Frederic walking away from the hospital in the rain.I do not generally post reviews with such blatant spoilers, though I feel some responsibility alleviated due to the overall awareness of Hemingway's book in our literary culture, or from the films based on it. Even still, I myself didn't know of the particulars of the plot before reading, though I could fairly well guess Catherine's fate based on the melancholy tone of the novel from beginning to end. The difficulty as a reviewer is that my evaluation of the book rests solely on my estimation of the end, and to justify the middling rating, I felt it necessary to specifically outline why the ending is so unsatisfactory.First though, the positives - which are still somewhat relative.Even from a distance of more than eighty years, I can see how this book could have been very fresh when it was published. Hemingway's terse descriptions and pitter-patter dialog must have stunned readers used to floral-arrangement countrysides and refined voices. I think one of the strengths of the book is the Spartan settings, though the conversational pieces sound almost nonsensical to my modern ears. Another strength is its gritty-though-still-restrained realism, both in the descriptions of the war and in the adult situations between Frederic and Catherine. This is, of course, a relative assumption - in comparison to what we have now, 'A Farewell to Arms' is still quite tame and euphemistic; its most shocking moment coming during the retreat as Lt. Henry must deal with insubordinate soldiers.A short blurb from Wikipedia says the book \\"skillfully contrasts the meaning of personal tragedy against... impersonal destruction\\". My objection is that Hemingway _imposes_meaning onto inherently pointless events. It isn't as though women didn't die in childbirth at that time, but by having Catherine die arbitrarily strikes me as contrived for the purpose of theme - which to my mind calls into question the validity of that theme. The treacly descriptions of the couple's time prior to Catherine's death clumsily trolls for our emotional investment in order to make the tragedy even more poignant, yet instead it takes on a melodramatic flair as it insists on elevating these characters to a larger-than-life status.In the end, Frederic Henry walks away in the rain, a lonely, tragic figure for whom only the hardest of hearts will lack sympathy. Catherine Barclay, as a character, lives and dies in order to produce this effect - that was the entire _meaining_ of his 'personal tragedy'. Ultimately, I get the feeling that she was only a prop, a circumstance - she happened to Frederic instead of occupying real space.'A Farewell to Arms' is recommended for its descriptions of the war, which I think are still relevant today. But the love story between Frederic and Catherine is emotionally manipulative for the sake of advancing a theme, and doesn't hold up as well. Three-and-a-half stars."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Simply a great novel by one of the worlds best writers ever. A definite classic from world war one.

A Farwell to Arms provides a vital service in reminding Americans that there was such a thing as World War I, and it was a costly and tragic event. Hemingway has also left us a vital and unusual bit of that war: Italy's involvement. Few Americans realize that Italy was an ally during The Great War; nor do they realize how different in quality this part of the war was from the Western Front. Hemingway has left us something unique: a marker post for a forgotten history. People still read this book today. Only Hemingway could have pulled this off.But these are simply the social and historical reasons for reading this novel. The novel itself is a clear, precise, exciting, exactingly written, and largely free of anti-war statements (there are a few). Hemingway lets the plot and action carry the day, avoiding the pitfalls of the \\"protest novel.\\" There is probably no better piece of writing in 20th century American fiction that the description of the retreat at Caporetto. Moments like these can help offset the terrible characterization of Catherine Barkley, probably one of Hemingway's most embarrassing heroines. She is weak and ineffectual; one sided and not fully fleshed out. This is the clich&eacute; expectation of a Hemingway female character, and unfortunately we find it here in spades."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A great story that captures the true brutality and unforgivingness of war, as well as finding love in the middle of one.

It is an overall good book, and one worth reading."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Ernest Hemingway gained fame in 1926, with the release of his first novel \\"The Sun Also Rises\\". Taken from the Bible, the title is a catchy phrase and one that has an allure all to itself. Considering that Hemingway was only 27 when it came out, the book shows the promise of a young writer struggling to find his niche. The story involves a group of American expatriates in Europe who are all heavily involved in drinking, eating, arguing and sleeping with each other's best friends- and drinking some more. If it were written today, with its' lack of any real \\"action\\" scenes and relatively weak plot, the novel would have trouble gaining the attention of any major publishing house.The one redeeming quality of Hemingway shown in this book which comes out clearly is that he describes scenes, writes dialogue and sketches the \\"landscape\\" in a way which other writers were not doing at the time. His approach is fresh, bold- sometimes shockingly annoying, but obviously different- which sets him apart from his contemporaries. His verbal interactions with others are couched in a style which would be foreign to most people today- and perhaps many of those in his day...but that's part of what makes his writing so interesting. My views are perhaps somewhat clouded, as I am a true Hemingway fan- but for a lot of other reasons and mostly for his other novels, including the under-rated and not widely covered \\"Islands in the Stream\\", which is one of his very finest works.\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" was a good start for Hemingway- but he shows his talent more strongly in the following novel released a few years later- \\"A Farewell to Arms\\". His descriptions of his inner psyche, the thoughts of others, their interactions in this later book are signs of the maturing Hemingway, a young man in \\"The Sun Also Rises\\"...growing to a man in \\"A Farewell to Arms\\"- with a greater depth of character, a more worldly view...and many more stories to tell...-Gene PisasaleAuthor- \\"Lafayette's Gold- The Lost Brandywine Treasure\\""},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I found the first two-thirds of this book slow.

I don't want to ruin the ending, but I have to say I was surprised by it.

I liked the plot and story line of this book more than I did the style. Personally, Hemingway's style is not my favorite because it leaves you guessing most of the time about how the characters feel. It depends if you like deciding the way characters feel or you like having the author state their feelings and deciding how you feel about the emotions of the characters. Although, the plot is very interesting all the conflicts such as all the risks he takes to leave the front to go see Catherine leading up to the climax of them escaping to Switzerland via a small row boat stolen from the nearby city of Stresa. But it had a very unusual ending, I had a feeling that it was not going to be a perfect happy ending because war was involved, and war is deadly and hopeless. The ending was a letdown though I expected Hemingway to incorporate some sort of happiness within the ending. I would recommend this book for people who have time to analyze the text, because in my opinion I had to really pay attention to each action that was made by each character since it always lead to something else.

I did not get any previous warning on how plain the writing is so, at first, I was a little disappointed. It's a lot of action and not a lot of explanation behind it, which was a little annoying to me. But I was able to get used to it and generally enjoy the story. Hemingway used some nice imagery at the start of most chapters, describing where they are and what it looked like. It was very descriptive and kept me turning the pages.As for the content, it seemed like a typical war-love story: two normal people who met each other by chance and had some awkward encounters but ultimately ended up falling in love and had a dream of leaving the war behind and being together forever! But that doesn't mean I didn't like it. I just wish Catherine Barkley hadn't been so crazy and clingy throughout the book. Yes, there were reasons behind her actions, but she was so ditzy sometimes and it was hard to get through. Frederic Henry, though, was an okay guy. You didn't get a clear look at his thoughts, but you could kind of tell that he was a pretty relaxed guy. He was very responsible when it came to the war and his duty, and he truly loved Catherine, even if she was a little psycho. There were a few scenes between Henry and Catherine that caught my attention and had me feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. The ending was my favorite, though. Henry's actions at the end gave me a clear view of how he was feeling without even spelling it out. It was overall a good read, it was interesting enough but it didn't have me on the edge of my seat at any time. I enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to anyone interested in Hemingway, but I probably won't read it again."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"Love this edition of my favorite book.

Very happy with this purchase!!"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I enjoy the writing in this book by Mr Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961). It was a gift from my sister's family, and I am glad I had the oppotunity to read it. The liner notes write that he did more to change the English-language novel than any other twentieth-century writer. His &quot;sparse and unemotional style is probably the most imitated.&quot; In 1953, he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his novella &quot;The Old Man &amp; the Sea&quot;; then, in 1954, he received a Nobel Prize for Literture. &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; (1927) was his greatest success up to that time. Mr Hemingway writes an almost auto-biographical account of a love story during war time. Like the protagonist, Henry Frederick, he drove an ambulance for the Red Cross on the Austro-Italian Border during the European Great War (1914-1918). Mr Hemingway was wounded, hospitalised and fell in love with one of the Red Cross nurses who cared for him, Ms Agnes von Kurowsky. The book he has written draws on these experiences and the result is a stirring description of people's reactions and behaviours during the stresses of war. Henry Frederick drives an ambulance on the Austro-Italian Border during the Great War. He meets Ms Catherine Barkley, who is from Scotland and is working as a nurse in an English Hospital unit. The three great adventures in this book are Frederick's recovery from his battle wound, his involvement in the Italian retreat, and finally, when he and Catherine escape. The narrative of the Italian retreat is quite impressive to me because Mr Hemingway captures a feeling a hopelessness. It reaches an horrifying level as he decribes the Italian soldiers shooting their own officers. Throughout, I am impressed with the description of the coping methods different characters use. Many times humour is a source of relief. My favourite anecdote is when the Italian barber mistakes Henry for an Austrian officer. The porter cannot contain his laughter at the thought of our hero under the sharp razor. If you are interested in the writings of Mr Ernest Hemingway, or in romance against a wartime setting, this book will be interesting to you."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"\\"If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.\\"-Ernest HemingwayThis novel is about courage, defiance, and acceptance. It is about facing fear and conquering it, and about finding your own way through life. In a sense, it is a sort of bildungsroman or coming of age story. In another, it is pure tragedy, unrefined and raw as real life can get. A beautiful and meaningful novel that doesn't leave one satisfied, but wanting more. Depressing and cold, piercingly brutal and at times so warm and heartfelt it hurt, this is not a novel I will soon forget. A Farewell to Arms captures the essence of the fleeting transience of life, and makes no apologies.I find it funny to read the negative comments and notice they are almost all from women, upset with Catherine being \\"an idiot\\" or Frederick being \\"selfish.\\" It is ironic because it is the women leaving these uninsightful comments that are the real idiots. Maybe they saw something of their own abusive husbands and lovers in Frederick? Or maybe they were simply jealous of the genuine passion and honest, unabashed love Catherine got to experience, that they themselves have never felt? Either way, I think these women and their housewife book clubs should stick to Oprah's reading list from now on, and leave the world of worthwhile literature happily alone.For me, the characters were among Hemingway's finest, most emotional and complex, and it felt as though Hemignway opened up for the first time, in a way that he hadn't before, and would never truly do again. Frederick was noble, unique, sensitive, deeply caring, and way ahead of his time. And yet, there was a naivet&eacute; and innocence about him that made him all the more touching. There was nothing abusive about him, except that he seemed to be so hard on himself. On the other hand, Catherine seemed to be the rock that Frederick depended upon. She was the real strong one in their relationship. In my opinion (I am female, as well, by the way), far from being an idiot, she was an enormously brave, courageous woman, caught in a situation that left her with few alternatives besides hysteria. Yet, instead of breaking down, she managed to put a brave face on throughout it all. That shows class, character, and intelligence, something few women seem to have today. She was someone to look up to. She wasn't afraid of what others think, and she not only dared to leave her country and serve in the war, she risked being socially outcast in going against the strict, traditional values of her time by being a kept, unmarried woman. That doesn't sound like a mysogynistic author to me, to create such a proud and truly remarkable female character. People who say Hemingway was a mysogynist or a male chauvinist don't understand what true respect is, nor do they understand Hemingway. This was the last novel of his I had to read, and I can safely say the feminists have him all wrong. Possibly his most human work."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I love Hernest Hemingway's writing. His prose is so clean, and simple, and yet so rich.

Hemingway writes a vivid and emotional tale that has strong ties to his own life. A Farewell to Arms is a gut-wrenching tale that will leave the reader emotionally exhausted, but very glad to have read it. This is an excellent read and the reader will stay up until they finish the book."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms begins in 1915 when Henry, an American, volunteers to be an ambulance driver for the Italians in World War I. Henry is indifferent and detached from the war and survives by drinking a lot of alcohol and frequenting the local whorehouse. He eventually meets a vulnerable English nurse named Catherine and begins a primitive relationship with her.Henry is wounded by a mortar shell and spends months in the hospital where he consummates his relationship with Catherine. They build an awkward relationship around his hospital room and fall in love. Henry reluctantly returns to the war and takes part in the famous Italian Caporetto retreat and debacle. Henry fights for his survival and those under his command.Hemingway has created a novel with unlikeable characters who struggle to find happiness and peace during WWI. It is a tragedy told in five parts. It is melodramatic at times but holds to Hemingway's theory that \\"war is permanent\\" and that Nature \\"can have only one end\\". Reading Hemingway, one must acknowledge that what isn't said in the book is just as important as what is.A Farewell to Arms depicts WWI as difficult, depressing and impossible to escape. Although Henry escapes the war through his romance with Catherine, it seeks to find him and forever destroy the desperate peace he has found.The greatest part of the novel for me was the Caporetto retreat as it is well written and vivid in description. Overall I liked the book even though I didn't particularly like the characters. I think it is interesting to analyze Hemingway because he was obviously a great novelist for his time. It is sometimes hard to read great books as their writing style and meaning are lost on a generation who didn't experience the truths and horrors that are represented in the pages of the book. I do believe A Farewell to Arms is a valuable and memorable piece of literature and I am glad I read it."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I will not attempt a serious review of this novel. It is too revered a classic for me to have anything to add to the volumes that have already been written. I will instead concentrate on a few points that came to mind when re-reading this for the first time in over twenty years.A Farewell to Arms is regarded as the definitive American novel of WWI. Frederic Henry is an American ambulance driver serving the Italians. He falls in love with British nurse Catherine Barkley. Henry is wounded. He returns to the front after recovering and takes part in the disastrous Italian retreat. Henry is mistaken for an Austrian office in Italian uniform and barely escapes a summary execution. He deserts and runs away to Switzerland with Catherine where she dies in childbirth.Taken as a simple adventure/love story the novel is entertaining and highly readable. Some of the dialogue between the lovers is awkward but the action scenes are well written and believable. The narrator's voice is that of a modern man. Apart from such anachronisms as horse-drawn carriages, capes and puttees the story could have been set in the present day. It is this modern feel that distinguishes Hemingway from his contemporaries. To me Faulkner and Fitzgerald are dated and unreadable by comparison.It is interesting to note that the protagonist spends much of his waking hours consuming alcohol. At one point he becomes jaundiced as the result of alcohol induced liver damage. This is pathological alcoholism rather than recreational overindulgence. Hemingway presents this as a normal and healthy facet of our hero's character. This is quite a departure from what our modern sensibility expects. If written today at least half of the text would deal with touchy-feely aspects of the horrors of alcoholism. Our hero's inner dialogue would be full of the tortures of alcohol addiction. Instead, Hemingway regards this as no big deal.Some aspects of the story did not ring true. Ambulance drivers are unlikely to be officers. I believe Hemingway made Henry an officer because that would allow him to have a more exciting social life than a mere enlisted man. In real life Hemingway was not an officer and the nurse he fell in love with did not have sex with him in his hospital bed. This aspect of the story may be a heartfelt putting to paper of the authors fantasy life. Similarly, Catherine Barkley's death at the end of the novel may be his way of getting back at his real-life sweetheart's rejection of him. Agnes von Kurowsky spurned his marriage proposal; Hemingway kills off her fictional counterpart in retaliation.These minor points aside, A Farewell to Arms is deservedly regarded as a classic. It makes the point that war is hell subtly yet convincingly. Hemingway doesn't need to philosophize endlessly about abstract concepts to get the reader to agree. Henry manages to rejoin the Italian forces retreating from the Germans. Without warning he pulled from a mass of filthy dispirited soldiers marching away from the front. He is singled out for summary execution along with some other hapless officers who have been separated from their men. The smug \\"battle police\\" remorselessly interrogate and execute these men one after another with the same care and concern a meter maid would give in ticketing an expired parking meter. In just a few pages Henry goes from dedicated fighter for the cause to deserter doing all he can to stay alive. The reader makes this transition with him in a way that illustrates the pointlessness of war better than thousands of pages of text."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"In A Farewell to Arms, Hemingway does an excellent job with his description of the events in the novel but the dialogue between Henry, the main character, and the other characters is not great. Especially when Henry talks to his English lover, Catherine Barkley, there is a great deal of shallow affection in their conversations that gets repetitive and annoying. Also in other parts there is dialogue between multiple characters and Hemingway does not distinguish between who is talking often enough, so it becomes confusing. Hemingway does a good job describing the scenery and events, especially with Henry's escape from the Austrian officers and the Spanish police, but once again that section of the book was broken up with dialogue between Henry and Barkley that ruined the mood Hemingway created. After I got around some of the dialogue, A Farewell to Arms turned out to be a good book it was worth the read."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell To Arms is a literary masterpiece, and despite what other online reviewers might say, it is not predominately a war story. While a war might be going on during the book, it is primarily a love story. A story about one mans trials through love and war, mostly love. Also the feeling of being trapped. While it states that he fell madly in love with Ms.Barkley, he is ultimately relieved at not having to be formally married and starting a family. How could it be only about war, with an undertone of love, when throughout the book, Mr.Henry expresses a severe passion to leave the war, the hospital, or anywhere, to be with Cathereine? The description is incredible and the emotion you feel is amazing. You actually FEEL for the characters. That is how i feel. Thank you, and goodnight."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This was a very nice war-time romance, but not what I expected. The story, while always downplayed, is quite gripping at times. It's always interesting to track adventures across Europe in an unusual setting. Hemingway employs his famous journalistic style again. I get rather sick of Hemingway's &quot;strong characters.&quot; I have never met people like these, I guess he has. Something just didn't click. I guess you have to be a Hemingway fan. Obviously, don't look for a story with a point. This is another documentation of a nit of human experience. Take it for what it's worth."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A Farewell to Arms was my first entry into the world of Ernest Hemingway and after reading it I plan on making a few more trips. Some here have said that Hemingway does not develop his characters enough but I beg to differ. Rather, I think that one of the best parts of the novel is the growth we witness in them, particularly in Henry. At first, I felt nothing towards him but as the novel crept slowly towards its inevitable conclusion I realized how human Henry had become and I began to feel for him. On the other hand, Catherine remains stagnant but I'm beginning to think that was intentional. She's sweet at the beginning but rather flat and annoying as the story progresses. Hemingway also manages to make the novel's setting frighteningly real, particulalry the battle and retreat sequences about two-thrids of the way through. In short, A Farewell to Arms is a worthwhile read and an excellent introduction to Ernest Hemingway."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"&quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; is considered by many critics the best novel ever written about World War I. Hemingway's account of the retreat from Caporetto is so realistic that many readers, particularly Italian readers have assumed the author was present to see what transpired. EH, however, was still in high school when the retreat took place. Hemingway's opening paragraph to the book has (on more than one occasion) been labelled the &quot;best opening paragraph in American Literature.&quot; The famous &quot;strong at the broken places&quot; passage from chapter 34 is still widely quoted in popular culture. These reasons alone, in my humble opinion, make this novel &quot;an American classic.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"People are individuals, society is a ruse.Our narrator is an island. He drifts without motivation- without hate for an enemy, concern for a cause, or love for a lover.To delay being subsumed by this nothingness, he avoids abstract thought, falls into alcohol, and fools himself that he has fallen in love. But it is only a delay.His story demands the writing style. Through Hemingway's high-tempo efficiency we learn of our narrator's capacity for prompt, clear thought, both to lead others, and to save his own life. We learn of his meandering shallowness, as he plays with a dog during his child's birth. And through Hemingway's intentional omissions, we learn that our narrator has no interest in his lover's past or future, he thinks not of his family, he neither sees nor values the beauty of his surrounds, and he experiences only a fleeting curiousity for absent buddies.Don't be distracted by the setting, 'Farewell to Arms' is honest, relevant and fascinating."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I consider this book a must to every well educated, intelligent person, however, you have to push yourself towards it. Considering Hemingway an author who isn't easy to read, this is his standard. The description of war is better than the description of love between the two.At many points it seemed too shallow and you have to use all your imagination to be able to picture it."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"First, let me start with the important facts. A Farewell to Arms is the kind of book that always keeps you interested. As the story builds, so does the suspense with each passing action. In short, the novel is not dull.Between happenings, Hemingway describes scenes in such vivid detail that can't help but capture the mind's curiosity. If you read this, and let him weave his magical tale, you won't be disappointed.At the base of the novel, there's an excellent story. Anyone that reads it, while giving his or her full attention to the book, should have an excellent and refreshing experience.By the way, you don't have to be a Hemingway fan to like this story; it's an all around great book. I wish I could describe all of the fantastic things that he puts in, but I think it's best to know very little about the story before reading it. Check this book out and have fun."},{"Title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"A FAREWELL TO ARMS is, in my opinion, a well written novel. It makes many twists and turns, which the writer uses to keep the ready on the edge of their seat. However, these twists and turns seem out of place. Books 1 and 3 rocked!, but books 2, 4, and 5 were quite dull. Also, if the novel had not ended with a dull book, then I would have rated it better. Back to the good side of the novel. I particularly enjoy the way Ernest Hemingway describes the war's use of women."},{"Title":"Mallarm&#233;'s Prose Poems: A Critical Study (Cambridge Studies in French)","review":"One of the great pleasures of life is to read Robert Greer Cohn on Mallarm&eacute; and of all Cohn's work, this is my favorite. Each prose poem is introduced and then preseneted in both French and English. Then the whole is examined with rigorous closeness and loving attention - never dryly and pompously but with great affection and admiration. He really does bring Mallarm&eacute; alive as no else has. For the modern writer of prose poems this is an 'Ur-text' on the prose poem and what it once was and perhaps could be again."},{"Title":"Curiosity: A Cultural History of Early Modern Inquiry","review":"Benedict's book is something of a literary curiosity cabinet, to use one of her favorite phrases. It is full of interesting little nuggets of information, but I am left somewhat puzzled as to the point. The era that she focuses on, 1660-1820, saw the rise of the empirical method, and she makes the case that many people thought that the researchers who would later be called scientists were pushing into forbidden knowledge. I found that part interesting, and I expected more on the subject. Most of the book, however, discusses the sort of curiosity that I would think is part of the human condition.Its forms may change: books collecting oddities obviously only become possible with the development of inexpensive printing and the rise of literacy. Better communication, exploration, and travel made more curiosities available. But was there really any change in people's tendency to be curious? Benedict speaks of curiosities disappearing into private collections, but many of these things were never publicly available until the rise of museums. When did the average person get to see exotic plants, minerals, and artifacts, unless perhaps they were a servant dusting them?In earlier times, villages, tithings, frankpledges were forms of communal responsibility that must have encouraged a lively interest in the doings of the neighbors, since the collective could be held responsible for individual negligence. Relics added greatly to the attraction of places of worship and pilgrimage, so much to that the houses competed for them, and the church had to limit the \\"finding\\" of new relics. Was this entirely for the religious merit, or was it also because the relics were curiosities? Didn't people stare at monstrous births and grisly accidents? I find it hard to believe that gossip and prying about a suspicious pregnancy or neighborly failure or the lives of famous people is not a constant, and Benedict does nothing to establish that it was new in her chosen period. The issues of healthy interest versus prying continue to this day with scandal magazines and tabloids. If one is interested in the particular details of how curiosity manifested itself in this single time period, well here's your book.I must admit to ignoring a great deal of the theoretical framework."},{"Title":"Mechanics (Course of theoretical physics)","review":"The quality of this book as a resource for physics is impeccable.However, the print is often unreadable with letters merged and blurry.

No one can read Lev Landau without falling in love with physics. All his books are quite perfect. This one probably retains much of what was the original Landau flavor; all the volumes of the Course of Theoretical Physics have Evgeny Lifshitz as co-author, but many of the volumes required extensive updating over the course of the last 50 years. Classical mechanics is somewhat exceptional in this respect. However, this (and all modern classical mechanics books) treats classical mechanics from the point of view of what will be needed in quantum mechanics, so there is only the bare minimum of material; the book has only 169 pages.

Like Goldstein, however, the problems are all of the integrable type and there is no training provided for analyzing nonintegrable (especially chaotic) dynamical systems. Worse, one does not learn what 'integability' is from this book because it is implicitly assumed that every problem is integrable. This error follows from failing to distinguish local from global integrability. If one may be excused for criticizing the Pope, the authors make wrong and completely misleading statements about integrability (see my review of Goldstein, and also ch. 16 of my book Classical Mechanics, Cambridge, 1997). The problems and examples are indeed more challenging than those in Goldstein, and are instructive, but the text makes no contact whatsoever with the ideas and methods of modern nonlinear dynamics, in spite of the fact that (as Poincare, Arnol'd and others have shown), most of classical mechanics IS nonlinear dynamics. In other words, a student learns little from this text that is useful for research in theoretical mechanics these days. In my newer text I develope Poincare's method of qualitative analysis, and then assign as homework problems many numerical problems where in addition the students are required to check the accuracy of forward integrations in time by integrating backward to try to recover the initial conditions to within at least one digit accuracy. My text was tested for several years teaching both physics and mechanical engineering students at the graduate level, and with success. Try my text, you may find that you like it, especially since it's readability compares more with that of Goldstein than with Arnol'd."},{"Title":"Mechanics (Course of theoretical physics)","review":"If physicists could weep, they would weep over this book. The book is devastingly brief whilst deriving, in its few pages, all the great results of classical mechanics. Results that in other books take take up many more pages. I first came across Landau's mechanics many years ago as a brash undergrad. My prof at the time had given me this book but warned me that it's the kind of book that ages like wine. I've read this book several times since and I have found that indeed, each time is more rewarding than the last.The reason for the brevity is that, as pointed out by previous reviewers, Landau derives mechanics from symmetry. Historically, it was long after the main bulk of mechanics was developed that Emmy Noether proved that symmetries underly every important quantity in physics. So instead of starting from concrete mechanical case-studies and generalising to the formal machinery of the Hamilton equations, Landau starts out from the most generic symmetry and dervies the mechanics. The 2nd laws of mechanics, for example, is derived as a consequence of the uniqueness of trajectories in the Lagragian. For some, this may seem too \\"mathematical\\" but in reality, it is a sign of sophisitication in physics if one can identify the underlying symmetries in a mechanical system. Thus this book represents the height of theoretical sophistication in that symmetries are used to derive so many physical results.The difficulty with this approach, and the reason why this book is not a beginner's book, is that to the follow symmetric arguments, one really has to have already mastered vector calculus. Ideally, you should be able to transform coordinate in your sleep, perform integrals without missing a beat, whether they be line, area, or path, and differentiate functions in many dimensions. The arguments are not sloppy, as some have claimed - it only seems so if you have not mastered vector calculus.Tradition says that in Plato's academy was engraved the phrase, \\"Let no one ignorant of geometry enter here\\", so should the modern theoretical physicist, with Landau's bible in hand, march under the arches engraved with the words \\"Let no one ignorant of symmetry enter here\\"."},{"Title":"Mechanics (Course of theoretical physics)","review":"Classical Mechanics by H. Goldstein was the assigned text for a senior year course on CM. In all fairness, Goldstein does introduce tools and concepts useful to more advanced study in the subject, so I would turn to G. for a second reading on these topics. He also discusses the connections between classical to quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, Landau's presentation of the core of CM is clearer and more direct. For learning about the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, rigid body rotation, small oscillations and canonical transformation, I found Landau to be the better book."},{"Title":"Mechanics (Course of theoretical physics)","review":"This marvellous book of Landau, Lifshitz is the best adult presentation of &quot;classical&quot; classical mechanics, that is, leaving aside problems of stability, chaos, etc. With this proviso, the book is perfect. It is very short, not by omitting things, but by choosing (and rigidly adhering to it) a very sound philosophy: exploring the connection between symmetries and conservation laws. This explains why the dynamics is based on the action principle, which, as shown by Wigner, is the optimum language for expliciting the discoveries of Emmy Noether. The whole book follows this line, making the exposition very original and, at points, quite surprising (as when the mass is proved to be positive). In my opinion the climax of the book is the theory of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, along the ideas of Jacobi. I know of no place where this is so admirably done. Simple and beautiful. After learning it, and the applications contained in the book, you can learn the miracles ! Landau and Lifshitz perform with this equation in all areas of physics, particularly in General Relativity."},{"Title":"Mechanics (Course of theoretical physics)","review":"This book(and very hotly contested by their Classical Theory of Fields) has to be the most gorgeous exposition on classical physics to be found. Crystal clear, yet concise and perfectly logical as is to be expected from all of Landau's works. The material is so beautifully developed that this is one of the few places where it is possible to see how each piece of the classical mechanics puzzle fits together. If not for the rest of the book, the sections on the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation, Maupertuis Principle and a small but absolutely incredible section on mechanical similarity are simply a must read. Goldstein(the general) standard suffers from several defects, notably logical inconsistency within the own text(A complaint that can never be made of any of Landau's books). Above all, This book is the perfect keystone to the remaining books of their series, and as such should be read before attempting any of the remaining volumes.Lastly regarding criticisms that this book does not tend itself to non-integrability and classical chaos I suppose these are justified statments, but considering that this book was never written with such goals in mind, the arguments are irrelevant. There are several excellent references available on such material(including a recently added section in Goldstein) which will satisfy people looking for such topics. But this volume should feature on the bookshelf of anyone that has any interest in classical mechanics and wishes to read the treatment of the subject by a master."},{"Title":"Mechanics (Course of theoretical physics)","review":"Nowhere else would you find classical mechanics presented so elegantly, so efficiently, and with so much sophistication. However, this is a book that will be enjoyed only by those who already are familiar with the overall landscape of classical mechanics. Let's face it, a classical-mechanics virgin would be devastated if he/she used the book as the intro. There's just too much maturity, mathematical and physical, that's expected of the reader.Again, NOT recommended for beginners. I am pretty sure Landau himself did not initially learn classical mechanics this way."},{"Title":"Mechanics (Course of theoretical physics)","review":"This is the first volume in the famous course on theoretical physics. The writing is concise and clear. This is how real physicists do mechanics.There are other mechanics books to choose from. Maybe my second choice would be Goldstein's. But this one is the best.Start with the first chapter. In ten pages you'll learn about the Principle of Least Action, Lagrangians, and Lagrange's Equations. Then do the four exercises at the end of the chapter. Find those Lagrangians! If you want to be adventurous, plug them back into Lagrange's equations and find the equations of motion. You'll feel as though you've acquired magical power. And the rest of the book is like that, too.Once you've taken calculus, you'll be ready for this. And it's definitely the way to start learning physics. Try it."},{"Title":"Mechanics (Course of theoretical physics)","review":"I should be studying General Relativity right now instead of writing this reveiw, but I'm studying GR from Landau's Field Theory book, and I was so moved by the perfection of his writing that I had to put this review in for my beloved Mechanics book. So here it is ... If it wasn't for Landau, I wouldn't understand physics. He speaks to me in a way that nobody in the world can, clearly, with purpose, and he senses the questions that I have and answers them in a word or two. I used Goldstein's book and Saletan's book for Mechanics, and they all had wonderful stuff about Special Relativity and Nonlinear stuff, but for the meat, for the stuff that sits in your gut and makes you finally feel full, finally feel that you understand what is really happening, there is only Landau. And as I work my way through his books, I finally understand why the whole physics community of Russia banded together to save their 'Dau from the clutches of death. It was simple, they loved him, as I love him, because he makes physics something tangible, something that feels right, something that allows me to look up for once, instead of feeling crushed under the weight of the math and the theory. Hopefully soon, when I have finished this class and his Field Theory book, I will write a review for that one too, but it won't be very much different from this one. HOWEVER, I do have a complaint, and it is directed at the publisher of this book. My book was bound improperly, and it is missing part of the last section of the book. The printing is horrible, (it has been printed in India on poor-quality paper) and in some cases it makes it difficult to read. I'm sure I can send this book back to the publisher and they would replace it for me, but I can't part with it now. I feel that for the price of this thin little paperback, 50-something dollars, that this should not look like a rip-off version of the book. The publisher should use higher quality paper, printing, and maybe even re-set the equations and typography. If 'Dau could see the quality of this book, I'm sure he would be upset, and that is wrong for Butterworth Heinemann, the publisher. If I hit the Lotto someday, I hope to buy these books away from the B-H and give them the respect they deserve.**Note: I'm adding this note about two years later, and the publisher of the book very graciously replaced my defective copy for a good one. I also have to say that the new printing is much better than the old printing. Thanks publisher."},{"Title":"Mechanics (Course of theoretical physics)","review":"First, I completely concur with all those who have suggested that this book is the pinnacle of mechanics. I have a copy of the soft-cover text that I have read (and reread) for years. \\"Brilliant\\" doesn't do it justice. If you are serious about understanding classical mechanics and seeing the connections between classical and modern physics, this concise text is a must-read.Loving the text as I do, I was excited to get a copy for Kindle. I justified the expense (on a book I already own) by noting the aging, dog-eared, well used character of my physical copy. How sadly disappointed I was with the purchase. While essentially the same as the original, the production of the Kindle edition uses odd type faces for the Greek/scientific notation that is inline (which is distracting and annoying to try to parse). Equations are simply scanned copies from the original (scalable vector equations would have been too much trouble, I guess). While this could have been OK, the publisher chose to scan the figures in grayscale (instead of b/w) and to do it at a remarkably low resolution. The result is that the equations are often too small to read inline with the text and zooming them just give you a larger, fuzzier version. Really less than ideal. In fact, I would say the production values on this one are the worse that I have seen for a mathematical/physics text on Kindle. So sad that this should be done to such an outstanding text.So 5 stars for the book, 1 for the kindle edition -> 3 stars overall."},{"Title":"Mechanics (Course of theoretical physics)","review":"This book was recommended as a supplimentary text for our mechanics course.

Learning this book can save a lot of frustration when the things this book covers show up in more advanced physics courses. It is also a good reference book to use when the things in this book do show up in later physics courses and you need a good review.To explain it the best way I know how, this book is the nuts and bolts of what is going on behind the scenes of physics. Why Newton's equations act they way they do. This book adds the maturity to what you already know about classical mechanics and more advanced physics.Most of the physics you take from now on depend on the formulation of the ideas of this book in one way or another. Some of the formulations of QM. depend on the Hamilton-Jacobi equation which this book covers. Simply put this book is the level of maturity you need to be at to move on to more advanced physics courses.This book does an excellent job of covering these topics. It has the solutions to almost all the problems in the book making it the perfect book for self study. This book covers just the right amount of material and no more, so there is no fluff. The book is written in such a style that it is a easy read. It has just the right balance between understanding concepts and the mathematics.This book is the bridge to the next level of physics. This book gives the right background so in the future you do not memorize a bunch of equations without understanding how they came about.

It is indeed complementary to Goldstein in two respect: it first gives a very short but very concise presentation of mechanics. This is invaluable for exam preparations. Second, the language used by Landau should be taken as an example as how to prepare scientific work. In few words, Landau is superb and a master of packing complete aspects of physics.

Since space is isotropic, the Lagrangian must also be independent of the direction of v, and is therefore a function only of its magnitude, i.e., of v^2.\\" (p. 5)Those of us who've solved countless Lagrangians know to expect v^2 in the kinetic energy term. I had never given it much thought before--kinetic energy is just kinetic energy, right?--but now I know *why* it's there and what it implies physically. The connection to Relativity is obvious, too.The flow of the topics is smooth, not clunky and contrived like many books.

In every one of these texts I can find something that I dislike---excessive rigour, lack of figures, verbosity, crazy exercises, etc. (sometimes in combination...)---, but I can hardly find any fault in L&L-I.;The choice of topics in L&L-I; is just exactly (imho) what a working physicist must know by heart. Some complain that it does not deal adequately with nonlinear dynamics, chaos, etc., but this critique is unfair: the book does not cover all you may want know about classical mechanics, but definitely covers everything you *must* know about classical mechanics. Moreover, it was written ~70 years ago, way before the \\"chaos revival\\" of the 1980's.Recently, I came across at the library with a little book that I found well written, concise, rigorous, and with a very nice blend of classical and modern subjects: \\"Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics,\\" by M.

I decided to pick up a copy of \\"Mechanics\\" by Landau and Lifshitz that was on reserve in the library for the mechanics class that I was taking. This is the first volume in the internationally renowned series of textbooks on theoretical Physics, the series that has a reputation for its sparse and difficult writing style, as well as the undoubted difficulty and brilliance of the material presented. This is probably the reason why until that point I didn't even bother looking at these books, but for whatever reason that fateful night I decided to take a look at this particular volume. To my surprise, the book was actually pretty readable and the first few chapters revealed an entirely new way of looking at Physics. Until that point I was used to thinking about Physics as a set of laws and equations, relatively succinct but otherwise somewhat arbitrary and ad-hoc. Landau and Lifshitz's book started from a very different point; it gave some deep underlying principles as a starting point behind the development of physical laws and equations. Based on that I had a new and deeper appreciation of my chosen field of study, and I gained a whole new way of looking at the physical reality.Granted, the book is really not a walk in the park. Many later chapters can be rather technically demanding, and a prior course on theoretical mechanics at college level is probably the minimal level of preparation that can get a reader through the whole text. There aren't all that many examples that are thoroughly worked out, but all of the problems are given (rather concise) solutions - you still need to fill in some of the more important steps on your own. Mechanics is not an area of active modern research, so this is not necessarily a book that will help one with their scientific careers. However, it provides a solid grounding in some of the most basic physical concepts, and the skills and techniques acquired here can be very important in other areas of Physics.

He will not be required to fill his marital duties and will in fact reside in his own apartments.Rory of course makes her his wife in every way, giving her a happiness that she could only dream of.Charlotte has been busy collecting evidence against the Pitte brothers and a crew of malcontents that plague the docks, and in fact were responsible for beating Rory and other crimes against the local humanity.Though everyone is whispering about Rory's marriage to Charlotte, he finds himself falling in love with his plain, gentle wife. She informs him that she is with child, and he is beyond happy--until he learns that his first wife has returned, a shell of her former beautiful self, and bitter when she finds out that he has remarried.She threatens to expose him even as Rory declares to her that he loves his new wife and that she is expecting.The Pitte brother's burn Rory's brother's business and redemption is satisfied when Rory enters the burning building to save him. With his body on fire, he manages to save his sibling, but incurs fatal burns and survives long enough to declare his love once more to charlotte.Catherine Cooks tells stories the way we author's today are no longer allowed to. Always filled with passion, and redemption, Catherine always showed the cruelty as well as the beauty in the lives of those who weren't always rich and powerful. Her stories includes their downfall, as well as their redeeming qualities. As with most of her books, I highly recommend THE GAMBLING MAN."},{"Title":"Communitarianism and Its Critics","review":"I am not a philosopher and I do not have any knowledge of communitarianism prior to reading Bell's work. Still, I find this doctorate thesis which Bell wrote at Oxford a very interesting, engaging and thought-provocative one.Bell traces the history of communitarianism and illustrates the main pillars in this paradigm. In so doing, he also argues that communitarianism is closer to the natural aspirations of human beings and its political implications offer more protection on human freedom than the liberals would otherwise suggest.This is not a typical doctorate thesis that one would normally expect - one that is very dry and has citations appearing almost at the end of every sentences. Rather, Bell presents the thoughts of communitarians and those of its critics (mostly libertarians) in an often lively dialogue format - not indifferent from those in Plato's time.I highly reccommend this book to those who are dissatisfied with liberalism and the current political system it shapes. Bell and his fellow communitarians may offer you important insights to human aspirations. It may also give you inspirations for a new form of participatory democracy which emphasizes more on the common good and overcomes the challenges of individualism."},{"Title":"Communitarianism and Its Critics","review":"this was a required textbook.less expensive than campus book store.like most textbooks, informative.all aspects of the transaction were satisfactory."},{"Title":"O Come, Emmanuel","review":"Each year I purchase a new devotional book for the season of Advent and Christmas. This was one of the most meaningful ones I've ever used, in part because I'm a church musician. The hymn texts were usuallly familiar to me as sung hymns, but the texts and the author's comments were inspiring even without music. I can highly recommend this little book as a companion for personal devotions during the season. It could be used for small group gatherings also."},{"Title":"O Come, Emmanuel","review":"I'm always looking for new and different ways to make the holidays more meaningful for myself as well as others--when I first saw this book, it just struck me as a new way to celebrate advent and travel the path towards Christmas itself. Most of the writings are very traditional, true--but it gives a more intimate and old fashioned quality to the season in the middle of all the stress and hustle and bustle of Christmas in these times we live in now. I am very happy that I stumbled across it and am enjoying the readings immensely."},{"Title":"Stories of great Americans for little Americans","review":"While the publisher says this book is for 9-12 year olds, my 5- and 6-year olds love it! The stories are short - most can be read in a few minutes. They are written in a very exciting, but simple style that grips the attention. It's a hard book to put down. Stories discuss such great Americans as Washington, Franklin, Fulton, Kit Carson, Audubon, Goodyear, and more. I can't recommend this book enough for young readers. It's also suitable for those who are learning to read and want to read something interesting."},{"Title":"Stories of great Americans for little Americans","review":"My 5-year-old son received this book as a Christmas present. He started it two days ago, and he has been not been able to put the book down. He even wants to read during mealtimes. He also insisted on bringing it to Show N'Tell today. This is a wonderful book for early readers, not only because the stories are educational and interesting, but they are written in a short and simple manner."},{"Title":"Stories of great Americans for little Americans","review":"The paperback (yellow) edition does not have pictures, rather it has placeholders for the images (as if there were an error in typesetting.)The text content, however, is fantastic for children.GET THE HARDCOVER, (RED) EDITION - IT HAS THE CORRECT ILLUSTRATIONS."},{"Title":"Stories of great Americans for little Americans","review":"This book is more than I expected. What a wonderful collection of stories, nice illustrations.

The sections are nice and short making them perfect for oral narration. I have found this to be one of the best books my son has narrated from. He has learned a lot of history in a fun and painless way. We also used this book for dictation lessons and copywork."},{"Title":"Stories of great Americans for little Americans","review":"What a fabulous little book! I bought this as a summer reading book for my son who is at a 2nd-3rd grade reading level. It can be difficult to engage him in reading or other academic lessons during the summer, but that is not the case with this book. He enjoys the anecdotes of famous people we have been learning about this year American history and laughs at the funny stories. It is insightfully written to capture the interest of kids, and particularly of boys who love adventure. It includes chronicles of explorers encountering Indian tribes, generals fighting the redcoats, and childhood exploits of some of our country's founders. When my husband does the reading time with my son, I find that I go back and reread the chapters that I missed. The amusing and delightful tales of this little book from 1895 are still pleasurable reading in the 21st century, not only for kids but for adults as well."},{"Title":"Stories of great Americans for little Americans","review":"This is the Lost Classics edition. Amazon charges *three times* the cost of the very same hardcover edition sold at the publisher's website. That's right, fifteen bucks at Lost Classics.

Great for K-2!"},{"Title":"Stories of great Americans for little Americans","review":"I'm very disappointed that this book does not have the illustrations. It says \\"illustration\\" where the illustrations should be. The description I read about the book did not say that there weren't going to be illustrations and you have to actually click \\"look inside the book\\" and go to the first story to see that the illustrations are missing. I think that even the authro would be highly disappointed with the lack of illustrations as he considered them to be very important when teaching history to young children."},{"Title":"Stories of great Americans for little Americans","review":"My daughter is 5 years old and we just started this book. The stories are short and interesting, still I was worried that they wouldn't hold her attention. I was planning on doing one or two stories per week. Instead she wants me to read two new stories per day....and on top of that, will I please read the previous days stories before we are done?All I can say is \\"Wow\\", my 5 year old enjoys these engaging history stories and I couldn't be more pleased.When we are done with this book I plan to move on to the American History Stories also publish by Yesterdays Classics."},{"Title":"Stories of great Americans for little Americans","review":"We have a son who is severely dyslexic. One tool that has helped him is the style of book deliberately written in mostly one syllable words. If longer words are needed (for example, if there are no substitutes -- \\"George Wash-ing-ton\\") they are divided into syllables. These are a rare find and a real treasure to us when we come across them. Of course, they are great for young readers, and the content itself is sound. In the instance of our son, the books give him confidence and the chance to experience success in reading."},{"Title":"Accessible Access 2003","review":"I decided to learn access a few months ago. I brought a few books on the subject and hit a brick wall. Nothing was making any sense. I just wanted to build a database from scratch. I came across this book and it saved me from despair. It was exactly what I wanted. The other books that I had brought started teaching you multi table database right from the start and that's where it got confusing. This book is divided into several sections. The first three sections of this book teach you how to build single table databases and it will have you up and building a simple database in no time. This approach made it all make sense. After reading about 100 pages I built my first phone book, easy!! Part iv introduces you to multi table databases. By the time I finished this book I made a multi table data base for our business which everyone is using and loves. Now people are asking me to build more things for them in access, their goes my weekends??? I can't rate this book high enough. The Author, Mark Whitehorn, has a great way of explaining complex concepts into simple concepts and he also has a sense of humour which most computer book writer's lack. If you no nothing about access and want to learn access then this book is perfect. If there were more Authors like Mark Whitehorn then the world would be a better place."},{"Title":"A Little Book of Mirror Magick: Meditations, Myths, Spells (Little Book Series)","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer in that this book is definitely up to par with Telesco's other well-researched titles. The format of the little series is meant for a &quot;gifty&quot; market (I think) and therefore the price is a bit high for a small tome. Nonetheless the author does a fine job of cramming the pages with research and practical information as always."},{"Title":"A Little Book of Mirror Magick: Meditations, Myths, Spells (Little Book Series)","review":"This book explored the history of mirrors and their magical uses....it gave me better methods for scrying that I never tried before....first shot at using the technique I was comfortable with gave me great insight."},{"Title":"A Little Fate","review":"If you already have The Once Upon Series then DO NOT buy this book. If you don't you will enjoy this book. Nora Roberts' is a fantastic writer and this is a rerelease of her earlier works."},{"Title":"A Little Fate","review":"This is one of her three-for-one deals. Three favorite tales of love and magic! Others such as this are A LITTLE MAGIC and FROM THE HEART. Early in her career, she wrote under the name of J. D. Robb, seventeen with \\"Death\\" in the titles and now REMEMBER WHEN using the old name. She is most prolific with seven series of three to six novels on a particular topic and/or same characters. She has twenty-two other novels, two anthologies under the old name and, also available, THE OFFICIAL NORA ROBERTS COMPANION.In THE WITCHING HOUR, a wizard's spell brings a heroine to the kingdom which has been plagued by tragedy. She is a lovely woman who must follow her destiny in battle as well as heart in love. Even the gods can't save this place until the 'lady' arrives on the scene in Twylia. This reads more like science fiction with the strange fantasy names. Sometimes, fate is deceiving with its promises of better things to come. Our fates are decided by a higher power, no matter how we may strive to change it. We are here for a purpose, for a certain time, and when that is reached, we are needed no more. \\"We'll be happy.\\" \\"Yes, until the end of days.\\" It's just a fairytale to have eternal life.In WINTER ROSE, Deirdre wearing a red cloak, thinks \\"Men are such odd creatures\\" as she discovers a young wounded soldier lying out in the eternal winter. He had fought three enemy soldiers and lay bleeding in the snow, which saved him as his strength waned. He'd give half a kingdom to spend the last hour of his life by a fire's light and heat, he thought. He reached up to her red hood and realized that she was real and not a rose at all. The young queen's magic healed his wounds,and he warms her heart with the joys of true love. Now, that is what I call fate, to almost die and then find someone you can love until the end of time.IN A WORLD APART is so like THE GIRL OF HIS DREAMS by Stephen Donaldson, which takes place in Medieval times only this time the Demon Slayer is the female and the 20th Century New Yorker is male. She finds a strange new world in America as did the woman librarian of the Donaldson book when she was transported back to Europe during Medieval times, where things were primitive and 'hard.' These are romances in the vein of Rosemary Rogers with passion, desire and much lovemaking.Nora Roberts also wrote a similar title LITTLE FATE, A 12-COPY FLOOR. Magic and love abounds in her stories. They are great for young housewives whose lives have lost that loving feeling."},{"Title":"A Little Fate","review":"I'm as hardened a reader as the next, but sometimes life throws one a curve and you just want to curl up with something magical which will be uplifting and *happy*. Not only are these stories uplifting and happy but they are written with wonderful language. I am so sick of the word \\"fisted\\" in chic lit (\\"he fisted his hands in her hair\\".....it is halfway between fight night and school yard brawls...........THAT is modern romance? ugh)..............this is softer, dreamier and perfect for winter's end. I wish we had more of these out of time, out of space ADULT fairy tales."},{"Title":"A Little Fate","review":"Great stories from the story teller herself. A world apart is one of my absolute favorites. It's a true romance.

It truly leaves you with a wonderful feeling."},{"Title":"A Little Fate","review":"I am a HUGE Nora Roberts fan, but this book was not one of my favorites. It wasn't the quality I've come to expect from reading so many of her other books. However, I hesitate to judge too harshly, because they are short stories, so the characters and stories are not as in depth as her others. If this is your first Nora book, please try another- she's an excellent author!"},{"Title":"A Little Fate","review":"Worst Book Ever!!! Far below the expected excellance of Nora. Not worth 5 cents let alone $5+. Nora is a great writer and these stories are just beneath her. If I could I wouldn't even give this book 1 star."},{"Title":"A Little Fate","review":"My mother lent me this book, she thought I'd enjoy. HA! it was the worst load of garbage. If this was her early work she should have left in the box! Is she hard up for cash? The plotlines were all begged, borrowed, and stolen. The characters were square (which means not developed roundly). The sex scenes were overplayed or underplayed depending on how you tumble. Her male voices were lacking. She couldn't even find new names for the characters - had to borrow them from other authors. I have never read any of her other books and now I certainly never will. I'm told she is a very good writer, so shouldn't she have known better than to publish this drivel? My brain/senses need(s) a day of bad television to wash the haunting memories of a bad book away. Even Matlock reruns would be better! I know that sounds harsh, but gosh, this book was really truly horrible!"},{"Title":"The Night Orchid (Monogram)","review":"This book started out well but I wasn't enchanted with the ending. Marissa Quinn is a cattlewoman from Montana who flies to Seattle to visit her sister Leslie when she gets a disturbing letter from her. In Seattle she meets David and Diana Woodward, two peculiar people who seem to be hiding something. Alek is warrior from the time of the Druids and the Romans who has been brought forward in time into Marissa's world where he can amazingly speak and understand the language. He knows that he has a limited amount of time in the new world and he may never get back home if he cannot perform the ritual with the Night Orchid. While I enjoy Patricia Simpson's stories about the paranormal and time travel, I was not overjoyed with this particular book. There was a story line, it was just not my kind of story. It was however, well written."},{"Title":"Essay Writing for HighSchool Students 1e","review":"I've used a lot of writing products for our children, and for high school, this seems to work very well, especially to get them to THINK about their writing, ORGANIZE (he is big on the 5 paragraph essay) and churn it out in a timely manner. Excellent practice for the SAT 25 minute essay. To help the teacher, he has a list of over 150 essay topics in the back of the book; something for almost everyone, even the most reluctant freshman writer (though I would use this more toward the year before your student takes the SAT--probably sophomore and work on basic writing skills freshman year).

To us in this age of air conditioning, paved roads, and (reasonably) reliable transportation, the lives of the people described by Reed seem almost unimaginable. Yet people made their living off the land in what is now the Anza-Borrego State Park for nearly a hundred years, not to mention the Cahuilla indians, who had lived there for uncountable years. Reed was a tough old-time cattleman and cowboy, his book is a collection of reminicses, rambling and off topic sometimes, but beautiful and invaluable in their own way. We hear of the hardships of the first pioneers to this area, Reed's own father was one, the deaths of children, the graves that once dotted the primitive roads and trails (all of which are lost to memory now), near-death and death, horse theives shot dead in the back, white men venturing into the forbidden Rockhouse valley and not returning, neighbors who fight but return to help one another out. Above all the sun beats down, water and grass must be found. Pioneer replaced Indian, cowman replaced pioneer, homesteader replaced cowman, and a state-run museum piece park replaced all of them. Reed is no stylist, but he doesn't need to be, his book is a simple, moving little slice of life, and that is all it needs to be."},{"Title":"Old Time Cattlemen: And Other Pioneers of the Anza-Borrego Area","review":"Lester Reed had a simple, direct way of writing that brings the reader an everyday look at the life of a desert cowman at work around 1900. He masterfully weaves his tales about desert life with stories of family, quirky friends, and hair brained schemes involving desert trips in search of gold mines and ghosts. He did and saw it all. Great cattle empires are built, herds are driven, and travel goes from burros to Model-T's. If you want a very personal, simple look at the real world on the great deserts of far southern California then you will love this book by Lester."},{"Title":"The Chicago Bulls Encyclopedia","review":"The book was missing pages as various pictures and pages had been ripped out.

He shares how the Holy Spirit illuminated important words given to Paul in his prison epistles - Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians.Key principles concerning intercessory prayer covered include (1) Thankfulness unto God for those He lays upon our hearts in prayer, (2) Importunity or Unrelenting Persistence that must have an answer to prayer, (3) Confidence in God's perfect work, (4) An Enlarged Heart for others, and (5) Compassion for all in Christ.The book is well organized and separated into two parts. Part one is an introduction on the subject and part two is a guide to intercessory prayer breaking down insights from Paul's letters. The book will be a blessing for both personal and group study. Part two is presented in such a way as to guide believers in monthly focus - twelve specific meditations (one for each month of the year)."},{"Title":"New England's Gothic Literature: History and Folklore of the Supernatural from the Seventeenth Through the Twentieth Centuries (Studies in American)","review":"The book's title is misleading. It's a study of 20th century New England Gothic literature, and a romp through various items of New England folklore from the 17th through the 19th century with very little of value in terms of literary criticism. It's disappointing for the serious student of New England literature, and too expensive for a casual reader of folklore. Better to get it at the library than to pay over 100 dollars for it."},{"Title":"Lone Star J.R.: The Autobiography of Racing Legend Johnny Rutherford","review":"If you are a fan of Johnny Rutherford and racing in general, this is the book for you. The book gives insight from inside the racing world. It is a highly detailed account of Johnny's personal life and his racing career. I found his personal struggle to become a big time driver very interesting, as he started at a relatively late age for his era. It was also interesting to me to read his explanation of the many changes in racing and what was expected of a driver from his first race until his retirement.

The story of JR's early racing days and his travels with Jim McElreath as they followed the IMCA circuit was good reading. In addition, the details of his 1966 Eldora crash and recovery as well as his experience driving the Smokey Yunick NASCAR Chevy in 1963 was very interesting.

If you were around racing as a fan in the late 60's, 70's and into the 80's, you'll enjoy this too as it speaks to what racing was like in an era that a lot of open wheel fans wish could somehow be recaptured (bring back the snake pit)."},{"Title":"Lone Star J.R.: The Autobiography of Racing Legend Johnny Rutherford","review":"Good discription of his life and times.

It was, seemingly, the most loved and sought-after book of the six and is often described as one that you can't put down until you have finished reading it! Both old and young alike will like the descriptive journey in this biographical book filled with adventures from the Great Depression days.It saddens me a bit to see it up for sale, though. Dad either always gave it away or only sold it at cost. His desire was just to get his message in the hands of as many people that he could. There are still boxes of them available to give to those who are willing to pay just the price of S&H..;."},{"Title":"Masters of the Maze","review":"I recently dug up an old 1976 paperback copy of this slim 158 page book. WOW!!! This book has time travel, parallel universes, other dimensions, aliens, true and obscure historical facts, secret societies, religion, philosophy, PHEW!!! Although I have been aware of Avram Davidson since the 60's, it has taken me all this time to really discover and appreciate this writer. You actually have to take the time to read every word and sentence and paragraph to follow a Davidson story and don't feel bad if you have to go back to reread sections. I regret that he has passed away but I am grateful there is so much of his work available to us. You can't really classify Avram Davidson's work, it is unique. Davidson is one of those writers with the ability to induce an altered state of consciousness in the reader through the power of words and the use of language. &quot;Masters of the Maze&quot; does just that. As the book opened, I didn't know what was going on or who the protagonist even was. I was drawn into the subtle and cleverly woven tapestry of this novel in spite of myself and continuously surprised. No cliches here. If you want to give your gray cells a workout, this one is a delight!"},{"Title":"Masters of the Maze","review":"This story has a writing style that is unusual for Avram. The characters remind you of how Assimov's main characters always are(not to down play assimov here): intellectual, \\"good show old boy\\"ish. Its a bizarre story, but not the kind that creeps you out or assults your sense of reality. It does deal with a different reality, sure, but you don't get sucked into that particular part fo the book. What sucks you in is the rapid change from character to character that makes an increadibly large idea somewhat understandable. The only short coming of the book is that it has this expansive idea of the maze and what its connected to(to not ruin anything for you), but its a short book. Avram could have written A LOT more and dazzled us. Regardless its still a story that brings you into its world and makes you forget yours."},{"Title":"Masters of the Maze","review":"The 2 previous reviewers must live in a parallel universe to me. Now I must admit that I had to give up reading half way through the book, I just couldn't take it anymore. I am a huge sci fi fan and read a large number of books every year, and it is fairly rare for me not to be able to finish a book. It started out boring on page 1, and went down hill from there. If it wasn't for the little story blurb on Amazon I probably wouldn't even know what was going on at all in the story. Maybe it got better in the second half, but even the Supreme Court would consider it cruel and inhuman punishment to make someone read it to get there. I really can't give you an intellectual analysis of the book, because I have no idea where it began of where it was going."},{"Title":"Cheerful Weather for the Wedding","review":"These two stories brought together in the Penguin Classics series (but also available in other editions) are related in setting and theme. One, published in 1932, is a mere novella; the other, from 1951, is a short novel. Together they reveal the work of a charming but minor British writer of the second quarter of the Twentieth Century. On the evidence of these works, Julia Strachey emerges as a comedian of sentiment; think Evelyn Waugh with the sensibility of Elizabeth Bowen. The main difference between the two books is the balance between comedy and feeling in each.CHEERFUL WEATHER FOR THE WEDDING comes over as a brilliant comic set-piece in search of a novel to contain it. The setting is the large house in the South of England, staffed by a fair number of servants whom the owner, Mrs. Thatcham, is unable either to manage or to comprehend. Dolly, the oldest of the Thatcham children, is to be married in the afternoon, and a number of relatives and friends are gathering for the occasion. All of them are peculiar in one way or another, and most of the story proceeds in an almost surreal montage of comic dialogue. But the bride herself, Dolly, has cold feet and fortifies herself with surreptitious swigs of rum. Meanwhile a former suitor, Joseph Patten, wanders around trying to summon the courage to talk privately to Dolly, something he should have done ages ago. He gets his chance almost at the end of the story, but not in the way he expected. Suddenly, bits of back-story come tumbling confusedly out, but too late to affect the course of events. Joseph has missed his opportunity, but he is not the only one. For a brief moment, we sense the traction that the story might have had, if Strachey had only given these characters more depth.Although written two decades later, AN INTEGRATED MAN occupies the same time period (the thirties), the same location (the Dorset coast), and the same upper-middle-class lifestyle, where people might stay with friends for months at a time, and houses were supplied with numerous servants to look after them. Gwen Cedar, the hostess here, appeared as a minor character in the earlier novella, and shares Mrs. Thatcham's incomprehension of the servants -- although she goes one further by treating them to forced lectures on aesthetics. The contemporary satire is one of the most interesting aspects of the book. Strachey, who was married to two artists herself, gets in numerous references to modern art and coffee-table theories about everything from social progress to radical education. For her two main guests, Aron and Ned, are educational theorists who have just bought a boys' boarding school to use as a showcase for the most progressive approaches.Forty-year-old Ned proclaims himself on the first page of the book as \\"an integrated man,\\" fully in command of himself and in tune with his surroundings. What hubris! For before long, Ned has fallen head over heels in love with Aron's new wife, Marina. Or rather, fallen in lust; the distinction is important to both Ned and the author, who writes obliquely but with surprising frankness about Marina's physical effect on Ned. I imagine that I am not alone in recognizing the syndrome that Strachey analyzes so precisely, but she is less good at making me actually re-live it; I always feel I am watching Ned from the outside. Towards the very end, however, when this comedy of desire reaches a climax involving the danger of real people getting really hurt, there are a few moments that have the frisson of true emotional agony. But only a few. While this is much the more substantial of the two books, and certainly worth reading for its social observations, Strachey's comedic bent gets in the way of her potential as a novelist, resulting in another missed opportunity."},{"Title":"Cheerful Weather for the Wedding","review":"Stumbled upon this gem because of the film adaptation with Felicity Jones. I always try to read the book before seeing the film so I hunted down a copy. It is surprisingly difficult to get ahold of this but it was worth it. An enjoyable fluffy story, fun to read on a rainy day or on the beach. The characters a whimsical treat. More character development should have been done, though.If you can acquire a copy, do so. However, make sure you go in knowing that they're sparse characters and with that mindset, the novella is a real pleasure."},{"Title":"Cheerful Weather for the Wedding","review":"I have been very excited to read any Persephone Classics book, they have published wonderful forgotten books, mostly by female authors. THis was the least interesting of the titles I have read. It is a very short story so I don't regret having sampled it, but its not that interesting or particularly well written. The story covers the few hours before Dolly's wedding. You have the silly mother, continually praising the weather, the bride is so nervous she polishes off a bottle of rum, the ex boyfriend who regrets having dumped Dolly shows up and finally Dolly spills a bottle of ink on her wedding dress just minutes before she has to walk down the aisle.I fully understand this is just a feeling..but I just didn't really take to the story. It was told so quickly it was difficult to get a sense of any character or develop any feelings for them...or much interest in what was going on. This possibly was a story that resonated at the time..the whole English aristocracy life style...but it was just not that interesting.

So writes Dr. Hyrum L. Andrus in this scholarly treatise which shows that the true plan for achieving social justice without impinging upon man's freedom and dignity has been revealed to the Latter-day Saints through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Says the author: 'While modern liberalism attempts to foster the freedom and dignity of man through state-sponsored welfare measures, its program is deficient as a movement in that it lacks the necessary enlightening and regenerating powers to promote social union and justice without destroying the freedom of man. . . But while it stresses the need to reassert the principle of freedom in modern society, conservatism also lacks the necessary cohesive powers with which to promote true social union among free men and thereby achieve social justice.' Dr. Andrus emphasizes that Latter-day Saints posses the key to the riddle of social justice. Possession of this key gives the Saints grave responsibilities to understand, promote and preserve this Society of Zion. Reading this book will aid the discharge of this responsibility.\\""},{"Title":"From Piglets To Prep School: Crossing A Chasm","review":"Piglets to Prep School is a delightful read.

The author expanded on several themes of the first novel and carried forth the ideas established in the first book with excellent continuity.I found very few typos in the novel and in only one place in the book was I unsure about how word had reached a certain group.In this novel, we get to see a more in-depth view of the famous Makir, we are introduced to the Kleimen, and red dragons play more of a role. The lingering link between some people and various animals is expanded, and the link to the Garden and its role in the story is expanded, along with Lamech's plight in Nod City. The novel also has a few twists involving other characters from the first book. The enemies of book one are fleshed-out even more and the new enemies are fully realized.The book takes several directions that were unexpected, which was enjoyable. It also involves ancient earthly monuments we are familiar with, yet are attributed to pre-flood times in a manner integral to the overall theme of the series. The use of a certain planet reminded me of another novel I have read concerning pre-flood times, showing a consistency of thought in the way things may have happened in that era.Again, the spiritual aspects of the novel are fully realized. I didn't agree with the way the term \\"demon\\" was used to refer to only a certain portion of evil spirits, but this was a small point. The fallen angels, angels, and Nephilim were again represented in the story and it is obvious that the latter group will have a much larger role in the upcoming book three of the series.

However, this is not a book I'll be taking out with me for serious lunar observation. For that, I'll stick with Rukl. If you're a beginner, this book may be fine. I do like that the photos give the same view as seen through the telescope, as opposed to the naked eye or with binoculars. That is appreciated. However, there are two MAJOR flaws with the book: 1) very few craters and other surface features are identified on each image of the moon and even more significantly is 2) the plastic overlays that have the names of craters on them appear only every other day! On the even-numbered days, e.g., day 2, day 4, etc., the craters are unidentified, although if one observes the moon on a daily basis different surface features become more prominent for viewing. What were the authors possibly thinking? Cost savings? On an even-numbered day you'll be flipping back and forth between odd days and trying to guess what you are looking at near the lunar terminator. Strange. I read a review on Cloudy Nights that raved about the book but I'm disappointed. The concept had real potential but fails under real-world observation conditions. If you want a lovely book of photos of the moon then this is the book for you. But don't confuse this book with a true lunar atlas. Check it out at brick and mortar store before you buy.One more thing to note-- Brunier is very liberal in his use of the word \\"atlas.\\" He wrote the book \\"The Great Star Atlas\\" which although I like enough to recommend to others for its photos, is not even remotely a true atlas due to, once again, its lack of detail."},{"Title":"New Atlas of the Moon","review":"I am going to take the easy way out here and say that I agree 100% with the previous reviewer except...I too use Rukl---and sophisticated software for printing custom charts.

University ... Wales, Bangor. Ballard Matthews lectures])","review":"It was once a truism that to properly criticize a piece of literature one had to first understand and appreciate the historical situation and audience in which the piece of literature was received. The historical nature of literary criticism was, if not on the same level as criticism of form and style, at least an indispensable consideration of the literary critic. Lewis, perhaps more than any other medieval and renaissance critic of the 20th century, embodies the ideal of historically grounded literary criticism. His efforts to reconstruct the various categories of the historical setting (intellectual, religious, social, political, economic, etc.) in conjunction with an appropriate attempt to step into the author's own aims for the piece of literature are both successful as a project of literary understanding, and a delight as a reader who wishes to \\"get into\\" the life of the book as it was intended to be received. In this respect Lewis is the consumate critic of the literary author. His Preface to Paradise Lost does double duty in providing the reader with the proper context for understanding the genre of writing into which Paradise Lost was consciously cast, and the historical relevancies, to which the contemporary audience was oblivious because of their being second-nature, but to which the modern reader are as alien as an undiscovered tribal culture. Its other duty, in addition to this framework of understanding, is to propose an alternative conception of Milton's Satan to the modern romanticized interpretations of Satan as a tragic hero. For the original audience, argues Lewis, the rhetorical prowess of Satan would simply reflect the Accuser's God-given nature as the most shrewd created being of all--not to be admired or emulated, but to be scoffed at in light of its diabolical consequences in rebellion to the all-powerful Calvinistic God of the Puritan and 39 Articles confessing Anglican English readers. If any sympathy for Satan were to be had, it would be in recognition of his similarity with the inherited sinful nature all men possess as descendants of Adam (the true comic hero of the epic). While such a reading often clangs with the sympathies of the modern reader, Lewis' efforts are to put the modern reading into the perspective of the original audience, which ought to, insofar as Lewis is concerned, position the reader in the appropriate posture for evaluating Milton's efforts, and therefore his success or failure in producing the type of literature at which he aimed (as well as being able to provide a more balanced and reflective assessment of the timeless quality of the piece of literature). Even if one finds Lewis' efforts outdated, misguided, or otherwise undesirable, one can find few, if any, attempts at literary criticism that accomplish the aim of historical-contextual literary criticism as well or as poignantly as Lewis'."},{"Title":"A preface to Paradise lost,: Being the Ballard Matthews lectures, delivered at University College, North Wales, 1941 ([Wales, North.

University ... Wales, Bangor. Ballard Matthews lectures])","review":"If you have, like me, tried to read Paradise Lost but couldn't finish it, then this book is a great resource to help you get through it. I learned a lot from this book. Literally on page one C.S. Lewis talks about how people misread narrative poetry (like Paradise Lost) all the time because used bookstores are full of books of narrative poetry whose first few pages are underlined in random places and the rest of the book is blank. This made me laugh because that's EXACTLY what my copy of Paradise Lost looks like. C.S Lewis points out that you can't read it like lyrics looking for little nuggets of good lines. That's what I did the first time and I quit reading Paradise Lost after 20 pages.Stuff I learned from this Preface in case you don't really want to read it:*The form of poetry is important and the rules add to it's beauty, not take away from it.*Epic poetry comes from the court so it is meant to be oral. (Good to know - I will try to read it like a speaker instead of a drone voice in my head). Since its traditionally oral, there is a lot of repetition because if you have to think too much while you are listening to a poem you can get lost very easily.*Epic poetry tends to be about men, historically true and tragic.*The beauty of the poetry is in the paragraph or the whole. Looking for good lines is like looking for good stones in a cathedral.*The language is repetitive but not commonplace, like having pumpkin pie every year for Christmas. This also makes it feel ceremonial.*Everything we need to know is in the poem itself. Another reason I got stuck in Paradise Lost was the massive amount of details. I was delighted when C.S. Lewis said that we don't need to look up all the places in the notes. The feeling that Milton is trying to achieve is the important part. Yay for that.*Milton purposefully made it feel like you are listening to a never ending voice go on and on. There aren't many stopping points in the poem.*One of the techniques that Lewis suggests in reading Paradise Lost is to immerse yourself in the poem and feel like you are living it yourself instead of trying to strip away all the \\"exterior stuff.\\"*The idea of hierarchy is seen a lot in Paradise Lost. Everything has a superior (except God) and an inferior.Then Lewis talks a lot about heresy and whether or not it's there in Paradise Lost (which I didn't much care about).So there you have it. I feel properly prepared to read Paradise Lost and actually finish it this time."},{"Title":"A preface to Paradise lost,: Being the Ballard Matthews lectures, delivered at University College, North Wales, 1941 ([Wales, North.

I purchased this book to gather lecture notes as I taught Paradise Lost to my students because of Lewis' concise style and approachable rhetoric, but I read the book from cover to cover once I received it because of his excellent insight. Like C.S. Lewis' Allegory of Love and Discarded Image, it is evident how thoroughly Lewis' understands Milton and his desires. I was ecstatic to see in the newest Norton Critical edition of Paradise Lost they included many of these essays, but I was even happier with this inexpensive reprinting of all of them.This book is a must for anyone attempting to approach Milton's Paradise Lost."},{"Title":"A preface to Paradise lost,: Being the Ballard Matthews lectures, delivered at University College, North Wales, 1941 ([Wales, North.

These writings comprise two types of reviews: unfinished reviews, abandoned during various stages of composition, and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted. Of the later type, back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work, a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released. I am publishing these reviews now for the first time, over a decade after they were initially written. Mike London 10-3-2012]In \\"A Preface To Paradise Lost\\", Lewis talks about what Milton was trying to accomplish with this epic, and this critical work will always stand in very high circles indeed in Milton scholarship. Much of his wisdom is sound, especially when it comes to judging a thing. Lewis says to judge something we must know what it is and what it is intended to do, and then he goes into types of epic poetry and what Milton is trying to accomplish with his work.Milton's influence on \\"Perelandra\\" is very evident, for Lewis took everything he did not like in Milton and threw them out in the elaborate construction of \\"Perelandra\\". It is obvious Lewis greatly admires Milton, and his tribute to him is very great indeed.One issue, as some critics have pointed out, is Lewis's inability to appreciate spoken poetry, which is a very real weakness. Other than that, however, \\"A Preface to Paradise\\" lost stands as one of Lewis's best work of scholarship and will greatly add to anyone's understanding of Milton's aim and theology in general.Lewis deals with the several key issues in Milton. One thing often misunderstood by the Romantics was it seemed to have a positive portrayal of Satan, and how lordly he sounds. The idea of better to be a king in hell than a slave in heaven is of course an absurd one, but from this Lewis builds his great little novel \\"The Great Divorce.\\"Ultimately, like Tolkien with \\"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics\\", Lewis has written the definitive textual commentary to \\"Paradise Lost\\", and probably the most read book on Milton as well as far as literary criticism goes.*(These reviews covered all seven books of \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\", the three novels of \\"The Space Trilogy\\", \\"The Abolition of Man\\", \\"The Four Loves\\", \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\", a revised version of my 2000 review of \\"Till We Have Faces\\", \\"Surprised By Joy\\", and \\"The Screwtape Letters\\".)"},{"Title":"A preface to Paradise lost,: Being the Ballard Matthews lectures, delivered at University College, North Wales, 1941 ([Wales, North.

I began the book with great expectations and must admit to being somewhat disappointed. Lewis sets out defining the 'epic' as genre, and explaining why Milton chose this form. He also traces the history of the Epic giving special emphasis on the turning point in the form made by the 'Aeneid'.He also outlines the stylistic peculiarities of Milton which helped give shape to his Epic. The latter part of the book is a discussion of the Themes of 'Paradise Loss' and considers among other things, the relation of Milton's work to the thought of Augustine, the role of Satan in the work, that of Adam and Eve. Lewis tends to the view that the Arian Milton did not attempt to force his own religious views on the Poem, but rather was concerned with the Poem's achieving its artistic and moral end.There is an important chapter on 'Heirarchy' which shows how for Milton as for Shakespeare this is a key conception in their worlds. Lewis is a chamption of Milton's discipline, and shows how his stylistic brilliance created a continuous motion and form for the poem. The great Miltonian sentence in all its complexities is central here.There is much to learn from this work about Milton, and also about Lewis.I find that it did not however provide the kind of overall picture of the meaning of the Poem that I certainly thought it would."},{"Title":"A preface to Paradise lost,: Being the Ballard Matthews lectures, delivered at University College, North Wales, 1941 ([Wales, North.

On one side you have those who say that Milton was secretly on the Devil's side. (Due to the realistic portrayal of Satan and the seemingly far off and tyrannical portrayal of God) On the other side you have those who say that Milton's sympathies were with God and the angels. (Due to the loving portrayal of the angels and mankind) C.S. Lewis was of the later camp. In 1942, he stood up against those who said otherwise.I have a hard time labeling this as a 'preface'; Lewis was obviously writing to the learned elite at Cambridge, not to new readers of Milton. But Lewis does an excellent job of explaining Milton's worldview and how it works in Paradise Lost. His chapters on Primary and Secondary Epics, Miton and St. Augustine, and Hierarchy are EXTREMELY helpful. (Particularly the helpful to American readers is the Hierarchy chapter; we just don't understand what it means to live under and totally submit to a king or emperor.)I highly recommend this to readers of Lewis or fans of Medieval and Renaissance literature."},{"Title":"A preface to Paradise lost,: Being the Ballard Matthews lectures, delivered at University College, North Wales, 1941 ([Wales, North.

In fact, one can make a nice trilogy out of PREFACE TO PARADISE LOST, PARADISE LOST, and Lewis's PERELANDRA. Lewis's PREFACE should interest both the general reader and the specialist. Lewis gives a roadmap for working through Milton's epic poem, discussing what an epic is and why Milton chose it, for example, or why Milton used a certain style for writing; he also comments on Milton's theology, medieval hierarchy, and a number of other pertinent subjects with which the reader will probably not be overly familiar. The writing is clear, the discussion lucid and enlightening, and the subjects are interesting.

His presentation of background information sets the great English epic in its contemporary context--literary, historical, and theological--with a minimum of fuss and footnotes. Some of his negative judgments, such as calling the last two books &quot;an undigested lump of futurity,&quot; deserve reconsideration, but on the whole his judgments encourage critical reading rather than bardolatry."},{"Title":"A preface to Paradise lost,: Being the Ballard Matthews lectures, delivered at University College, North Wales, 1941 ([Wales, North. University ... Wales, Bangor. Ballard Matthews lectures])","review":"C.S. Lewis had one great advantage for truly comprehending Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\": he shared Milton's Christianity. It seems that many modern non-Christian critics of Milton impose concepts on the text which would have been foreign to Milton. Lewis, in contrast, belonged in his whole mindset (according to his own admission) much more to bygone ages than to the twentieth century. Thus he was able to understand bygone poets more than most people today.Added to this advantage is of course Lewis's gift of having a lucid mind extended by an enchanting pen. His writings, including his academic ones, bristle with a liveliness lacking in most academic circles. \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\" is no exception in this regard.As for the content of the \\"Preface,\\" Lewis first spends eight chapters describing and defending the style of Epic Poetry, to which \\"Paradise Lost\\" belongs. He distinguishes between Primary and Secondary Epic and draws parallels to the Roman poet Virgil. The remaining eleven chapters are used to discuss the theological concepts in \\"Paradise Lost,\\" making particular note of St. Augustine's influence on Milton.The bottom line of the book is that Milton's poem, more than anything else, embodies concepts found in the Bible and the teachings of the Church, and that the supposed \\"revolutionary\\" concepts in Milton have largely been forced upon the text by later critics.My own experience of reading Milton, for what it is worth, agrees with this view. I studied the Bible and church history quite extensively BEFORE I picked up \\"Paradise Lost,\\" and I was surprised to find how very unoriginal the poem was in its portrayed concepts (which does not mean that it is a bad poem); almost everything in Milton has its source either in the Bible or in Christian traditions and teachings.Edward Wagenknecht from \\"The New York Times\\" was right to say that in the \\"Preface,\\" C.S. Lewis's \\"most valiant service is to protect us against the many students of Milton who have not been able to see the woods for the trees\\" (taken from the back cover of the book).A superb academic work - not only for academic readers.(By the way, for a start on Lewis's own poetry, I recommendSpirits in Bondage: The Anguished Spirit That Found Narnia.)- Jacob Schriftman, Author of The C.

University ... Wales, Bangor. Ballard Matthews lectures])","review":"As a man who spent the entirety of his childhood avoiding the repeatedly assigned Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe (i got very good at making my tests look like i'd read it, as im sure many grade school students do when its assigned year after year, i think we even did it in high school), i always associated Lweis' name with BAD. And then i discovered Milton, and his Satan, and Lewis re-entered the picture.His preface to Paradise Lost is largely a defense, mostly against the attacks of contemporary and irreverant poets like Pound and Eliot who criticized Milton extensively, especially for his Latinate syntax. Lewis engages Eliot specifically in one chapter that reads like a very wordy rap beef. If you ask me, Eliot, certainly the better poet, is out of his element in the crit ring, and Lewis smokes him good, at times you might shout \\"OHHHHHHHHHHHH\\"Far as his approach to the poem, he lays out the foundation for a modern understanding of Milton, namely a reverence for ritual and heritage, and an appreciation of epic and narrative poetry. His chapters on Homer Virgil and Beowulf are valuable and enjoyable reads worth the price of admission themselves. His criticism is highly intelligent but never overwhelming or tangential, it is systematic and thorough while still retaining a smooth readability. Easily one of the most valuable studies of Milton to come out of the 20th century."},{"Title":"A preface to Paradise lost,: Being the Ballard Matthews lectures, delivered at University College, North Wales, 1941 ([Wales, North. University ... Wales, Bangor. Ballard Matthews lectures])","review":"Read this before reading Paradise Lost for a much easier time comprehending the work. Lewis is recognized by most literary scholars for his ability to interpret the language and literature from the Milton's period in literary history. It is clear, easy to read, yet profound in insight. Any reader who is honestly interested in comprehending the depth of Milton's work will appreciate Lewis' analysis; unless, of course, that reader is such a defensive unbeliever that he cannot stomach the idea that the devil might be real, even in literature."},{"Title":"A preface to Paradise lost,: Being the Ballard Matthews lectures, delivered at University College, North Wales, 1941 ([Wales, North. University ... Wales, Bangor. Ballard Matthews lectures])","review":"While other reviewers have already touched on many key tenets of this fabulous little book, I may be able to enumerate or elaborate a little yet.The real stuff of this book you must read for yourself, but I can at least adumbrate some general ideas he touches on.1) A short, lucid, and highly informative introduction to epic _qua_ epic. Style, content, form, all the essentials. What makes Homer Homer: what it means. Where Virgil deviated: why it matters. Where Milton deviates: why it matters. &c.;2) Lovely interaction with contemporary \\"New Criticism.\\" I. A. Richards meets the classical scholar (Chapter VIII).3) Quintessential societal and philosophical criticism peppered _throughout_. You wouldn't think you'd be able to quote Lewis on the fatuousness of certain \\"sacred cow\\" tenets of \\"progressive modernity\\" in a book on Milton, but it's here--and moreover, each little epigrammatic jab is perfectly felicitous and apposite. Only Clive! Each one yields great laughter and reflection.4) Some _excellent_ and _original_ universal literary criticism. It is my opinion that many excerpts of this book should be included in Literary Theory anthologies. He treats such overarching topics as reading, poetry _qua_ poetry, criticism _qua_ criticism, authorial intent, &c.; &c.;5) His criticism of Milton's Satan is pretty much the coolest thing you'll ever read. I'll leave it at that: you must read it for yourself! I've read the chapter on Satan four times it's so good.That's enough for now. Buy and read!"},{"Title":"A preface to Paradise lost,: Being the Ballard Matthews lectures, delivered at University College, North Wales, 1941 ([Wales, North. University ... Wales, Bangor. Ballard Matthews lectures])","review":"Although a work of extraordinary brilliance and charm, this is not the critical last word on Milton. Lewis is brilliant almost to the point of being overwhelming on everything which is story and narrative and character; his comparison of Adam with Satan, his account of the diabolical cabinet meeting in book two, his description of what eating the apple did to Adam and Eve - the father of all bright epigrammatic wastrels meeting the mother of all [evil], selfish sentimentalists - his observation on Eve's sin, which could have been written by Chesterton, all are outstanding and hit the nail on the head so hard that it rings. And his immense learning is certainly up to the task of disentangling the intellectual background to the story - his account of the correspondence between Augustine's view of the Fall and Milton's, and his observation that both Satan and Abdiel \\"are good Aristotelians\\", show his easy, almost careless handling of vast stores of knowledge and understanding.The problem with this otherwise superlative and certainly indispensable essay is that Lewis, taken with his vision of a common \\"mere Christianity\\" embracing Protestants, Anglicans, Catholics and Orthodox, simply misses the extent and significance of Milton's sectarian and heretical opinions. Sure, he knows that Milton was a sort of modified follower of Arius, who denied the divinity of Jesus - that is, that he stood at the outer edges of what is permissible for a Christian to believe - but he does not seem to understand that the consistently materializing imagination of Milton, that almost transforms the Trinity and the Angels into Greek Gods, was a typically Protestant and sectarian reaction against Catholic theology and especially against Thomism, with its wholly spiritual view of Angels. Nor does he give sufficient space to the most sectarian feature of Milton's spirit, the bitterness, amounting almost to bigotry, with which he denounced opposing viewpoints; in spite of the famous passage in the AEROPAGITICUS, he is a bad friend of liberty. Listen to the pointed observations of the historian Eric Voegelin:\\"[Milton writes in Of True Religion , 1673:] Catholic worship cannot be tolerated \\"without grievous and unsufferable scandal giv'n to all consciencious Beholders.\\" And he leaves it to the civil magistrate to consider whether Catholics in England can be tolerated at all, even without public worship. If Catholics should complain that their conscience is violated if the celebration of the mass is not permitted to them, he replies that \\"we have not warrant to regard Conscience which is not founded on Scripture.\\" . . . . Radical scripturalism has become, in the field of social technique, the instrument through which the conscience of man can be kept within the limits of national jurisdiction.\\"Milton goes even further in his scripturalism: he expects everybody to do his duty and to use the opportunity offered by the English Bible translation for becoming thoroughly acquainted with Scripture. \\"Neither let the Countryman, the Tradesman, the Lawyer, the Physician, the Statesman, excuse himself by his much business from the studious reading thereof. . . .\\"Using a modern category, we might say that Milton was a totalitarian National Scripturalist. . . . \\"Lewis is possibly too much in love with Milton's masterpiece; certain it is that at the end of this marvellous little tome we may find ourselves wondering why, if Milton is really so wonderful as Lewis makes him, we feel so little need to go and revisit his work; why, indeed, we would much rather re-read Lewis' own PREFACE than Milton himself."},{"Title":"A preface to Paradise lost,: Being the Ballard Matthews lectures, delivered at University College, North Wales, 1941 ([Wales, North. University ... Wales, Bangor. Ballard Matthews lectures])","review":"There are many approaches to criticism of Paradise Lost. None is more in the spirit of the poem as Milton wrote and intended than C. S. Lewis's Preface. Lewis's spirit is in harmony with Milton's and his Preface is a masterful explication of the greatest poem ever written. It is a delight to read and, as Lewis wished, urges one on to read the poem itself, with greater understanding."},{"Title":"A preface to Paradise lost,: Being the Ballard Matthews lectures, delivered at University College, North Wales, 1941 ([Wales, North. University ... Wales, Bangor. Ballard Matthews lectures])","review":"This book by CS Lewis is such a classic that it really needs no further recommendation as far as the quality and the content of the book go. However, I think it would be helpful to clarify how Lewis approaches Milton.Lewis's conception of poetry, like Milton's, is fundamentally classical. To paraphrase Lewis, poetry is both something said (logos) and something made (poiema). If you can adjust yourself to this view of poetry, this is a superb book that provides tremendous insight to \\"the divine poem\\". If you cannot adjust yourself to this view of poetry, you will hate this book.The implications are serious, for Lewis's book will not help you to \\"read into Milton\\" an embittered individual trying to avenge his political failures, nor will it help you to \\"prove\\" that Milton is a misogynist, nor will it help you to conclude that Milton secretly belongs to Satan's party. In this sense, Lewis's book will not necessarily give you ideas on writing clever papers for literature classes. If that is what you are looking for, please refer to the Cambridge Companion to Milton.As De Quincey says, \\"What you owe to Milton is not any knowledge, of which a million separate items are still but a million of advancing steps on the same earthly level; what you owe is power, that is, exercise and expansion to your own latent capacity of sympathy with the infinite, where every pulse and each separate influx is a step upwards, a step ascending as upon a Jacob's ladder from earth to mysterious altitudes above the earth.\\" If you are prepared to appreciate the power of Milton in all its splendor and subtleties, Lewis's book is an invaluable guide."},{"Title":"War and the Iliad","review":"Besides being thankful to the New York Review of Books for publishing some of the most intelligent and expansive literary criticism around, we can now be grateful for one more gift from the series of New York Review Classics. This one, two essays ostensibly on the Iliad by Simone Weil and Rachel Bespaloff, attains the very special pantheon of a glorious literary event.Both pieces were written by women who were Jewish intellectuals forced to flee France on the cusp of the Second World War and were composed in that climate of national upheaval. In writing about the greatest war epic in Western literature, they were able-each in her own way-to cast a reflection on her own time and the devasting changes that the threat of war was effecting. Needless to say, this creates an urgency and immediacy to their writing that goes beyond the literary. These are not aloof reflections on an ancient relic but the purest example of writing on life and death as a matter of life and death.The publishing of the the pairing of these two pieces is an act of heroic recovery, the best example of why writing matters."},{"Title":"War and the Iliad","review":"Simone Weil was one of the transcendent geniuses of our time. The archetypal intellectual/activist - the clarity of her insight and the depth and weight of her oeuvre is remarkable, incredible for anyone - no less someone in their twenties and early thirties. A brilliant comet of a being, intensely engaged in the vortex of social change, yet seen by her contemporaries only from a distance - she died at a mere 34!Weil mastered Ancient Greek in her teens and used to correspond with her brother in Attic script. She even contemplated a translation of the Iliad, which she believed to be \\"the purest mirror of the human condition\\". Her writings on Greek thought, luminous, eloquent, and profound are collected in a svelte volume, 'Intimations of Christianity Among the Ancient Greeks' Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1957. Wonderful as it is to have these works in English in one volume - the best translation of her noted masterpiece, 'The Iliad, the Poem of Force' is not to be found here - nor is it to be found in NYRB's reissue of the original English translation by Mary McCarthy. The translation which, to my ear, really captures the honed edge of Weil's prose is Holoka's 'The Iliad or the Poem of Force: A Critical Edition'. New York and Frankfort on Main, Peter Lang, 2003.Compare the rendering of famous first lines of the 26 page essay:McCarthy: \\"The true hero, the true subject matter, the center of the Iliad is force. Force employed by man, force that enslaves man, force before which man's flesh shrinks away\\".Holoka: \\"The true hero, the true subject matter, the center of the Iliad is force. The force that men wield, the force that subdues men, in the face of which human flesh shrinks back\\"."},{"Title":"War and the Iliad","review":"Mary McCarthy translated both of these great essays on the ILIAD written during the Occupation by two of France's leading intellectuals with the intention of publishing them both together, but entanglements with the estate of Simone Weil made this impossible until now. The great Greek literary works about warfare and civilization were much on the minds of French intellectuals during World War II, and these two essays are among the most remarkable fruits of that thematic obsession.Homer's literary inheritor, the seventh-century BCE poet Archilochus, wrote, \\"The fox knows many tricks, the hedgehog only one, but it is a good one.\\" The great twentieth-century philosopher Isaiah Berlin thus grouped the preeminent figures of Western culture into the categories of \\"foxes\\" and \\"hedgehogs.\\" In her essay here, Weil shows herself to be a hedgehog, pursuing one theme relentlessly and obsessively but exceptionally persuasively. In pursuit of her argument that the ILIAD is a poem about force she herself reenacts such violence upon the characters, stripping the characters of their names (such that Andromache becomes \\"the wife,\\" Priam \\"the suppliant\\") in order to make her point that they are de-humanized by the processes of war. Even with this in mind, hopwever, it would be hard to think of a more encompassing or poignant reading of the poem, though Rachel Bespaloff, who apparently read Weil's piece while writing her own study of the ILIAD and altered her argument to accommodate Weil's, may well out-do her. Bespaloff is intellectually a fox, pursuing many ideas and themes with real grace and with Weil's very historically and culturally broad sense of scope; her argument is absolutely remarkable, and shows that, like Weil, she has a strong command of the poem's ethical problems as well as of its richness. As icing on the cake, NYRB also appends the novelist Hermann Broch's own fine essay on Bespaloff's piece. Anyone who has read the ILIAD carefully will find much meat here, even sixty years after the original essays were written."},{"Title":"Funk & Wagnalls new encyclopedia","review":"I own a 1950 edition of the FUNK AND WAGNALLAS ENCYCLOPEDIA&gt;.

That is always the problem when a writer bases their writing on second hand information rather than going to the source (the same mistake as Calvin Beisner's).As an example, the claim that numerical growth of Oneness churches has been far lower than those of their Trinitarian counterparts has been proven false by Oneness researcher Talmadge French in his book \\"Our God is One: The Story of the Oneness Pentecostals\\". His research, which was his M.A. dissertation at Billy Graham's alma matter (Wheaton College) is very well documented and proves that from 1960 on specially the largest Oneness organization, the United Pentecostal Church, has had a fastest growth than the two other \\"contenders\\" (i.e. The Church of God and the Assemblies of God).The author's use of the term \\"Unitarian\\" instead of \\"Oneness\\" is also misleading. No Oneness advocate should be confused with Unitarian Universalist, which this term allows.All in all, and to make this short, the book is not worth it.

With the help of a woman, he wins the respect of Canaan and is able to usurp Pike's power.I thought this book was fairly dry.

The Vogels move beyond church traditional thinking about sacraments (Eucharist, Baptism, and others) to think about friendships, hospitality, sharing gifts, being present to others as sacraments. They invite readers to think about the whole of life as sacred and they see aspects of the sacred in all facets of life."},{"Title":"Sacramental Living: Falling Stars and Coloring Outside the Lines","review":"In the grand sweep of post-Baby-Boom theologians and liturgical practitioners, Dwight and Linda Vogel stand out as both wonderful teachers and practical advisors. The title might seem a little too \\"space cadet\\" for those of us not aculturated to a late-sixties world view. Don't let this fool you: the title is an accruate reflection of the contents and the spirit of the book.At its heart, the book is an attempt (successful!) at placing the lessons of baptism and Eucharist into daily life. No one sees the world in the living colors that the Vogels do. Snap this book up, read it, contemplate it, and live it. It is a mad roller-coaster ride through sacramental thought expressed in daily living. Appropriate for all stripes of Christians, but the liturgical denominations will probably \\"get it\\" more quickly. I am somewhere between the Wesleyan & Eastern Orthodox strains on the theological scale, and this book hit me squarely between the eyes.The style is readable and fairly represents what you'd hear and see if you met the Vogels in person (I have just recently.)I can recommend it completely, totally, heartily. Read and enjoy! It is a delight, fun, approachable - but be warned, it might permanently change your life; it did for me."},{"Title":"Sacramental Living: Falling Stars and Coloring Outside the Lines","review":"I really WANTED to like this book. Being aware of the sacramental nature of our life in Christ is something I've spent a lot of time thinking about. Unfortunately, this book feels \\"off\\", slightly tainted with an overemphasis on story and a lack of appreciation for solid truth. Yes, the story of Jesus matters, and people's individual stories matter...but they don't matter more than or at the expense of the truth of the creeds. Both are necessary, and unfortunately the Vogels seem to have forgotten that."},{"Title":"Sacramental Living: Falling Stars and Coloring Outside the Lines","review":"I enjoyed much of the insight this book had to offer, and a its a fun exercise in waking up to a more appreciative attitude towards life.

If you ask me... when it comes to Hip Hop, stick with the old school.I was brought up in Melbourne, Australia, and did quite a bit of graffiti there during the 1980s. Melbourne had plenty of weird & wonderful characters who were into graff back then. The vast majority have gone their separate ways. But there's always the rare psycho who's still bombing (I'm not referring to the younger generation - but to old school dudes who are still around). There's also those who got into graphic art and made a career for themselves out of graff.I recommend checking out some of the original Vaughn Bode cartoons for yourself through a simple Google search.Additional to this, I recommend Getting Up: Subway Graffitti in New York\\" by Craig Castleman. It has some pictures of trains and so on, but it is more for the reader. A copy was stolen from a local library near me - go figure.And if you're ever in NYC... Check out the Hall of Fame. It's located on the corner of 106th Street and Park Avenue."},{"Title":"Subway Art","review":"This book is THE book for graffiti writers. If you haven't heard of this book or haven't read it, what is wrong with you. This book manages to cover all aspects of graffiti in little over 100 pages. The book is chock full of the best pictures of the Kings of old school graffiti. This book is a must for toys as well as experieced writers. If you are into graffiti you will be into this book in a major way, but you don't have to take my word for it."},{"Title":"Subway Art","review":"I grew up on the south side of Chicago during the 80s and had many friends who were \\"taggers\\" and got up every chance they got. They had spray-cans, hollowed-out deodorant sticks somehow replaced with ink, fat markers, Griffin, and who knows what else. Though I myself wasnt a graffiti artist or writer or tagger, this book is a great ride down memory lane for those of us who grew up on the streets. For those of us of a certain age, this book, \\"Subway Art\\", along with movies like Breakin' I AND II, Beat Street, original hip-hop and old school house music were all of a specific time and place. This book will make you want to break out the Pumas with the fat laces, bring out the tile and start back-spinnin', but it is also one of the the earliest, most definitive and detailed books on graffiti ever."},{"Title":"American Social Classes in the 1950s: Selections from Vance Packard's The Status Seekers (Bedford Series in History and Culture)","review":"Vance Packard's \\"The Status Seekers\\" is a well known compendium and analysis of the nature and development of social classification during the 1950's-a period marked by explosive growth of the U.S. economy, especially among young white families. The thesis of the book, as explained by Packard, is that rather than the creation of a largely classless society in which \\"all\\" were gaining the benefits of democratic capitalism, the creation of an \\"affluent\\" society simply highlighted and created new stratifications, both horizontal, and vertical, of social class based on race, religion, behavioral and consumptive practices.Packard sought to demonstrate his thesis by compiling and synthesizing then current sociological studies, as well as conducting informal interviews among members of various economic classes, policy experts, and professionals in different cities, towns, and states. There is little in the book that represents original thought, but the form, promotion and style of the book made it a best-selling nonfiction work among the general public.It was precisely these qualities that drew so much ire from many critics, especially those drawn from the circles of New York intelligentsia-it was often attacked for its own pretense to provinciality and romanticism of an agrarian, frontier past. The Status Seekers nonetheless stands as a significant work in American Studies, precisely because of its ability to bring scholarly information, especially regarding the vertical stratifications of race and religion, to bear on the nature of class in America, and stands out as a dissenting voice in the consensus ideology and politics of containment that ruled public discourse at the time. Other criticisms of the book, such as the charge that it portrayed status seeking voyeuristically and hypocritically--- insofar as buyers used it to advance their own status---- are charges more appropriate to the willingness of the buying public to commodify and use as a tool any weapon in the fight to gain greater status. While books are meant to be read, conveying information about such timely topics is bound to get caught up in the politics of the very phenomenon studied. That is not Packard's fault.There are other criticisms, more from a contemporary standpoint, that could be made of Packard's work. It is true that he took from conservative liberalism a predisposition to see affluence as the problem, rather than the lack of it for so many people within the society he studied. It is also true that he played more to the prejudices of the day, especially regarding race and gender, and failed to aggressively question some of the roots of the problems he sought in terms of these prejudices. But the point of his text was not to make a critique of American institutions as such, but rather the interpretations of those institutions as held and manipulated by consumers for their own benefit.On the one hand, we should chalk this up to Packard's Cold War liberalism. Moreover, as pointed out in the excellent introductory essay by Daniel Horowitz, Packard was once a socialist radical, but experienced the realpolitik of Stalin's Soviet Union negotiations with Hitler, and correctly understood the USSR as a form of state capitalism (much like C. L. R. James). It would be worst sort of ex post facto presentism to hold these sorts of criticisms too hard against Packard.Christopher W. Chase - PhD Fellow - Michigan State University"},{"Title":"The raven;: A biography of Sam Houston,","review":"A interesting Texas history lesson, this book was recommended by a local Texas historian from the Haley Library and Museum. Very enjoyable if you want more than just a history about Sam Houston, this is a Texas/Mexico history mini-lesson as well. The book tells the story of Sam Houston's life including his: Tennessee Governorship, ties to President Andrew Jackson, role as General of Armies and Malitias, tenure as President of the Republic of Texas, role as United States Senator and Governorship of the State of Texas."},{"Title":"The raven;: A biography of Sam Houston,","review":"In 1929 Marquis James published his autobiography of Sam Houston which he titled \\"The Raven\\". It reflects, favorably for me, the style of scholarly writing of the times. Mr. James, who has written of other men and events of Houston's era, writes in a manor that suggests an almost intimate knowledge of his subject. He often shares Houston's feelings and reactions which he probably picked up on through his research into his subject's personal papers. As a result, the reader is more apt to become more emotionally involved with General Houston as he or she reads \\"The Raven\\". This became somewhat of a problem for me because Sam Houston is a somewhat exasperating individual.The Sam Houston that emerged, for me, in \\"The Raven\\" was a man of strong leadership abilities, solid loyalties, and minimal political thought. I say this last part reluctantly because Marquis James provides information that suggests that he was a very capable governor. However, there seem to be few issues that come up during Houston's various tenures in the US House and Senate. There were the issues of Texas, the Union, and his close friends; the Chreokees. There is little, if anything, on Houston's opinions concerning the National Bank, trade issues, interstate commerce or other important subjects of the day. Indeed, we get images of a bored Senator Houston whittling away (literally) his time in the US Senate. There is, however, plenty about Houston the leader whether it be on the field of battle or the state house. He was and remains a most impressive figure in the history of the United States of America. Much of what I had heard about the man was fleshed out in \\"The Raven\\" in a satisfactory manner.The major events are dealt with appropriately. For example, we don't get half of the book devoted to the Battle of San Jacinto. In fact, we get only a brief message of the Alamo but enough of San Jacinto to know what happened and how it affected both Houstan and Texas. Indeed, the greatest attention seems to have been given to Houston's failed first marriage. It ended with neither party talking about the cause of the split. The author seemed intent on uncovering the real cause and had us revisiting his first wife periodically through her life after Houston.Marquis James did have an interesting mystery that he introduced to us early in the book. It had to do with a gift from Houston's mother to him when he was young. I had forgotten all about it until it showed up again at the end of the book; an appropriate message at an appropriate place.I learned a lot about Sam Houston from reading this book and I am glad I did. There is plenty of Texas in here as there should be. There is also plenty of Tennessee, Washington DC, Andrew Jackson, Santa Ana, Cherokee Indians, and, as I alluded to early, the first Mrs. Houston (the second Mrs. Houston seemed to exist solely for producing offspring and writing letters). If Sam Houston is your hero, this is your book. If not then this is still an excellent biography."},{"Title":"The raven;: A biography of Sam Houston,","review":"I've read this book twice and I'm currently working on my third time. Not only is it a supurb, extremely well-written biography of one of the most interesting men in American history, it is also a wonderful story, filled with triumph and betrayal, adventure and sadness, cowardice and courage. If this were a novel, it would be considered one of the greatest American novels of all time. I cannot recommend this book too highly."},{"Title":"The raven;: A biography of Sam Houston,","review":"Marquis James shows why he won more than one Nobel prize for historical writing. In this book he takes you through the entire life of Sam Houston, giving the reader an insight on the events of Houston's earlier life that shaped his actions in the founding of the Texas Republic. Until reading this book, I had no idea just how important Sam Houston was to the history of not just Texas, but the entire United States."},{"Title":"The raven;: A biography of Sam Houston,","review":"I read this book because it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1930, but it stands with any more recently written biography. Sam Houston had a fantastically interesting life, and if you haven't read a bio of him you will be amazed. I recommend this book without reservation."},{"Title":"The raven;: A biography of Sam Houston,","review":"Great biographical reading about Sam Houston. I am a lousy reader and a history book has to be really good to keep my attention. I loved this book."},{"Title":"The raven;: A biography of Sam Houston,","review":"Superb biography of the Raven. Well worth your reading time. This was an unusual man! As old General Nicks said, \\"God made him two drinks scant.\\"Unfortunately, my first copy arrived missing 30 pages. Amazon graciously sent a replacement copy and allowed me to keep the defective copy with all my notes, underlinings, etc."},{"Title":"The raven;: A biography of Sam Houston,","review":"If a novelist had created the character Sam Houston, the story would have been considered outlandish, picaresque, too fantastical to be realistic. But this fully-documented biography of a Texas legend is proof that larger-than-life heroes sometimes appear in real life.Before Houston even stepped foot in Texas, he had carved a name for himself in Tennessee. He lived with the Cherokee, and was adopted as a citizen of that nation, which gave him the name \\"The Raven.\\" He founded a school. He acquitted himself with honor in the War of 1812, surviving wounds which were considered fatal. He became a protege' of Andrew Jackson. He became an attorney. He represented Tennessee in the U. S. House of Representatives. He was elected governor of Tennessee, with the backing of Andrew Jackson. And then he married. And everything changed.After only eleven weeks of marriage, Houston's new bride, Eliza, returned to her family. For the rest of their lives, neither Houston nor Eliza would explain their separation. Houston resigned his governorship and retreated to his Indian family, living with the Cherokee for three more years before going to Texas.It is in the unfolding of Houston's life in Texas that author Marquis James really hits his stride in revealing the cunning and intellect of Houston, as he orchestrated battles and later led his new Republic into eventual annexation by the United States. Twice President of the Republic of Texas, once elected to the U.S. Senate to represent his new state after annexation, and once elected as Governor, Houston shaped the destiny of Texas as no other ever did.Houston's final act as a political figure demonstrates his continued adherence to his own code of honor: He resigned as Governor rather than take an oath of loyalty to the Confederacy.This Pulitzer Prize-winning biography portrays Sam Houston in a most favorable light; other biographers have not been as kind. The writing constantly seems to straddle the ground between a history for historians (which tend to be dull, even though describing exciting events), and a history for non-historians (which tend to include flights of fancy). Nevertheless, it is essential reading for all true Texans and all those who admire the larger-than-life history of early Texas."},{"Title":"The raven;: A biography of Sam Houston,","review":"Interesting; a little too detailed for my taste, especialy at the beginning.
