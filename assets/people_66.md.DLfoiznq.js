This story is great, with a strong Lord of the Flies allusion, that actually continues on across the other stories in this collection. The characterizations of the mother, son and recent arrival in the neighborhood are strong. The story also has a subtle &quot;creepiness&quot; that kept me on edge. The other stories in the volume are much less satisfying, as the protagonists are less well developed, and generally less likeable. Hearts in Atlantic (story 2) is the best of the rest, because King succeeds in creating some suspense and an interesting view of the UMaine in the 60's. The other stories are sort of forced."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I ran out and bought this book as soon as I heard it was out. I had high hopes for this book as the preliminary reviews said it was worth reading.Instead, what the book entails is four soporific tales that were about as scary as watching the cookie monster on PBS. The monsters / ghosts that were thrown into the four entertwined novellas came as more of an afterthought than an integral part of the story. The monsters did weird things but were never 100% explained.The set of stories start with a young kid growing up in the early 60's. Stories of Vietnam were in the paper, but no one paid any attention to them. As the stories, progress Vietnam and the tension of the times are depicted. Some of the characters from the first story show up in subsequent stories. The novellas wind up in 1999 with some of the main characters facing their final endings.I was left with an empty feeling upon reading many of the stories. They didn't seem to be conclusive and appeared to be an exercise of patience to get through them. King writes well and captures the essence and brand name items of the time ( he does this too well ) but fails to conjure a tale worthy of reading. I was all too glad to go on to a different book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Loved Low Men In Yellow Coats and the last story, not so wild about the ones in between. I felt that the first story had a touch of INSOMNIA as well. Overall, well worth my time!!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Wonderful novel where every story is tied together in some way...makes you want to keep reading! &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; and &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; held your attention and were a fast read. &quot;Blind Willie&quot; and &quot;Why we're in Vietnam&quot; were a bit tedious but brought everything together in their own way. I personally think, Mr King could have had Bobby Garfield and Carol Gerber's stories carry the whole book..I don't believe there was much interest in the other external characters. These 2 characters, in themselves, were interesting and complex. Still I believe this is one his best stories yet and on a more human level than past works ."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Unlike &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; which I couldn't put down. I couldn't wait to finish this one...it was terrible after the first story. The only people who will understand the Vietnam references will be those who experienced it first hand. I was very dissappointed!!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"A great piece of work! I loved the way the stories interweaved and the way you learned more about the characters who may have had a minor role in the previous story but play a more important role in the narrative of the next - Each story connects and each adds brushstrokes to create a fabulous read. I also liked how the themes ranged from the supernatural evil of the &quot;low men&quot; to the mundane corruptness of Officer Wheelock. All ranges that no one does like King. I had tears in my eyes at the end. Keep them coming!!!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have read all of SK's books, and I must admit, I was a little disappointed with some of his recent ventures (Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, Bag of Bones, Storm of the Century), but Hearts in Atlantis has proved once again that Stephen is King! He's a fabulous storyteller and this book proves it. Since I was born during the Vietnam war, I cannot vouch for the authenticity of the historical perspective, but the story is amazing. And if you're hooked on the Gunslinger series (as I am), you MUST read &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; - it *does* shed some light on the mystery..."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"From chapter one to the e nd you are caught up in the characters and the story. Only Mr King could interweave so many characters, and storylines so well and leave you wanting more. Here's hoping he is well enough to write more soon. I think I saw a hint of what may be coming next look for it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Better than his last work. These stories evoke emotion and interest in the reader, something King's earlier works did. While buying this book I got sidetracked on titles and bought another book ATLANTIS, by Greg Donegan. Loved it and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I hate to say this, but I was quite disappointed with this novel, because it's not up to par--and I say this, having read *all* of King's other books. The first two stories were pretty good--I especially liked the Dark Tower tie-ins. Unfortunately, the book has a domewhat fragmented feel...after &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot;, and &quot;HEarts in Atlantis&quot;, I was just reading ti to be done. Also, it has an un-fullfilling ending. I think that this is a far cry from the masterpice that was &quot;Bag of Bones.&quot; Mr. King, do us all a favor--please, drop the dentimental reflective suttf that you jammed into this book, and give us something real: The Dark Tower V; a new, good horror novel.. or anything, t make up for this, and &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"King writes great Americana, and this take on the sixties, and the lost innocence of a nation, is touching and wistful.I have come to worry that supernatural horror will come in at the end and muck up a perfectly reasonable book, but here any supernatural events are the magic of childhood, not the monster out of the closet."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I always anxiously await the arival of any new Steven King novel. Though some of them are true dogs (Gerald's Game, The Tommyknockers)the vast majority of his work is downright awe-inspiring. I've never read anyone else's work that describes things is such fine detail, and in such a meaningful way. This book is a great read, and well worth the cost. I won't spoil it for you, but King describes his work aptly enough through one of his characters: &quot;when you find a book that's both a good story and has good language, treasure that book.&quot; Truer words were never spoken (er, written) and certainly apply to Hearts in Atlantis."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is a great book - there are enough creepy bits for those of us who like Mr King being spooky, and there is also great straight story telling for those of us who like Mr King's short stories (&quot;Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption&quot; springs to mind). The stories all have common ties, and the ending is marvellous, even poignant.

Is Hearts in Atlantis a horror novel?"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I thought this was a very good book, one that brought back numerous memories for me of the time I was growing up. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Young, carefree children start King's latest and in my opinion best novel in their home town of Harwich struggling with the pressures every eleven year old faces. They eventually grow apart and like in so many King novels all face greater problems and the hardships that follow us all into adulthood. The content for me isn't overly important in this novel but never has a King novel touched me on so many different levels and never have I read a book where almost everything from childhood to college seemed so familiar to me and my own life. Not since I first read Christine have I ever read an entire novel in one sitting and that was over a decade ago. The monsters in this book aren't as big as usual, you won't find them hiding under the bed either. They are small demons in your face and by God do they have sharp teeth. They are real lifeKing has produced a masterpiece. Like the vulgar DeSoto found in the first story this book is alive."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"As I have now read over 300 reviews regarding King's &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;, I understand what these critiques are all about. If you are anywhere from 20 - 40 years old, you are probably not aware of the important events that shaped my life. The Viet Nam War and the importance of my college years were so special to me and my friends...especially those who had to go and fight. I felt such a camaderie with Stephen King as I read Hearts of Atlantis. Yes, he grew up during my era. The 60's are a decade that will live forever in my heart...my friends who died in Viet Nam, and those who survived. We played Bridge. Just let those young people out there know that there is a world that Stephen King remembers...A world that I remember...A world that remembers the Viet Nam War...Hearts in Atlantis remembers ALL of those. King also remembers all of my thoughts."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King has an amazing way with imagery and getting readers hooked with a story. I would particularly recommmend this book to anyone who hasn't read any King in a while. This work represents somewhat of a departure from his past style of shocking gore, and might be a pleasant surprise to those who think they can't stomach Stephen King. This book, like Bag of Bones and The Green Mile, weaves an intricate and thoughtful plot with an undercurrent of the supernatural. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed King's commentary on the '60s in Hearts in Atlantis for several reasons. First, I actually failed a semester of college in the spring of 1971 because I played Hearts non-stop instead of going to class or studying. Second, my generation (DOB: 12-18-50)deserves to be held up for examination on the question- for what the hell is it that we still stand? Third, the fluid boundaries of each story within accuratly reflect the extremes of the social and political upheavals that forged, and sometimes bludgeoned, America into her next developmental stage. If you don't mind a little lingering aftertaste to tweak your conscience about what you've been doing since the '60s, this book is a terrific read."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have been an avid reader of Stephen King since I was in high school (my favorites being &quot;The Stand&quot; and &quot;It&quot;), but my experiences with his more recent works have been less than satisfying. Unlike a previous reviewer, I found &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; to be rather unimaginative--like a standard Harlequin romance with supernatural undertones. When I saw &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; in a bookstore, I thought I'd give Stephen King another shot.Initially, I found the style of this novel refreshing--it lacked the usual gore of King's previous novels. The story really pulled me in--I love his depictions of childhood antics.But just when I was hooked on the character he developed for approximately half the book, the story abruptly stopped. To my dismay, I would never find out what happened in the young boy's life. And I would never discover what the significance was of the references to &quot;the beam&quot; and the men in yellow jackets (lucky for me, though, I'd read &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; novels, so I wasn't competely confused). Suddenly, what started out as a great novel turned into a string of novellas with very loosely related themes. In addition, every one of the novellas left you hanging. The final chapter tried to tie all the short stories together, but it seemed rushed and lacking.If you want a truely original and gripping King novel, try &quot;The Stand&quot;."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I was skeptical when I picked up this book. I don't know much about the Vietnam War and what I do know isn't anything good. I'm still fairly young to know what the times were like and the reasons.Then I started reading this book. I was immediately drawn into Carol, Bobby and Sully-John's world... only to be completely confused by the introduction of a new character and what at first appeared to be a different storyline. I have to admit, I was put out by it, I wanted to know what happened to them, not about this new guy. So I trudged along in the new story and from then on I was hooked once again.I feel like I am missing some of the history of what took place but it saddened me to read about what happened to these people, what they had to \\"live\\" through. It makes no sense to me.But I think King sums it up best when he writes: \\" ...That's us, brother, we like to watch. Movies, video games, live car-chase footage, fistfights on The Jerry Springer Show, Mark McGwire, World Federation Wrestling, impeachment hearings, we don't care, we just like to watch. But there was a time...don't laugh, but there was time when it was really all in our hands. Do you know that?\\"Those words ring so true more than ever. We live in a society where people think they have control but in reality are no more than puppets whose strings are determined by the environments that the media has created. We have no control over anything, when the truth is told. We are always fighting for the idea that we can control something. We are allowed to think that we've won but the truth is that it's just that, a thought.This book is very thought provoking, very insightful to what it was like or could have been like. It takes you to many worlds over and connects in a way that can only be revealed full circle. It's an amazing read and even more so an amazing experience."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Everything in the novel \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" by Stephen King revolves around theme of the story of schoolboys in \\"The Lord of Flies\\". A few schoolboys are stranded on an island after plane crash. Soon it gets into the two fights or wars going on. One in the sky, the other between two groups of boys on the ground. Living in natural state brings out inborn cruelty.The same thing we witness in Vietnam. The group of soldiers- Sully, Malenphant, Willie Sherman are attacked, and cornered by Vietcong. They are running towards clearing to get evacuated, when helicopters falls down and explodes. They rush to rescue people in helicopter. Jack in the Lord of flies kills a sow; here Malenphant kills Vietnamese woman in his war rage, giving vent to basic natural instinct to kill.The survivors are haunted for rest of their life by this and other event, blowing up of one of their own companion, severely wounded. War didn't finish when it was over, but survives and continues in their mind.One commentator in his essay refers \\"Atlantis\\" as a symbol of years of Sixties. I feel that rather Atlantis stands for that period of adolescence and youth in the life of main characters in the novel. Their life in college Dormitory. They live a life governed by their own rules, apart from the rest of the world. This life gradually sinks, never to come back. Thus the story stops being their own story. All of us have gone through that period of life, where we loose our child hood innocence and dream, gradually learn what life is and grow into it. It gradually drifts away and lives only in our own memory. This is the period when we don't know our place in the world surrounding us. We try to live it in our own way, apart from the rest of the world.The beating of Carol in the park near field B is somewhat akin to killing a mamsan-Old Vietnamese lady and killing a sow. Carol was not virtually killed, just badly beaten, but something in her mind is dead for ever. This forever haunts Willie Sherman, just like killing of Mamsan till his death haunts Sully, though both of them didn't actually do themselves. The summer vacation of 1960 brings the isolation to Bobby and his friends like air crash to schoolboys in The Lord of Flies. They daily routine is stopped, they are vacuum, nothing to do except roam around in their own world while adults in home are busy with their chores and problems. Thus they become prey to their own natural instincts. The effect of the summer vacation on 1960 was the same as effect produced by Vietnam War on young American soldiers on distant island.In \\" Hearts in Atlantis\\" Stephen King is taking us to the heart of some of the problems of to days American life, drugs, school shootings, street Gang fights, drive away shootings. These are nothing but killing a sow. The news media like CNN and NBC are broadcasting the head of sow stuck on a pole all over America and rest of the world.Amidst all this, as Bobby Garfield thinks, we need to remember, there is always a Navy Guy or Rionda coming along to stop the bad action and rescue. This is something reader must not forget when putting the book down,Though Carol and Bobby Garfield go behind the scene most of the time after Low Men in Yellow Coats, they are the main characters; this is their love story in a sense. Of all characters, Carol stands out as heroine, a young idealistic girl, who was beaten up and then tricked by activist, thus robbed of everything."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I first read &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; a couple of years ago. I really, really liked the book. I would cite it as one of the best pieces of evidence against those more snobbish folks who like to pretend Stephen King can't write.The book is a masterpiece of intertwining stories. It follows the fates of various characters from a small New England town over the course of more than forty years: from the wonder and sadness of youth, through an eerily terrible account of college, to the identity crises of middle age--and finally, death. Some of these stories will, like Myth, become a part of you.King's honesty and insight into human nature carves a path through the hidden chambers of the human soul. This is some of his greatest stuff.The movie failed to do this book any kind of justice--even with the great Anthony Hopkins.Not so with the tape recording.William Hurt took some adjusting to for me, but he is consistently outstanding as a reader. In &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats,&quot; Hurt captures Bobby's innocence and Mrs. Garfield's ambition (and later wounded-ness) perfectly. His laid back reading catches something of a seemingly simpler time.King also does a darn good job. I did not care for his earlier reading of &quot;The Gunslinger,&quot; but he is spot on here.I highly recommend this audio version."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have not read much of King's work, but the more I read, the more I enjoy it. This book drew me in from the first page. I knew very little about the story, only what my boyfriend (who suggested I read it in the first place) had told me about it. It seemed interesting, so I gave it a try. For days, I read it whenever I could. It just captured me.The relationship between Bobby Garfield and Ted Brautigan in the first story is fascinating. The haunting way that Ted interacts with young Bobby, how he introduces Bobby to new books, and the interesting &quot;job&quot; that he gives him are all fabulously written. The first story is nearly half of the book, and for good reason. This book did not go over my head, as I first expected it to. With another of King's book (The Eyes of the Dragon), I would sometimes have to read a page twice to understand it and fully take it in. This book read easily and kept me involved the whole time.If you are already a fan of King's, make sure to pick this one up. And if you are not, I think this would be a great place to start. A journey into one of King's books may change how you look at literature. It has certainly opened my eyes."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"With the number of reviews that have been posted about this particular book by Mr. King, it is reasonable to question why anyone would write another. It has probably been two decades since I last read a book by Mr. King; even the title of the book escapes me. \\"Hearts In Atlantis\\", is the book that began once again my reading of his work, and I owe this to a movie trailer. Sir Anthony Hopkins has joined a distinguished group of actors and actresses that have participated in other films by Mr. King, and this will continue in this coming film. \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\", and, \\"The Green Mile\\", were two other films that I had no idea they were Mr. King's until I saw the credits.The main point I wish to make is for readers who may have once read this man's work and stopped, you should absolutely begin once again. And if you have never read his work he is an author that should be experienced.\\"Hearts In Atlantis\\", is a wonderful and disturbing read. Even while separated into distinct stories that could each stand alone, when combined they create a major work by an exceptional storyteller. Until the events I mentioned, all of my reading quite some time ago placed this writer's work in the category of horror. The two films I mention, and this book again are about terrible acts that can be committed by people, however they are as far from a horror genre novel as can be. This is a book that deals with the damage that continues well after The Vietnam War is complete. This may sound like a topic that has been written about ad nauseum. The same could be said about a man wrongfully imprisoned, however, \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\", is as original as any other writing or film on the topic. I believe it can stand with any other book/film of the genre. The same is true of this work.Mr. King is a prodigious creator of books, and I cannot begin to say I have read even a large fraction of what he has written. I can say it was an error that I ever stopped, and it will take time to catch up on what I have missed. Mr. King has been noted as one of the finer writers of the 20th Century, I never understood why, happily now I do."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Just when you think you have Stephen King figured out, he surprises you again!! The characters who inhabit the places and times of this book are richly limned and lovingly detailed. Mr. King has done them the justice that only someone the calibre of a Harper Lee or a Carson McCullers can do..in that he captures them in prose that is achingly reminiscent of these two authors..He has proven himself truly a master..as far as I am concerned, this is his magnum opus..."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I must admit I began with Carrie, not unlike anyone my age, and realized that movies basically do nothing much for King's style of writing or the images he leaves you open to place in your mind. To say that the audiobook version of this long, five-part story didn't blow me away would me a total understatement.People have always told me I'm crazy to like Stephen King because \\"he's so SCAAAAARY!\\" I've always known what a fabulous technique he has for dealing with human nature given unusual circustances or in general, and his sense of humor is always off the charts in his most dire of literary works. This, however, with my obvious love of all things 60s, has captivated me, and drawn me in like few other books I have enjoyed in the last 10 years.What a gorgeous and heartfelt ode to such an important decade in our nation's history. King brings it home, surrounding the characters of Bobby Garfield and Carol Gerber, in a way that endears you to each and every character. He takes you to the next best thing of a time machine and trasports you back into a place and era that makes your heart bleed and your soul fill with a profound sense of spiritual longing. They didn't accomplish what they wanted to, but the youth of the 60s' romanticisms sweep you up in a way that only King can provide with his wisdom of human folly. The loss of innocence is what this book is essentially about, and the humor and soulfulness that embellish it make it that much more of a treasure.I love this book, have rented the audio version 5 times, and would recommend it to anyone who loves the 60s or wants to know that Stephen King is not just the master of horror, but also the master of the heart. He is a walking encyclopedia, and he also understands people better than the \\"oh-he-scares-me\\" crowd can relate to, simply because they're scared to read his books. I always recommend this one. Sometimes crude, always entertaining and full of more life than most people experience, Hearts in Atlantis is a winner from cover to cover. Don't let it pass you by. I'm having a love affair with it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I am, what King would consider a \\"constant reader.\\" I have read almost everything the man has ever written and I love all of his work. He is gifted and talented. Atlantis is a book that was not written for my generation, it was written for my parents. I'm a child born out of the very early 80's... this book was written for my mother's generation, for King's generation. I don't feel like I wasted my time reading it, King is never a waste of time, but I wouldn't read it again."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This was my first Stephen King other than On Writing. I'm not a fan of horror--there is enough awful stuff in the world without making it up--but I heard this wasn't. It was weird in places, but more like brilliantly-written speculative fiction. The real story isn't the supernatural, but the lives of the Viet Nam generation--my generation--and how the years between the deaths of John Kennedy and John Lennon affected us.We lost our way in free love and drugs. We went from the idealism of longing for something more than what we saw as the trite suburbanism of our parents to something very similar and far more empty. After all, our parents had found meaning in surviving the Great Depression and fighting the Nazis. They are what Tom Brokaw calls \\"The Greatest Generation.\\" And us? We rejected God and tried to \\"do our own thing\\" and so rejected what would have given meaning to the experiences that history threw at us. And after all our counter-culture talk and revolutionary acts we ended up buried in cell phones, microwave ovens and garden ornaments. (King's symbolism is obvious, but effective.)There are those of my generation who didn't fry their brains on drugs or throw away their bodies and souls, jumping from bed to bed. I have met them all over the world, building hospitals in Ethiopia, teaching school in Pakistan, distributing used clothing to the destitute in Mozambique and funding micro-industries in Indonesia. It is not as flashy as spray-painting peace signs on the side of college dorms or throwing rocks at Chicago cops, but in the end it is far more effective. They do it, not for the Age of Aquarius or for King's lost Atlantis, but for the Kingdom of God.Hearts in Atlantis is well worth the read, but I'm glad it isn't all there is."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is the same edition sold on Audible, read by William Hurt and Stephen King. As a reader, King does not act very much, but I found his reading drew out tremendous depth from this text, a book that was obviously rooted in his own experience and beliefs. His reading routinely brings out nuances that escaped me on reading the book.The real surprise is William Hurt. At first I found his delivery odd, filled with mid-sentence pauses and intonations that seemed distracting. As the book progressed, however, I was mesmerized by the manner in which he found precisely the right word to emphasize so as to heighten the tension of each scene. The moments of joy were more joyous, those of simplicity sounded as fresh as morning dew, and in the moments of bitterness and betrayal, Hurt's rendition made the passages almost unendurably painful and wrenching. All without the usual vocal trickery of accents, shifts in volume, changes in vocal tone. Simply a terrific actor knowing how to interpret a text as a text. I hope he reads many more books."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book is fantastic. Just enough fantasy. Best thing is, the story of these kids' lives would be just as great without the fantasy, but adding it in just made it better. Absolutely one of the best S.K. books i've ever read, and i've read them all. The movie just doesn't do the book justice at all."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"William Hurt gives one of the best audio book readings I've ever listened to, and I've listened to scores of them. And the parts that King himself reads are also great, not so well done as the actor who reads, but for a novelist, he holds his own as a reader/performer. And it is just so cool to have the legendary master storyteller speaking into your ear, I admit, I idolize this guy, and it is really fine that he has spent the time to read his own story to us. I'm sure he didn't do it for the money."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis is the first and only Stephen King book I've read. The Product Description had it right when it called this book REMARKABLE, for remarkable it surely is. What particularly grabbed me about this book was the writing style. Since I'd never read a King book before, I was both surprised and confused (in a good way) when I started reading it. The prose is witty, clever, and insightful, characterization is dynamic and complete, and in each of the five stories that this book comprises, there's a common air of mystery and suspense that from what I've heard is what Stephen King's books are all about. My least favorite of the stories is the one entitled BLIND WILLIE, mostly because I don't understand it. In my opinion, you could get a lot out of the book and still comprehensively understand it's messages without even reading BLIND WILLIE. If I ever read the book again, I'll probably end up skipping it entirely.The main theme of the book, of course, is how the 60s and Vietnam have changed the course of American history, as well as the lives of individuals. Since I began the book knowing virtually nothing about the Vietnam War and about the 60s, only a bit of fashion and music, Hearts in Atlantis was a real eye-opener for me. A lot of it went over my head completely, but I learned from it. I appreciate the metaphors and the character's reflections on their experiences; the moral and historical lessons alike. I don't regret reading the book at all, I only wish I had been a little less oblivious about some things beforehand. I recommend this book only to people who know about the war in Vietnam: I think if I had I would've enjoyed it more. Adults who grew up in the 60s would find this book especially... thought provoking.I look forward to discovering more Stephen King in the future. He has a very unique way of describing events and depicting personas, and it's not at all cynical, at least not in this particular book, because you can always find a shadow of hope somewhere, no matter how often things go wrong."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"A strangely disjointed collection of novellas where the only connection between them is one character name (the characters themselves seem to have scant relation).I'd recommend borrowing the book from a library and see if you like it first. The first two novellas are terrific. The whole collection will be enjoyable for King fans, obviously, but the first and longest one is the one i'd recommend anyone to borrow the book to check out.The movie adaptation which took the name of this collection is actually based on this story, which is called \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats.\\" It is the second story, my favourite, set in King's university days, which is called \\"Hearts in Atlantis.\\"The first novella is most satisfying as a cohesive work. The others do feel a little tacked on, i'm afraid. Not a satisfying work as a whole."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I must admitt, I thought this book would of been great with a perfect ending after 300 or so pages of this book, basically, just part one of this book. Part one of this book deserves five stars!!! It ended pretty well with some questions in mind but I felt that ending was left up to the readers imagination!! Why did Mr. King continued with the rest fo the book??? I understand there were parts in the important later on but I could of cared less!! It just dragged and dragged and dragged. Honestly, I didn't cared for this book at all as a whole. This is my first Stephen King novel but I been recommended to read some of his previous greats, which, I will some day. But for now, if you never read any Stephen King novels I wouldn't recommended this book. Please try something else!!!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"First, I had been steering clear of King's work. His basic novels had no real call to me, no urge grew in my belly to compel me to read his words. A friend, who was burning through King's \\"Dark Tower\\" series, suggested I pick up this book. I had just finished \\"Slaughter House Five\\" and needed to keep my reading frenzy alive. Now, I have finished \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" and am in search of other titles by King. It sparked the question of what does come out of all the tie-ins to the \\"Dark Tower\\"? I am finally on that quest. \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" was refreshing in this time of war, makes me wonder what the outcome of this one will be....."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book was so good, that I returned it to the library overdue by a week. (If you knew what a cheapskate I am, you would understand the significance of this.)King takes the reader back to Connecticut in 1960, and then transits us forward with a few stops on the way to present day. This is a set of multiple stories, all intertwined and working towards a singular conclusion. I like this method since its the best of both worlds - the variety of short stories with the overall storyline of a novel. This book is part science fiction - the beginning story, \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats,\\" is great, and calling it sci fi seems to be discrediting. The title story, Hearts in Atlantis, actually opens a window on the burgeoning peace movement of 1966. I found this story interesting when overlayed with the current war in Iraq. It reads a little like an explanation of why people joined the anti-war movement. The pro- and anti- Vietnam War characters are cariactures, however. (Like all artists, King is naturally biased against pro-war views, but he balances this with events that take place later in the story.)Strangely, the movie \\"Hearts in Atlantis,\\" is actually the story \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats.\\" The Hearts title, when paired with the second story, makes perfect sense, but I wonder how many movie-goers left wondering where the heck the title came from? Hearts, of course, refers to the card game that becomes the undoing of U of Maine freshmen. Atlantis represents the pre-Vietnam world, the Baby Boomer good life.I enjoyed listening to the audio version this book. William Hurt does the best job of any audiobook reader I've listened to yet. I guess there's no substitute for good acting (hello Ben Affleck?). Stephen King also does a great job reading. I can't help thinking that the title story, set at the University of Maine in 1966, is somehow autobiographical just in the way King reads the first-person narrative. This book uses music, which is unusual with the unabridged titles, and is fairly effective. The Platters song at the end will give you a great ending to a great book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is not a horror story. This is a story about human strengths and weaknesses, about love and loss. This is King as the dark side of Ray Bradbury.Some will be too old for this book. Others will be too young. I guess I am just the right age. I was a sergeant in the US Army during the 1960s, and I cried when I reached the end of this book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This review will be short and sweet: I loved this book. I loved this book so much that I refused to see the film adaptation with Anthony Hopkins out of love for the words and not to be betrayed by the screen. It is absolutely brilliant. I have been reading Stephen King since the 8th Grade with Salem's Lot and this is by far, the absolute best that he has written. I finished this and Bag of Bones back-to-back and I honestly believe King is writing the best he ever has. Beautiful. Poignant. When the boy received the flower petals in the mail, it nearly brought me to my knees. I was truly, truly sorry when I finished it. I just wanted it to go on and on."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Everything who has read King knows his writing is flowing and easy to read. This book is NOT a horror story! It is a great coming of age/relationship story of a young boy and an old guy. Actually, it is three stories in one book but they all relate to each other in the end. The Film which was made was based on the first story mainly. I liked it, read it in less than 3 days and also enjoyed the movie."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I hated Insomnia for the longest time. I had tried to get into it to no avail. Then I learned it tied into The Dark Tower series, and I fought tooth-and-nail to get through. Even though it took a huge amount of effort, I still fell in love with that book. I fell in love with Hearts in Atlantis for completely the opposite reason. To me, it was open and yielding; very easy to fall into, like a dream that you don't want to wake up from. I would probably go so far as to say that this is my favorite Stephen King book of all time. It finally puts to rest any doubts about his talent to write stories other than those about monsters (which are really, end the end, also stories about people). Low Men in Yellow Coats I liked the best for reasons I've already mentioned (*cough* ties-in with The Dark Tower series *cough*), as well as the way it was written -- making even the unbelievable seem believable concerning the low men, and showing strong parental bond that started to develop between Bobby and Ted. I would even go so far as to say Ted is probably my favorite character in any King novel. To me, he's reminiscent of my sixth-grade teacher who instilled in me a great love of literature and language, much like Ted does for Bobby in the story. Hearts in Atlantis (the titled story) tied with the rest in my opinion (it did also make me want to learn to play Hearts). I liked them all pretty much the same. All in all, this is my favorite tie-in book. I also like Black House, but not as much as this one. Words like &quot;complex,&quot; &quot;bittersweet,&quot; and &quot;haunting&quot; come to ming when I think about this book.This book definitely gets high marks from me. If any of you out there have always wanted to try some Stephen King, but weren't too big on his &quot;horror stuff&quot; I highly recommend this. I am aware he has written other non-horror stories (being a fan, I would know that), but I'll save those other reviews for another day."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Usually I enjoy Stephen King novels, thrilling, on the edge of your seat reads, some have made me think and come away with a differing thought or perspective than before. This book I had to force myself to read. It took 10 days, which says alot. The stories had some inter conncetion between them, a common point, though I am not sure I know what now. I could not keep up interest in this book. The stories almost seem to be recycled bits from previous stories. King is a stand out writer, one of the best we have today, and I still look forward to his next book. I just hope it is better than Hearts, though I think it would have to be."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Of all the Stephen King novels I have read-Dreamcatcher, Bag of Bones, The Shining, It, none of them have touched me more than Hearts in Atlantis. When I read it I laughed, I cried, and I could not get myself to put it down. It was, by far, the best Stephen King book I have read, and I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This was a super book - part stort stories, part horror, part slice-of-life. The movie they created from this missed 2/3 of the book so I don't recommend that."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I'll start this review out by dividing my audience into two distinct groups. Some of you--I can't say how many--are King fans because that you like slightly gory horror stories. You'll want to leave now. You probably won't enjoy this book, and you certainly won't enjoy my review, since I'm not one of that number and find it difficult to understand people who are.The rest of you, I'll assume, are here either as broader King fans or just as inquisitive potential readers, and for you folks I have good news. Hearts in Atlantis is inded a very good book, and one that you should pick up now. I've read the book once, been away from it for two years or so, and just recently I've come back to it and read it again, and I'm surprised at how different it is from much of the rest of what you'll find in the King library. One reviewer remarked that this is a collection of horror stories that didn't happen, and in that sense, he's correct--in every instance in which a character has a choice, in this book, he makes the sensible one.This will disappoint the aforementioned King fans who are just looking for their next slasher fix. There isn't one here. What IS here is a very effective character examination, and perhaps a little bit of rumination about the sixties in general. Truth be told, this is one of the few books about the sixties that I can stomach at all, mostly because King is willing to admit, both to himself and to the world, that all of the protests and conflicts weren't quite the complete ideological war that some still believe them to have been. The one quality that all of the characters in this book share is their reality--even the supernatural ones (few though there might be). What moves these people is not some kind of Buck Rogers motivation for the good of all--it's true, basic human desires. It's rare that you see a cast of characters so authentically portrayed, and I'm very glad to see that King managed to turn his unique storytelling style and voice (which I have always loved) toward an effort that at least approaches &quot;respectability&quot; (i.e. the characters are rounded and three-dimensional).Of course, if you want to hate this book, I'm sure you'll be able to. Try though he might, King seems unable to ditch his addiction to brand names, and I don't really think that's a bad thing. The first story is exceptionally long, and will seem extremely strange at points to anybody who's not familiar with the Dark Tower series. The epilogue seems somewhat tacked on and might have been better left off. The fourth story is also somewhat out of synch with the rest of the stories in tone, pacing, and plot composition. If you go in with the intent of latching onto these shortcomings, you won't enjoy this book. If you do not, however, you'll find a rich and immersive story relating a little bit of what it was like to live in the decade that continues to define the American psyche that you probably don't want to miss."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have been reading Stephen King's work for the better part of 17 years now. I have gotten used to the nightmares that this man has given me over the years. When I picked this book up, I didn't know what to expect. About 300 pages into it, I thought to myself, &quot;what is this [junk]0-- certainly not the SK I'm used to.&quot; But, like any devoted fan, I trudged on in hopes of better things to come. What I got was not horror, but one of the most moving works of fiction I have ever had the pleasure of coming across. Stephen King taught me that he doesnt have to scare us to entertain us. After I resigned myself to the fact that this wasnt a horror read, I let myself fall into the world of Bobby Garfield &amp; co. and began a 672 page-long friendship with these characters. The final story: &quot;Heavenly Shades Of Night Are Falling&quot; ties all 4 of the prior stories together and (in my humble opinion) is the story that got me the most emotionally. Ironically, I heard that very song a few hours after finishing the book and was almost literally choked up about it--lol. I heartily recommend this book. Kudos to Mr. King!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"When I first read Hearts in Atlantis I was deeply touched. It had - has - a way of getting under your skin, it both terrifies you and makes you wanna cry. Although it's not a horror novel, it is classical King. This novel and its author deserves high literary acclaim."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book is extremely good . . . but you might want to read the Dark Tower series first, so you understand more of the first part of the book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Like other reviewers,I really wanted to like this book,but was unable to do so.It is becoming apparent that Stephen King peaked somewhere around 1983,with only a few bright spots&quot;Misery,&quot;&quot;The Green Mile&quot;, since.I say this as someone who once waited eagerly for each new king book to come out.&quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; is king's attempt to come to terms with the 60's,and specifically,Vietnam,but I feel that he has failed.The stories were uninteresting,the characters unlikable,and if it hadn't been a Stephen King book,I doubt that I would have continued reading.I know that in the past King has mocked authors who take 5 years or more between books,but maybe it's time for him to take some time off,recharge his batteries,and come up with some stories worth telling.Go back and read &quot;Night Shift&quot; or &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;,and then tell me &quot;hearts in Atlantis&quot; is the best that King can do."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I love this man's mind: he has the best mind for fiction than anyone else I have ever read! (He's even better at fiction than Casey Anthony and Jodi Arias rolled into one!) This is one of his older books, but just excellent as 99% of all of his writing. (There is only one of his books I read I really didn't like - very unusual.)"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I had just read 11/23/62 and I was eager to read something like that. It started out a little spooky, then went serious."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Order many books from Amazon, and can't wait to read this one. I saw the movie and it was so good, I had to order the book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"While not the best king book, I wanted to read this because of its ties to the dark tower. This is a book that will need to stew. Perhaps in a couple weeks I may have more perspective but for now it will be king induced oddity to my dreams."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This novel is a few short stories set in 1960s Maine. Some of the characters appear throughout each of the stories, though at different ages, tying the stories loosely together. I loved it! Its been awhile since I've read a book i couldn't put down. Make sure you have lots of free time before starting this one."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have recently began collecting the books that also have movies out. I have both this book and the movie. This was an excellent movie and I now look forward to reading the book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"As an avid fan of King and an '80s baby who was formerly obsessed with the Beatles and the Sixties, I was eager to get his view on that important time as well as our most painful war. The excellence of his writing and his connection to other cultural tie-ins (I read Lord of the Flies right before this) helps me to understand what is must have been like to live in that time, which seems so far away (although I wasn't even alive then). I hate to sound pretentious, but I can really picture the Sixties he described as though I &quot;remember&quot; them (a past life?). One comment: I was disappointed after read Low Men in Yellow Coats (a true masterpiece) to read stories that slowly dwindled down. And why was Blind Willie so unconnected? Quite possibly because it appeared in Antaeus Magazine. However, Heavenly Shades of Night are Falling tied up the book in an excellent way. It is a modern classic which fits into a nice (albeit 525-page) package."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Who would have thought that after so many years of &quot;horror&quot; stories from Mr. King, he could reach into his soul and pull out this book. I have enjoyed his writing from the start and have read all of his books...some good, some not so good. Still, I have been reluctant to suggest his books to people because so often the horror genre is full of &quot;schlok&quot; value. In Hearts In Atlantis, King is moving more and more into solid liturature. He has been traveling in that direction over the last few years, with The Green Mile and Bag of Bones, but this is by far his most moving book yet. I love the way he used the short stories to give a feel for the time, introducing us to characters and then weaving them together over a period of almost 40 years. Stephen King is a treasure."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Like many of the reviewers,I am a huge SK fan. I belong to the SK library and eagerly await his newest book,but I have to admit that the last couple of stories he has put out don't have the throat grabbing suspense that all previous works had. Bag of Bones was ok,it had it's moments. The Girl who loved Tom Gordon was just very uninvolving and his latest,Hearts In Atlantis was just plain boring!! The only reason I gave it 2 stars was for title story. I at least got through that one quickly and it actually had some merit. Please Mr King,return to the kind of novels that made you who you are today. Give us something that will scare the hell out of us and keep us on the edge of our seats!!!!!!!!!!!! I look forward to your next Dark Tower book with great anticipation but as for your next novel,I'm just not too sure anymore."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I've never read Stephen King before (stop laughing now) I've never been into the horror genre. I stick to stuff like The Testament or The Triumph and Glory, sometimes even an Oprah book if I'm in the mood for a change of pace. But as a Vietnam veteran I had to see how this fellow handled the era. Low Men In Yellow Coats was chilling, I was mesmerized. The title story was just average, but it did bring to harsh reality what many of us experienced--the surreal experience of going from college hijinks and nonsense to 365 days of life or death hell 10,000 miles from home. I am a new Stephen King fan because of Low Men."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is an addendum to my previous review. When Ted gave Bobby &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; to read, I realized how much of an impact it would have on a young mind. I remember reading it when I was 16. I am now 53 and can still recall almost every event that took place. King probably read it at an early age too. Low men in yellow coats...where does he come up with these ideas. I love them. There have been King books that made me wince and forced me to put them aside for days at a time until I had the nerve to pick them up again. But this one, it is a charmer. Fully fleshed-out characters that took me back to my college years. Don't look for horror in this one. Being a middle school teacher, I could totally understand the caring side of young people as well as the brutal side as depicted in the first story. King is a master at portraying both. Read it and weep! I did."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book made me wish I hadn't already read all of SK's books so I could start from the beginning and read them all for the first time. The only thing I want to read after a SK book is another SK book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have read a lot of Stephen King's books and this is one of the few that did not have an obvious ending. It was more of a trip back to the sixties and for those who were a part of it could be quite disturbing. It touched on alot of different aspects of growing up and living during one of this countries most volatile periods. Although it covers both sides of the war issue, a lot more of the veteran's insights were dealt with. Who were the real victims? One thing I really disliked was the implication that almost every Viet-Nam vet ended an extremely disturbed individual. It also had a touch of supernatural (would it be King without it?). It reminded me a lot of Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five -Life just keeps going on- can you really change anything? A book you'll keep thinking back to after you've finished it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"&quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; is a must read for Stephen King fans, but it is also a book which will make fans out of those who have been hesitant to pick-up a King book for fear it will be filled with horror. If you haven't read King before - please give &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; a try. This book is magnificantly written and intellectually challenging and is not a horror story, unless you consider the Vietnam War a story of horror. The stories will leave the reader thinking about the plots and how &amp; why they intertwine for a long, long time. I found myself returning to the previous stories as the book moved along. It is worthy of a second read. Cleverly King brings into this book some of the plot line from the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series - will the intricate plot(s) from &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; appear in future stories?"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The book is superb. The ending is magnificent. King's last paragraph ranks right up there as one of the most powerful endings in literature. Yes, literature; because Hearts in Atlantis is a beautiful, literary book. We have all known King could capture us with his narrative and make memorable characters, but this transcends all that. I actually re-read the last page five times just so I wouldn't have to close the book. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is a collection of five Vietnam-haunted small-town New England stories that are woven together. The title seems to fit well, as King shows the reader the lost, time-sunken continent of Eisenhower era. King has a wonderful way of finding the simplest of phrases that invoke childhood memories in those of us who lived through this era.The first story is the spookiest. It is about 11 year old Bobby Garfield, who lives with his widowed and embittered mother. A boarder, Ted Brautigan, who lives on the third floor of Bobby's house, introduces him to the joys of great books life Lord of the Flies. But Ted is not what he seems. He is hunted by &quot;Low Men in Yellow Jackets&quot;, who are right out of King's Dark Tower series. Ted can also read minds and turn into &quot;other worlds.&quot; King makes his characters real by mixing the familiar with the make-believe. This is by far the creepiest of the five stories.The others: &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Blind Willie&quot;, &quot;Why We're in Vietnam&quot; and &quot;Heavenly Shades of Night are Falling&quot; all tie into the lead story as Bobby returns to his boyhood home. A must read for any die-hard King fan. Different, but well worth the read."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis is about the story of three best friends and how they started their lives and how their lives really turned out.Hearts in Atlantis is a book that teaches you some of lifes greatest lessons. In it you will learn that you should find out who you really are and not be afraid of it. Find out why life shouldn't be wasted and that you should stand up for what you believe in.Hearts in Atlantis is a pretty good story, not one of Stephen Kings best, but still pretty good. If you have the time you should look into reading, but it isn't a must read book. Also, if you are afended easily by either swearing or sexual things then this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King has definitely moved from mainstream horror he was famously known for. This trend must have started off with Bag of Bones and ever since then, King has been delving deeper into the literary aspect of writing. It may seem incredulous to think of him as the modern day Charles Dickens, but I won't be surprised to see his work being studied in a century or so from now.In his novel, which is more of an anthology of 5 stories (the first two of novella length) span the time period of nearly 40 years. All the major characters in each story have a mention in the next, but one thing remains constant, the Vietnam War.The first novella, \\"Long Men in Yellow Coats\\" has got to be the best of all the five stories. Same novella in which the movie \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" was based on. In it, King depicts the ramblings of aten year olds perfectly. The only person able to do such a thing in modern times would have to be director Steven Spielberg. The story has a lot of drama between the characters and it's just peppered with a mist of mystery that is vintage King. His descriptions of the sipernatural character and their cars are downright eery. You couls swear that you can see what he tells you in your mind's eye. The display of the right amount of ingredients truly shows that the author is a master of such story telling. Perhaps the highlight of the novella happens when you read how The main character Ted Brautigan is related to King's sci-fi series, the Dark Tower. Excellent display. Excellent approach. Suredly to send shivers down people's spine.The other remaining 4 stories revolve around the same charcaters as the first, but takes into the theme of how each other's lives have been altered by the Vietnam War. Even in the last story set in 1999, the theme is just as strong as ever. Though the connection is intact, the integrity of teh story is just not there anymore. With an excellent beginning, King's writing and the way the novel is going just seems to frizzle.All in all a good book with a good beginning and dealing with an adult theme at the same time. Not as great as some of his other works, Bag of Bones being my own personal fave, but at least you get introduced to a major character in upcoming Dark Tower stories."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I won't go into any more detail about the novel's plot here. The above synopsis does that quite well as do many of the reviews posted here. I will say, however, that this audiobook is one of the best I've ever heard.I read HIA when it first came out and fell in love with the story. Bobby Garfield and Ted Brautigan are two of my favorite King characters. Not having the time to re-read this great novel, I decided to compromise and picked up the audio version. Wonderful! I enjoyed King's narration because he sort of seems like an old friend now. But Hurt's narration is award-winning. He adds such wonderful vocal elements to the characters depending on the situation. I was totally mesmerized by his rendition of these words. I'm so happy that I took a chance on these tapes, and this experience leaves me wanting more of these audiobooks.Although the novel brings in elements from King's Dark Tower series, you don't have to be familiar with those stories to follow HIA. This is a stand-alone novel that pieces together four different stories told over time. I think anyone who likes good story-telling with imaginative prose and well-developed characters will appreciate this book. &quot;Heavenly shades of night are falling, it's twilight time...&quot;"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"All I can say (again) is don't see the movie!! The book was great. It was amazing how all of the stories finally came together. The movie takes only one of the stories &amp; then leaves you hanging--completely! Don't even bother. Read the book"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Yes, I am from that &quot;flower power&quot; era, &amp; I have been reading King since &quot;Carrie.&quot; His writing has grown as I have over the years. This book is my favorite--so far. I haven't liked many movie versions of King's books, but I do like Anthony Hopkins, so that's why I went to see the movie. It was excellent, so I took out the audiobook from the public library, &amp; it was EVEN BETTER. I suppose it's that old nostalgia creeping up on me, but it made me cry more than once. Reminiscent of &quot;Stand By Me,&quot; which I also thoroughly enjoyed. I thought William Hurt was an odd match (as the reader), but he really grew on me after awhile. (Incidentally, authors should always hire professional readers to record their books. I personally do not care for Stephen King's voice; it detracts from my enjoyment of the story.) The other segments, about the card game in college etc, interested me only to the extent that they related to the first story. Also, I wonder how accurate was the depiction of the Viet Nam war. I've known more than a few vets, &amp; perhaps King's was a little too stereotyped... Anyway, this book made me want to read more about Ted, Bobby, the Low Men, et al."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"King's work expertly ties in several different characters to tell the story of the Vietnam War. He launches the story from a single childhood experience and uses that to explode the story. I loved it because wasn't really the story of how the characters handled the war but also how they affected the people that surrounded them. Not having lived during the Vietnam War, I can only imagine that the fury of the protests spread much like the realtionship of Carol and Pete in their college years. I really loved how the story line was about the Vietnam war, because it didn't chronicle a specific history, instead it follows the the effect it had on those that lived during the time."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"(...)If you're not afraid to read a novel out of the ordinary, then Hearts in Atlantis may be the book for you. Following Stephen King's abnormal recipe, this book is definitely different from any other I've ever read. At first glance, the title implies some sort of strange romance. However, the title is deceiving.This book is separated into stories which have familiar characters from different eras, and shifts the points of view. The setting of the first story starts off in a small town in the early sixties with the main character, Bobby, who is an eleven-year-old boy who lives with his mom, Liz, in an apartment. His only friends are Sully and Carol, who grew up in the same neighborhood, and Ted, a strange old man who lives on the floor above Bobby. Sully is the typical athlete friend to Bobby, and Carol is Bobby's potential love interest. When Ted moves in upstairs, Bobby takes immediate interest in him, and soon he finds out that Ted has an extraordinary background that changes their friendship forever, and endangers both of them. The following stories detail the life of a college student turned card playing addict, a schizophrenic con-man who was a childhood \\"friend\\" with Carol, Sully after Vietnam, and the friends coming together thirty years later, respectively.King did a superb job with realistic details from each of the eras he used, and deep, emotional attachment to the out of this world (some literally) characters. He used quotes from Lord of the Flies (\\"A stick sharpened at both ends\\") and other sixties-era books and movies. Also, King made sure that there was not one hurdle for the protagonist to jump, but a separate conflict for each protagonist he makes, all of which link together. I really enjoyed this book, but it may not be for everyone. The book is somewhat long because of its multiple-story attribute, and is a bit graphic, especially when the main characters are in college. There is a lot of language, and a bit of violence and sex, but its not used too gratuitously. There is no real genre for this book, as it has so many elements from fantasy, science fiction, fiction, and historical fiction. I would recommend this to anyone that's a fan of strange fiction novels or fans of Stephen King."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I liked this book. No, I loved this book. It did human nature justice, and for that, I applaud Stephen King. Life does not always end in closure for those of us here on earth, so whyshould every book end leaving you feeling calm and complete? If life didn't seem to go the way you want it to, you can't just hang it up and go to bed. Things will leave us puzzled and baffled for years to come. Hearts In Atlantis essentially takes the reality of life and slaps it in your face. The truths and bad-natured flaws shown in each situation; Bobby with his pent-up anger and spiteful vengeance, and Peter with his motivational weakness as well as his natural sadistic yet incredibly accurate response to Rip-Rip's misfortune, all reflect the reality displayed in King's writing. Hearts In Atlantis is truly a work of art and I highly recommend it to any reader who's looking for perspective."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The first story about Bobby and Ted is the most fulfilling. The characters and situations are compelling, but its supernatural elements are vague and never explained, and then the story simply ends. The rest of the book is forgettable, and only tenuously tied into the first story. I kept wanting the book to come back around to Bobby and Ted, to understand the mystery hinted at in the first section, and some satisfactory closure. At the very end, Bobby does resurface but it's far too little (still no resolution to the mystery) and far too late."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I listened to this collection of Novelettes by Stephen King in the audio format. William Hurt is not one of my favorite readers but his droning voice suited the stories he narrated. King's voice is more pleasant than Hurt's to listen to (a TOTALLY scary thought) but...My biggest complaint about most recent King offerings is &quot;Where's the Horror?&quot; While I am a product of the &quot;Vietnam&quot; generation (and the war was a Horror in and of itself), I don't find it (the war) to be the cause of my own personal problems. It is simply a fact of my life. The &quot;Magic&quot; element within the story makes it slightly more interesting than it would have been without it, but that slight bit of magic doesn't really &quot;save&quot; the story. All-in-All, I was satisfied with the story, just disappointed that it was written by Stephen King and not some lesser author."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have bought 4 copies of this book because i reread it at least once a year and have worn them out, one copy I lent to somebody and never got it back. As a collection of stories that flow together as a novel they allow you to get lost in the pages the way a good book is supposed to."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is an excellent story that takes place over about 40 years. It's a lot better than the movie (some parts in the movie are different, too, so it's not predictable). You are able to see inside the characters heads and feel the psychological horror that some endure. But, parents beware! This is not a kid friendly book like the movie was. About 1/3 into this the profanity starts up and by the end there's hundreds of F-bombs. If there was a Kindle Kids Edition that would flag certain words and replace them with gibberish, this may be ok for kids. But the content is PG-13.I wanted to read this after seeing the movie because the movie raised unanswered questions that the book did a good job in bringing to fruition. Stephen King is a great writer and I look forward to reading more of his works. I would recommend this to adults."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The beginning of the opening story, \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" led me to believe that King was not only readable, but an extraodinary writer. I read the cluster of his titles that came out around the late 90s first: Hearts in Atlantis, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, Bag of Bones, and Dreamcatcher--and except for the latter, these remain my favorite King titles."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"For me this is one of Stephen King's best works, and this includes classics like The Stand and the Dark Tower series. The shorter format of the novella makes the characterization and storyline much more powerful and a great introduction to the writing of King.I also love the characters and this is one of the few stories I have read where the main character is so flawed yet so incredibly lovable. Very realistic and very well written. This is a story that has stayed with me for years and influenced the way I look at other stories and even to some extent my own life.Very good, couldn't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"It's a bit unnerving when after reading an epic, heartfelt third-person short story about a man who has some psychic powers befriending a boy with a pretty harsh life called\\" Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" switches into a first-person novel about a bunch of frat, college drinking guys addicted to a card game called hearts, in which the title is what the novel is called; and then \\"Blind Willie\\", a short story about a man who pretends to be blind; and then, not going to lie, the other stories . . . you just don't care for them because it becomes way too preachy about anti-war (so preachy that my girlfriend's semi-hippy mom didn't even like this novel) and King loses touch with his reader because they're still reading because of how incredibly great \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" was; because that novel was about good story telling, not a political agenda--and once you get to the end of the novel, you feel like it was one incredibly long, strung out, running sentence, like this review is so far, saying: \\"war is bad, free love, war is bad, free love, war is bad--\\" and then King throws in a domestic terrorist who is likely Randal Flagg toward the end of the novel not to keep the readers interest, but rather just a payoff.*Takes in a deep breath*I recommend stopping after \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" unless you're into politics that leans more toward the left. In fact, \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" is what this review should be about. I already briefly mentioned the synopsis in the really long run-on sentence above, and that's as much as I need to say. What are the Low Men, you may ask? Well, I won't tell you. This is a very good short story (though it's not necessarily short) that ties into The Dark Tower, and this short story is much better than The Dark Tower V, VI, and VII.Either way, if you're a King fan or not, a Dark Tower fan or not, you'll like \\"Low Men...\\" but I can't be certain about the other stories."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"HI Friends,I have read many of the reviews here. First, some say that is a book of 5 short stories that may be read independently. I don't find this to be true of this book. If it was a book of short stories, first, it would have a table of contents listing them.I saw it as a novel. Yes, there where various themes explored throughout 5 different, chapters, I guess you could say. But I feel that the \\"stories\\" read independently would have made no sense.I was an avid fan of Stephen King while in college, and now I am in my mid 50s, and have not been as into him in years past, although i have always found him to be a brilliant writer, not only in his writing but in his brilliant insights about human nature.this book is fantastic. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"this is my favorite stephen king book. i could relate to each of the five stories, that's probably why i like it so much. it deals with polarizing topics like politics, so i guess this book isn't for everyone."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis is the second King I've read. It possesses an odd dose of Sci-Fi in a series of 5 stories that lead up to and look back on the 60s, Vietnam factoring huge in 3 and 4. The characterizations of people in all are fantastic. The first two stories are brilliant. King starts with an outlandish premise that succeeds against all odds. It's a wonderfully human story about a sucky mother who has a terrific son, childhood relationships and another dimension - go figure - and has the largest dose of Sci-Fi. In fact, there is no more Sci-Fi until the very end of story 4.The second story follows to college the girl of three childhood friends (Bobby, Sully-John and Carol) from story 1. It's about college relationships and has phenomenal scenes of students possessed by a card game called Hearts. Really terrific.The third is about a man whose bizarrly lucrative adult life is constructed around the reverberations of Vietnam and a cowardly vicious childhood act depicted in story 1.The fourth picks up the life of Sully-John, now in his 50s.Story 5 picks up the life of Bobby, the wonderful boy with the sucky mother from story 1. I was so happy to see this wonderful boy again that I was disappointed by the story, which was sappy, predictable and a cop out. It was a necessary glue, however."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I must confess that I had seen the film before reading the book. Not a good thing, specially when few films have honored Stephen King's works.This was no exception. HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is one of the best books I've read, not only because it is briliantly written, but because each part of the story is packed with feelings, experiences and a sense of \\"generational awareness\\". Every character is shown in its full dimension and there is no way you can put a distance between the character and yourself, no matter how alien his behaviour might have been.I was not able to put down and at the end I was filled with a feeling of \\"nolstalgia\\" hard to explain. I'm not a \\"Nam vet\\", didn't even live in the US at the time. nevertheless, King was able to draw me back and make me live the experience.The film, now I see, is only a very good introduction to something much bigger, deeper and compeling.Thank you, Mr. King, for writting the way you do."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I read the first half of this book in a collection of Stephen King stories i found at the grocery store.As soon as i began reading \\"Heart's in Atlantis\\", i couldn't put it down... i read it in about 2 days time.Some parts were so intriguing to me that i just HAD to have more... so i bought the GUNSLINGER (the original edition)...since then i was hooked on the Dark Tower series. Completey nerded out on it.I have since finished the 7 Dark Tower books, and currently read the marvel comics series. All thanks to Hearts in Atlantis... a really good book.bewm."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have always been wary of reading Stephen King. In the past I've been very selective in what I choose to read by him: THe Stand, IT, Green Mile serial...then the Gunslinger series.The Gunslinger series is what really hooked me in. When I found out that other books were &quot;related&quot; to the Dark Tower, I dove right in to Kings books.This one, Hearts in Atlantis is fantastic. Each story is unique in its own way. By the last story, Heavenly shades of Light are Falling, I could not tear myself away from the book. Very moving.Now I am addicted to Kings writing. Currently reading The Talisman and not long ago finished Insomnia (which is also VERY good)"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I'm normally not a King fan, except for The Stand, but Hearts in Atlantis is great. I started it on a Saturday and contemplated calling in sick to work on Monday to finish it!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis is an offbeat novel by King. In this novel King skilfully weaves a childhood story about Bobby and his group of friends, living in the 60s. Bobby befriends Ted an elderly man who introduces him to serious novels such as Lord of the Flies. Ted apparently is a Breaker - a character from the Dark Tower series. His telephatic powers can be transferred temporarily to another person and it happended to Bobby on a few occasions. During one such occasion, Bobby glimpsed into his mother's humiliating rape by her boss.The next chapter tracks Bobby childhood sweetheart's passage through college. In this chapter, Carol was not the primary character. Her boyfriend was the main character and it intensely described his addiction to the card game Heart's and how his college eductaion was almost forsaken because of it. This chapter tugged my heartstrings because I was addicted to Hearts when I was in college too.The other 2 chapters spins on to describe Bobby's other childhood acquiantances and how they are affected by the Vietnam war. One became a successful schizophrenic beggar and the other living with the ghost of a Vietnam village massacre.At the end of the story Bobby and Carol were briefly reunited, with Bobby's baseball glove turning up as a reminder of their past.It was a beautiful story which I thought could be improved without requiring the addition of characters from the Dark Towers. This proved to be a distraction to an otherwise offbeat but masterful King novel."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book is a wonderful look at being a child and growing up as well as the things we remeber from being young and the effect childhood events have on us. The great writing makes the reader feel as if they're in the story and the plot, while challenging, is an original and unigue story. With enough of King's usual creepiness to satisfy any King fan this book brings out another side of his writing and shows alot about King himself. Anyone who loves Stephen King has to read this book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book is hard...and i'll tell you why: it asks the reader to look inwardly--at us, at the human being--and to look at how cruel, how disturbing we can be; and boy do both gloves fit snug. I might have enjoyed The Stand more, but i know that not even that masterpiece was written with as much grace and honesty, and i guess that that is where Hearts shines. It is an American classic in the same class as Roth's American Pastoral, and Melville's Moby Dick, and Kerouack's On the Road, and Gatsby, and the Sun Also Rises, and Huck Finn. Good for you Stephen.This book is divided into 5 loosely related tales that circle in on each other. And they are sad, and they are warm, and they are beautiful; like a child who has just discovered that his first crush is only that...and during that moment that child becomes enlightened, dissapointed, a little bit older than he just was--beautiful. And no-one brings out these humanistic characteristics better than Mr. King. He seems to know us frighteningly well...and it is in his discription of humanity--of its conflict with its natural state--that terrifies us the most, because the monsters dissapear after the book covers are closed, but the human heart is the human heart, no matter the gender and no matter the color of skin. I know this review is general and vague, but i think it will make sence if you read this book...so please, read this book; tell your friends to read this book, and remember it; i think it has much to offer."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book is hard...and i'll tell you why: it asks the reader to look at inwardly--at us, at the human being--and look at how cruel, at how disturbing we can be; and boy do both gloves fit snug.

However, after reading Hearts in Atlantis it will dawn on you why he can hold your interest through 1,000+ pages of &quot;It&quot; and the &quot;Stand&quot;. It's not his premise, but how he can breathe life into the characters that he writes and make them relatable to the reader. There is a supernatural element in this but it is not the main focus of the book, which may be off putting to some fans. I found the second part of the book absolutely enthralling and it's about a bunch of college guys playing Hearts. Man, will it take you back, even if you went to college five years ago.I was not expecting to like this one, I got this as a gift and havent been much of a fan after the Dark Half. Different Seasons and the Green Mile are the closest comparisons that I can think as to the tone and mood of this story. Very introspective. My only wish is that the author give his bullies from grade school a rest. He has put them through the ringer and it's time to move on. I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading it again in a few years."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I'm baffled by the reviewers who rated this book highly, it makes me wonder if we read the same book.This book is a collection of stories, that loosely tie together, but not in any overall plot system. In fact, none of the stories particularly has a &quot;plot&quot; as youd typically define it.When I approached the end of the book, I developed a sickening feeling as I realized there were too few pages left for the book to develop anything of interest for the end. The book fizzed out with no climax, but then there had never been any build up of anything TO climax, so that wasn't very surprising.Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Deeper and more involved than the film--a great read even if you saw the film already---"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis is definitly not King at his best.

Learn how you should stand up for what you believe in and that life shound't be wasted doing things you may regret later in your life.If you don't read this I don't blame you. The first couple of sections were pretty well done, but through the rest of the book I had to force myself to finish."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Far from having lost it, King continually changes, pushes his boundaries, finds new directions to take his insight into the American character and the wonder and horror of childhood.This is a wonderful book, evocative and rich-textured. The first &quot;chapter&quot; of this loosely constructed novel, &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats,&quot; resonates with the paranoia of the fifties. The rest evoke the restlessness and disllusionment of the subsequent 60s, 70s, and 80s.If you're looking for a good Holiday read, or a stocking stuffer for someone, look no further than this book. If other King books haven't been to your liking, check this one out."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"One of King's most mature outings, this book worked for me on several levels. As usual King's prose style was superb, and his grasp of story is excellent. But the best part of the book for me was the chords it struck in reminding me about the era. As a teacher, the most telling comment for me was when we see professor's thinking twice about giving failing grades because they realize for the boys it might well mean a trip to vietnam. Lots of nostalgia today focuses on the obvious elements of the times, but this book brings back the realities, as they were lived by the youth of the day."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis is one of the best Stephen King books I have read, and I have read almost all of them!!! I could barely put the book down, and constantly stayed up until all hours of the morning until I had completely devoured the book. I can't wait to read it again...something I rarely ever do!!! It really brought the 60s alive for me, considering I am a child of the 80s and 90s. I reccommend it to EVERYONE!!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Let me start by declaring that I am not an unconditional Stephen King fan. The 'horror' genre leaves me cold, and it's only when King ventures into more mainstream themes that I enjoy his work. I enjoyed Atlantis immensely.These boomers coming of age in the twilight zone of Vietnam, and living out their inevitable tragic final chapters of that generation are satisfying and fully formed. Their frailties as engaging as their strengths. None of these stories stays in the world of the surreal or what passes for the real world for long. The transition is so seamless that the reader isn't certain where it lies. That is when I love King -- when he blurs that jagged edge of reality!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Bravo to Stephen King who once again re-creates literature. Never one to stick to a rigid formula of presentation, he artfully produces his novels with brilliant creativity. The man blends the real and imaginary into stories that are unique and on the edge. For this alone, he deserves recognition.Hearts in Atlantis is an interwoven tale that will touch your heart if you let it. For those of the nay-sayers, I respect your opinions, but feel you are missing out on some incredible reads. I am saying this as one being very new on the SK band wagon...I started with one novel and was led to another, then another. I caught the rhythm and was intrigued by references to his past stories.Ever alert to new and old material, I adore how King links honored literature and movies within the story content, provoking my re-interest in books I read in high school and all the books and movies that slipped by me over the years since. I feel as if he personally offers me his favorites; a true gift of sorts for the impassioned reader and lover of old movies.Hearts in Atlantis weaves a collection of stories which connect to each other through a selection of characters that, of course, touch your heart, but never allows you the luxury of surmising the outcome. A boy's childhood (Bobby) is revealed , along with the growing pains of adolescence and the heartbreak of being a son without a father . Elegantly portrayed, a lodger named Ted becomes a substitute male figure for this love starved youth. Ted has some secrets of his own, and makes Bobby aware of his fears that he is being stalked by some shady characters. Just as a child's imagination runs wild, the reality of Ted is in fact the truth. He reluctantly takes Bobby into his confidence, and Bobby discovers that life is not as simple as a baseball game.The book revolves around a key set of friends that grow up together. It blends them into a broader representation of what life was like for the generation immediately affected by the war in Viet Nam. In the course of the story past characters and story lines are intelligently interjected, beckoning one to know more, yet satisfied with the story before you.And so, I was introduced to past story lines (Dark Towers) represented in a selection of novels Mr. King has written. Even though I was unfamiliar with them, I was compelled to read them, anxious to know more and to quench the thirst that seems to arise when I read his novels. That I did not know of them made no difference to me in regards to this experience of reading_ Hearts in Atalantis _for the story was delivered well regardless.Simply said, that is the job Mr. King does.

I must say out of all his books this is not his best however in the top 10.This book did kept me enthralled to the end.

I was a little disappointed in the ending... but it didn't stop me from being moved and pleased with the work he had done."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Without a doubt Hearts in Atlantis is the best Stephen King Novel yet. The characters in the first two stories, Low Men in Yellow Coats and the Title Story - Hearts in Atlantis, are characters everyone can indentify with in some way.

This book is fantastic I loved it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Just when you think there's nothing distinctively different, and diverse coming from Mr. King, here comes Hearts In Atlantis.

Hope he keeps writing like this, in this style."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book shows a whole new level of King. His stories flow together so well, and King has proven that he can tackle the task of writing about romance just as well as writing about horror. Unfortunately as those of you who saw the Dateline interview know, King himself says he may not write any more novels. If this book is truly his last I cannot think of a better way to end a remarkable career."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I truely enjoyed this book. Even though I am too young for the 60's and Vietnam this book held my attention from start to finish. Each story stood well on it's own and combined to provide a great novel.

BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King continues to earn his place as a national literary treasure. While King himself continues to insist that his place in American letters is little better than the literary equivilant of a Big Mac and fries, this is clearly his humility at work. Of the popular writers working today, few can approach King's ability to draw finely-tuned characters who seem to come to life on the page. His latest effort, &quot;Hearts in Atlantis,&quot; is a prime example of his enormous gifts in this area. It is axiomatic that, in order to be fully drawn into a story, we must first care about the characters who inhabit it. &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; allows us to do so as it intertwines the same cast of characters through several different stories. In one of them, a character might be the central figure. In another, he might only rate a passing mention. But the world that King creates is rich with veracity, thanks to this technique. &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; is not King's scariest effort, to be sure. But it ranks right up there with &quot;Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,&quot; &quot;The Body&quot; (filmed as &quot;Stand By Me,&quot;) and &quot;The Green Mile&quot; in the pantheon of &quot;serious&quot; Stephen King works. I breathe a heavy sigh of relief that the author's close brush with his own mortality turned out well and that he continues to write his six pages per day, seven days a week. The release of each new King book is an event for me and I'm not ready to give that up."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King's new novel uses the horrors of Vietnam to weave together several different stories. Each story is intricate and well-written and King is in...Ah, who am I kidding? I didn't even read this book. I stopped reading King after Desperation, a great novel. Better get back to horror, Kingman, or the readers will revolt."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King has brought the past to life with a book that has both an interesting story line and wonderful characters. Having been born just a little too late to actually experience the sixties, I can now understand a little of what my older brother went through during the Vietnam Era. To say that King is masterful would be a grave understatement. His characters and imagination are second to none."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I just joined the Stephen King book club to replace all my tattered paperbacks, and this was the first book I received. By the time the next book arrives in my mailbox, I will need to replace this one. King's story-telling skills have always kept his books glued to my hands for hours and this one is no different. I was completely caught off gaurd by the Dark Tower reference and later suprised by who the main character really was. The last story made me want to pack up the car and take a leisurely drive home. I highly recommend this book, even if you have not been interested in King's other works. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book is phenomenal! It wove an incredible spell over me, but left me with a profound sadness, and I never even lived through this stuff. A friend who did, and who is a wiser person than I said of the sixties: &quot;you never felt more certain you could change the world, and never felt more dissapointed when you couldn't do it.&quot; King captures this spirit perfectly. I loved the inclusion of more material on the path to the Tower as well. And the moment in the fourth section when the materialistic world literally collapses on the lost innocence of an entire generation is pure genius! Fantastic book!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"You see I grew up in the late 60's and early 70's. Much of what is in this story I lived through. Granted, the first part of the book is a little off the wall and somehow relates to the Gunslinger series though I am not sure how. I can say this much, the rest of the book about first loves, school, the game of &quot;Hearts&quot;, the Peace movement, and God forgive us all, That War, seems like they happened only yesterday sometimes. How did they all fit together? As in the book, I didn't know then and I can't say that I ever will. ___ + ___ = Information. JCD"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is the first Stephen King novel I've read. It starts from a young boy's point of view and is quite well written. The little hints of something weird going on were genuinely creepy. I have to admit it was the first time in many years that I felt uneasy putting down a book and turning off the light! However, at the end of the section the weird creepy stuff is fully revealed in all its silliness - what a letdown! Rather than being scary it is just cartoonish.The next section was about students on a college campus, and it may have even been better than the first section. Notably, nothing creepy or otherwordly happens!There are another few shorter sections that are much weaker.The book would have been better without the sci-fi elements, which felt tacked on and unnecessary. If Stephen King wants to write a non-horror novel about the 60's he should just go ahead and do it. He could use a pseudonym if he likes, so as to not disappoint his horror fans."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Let me begin by saying I am sixteen years old. Obviously, I did not experience the sixties, so this novel had no chance from the beginning to strike a chord within me or launch a wave of nostalgia. However, as I'm sure other non-sixties readers have experienced, this novel neevrtheless transported me back into that era, particularly during the first two sections. Its keen character development and plots that were thought provoking, wildly funny, satirical, and just flat out fun to read all at once were at a level elevated even from King's usual grandeur.The first section of the book, novel-length in its own right, details the experiences of twelve year Bobby Garfield living with his bitter single mother and his mysterious old friend, Ted Brautigan. Ted is a character similar to The Green Mile's John Caffey, in that he has mysterious mental powers that transform Bobby's life.The true gem of this novel, however, is the long middle section entitled &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;. Though the name suggests some profound plot or content, it should be taken literally; the story is about college boys who become hooked playing hearts at the University of Maine while under the constant shadow of the Vietnam War and flunking their courses. There are many reasons why I love this section; mainly, it is just so much fun to read. The characters, from the obscene and sarcastic Ronnie to the wise voice of Nate become developed and fimiliar to the reader, to the point wherethe reader truly feels like part of the action. The plot is often hilarious, as conflicting attitudes and people within the dorm lose their collective mental sanity while playing the addictive game. however, there are also many throught provoking and meaningful scenes, especially those involving Stokley the cripple's opposing the war. The section is especially entertaining for Hearts enthusiasts, due to the countless references to nuances of the game.Ultimately, Hearts in Atlantis is a strange novel that is a departure from the usual King theme of Horror. However, in this case I believe he came through beautifully; even the mini sections I didn;t mention in this review were good. Definitely pick it up or rent it if you get the chance; you don't have to be an avid reader, King fan, or survivor of the sixties to enjoy it thoroughly."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book was pretty bland and disjointed, but moderately entertaining. The Green Mile was the first Stephen King book I had read in fifteen years and I loved it, so I was excited to pick up Hearts in Atlantis as another &quot;non-traditional&quot; Stephen King novel. It seems like Stephen King had multiple disconnected stories that he then went through unnatural acts to join together in Hearts in Atlantis... It's a stretch to bill this novel as a brilliant meditation on Vietnam when the first half of the novel is a poor excuse for a science fiction/mystery story -- I thought the wrong cover had been put on the book. I was left very disappointed after the hype. Go in with &quot;low&quot; expectations (no pun intended) and expect a mindless, beach book or airplane type read."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"King uses great imagery in this very moving story. You can defanitely see how King felt the sixties were for him. I exspecially liked the connection the story draws to the &quot;Dark tower series&quot;. This novel is defanitely worth reading even for those who dislike the King."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King returns with a melancholy look at growing up in the shadow of The Vietnam War and the 1960's. HEARTS IN ATLANTIS consists of 5 pieces of fiction, all tied together with characters appearing in different selections. The book is told in chronological fashion, starting with 1960 and ending in 1999.&quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; is a 254 novella that introduces us to Bobby Garfield, an 11 year old growing up without a father figure. The tale meditates on the themes of whom to trust, who the real threats in life are and that you can never go back to a time when things seemed similar.Bobby meets a new tenant in his building, a Ted Brautigan, who shows up from seemingly out of nowhere to befriend Bobby. Ted shows and tells Bobby that Low Men in Yellowcoats are following him and for Bobby to keep out for signs of their coming. Bobby does this but it doesn't stop the inevitable finding of Ted by these Low Men. Bobby eventually loses his innocence in this story and moves on. As a side note, followers of King's DARK TOWER series will see some interesting and familiar trappings in this story.Up next is the title story, which shows us Bobby in college six years later. He gets mixed up in the addicting game of Hearts and his grades go south. More importantly Bobby and his cohorts find out that they have the power of protest, be it the war or addressing their own scholastic fates.1983 is the year that &quot;Blind Willie&quot; takes place. We follow an old nemesis of Bobby's past, Willie Shearman, as he goes through a three person transformation. He goes from Bill, dutiful husband to Willie Shearman, a hard working joe to Blind Willie, a panhandler. It is the most depressing and moving piece due to the effects of guilt, war and lack of respect have on Bill.John Sullivan is the central character in &quot;Why We're in Vietnam&quot;. This starts off at a fellow Vietnam Vet's funeral where the past is too much to take for John. He meets up with some other soldiers from that time and he notices certain commonalities among them all. This is a sobering look at what our government exposed our boys in Viet Nam to and the effects it has on them all. The ending of this story connects directly with the last part. The third to the last paragraph in &quot;Why We're in Vietnam&quot; sums up this book. Look it up, read it and hope we don't fall to the same Fates that that generation did.&quot;Heavenly Shades of Night are Falling&quot; is the end piece of this work. It ties up all the loose ends...almost. Bobby comes back to his hometown of 1960 to notice the changes, meet up with old friends, and discover what he and the rest of his generation accomplished...or didn't accomplish. A bit of hope at the end of HEARTS IN ATLANTIS makes this book a standout. King accomplishes something unique: an entertaining but thought provoking heart tugger piece of fiction. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The First story was obviously the best. Its connection to the Dark Tower series is interesting and I hope we see the characters in it again. The kindly boarder, the use of &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, the cruelty of children are all elements of this intriguing tale. The other shining tale is the one of the college students who become obsessed with Hearts. Anyone who has experienced life in a college dorm knows how easily obsessions begin be they drinking, computer games or whatnot, and lead students far astray from their work. This story is also a beautiful love story and was very touching. The other stories were pretty weak however. Blind Willie was unbearably predictable, boring and farmiliar. Skip it. The final tale tying the threads together was also weak. But the two stories I mentioned were blockbusters!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have just read thru some of the other reviews for this bookand people seem to love or hate it. I must be the odd one out as itleft me feeling neither one way or the other. I agree with a lot of people who said the first section of the story is the best, very straightforward King. I felt the book lost the thread way half way through and never regained it. I was waiting for a revalation at the end, some point to the story and it never came. I might be missing the point myself, but I don't thnik so. I have been a huge fan of Stephen King since Carrie &amp; Salems Lot, but I'm finding his books increasingly formulaic and predictable, almost repetative in style if not content. He seems to be leaning more towards 'normal' stories these days, I think Insomnia was the last King book I really enjoyed reading. By normal standards Atlantis is a good book, but for Stephen king just good is well below average."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I haven't read the other stories in this book. I have only read &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot;. I could have just been satisfied with this story as the whole book. It ranks among King's best work. Including &quot;IT&quot; ( hard to believe, don't you think), Green Mile, Different Season's, or the Dark Tower Series. It pains me to think of what Bobby went through in the story. I won't say, you'll have to read for yourself. In the end, this is one great story, the other's are probably great too. I just think that they won't be as sensational as &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot;."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Certainly not the complelling story of the GREEN MILE but a good tale. The biggest flaw in the audio version is Kings readings. William Hurt brings the characters to life and seems to understand the timing and delivery of their feelings better than the author. Kings voice is like finger nails on a chalk board. Nasal and annoying.Hurt is a great reader and the characters he reads about are the ones I will remember."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book was some what of a let down after reading Bag Of Bones and The Green Mile. Stephen King said &quot;He was a child of the sixties and wanted to write about it&quot;,I grew up in the fifties and sixties and I could not relate to anything in the book. I got half way through the book and just put it down, it just wasn't going anywhere."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis can be described as average when compared to other works by Stephen King. I have been an avid reader of King for several years, but this is the first book I had to force myself to finish. The first story, Low Men in Yellow Coats, was quite compelling and enjoyable. The stories that followed, however, lacked the interesting storyline that is needed to keep me going. As far as the writing goes, it is King at his best, as usual."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Halfway through the book, and it is a fun read. King gets better and better at telling a story in a simple, matter of fact manner. The one thing that keeps haunting me are the references to THE PRISONER television series. HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is set in 1966, yet characters are remembering the series, despite the fact that it would not be televised for another year! Perhaps King will resolve this by the end of the story, but as an avid PRISONER fan (and child of the '60s), I have a hard time getting past this."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book began with a bang and ended with a whimper. The novellas got progressively shorter &amp; progressively weaker &amp; more confused. I enjoyed the tie in of the first novella with the Dark Tower series &amp; fully expected the rest of the book to continue in that vein &amp; bring all the disparate threads together. Instead, King just drops the Dark Tower references &amp; comes to a much less than satisfying conclusion. If you are expecting the typical King neatness &amp; continuity, this book is particularly disappointing. Taken individually, the novellas, especially the first two, are not bad, but together, they lack cohesiveness &amp; direction."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Errrr..... I might be out of line here, but how can the first part in this novel('Low men in yellow coats') be compared to earlier works of Mr. King exploring the theme of kids growing up, like 'IT' and 'The Body' from 'Different Seasons'? It seems to me that Mr. King might be losing his touch and I SERIOUSLY doubt if this novel would have sold this well under another author's name.... Still, it has its moments, I suppose (the final part is the only part which gave me goosebumps). And, of course, if you're an avid follower of the brilliant 'Dark Tower' series, you just can't skip it...."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have been on the other end of the spectrum, having read some of Kings books but never being real impressed. This one changes everything. being of the 60's everything relates Youth,Vietnam,protest and all the rest. I know Mr King is a great horror writer, but he is equally as good with factual fiction. 5 stars for sure."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"ONCE AGAIN KING USES HIS WONDERFUL STORY WRITING ABILITY. HE USES IT TO LINK THE STORIES IN EACH OF THE HEARTS STORIES WITH EACH OTHER. AND ALSO LINKS THEM SOMEHOW WITH THE DARK TOWER SERIES. THE LOW MEN IN YELLOW COATS, RIP RIP IN STORY TWO AND SO ON.. AMAZING --- YOU REALLY HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION OR YOU WILL MISS HIS INGENIUS GENIUS."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have read sevral books by S.K. Each one of them are great, I'd give them all 5-stars. With his books you have to prepare your mind as to how he is writting. This book is a good way of talking about the Nam experince. No way is a great way but that's something else all together. The first story seems to be tied to the dark tower sieres. After that all the other stories are tied in to the first one. It relates to me on a more personal level. Everyone tells about what happened to them after their 1960's summer together. I enjoy books, movies, or anything else to gives us the &quot;human&quot; experince. Point of views change with people &amp; time but I think we all enjoy seeing someone else's view to see what was really going on at that point &amp; time. What the historians write down is awful boring. But what S.K. did with it is very lively. Keep it going on Stephen."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I'm a big fan of Stephen King's horror books, but this wasn't a horror book. It seemed more like adult contemporary fiction, the kind of thing you hear on Oprah. The first story was great, but it all went downhill from there. The first story was the only one that had a &quot;boogeyman&quot; or any element of the supernatural. The rest were just about sad misfit people lamenting events that happened in their childhoods. If this book had been by a new author, I wouldn't have read any more books by the author."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"First, I always love when King crosses the plots of his books, and in &quot;Low Men...&quot;, he adds to the collective work known as &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;. The short stories all do come together in the end, but there are still a few too many loose ends to fit my tastes. A worthwhile read, but not Kings best."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I had to read this book immediately, as I do all of Kings work and have since 6th grade. I like it, I cared about the characters and was drawn &quot;in to&quot; the story as I am only when reading King. I didn't thik it was on the par with &quot;The Stand&quot;, which I consider a modern masterpiece, but lets face it folks....Kings avererage is better than the rests best.Mr. King, I'm your number one fan! Hahahaha-Annie(aka Angela Pickle)"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is a great book! Its somhow different from outher King book, but still its great. I got this for xmas 2001. I had wanted it for long, but not in Norwegian. Finaly my aunt had order it from someplace. Its fritening in the way, coz I had never thought of the vietnam war in a way King write about it. I have learend about it in school and so, but I never seemed to listen about it. I learned something from this book, how awful the vietman var was. This book made me cry! Its not many times King has made me cry, but he did. Its sad in a way, still its fritening, and that all mixed together makes a relly relly great book, its recomented for you people out there who understand the \\"Reading for fun\\" term!! This book will make you laught, cry, and be scared for daylight! I can ashure you that! I cant wait to see the movie, or start riding it again!!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is the second book I've read by Stephen King, and I must admit, I liked it a lot better than Black House. The first section about the children living in Connecticut and the old man and the &quot;low men in yellow&quot; coats started leading in the same direction as Black House. I found this disconcerting and almost quit reading, however, the next section had a different twist. Each section contained at least one character from the previous one, and so, in a sort of twisted way, they all fit together--like a puzzle. Kings liberal use of the 'f' word was offensive to me, but I have to admit, I enjoyed this book. I actually wanted to read the book before seeing the movie. I'm a big fan of Anthony Hopkins, and thought I'd like to have a frame of reference from the book. Happy reading."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK AND DIDNT PUT IT DOWN UNTIL PAGE 253.

I THINK KING DID A GREAT JOB STARTING OUT WITH THE KIDS AT AGE 11 AND FOLLOWING ONE CHARACTER HERE AND THEN ANOTHER CHARACTER IN COLLEGE AND ON INTO THE WAR WITH A COUPLE OF COLLEGE KIDS TOGETHER; THEN INTO THEIR MIDDLE-AGE YEARS,SO WHAT IF THE SAME CHARACTERS DID NOT LAST THROUGH THE ENTIRE STORY?HOW MANY OF US ARE STILL TOGETHER SINCE THE FIFTH GRADE? BOBBY AND CAROL SURVIVED UNTIL THE END OF THEBOOK WHEN THEY CAME TOGETHER AT THEIR BEST FRIEND'S FUNERAL SO THE TRIO THAT STARTED OUT IN FIFTH GRADE WERE REUNITED AT THE END EVEN IF ONE WAS DEAD. THE STORTIES THRUOUT THE BOOK RELATED TO ANY ONE OF THOSE THREE THEMSELVES OR TO THEIR FRIENDS SO THEY WERE ALL TIED UP AT THE END JUST LIKE SOME READERS WANT A GOOD BOOK TO END. I COULD ASSOCIATE WITH ALL THE CHARACTERS IN THE BOOK WITH LIKE PEOPLE IN MY OWN LIFE AND I HAD A GREAT TIME THINKING &quot;YEP, JUST LIKE SO AND SOIN MY LIFE!&quot; READ THIS GREAT BOOK AND JUDGE IT YOURSELF...DON'T LET POOR REVIEWS DEPRIVE YOU OF A GOOD READ!'"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I saw the movie first, and couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. Kings books always seem to translate very well to movies, but I have always loved the books more because of King's meticulous attention to creating a character through subtext. His characters cannot always be conveyed on screen with the same sense of three-dimensionality that he creates in the written word. So what a disappointment to find the shallow and lifeless characters who populate this book. I slogged through it, always hoping that the next page I would understand who these people were, and why the did the things they did. The plot was jointed, the tone of the story has awkward shifts and transitions. I got the sense that this book was a hurry-it-to-the editor effort. Too bad--I wouldn't recommend this one, but it won't make me skip the next King novel."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I would otherwise give the actual book about 4 stars. I read and enjoyed the print version of Hearts in Atlantis. But since this review is of the audio version, the only thing that counts here is the quality of the recorded reading. I'm a big fan of unabridged recordings of SK's books. I've listened to everything that has been produced. I've even come to love SK's own reading of his works. Over the years he's become quite a good reader.I recently got Hearts in Atlantis on CD to listen to. Question: was SK doing William Hurt a favor or something? Hurt is exhausting to listen to. He exudes such an air of tiredness, of zero-energy that he really does live up to his name. I know this isn't merely his attempt to interpret the story since this is how he ALWAYS sounds no matter which movie he's in.Since the book was produced by Recorded Books, which has THE greatest collection of talents of any company that is producing recorded books, I wondered if the selection of Hurt had been for reasons other than talent: Hurt's 'reading' draws too much attention to itself in the way he makes sentences run on, compounding the horror with too narrow a range of pitch, placing emphasis on the wrong words, destroying the rhythm--it's like Ken Nordine on Word Jazz doing the monotone character singing, &quot;My Valentine, my funny Valentine&quot;, except in this case it's not funny.George Guidall, Richard Ferrone, or even Frank Muller would have made their parts of the book shine. Instead, it's a dreary trudge through a grey land. You'd be far better off spending your money on the print version and saving the extra expense for Frank Muller's reading of The Gunslinger series (or The Dark Tower series, if you prefer). They're very good."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Bravo Mr.King! I believe one of the reasons Stephen King novels enjoy such phenomenal success lies in the authors ability to put the reader into the scene wholeheartedly. He has lived such a life as to be a common man with uncommon talents. In HEARTS IN ATLANTIS we move from a tough-times 1950's (and remember those are the supposed 'good old days') to the gritty, over-idealized 1960's and beyond into the confusion of the media event laden decades to follow. King never loses his focus on what the book is about. I loved the first part of the book as a DARK TOWER fan because SK seems to tease us a lot lately with tid-bits and innuendo. Note to other DT fans, see INSOMNIA. His revels in 60's Maine on the University campus are priceless looks into what feels like an autobiographical whimsey. There are some genuinely crazy characters in this work. Mr. King's characters seem never to come to a resolution with their ghosts-of-the-past, but it is important to note that most always they reach a living agreement with them. Thanks for another glimpse of the gunslinger, and the rose petals from the field at End World. HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is a multi-faceted work, and every face shines from within. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I'm not crazy about King's work in this book, but my real complaint is with Hurt's narration in the audiobook. (King and Hunt split narration duties. King narration work was wonderful as always.) Hunt's reading for large parts of this book sound almost as if he had been half-asleep or drunk. I thought the book was misrecorded at the wrong speed, but then I heard King's sections, and it seemed just fine. Hurt's &quot;style&quot; is more than distracting, and I regret this purchase. I do not recommend the audiobook version of Hearts In Atlantis."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book is actually 5 separate stories that meld into 1. The first story takes place in 1960 and centers around 11 year old Bobby Garfield and his friends. Stories 2 thru 4 tells the story of Bobby's friends (and 1 enemy) at different points of their respective lives and how the Vietnam War affected them. Story 5 brings Bobby back home. I wasn't sure what to expect from this book. I was pleased and surprised by the storyline and how Stephen King managed to pull the main character out of the middle stories completely and focus on the supporting characters. A very original and engaging story! Note: Dark Tower fans will especially enjoy the first story."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King has done once again something he has only done once before-- he managed to get four books out in sixteen months. Okay, he cheated a little, releasing a screenplay as his first book of 1999, but then one of the books during the 86-87 deluge was the re-release of The Stand, so who's counting? Not the fans, who were certainly all too happy to pay the [money] and change for all four books. And were they worth it? Sure, if you're a Stephen King fan.But, just as in the last deluge, there are bound to be some disappointments. I closed the cover on The Eyes of the Dragon all those years ago saying &quot;huh?&quot; And while that wasn't my foremost thought after finishing Hearts in Atlantis, it was up there. First, when it comes right down to it, it's yet another book about Vietnam, and we don't NEED yet another book about Vietnam, especially not yet another book of fiction about Vietnam. To play devil's advocate, however, the amount of time King actually spends in the jungle in this book is at a blessed minimum, about the same as Rex Miller does in _Slob_ (or, to cross genres, a little less than the film time the jungle got in _House_). When Vietnam is used as a stage setting, or an excuse (as it was in the aforementioned film), it works better than it does as a weapon of injustice. We've seen it too many times. We've all watched The Deer Hunter, Platoon, and another hundred thousand movies that tell us we royally screwed up, in one way or another, and even the most misguided loyalheaded mindless patriot who still believes the idea was right (read: me) is willing to admit that some really big screwups happened along the communication trail. So be it. Now it's a part of history, thankfully, and as such it makes a good backdrop for novels set in the sixties. A better backdrop than love-ins and peace-outs, that's for sure.Point two (is there a point two?), and this one goes on the plus side: we've seen both conventions taken in these stories before, but never done in quite this way. They read like an odd conglomeration of _The Nick Adams Stories_ and Robert Altman's short-lived TV series _Gun_, but with interesting twists thrown in. The object that passes from story to story is almost never in the hands of the person who passes from story to story. The person who does so is never the main character; the object is almost always completely incidental. A thing of beauty.However, a clever way of wrapping a bunch of stories together is just that, if there's not all that much meat to these, and despite the five-hundred-plus-page bulk of this, there really isn't. Not to say there isn't some fun here, and there's the usual round of &quot;spot the characters form the other books&quot; and the like, and one of the stories, &quot;Blind Willie,&quot; will send you into the thousand-yard stare, wondering how King could take such a simple idea and turn it into something so astoundingly brilliant...In any case, these five stories (actually, we'll call them two novellas and three short-shorts-- at least, they're short-shorts for King) cover forty years in the life of one person, as seen by friends, lovers, etc., in a kind of impressionist way. We're never completely sure what happens during those times our subject is out of sight, and neither are the other characters, but that doesn't stop them from going about their lives in interesting and usually destructive ways. Of course, we are left at the end with more questions than we'd like to be, but isn't that the way with most King novels these days? Everything ties into everything else. We know we'll get the answers somewhere down the line.I guess I can't help comparing this to Bag of Bones and Tom Gordon, thanks to the timing. And given those two, I have to rank this one at the bottom of the batch. Not that it's a bad book, not at all; I'd still rather read King than much of what's on the bestseller list at any given time. But in the past sixteen months King has delivered a one-two punch of his best work this decade, possibly in all of his career; it's hard to imagine anything would stand up to that. Still, I'm not sure I'd recommend this one to any except those who need it to follow along in a series (for DT aficionados, as I mentioned, this is a must-have, and I'm wondering if some of the unanswered questions won't end up tying into the what-the-hell-was-THAT? thing at the end of Bag of Bones)."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is a great book.Like a lot of reviewers I loved the story Low Men In Yellow Coats.It was King at his best.What King does with Bobby in this story is wonderful.It caught me completely off guard.This story alone makes the book a worthwhile purchase"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"In \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" Stephen King reaches the maturity every author tries to achieve during his career. Along the five stories existent in the book, King blends in his fantasy magna-opus with some touching tales about discovering life during the sixties in US, and how some of the people of that generation deal with the aftermath.The book contains five stories. Although they cover a forty-year span, they are all linked together, even if the main characters change in each story.The first story is \\"Low men in yellow coats\\", which was adapted to a movie starring Anthony Hopkins. This is the story of a summer in Bobby Garfield's life, in 1960, when he met a strange fellow, Ted Brautigan. Ted is much more than he seems to be, and he is running from something he can't tell Bobby about. \\"Low men...\\" is the longest story in the book, and, as previously stated by other reviewers, Dark Tower fans will be delighted to know yet another part of this amazing fantasy saga. Readers who are not aware of Dark Tower may think the story is strange and unbelievable, but it may also be a starting point to get to know Roland and his quest companions.\\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" is the second story, and the best one in my opinion. The main character is Pete Riley, a freshman in UMaine, coping with a new reality - the Vietnam war - and its developments: is the war right or wrong? On what side should he be? The portrayal of entering adult life in the sixties is very good and the character development is, once again, excellent. The fantasy elements don't appear in \\"Hearts...\\", and this story is as \\"reality\\" as it can be.The two next tales, \\"Blind Willie\\" and \\"Why we're in Vietnam\\" are not as compelling as the first two, and much shorter. In each one of them, there's pratically only one character, and the stories deal with experiences and post-war consciences.\\"Heavenly shades of night are falling\\" is the last one, only twenty pages long, and here we meet Bobby Garfield again, now as an adult that comes back to his childhood town. It's a good wrap-it-up story to the book, but could be more developed. As happens with everything concerning the Dark Tower, there are lots of unanswered questions, leaving the reader in near-despair concerning the conclusion of the saga.Stephen King delivers in \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" a different pattern of writing. A step up the ladder.Grade 9.2/10"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"As soon as I met Bobby Garfield in 1960, I was intrigued.King continues as a master storyteller, with a gift for character development. I was hooked on this book from page 1; just couldn't read it fast enough.Hearts in Atlantis is broken into five parts: the first and last respectively telling the story of Bobby Garfield as a youngster, and as an adult. The stories in between--which are brilliantly interconnected--tell the tale of other persons who are, albeit sometimes unknowingly, integral parts of Bobby's life.The book is an excellent read, which truly shows Kings maturity as a writer and a storyteller.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The title of this review is meant to applaud the story which is, in my opinion, first rate and it is nicely written. It shouldn't be necessary to explain this novel is of a genre which not all will find to their liking though. For Stephen King fans Hearts in Atlantis is an idea somewhat like Firestarter or The Stand, both of which are also favorites of mine. And the movie, of the same name, which starred Anthony Hopkins is true to the book. I was dissapointed somewhat because I wanted more to read than there was and also the additional chapters were a little long, however, it was interesting in how they all tied into the main story."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"For me, reading Steven King's *Hearts in Atlantis* was like awakening from a dream, in which hauntingly familiar scenes from the past float by, snatches of a reality once intimate and now lost forever...I grew up within one year and about ten miles of the central character in the first part of the novel, and some of the barely noticeable features in the background scenery just make the picture snap to life (the Alvin Dark baseball glove, Vitalis hair tonic). This is even more potent in the second part of the book, his paen to Atlantis. Without overdoing it -- he keeps his narrator an average guy at an average college -- he captures the intangible sensibility of that time in a way few authors have (I think of *Jesus' Son* by Denis Johnson). There was a tribal feeling in those days, you could tell instantly who was with you in that Atlantean world that rejected the War and the plastic middle-class cultural void that spawned it... that embraced mind expansion, sexual freedom, rock&roll...a time when you'd pick up hitchhikers as if they were long lost family...It brings to mind a line in a John Hartford song -- \\"The Goodle Days\\": \\"we was in love with people that we hadn't even met...out for anything we could get...well we did it then, and we'll do it yet...back in the goodle days\\"."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have to agree with G Cone from Texas--I, too, have read plentyof King books and not wanted them to end, but when they do, youmove on to the next. This one, though, I couldn't imagine itending and when it did, I couldn't--CAN'T--seem to forget it. It's been almost a week since I finished it and I just want toread it again and again, especially Hearts in Atlantis, the story. I don't know if I could ever even put into words why thisone book--and this one story, especially--has me so hooked but it does. A wonderful, truly exceptional piece of work and worththe read if only for the very outside reference to King's &quot;Eyes of the Dragon&quot; (another of my favorites) in &quot;Heavenly Shades of Night are Falling&quot; when Carol speaks of someone teaching her &quot;a long time ago&quot; to become dim. Could Flagg still be around stirring up trouble? :) Read this book!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have been reading Stephen King for nearly 17 years. Every time I read another author and return to King, I'm reminded of how remarkable an author he truly is. Sure, he has had some missteps (Rose Red, anyone?), but when he's on his game, he's damn near perfect.Hearts In Atlantis is, in my opinion, King on his game. Or better yet, it's a older, mellowing King re-inventing his game (kind of like what Michael Jordan has done during his stint with the Wizards.) Alternatingly poignant and creepy, mesmerizing and callous, King knows how to capture his readers and keep them enthralled. While it's not the type of story that most are accustomed to reading from the master of the macabre, it is one that I find elegant and literary -- with just the right touch of that supernatural element that only King can deliver.So while I'll always enjoy reading diverse authors, for me it's good to know that King is there when I need a &quot;sure thing.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Quite a bit different from most SK novels. It doesn't depend on a supernatural plot (though obligatory supernatural elements do appear).It's tough to describe why it's so good. On occasion, we have all met strangers from far away who, to our amazement, co-own little pieces of our past. Maybe they went to summer camp with someone who would become your college roomy, or maybe they married your 4th grade sweetheart. It might have made you wonder how many such connections you never quite stumble onto. Hearts in Atlantis is an exploration of that kind of interconnectedness in the lives of three childhood friends who go very separate ways. It's a bittersweet reflection on paths not taken, on what might have changed had we been just a little better or a little wiser.King usually holds my interest, but this is the first time one of his books wouldn't let go after I'd finished it. Very different from the movie, though I enjoyed both."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. King captures the reader from the first few pages. It is a conglomeration of different interlocking stories.The first story, \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" is about an old man, Ted Brautagan, that moves into an apartment above Bobby, an 11-year old boy. Bobby soon discovers that Ted may possess some psychic powers. Ted asks bobby to stay on the look out for \\"low men in yellow coats\\", or dangerous looking men who wear mustard trench-coats. They communicate with things such as lost pet posters, drawings on the sidewalk with chalk, or kitetails hanging from telephone wires. Although Bobby does not beleive these men exist, he begins to see the signs. The story ends in an interesting way, and ties into the other stories well.The second story, \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\", is probobly the best of the five stories. It tells the tale of a college student who's dorm get hooked on a card game (Hearts), and their grades start falling. This all takes place during the sixties and the Vietnam War, where men not in college were liable to be drafted for the war. The protagonist, Pete, struggles to keep his head above water and his grades up as he falls in love with Bobby's old girlfreind.The third and fourth stories, \\"Blind Willie\\" and \\"Why We're in Vietnam, two kids that grew up with Bobby struggle with their haunted post-Vietnam lives after serving in the war.In the conclusion of the book, \\"Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling\\", Bobby returns to his hometown after being contacted by Ted again to find the love of his life there as well.If you want a good book to read, pick up Hearts in Atlantis. It won't dissapoint - I am a huge fan of fantasy, and rarely read realistic fiction, but this book was a gift from a freind. I read it, and devoured every word."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The story is great - one of King's best in fact but the production is terrible.Many of the 60+ minute CDs only have 2 or 3 tracks which means that if you stop or eject the CD you're going to have to FF the CD to the point that you stopped. A major headache if you've stopped the CD 49 minutes into a 50 minute track. Yes, there are tracks that long. Very sloppy.Every other CD-Book I've listened to has had at least a dozen tracks so you can start and stop easily. For whatever reason, S&amp;S decided that they didn't need to do this for HIA."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The title of this one is a metaphor... though in grand King fashion, it isn't readily apparent just what the metaphor is all about until one is all but finished with the book. The metaphor also defies my ability to define here in this forum... one will just have to read the book to fully understand it. I can somewhat relate to the addiction some people have to the card game Hearts. This is one of five games I saw people in the military playing in Desert Storm and at other times and places throughout my military career, such as it was and is. The others are, Spades, Cribbage, Uno, and Chess, for those who are interested.The movie by the same name is based only upon the first short story within the book, Low Men in Yellow Coats, which I found quite interesting. Apparently, this story is related somehow to The Dark Tower series... yet to be finished by Mr. King.The other stories; Hearts in Atlantis, Blind Willie, Why We're in Vietnam, and Heavenly Shades of Night are Falling follow Low Men in Yellow Coats, and are set sequentially in time from the beginning of the 1960's to the end of the 1990's. All of the stories share some characters and are intertwined intriguingly... though when one first begins the new story, it isn't readily apparent just how the twining is done.After finishing the book... actually, some time during the title story, it seemed to me that this was as much a journal of self-discovery and retrospection as it was a work of interrelated fictional accounts of the last forty years. I think, that more than any of King's other works, this book allows the reader into the psyche of the genius that is King.Hardcover editions are now available for under ten dollars these days, which is less than the price of the trade paperback that is still in print as well. That bit of logic, or the lack thereof, is one of the idiosyncrasies of our free market economy. The publisher prints too many copies in an attempt to gauge the market and then ends up warehousing copies that nobody wants. He then lowers the price... at times below the cost of production just to avoid paying for the warehousing. Sometimes I wonder if a warehouse owner has greater literary acumen than the writers... they certainly make more money as a group.Go out and grab a copy of this one if you want to see some of King's best work and get a look inside his twisted gray matter. It might be debated that the original cover price ...was a bit much, but the [price]I paid for my copy was a bargain and money well spent.I will end this review with an excerpt that Mr. King apparently finds rather important, as he reproduces it several times within the text as well as on the back cover:(image of a pierced heart) + (image of a peace sign) = informationMake from this what you will. I think it's a secret code... or perhaps another metaphor?Dale A. RabyEditor/PublisherThe Green Bay Web"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This was my first Stephen King book and I enjoyed it. He made me care about what happened to all of the characters in each of the section. Being born in 1972, I was not alive during the Viet Nam War. Reading this book makes me thankful that I was not, and also makes me wonder what side I would have taken had I been alive back then.This book does not rely on horror and the supernatural for its thrills, but instead relies on pshycological drama in each of its characters. A good book to read for a first time Stephen King."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts of Atlantis begins in the inner city with a single mother raising her only son Bobby.

King a break - he's pumping out a book every 6 months. I gave the review section three stars, but just between you and me; it's only a two on a good day. I love Steven King and I own every one of his books in hard cover. I'm the reason why this guy's making the big bucks, but I have to say that there's a lot of books out there that blow this one away... many of which are mentioned in the first story in this book. If you just finished the Tom Gordon book, then don't worry - it's not half as bad, but if you just finished The Shining, It, or anything written in the 80's, then maybe you should try The Talisman, The Tommyknockers, Insomnia, or the brilliant series of The Green Mile. Sorry Steve..."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Like many other great artists Stephen King's work ranges unevenly...never below satisfying of course and sometimes all the way clear to perfection.A couple great examples of King at his best are Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption and Apt Pupil both from his novella collection Different Seasons.This book pleasantly reminded me of those other great works.Like Apt Pupil this books starts with the coming of age story of a young boy, Bobby Garfield who meets one of King's favorite characters THE FASCINATING STRANGER in the person of Ted Brauttigan, a mysterious man who in little steps allows young Bobby into his world.As it would happen Bobby and Brauttigan meet in 1960 or as King refers to it, the land of Atlantis, where America has not yet become grief stricken by the premature death of John F. Kennedy and the ultimate disillusionment of America's ill fated involvement in the Vietnam War. In time Bobby will join his generational peers in watching the America of 1960, Atlantis, sink below the waves. But in the here and now (the 1960 that is) the story of Hearts in Atlantis is very much the story of young Bobby's growing friendship with Brauttigan. It is also the story of Bobby's budding romantic interest in his friend Carol. Under Brauttigan's eye Bobby and Carol go from just friends to just beginning their lives as adults.For the good of it Brauttigan provides Bobby with a mentoring of sorts, that is until MYSTERIOUS EVENTS, also a King favorite, intervene to leave their own unique stamp on this story.Like I said, the Bobby/Brauttigan story is where this book STARTS. About halfway through this book, however we start time tripping, first to the mid 60s, then to the early 80s, then again to 1999 and finally back to 2000, each time telling what happened, not to Bobby or Brauttigan but other characters from the Bobby universe as Atlantis America descends beneath the waves. At this point I got reminded not so much of King trying to deal with Vietnam and the 60s but rather Kurt Vonnegut in Slaughterhouse Five trying to deal with the bombing Dresden. Like Vonnegut King seemed most to deal with the issues of the end of Atlantis by not dealing with them.The 60s story focuses on Carol and her early days in college...after Bobby and before Vietnam...as she sort of dates a fellow co ed Peter. Looking over Peter's shoulder King sometimes looks at Vietnam but mostly discusses academic life where Peter and his friends basically blow off class to play the card game Hearts for money. In what I guess is the signiture exchange in the book Carol tries to get to know Peter better explaining to him that she wants INFORMATION (meaning to understand). Later Carol sets out the formula written above (viz: HEARTS + PEACE = INFORMATION) a formula that at one in the same time reminds us both of genuine affection like that between Bobby and Brauttigan and of course also a card game one uses to bide time. In the 80s we join Blind Willie, another character from the Bobby universe. A standard King bad guy in the Bobby Brauttigan story by the 80s Blind Willie is trying to redeem himself for his misdeeds as a youth and in Vietnam (again in an over the shoulder view). In 99 we meet up again with Bobby's childhood best friend Scully John as Scully John lives his last few hours (again with Vietnam in distant focus). Finally, back in 2000, we meet Bobby and Carol as they sum up of sorts what we've just been told.For its ambition and beginning (and heck, because Stephen King wrote it) I of course award this book five stars. However, honestly the execution of the story following its midpoint may leave some readers disappointed because they're separated from Bobby and Brauttigan just when their tale became the most interesting. Indeed maybe even the best way to read this book is not as unified tale but rather a collection of stories thereby allowing the reader to cherry pick what they find most enjoyable. But for my part I was still reminded of Shawshank Redemption where the ultimate point of the story turned not on supernatural events but (hopefully) decidedly both natural and human ones.With King even if you don't get perfection you at lest get satisfying...which is saying a lot."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I'm not fond of every King's work, but this book is really worth it. Not only the plot is amazing, but the characters seem to be so real, and so rich, that the book causes all sorts of feelings in the readers mind.There are five stories interconnected by characters who were previously introduced in the first one. Encountering them throughout the book made me fell nostalgic. The same sentiment comes along when the author describes the end of one's childhood, going to college, or fond memories of someone who played a very important role in your life in the past, but is no longer present.What I also found very nice about this book is the way King relates some of his ideas with classics such as Lord of the Flies and Of Mice and Men."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King has been known for his short story collections, such as \\"Different Seasons,\\" which introduced us to \\"Rita Hayworth & The Shawshank Redemption\\" (later made into the film \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\") and \\"The Body\\" (later made into the film \\"Stand By Me\\"). With \\"Hearts In Atlantis,\\" King comes up with a base story and then writes five different stories that connect to the theme.The base story is \\"Low Men In Yellow Coats.\\" It is one of the stronger stories in the bunch that features Bobby Garfield, who likes to read and is looking to save up money for a bike. His friends are Carol Gerber (who comes off as somewhat of a love interest, or at least as much as you can say such a thing about a group of young kids) and John \\"Sully\\" Sullivan. An older gentleman named Ted Brautigan moves in near Bobby. He has psychic powers and is trying to avoid the low men in yellow coats. Bobby and Ted form a friendship. The story covers problems that Bobby encounters having to do with life, his mother's issues, hurdles of Carol and Ted's, and bullies that play a role.\\"Hearts In Atlantis,\\" the title story that sinfully doesn't make the film (only a tweaked \\"Low Men\\" and a current ending make it) dramatically covers a real dose of horror... the Vietnam War. The title comes from the fact that the college students enjoy playing Hearts and they wish to be in Atlantis, and not in danger of going overseas to die in a war that's being sprung by political values. Pete Riley is the narrator for this portion, and he ends up falling for Carol Gerber, who makes mention of Bobby.\\"Blind Willie\\" and \\"Why We're In Vietnam\\" are basically \\"where are they now\\" kind of stories. The former being about childhood bully Willie Shearman, and how he has a condition that makes him blind and uses this to beg for money, plus a twist involving him and Sully and Ronnie. The latter involves Sully's life after the war and how things end for him.\\"Heavenly Shades Of Night Are Falling\\" is the final portion of the book, and features Bobby Garfield's return to his hometown to attend a funeral. The title is based off of the opening line to \\"Twilight Time\\" by The Platters. In this piece, we see final strings being tied between Ted and Carol, whether they be in person or through alternate communication.What makes this one of Stephen King's best novels is not the horror fiction that drives the novel, but the story, the character development, and the setting that is included. These elements make it one of King's finest masterpieces. I felt the movie was excellent when I first saw it. After I read the book, this book was far more detailed than the film and light years in excellence.Definitely check this novel out. Stephen King fan or not, you'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis - Stephen King5 starsI began this book in audio format. It is read by Liam Hearn and Steven King. The readers were wonderful, but this was one of those books that I couldn't read fast enough. I had to get a print version because I can read much faster than I can listen. This book had everything that grabs my attention: interesting characters, suspenseful conflict, descriptive period atmosphere and great thematic fodder for discussion.The book is basically a series of stories that are loosely tied together by a few recurring characters. The first story Low Men in Yellow Coats begins in 1960. It's a dark, but nostalgic look at three children just entering adolescence in Harwich, Connecticut. There is a mildly spooky sci-fi plot line and a pivotal act of violence that resonates for these characters through all of the other stories.I loved this part of the book. Steven King won me over completely when he gave the protagonist, Bobby Garfield, an adult library card for a birthday present. Bobby's mysterious adult friend, Ted Brautigan is also a reader who guides Bobby to well-written, influential books. Literary themes from Lord of the Flies and Of Mice and Men become an integral part of Bobby's story.The central portion of the book takes place in 1966 and gives the entire collection its name, Hearts in Atlantis. It takes place in a freshman dormitory at the University of Maine. I've never played a game of hearts, but that did not prevent me from experiencing the game as if I was actually in the smoke filled dorm lounge. It's all there: immaturity and self-involvement side by side with idealistic fanaticism. Initially, there doesn't seem to be any connection with the first story, but then, Carol Gerber, Bobby's first girl friend makes an appearance. Carol's response to the earlier violence and Carol's effect on other characters becomes a theme of this story and those that follow. Of the three short stories that make up the end of the book, Blind Willie, and Why We are in Vietnam, deal with the aftermath of the war. Two characters form the original story, both veterans, deal with their post traumatic stress. Their Vietnam experiences are still tied to the early experience of violence in 1960. Finally, in the last story, Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling, King returns to Bobby Garfield in 1999 for some sweet, nostalgic closure.In the audio version, Liam Hearn read the first and last stories. Steven King read the title story and the two other short stories. The change in voice made perfect sense and I enjoyed both of them. I would recommend this audio book with one objection. One of the things that King does very well to invoke the atmosphere of the decade, is describe the music. This is a book that should come with its own playlist. The audio production did little to support the musical background. There were frequent musical interludes at the end of chapters. Only rarely did they coordinate with the music in the text and far too often the music overlaid the voices making the final lines of a chapter difficult to hear."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"...And it is magnificent.Hardcore Stephen King fans will argue that the older King was much better, and the days of \\"It\\" and \\"Pet Semetary\\" were his best time's, but i may have to disagree after reading this one.It'd be fair to say that King was at his scariest in the earlier days, but as far as all around story telling, how can you argue with the late 90's. The Green Mile, Bag of Bones, and Hearts in Atlantis all came out within a couple years, and they are all tremendous books.Hearts in Atlantis is hard to define.....it's a collection of novella's and short stories, but it's not really. It reads almost like a novel, but it's not. What it is, is just a great story, with an emotional quality that really shows King is once again capable of telling a beautiful story as well as making the hairs on your neck stand up. I won't give anything away, but at the end of Low Men in Yellow Coats, a character yells \\"I Love You\\", and i challenge you to read that without feeling a little ache in your heart, and being able to say King can make his readers connect with his characters. He excells in this book.I don't want to say much plot-wise, because each story has a different plot, and each story plays off of the previous one. I will say that \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" was my favorite in the book, and very possibly my favorite novella ever. The rest were very good, especially \\"Blind Willie\\".My real rating would probably be 4 1/2, because i couldn't really get into the fourth story all that much. Whether the reason is because it just wasn't as good, or it just seemed not as good compared the rest, that was my least favorite. It was o.k. overall.Overall, man, this book came close to stealing my #1 spot from \\"Bag of Bones\\", and it may have just done that if the fourth story wasn't slow paced. King fans read this. Reading fans read this. Everyone, READ THIS! Fantastic book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Another great work. I just finished the 'Low Men in Yellow Coats'. I read the entire Dark Tower Series in 2 months recently and as soon as I saw the title of the short story I picked up the book. The story is great wheather or not one read the Tower series. In the past, King has shown his ability to write horror/fiction novels with words and phrases that reach your inner mind. He develops the characters in such a meticulous way, but is able to keep the readers interested. He not only shows you the chilling horrors in his work, but he also does it in a way that makes one forget s/he is reading a novel from the horror/sci-fi genre. His ablitly to not only bring all the charachters to life but also make you famialir with the characters are evedent in this book. I think it's this atribute where some people might feel like he's changed too much. Yes, his writing has changed. But he's only doing something more stonger in this book than in his others. In other words, he's been writing this way forever. He's imporved this aspect of his writing in this book and it's good. It's change. Besides, what's life without change?"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"All I can say is, that it took me 4 hours from start to finish to read it ..I could try and write a novel about this review,but why, when I can say in it in one word &quot;GREAT&quot; It even has a touch of the dark tower in it.I lust after its sequel(there must be one).

Here, again, he strikes an unerring tone of versimilitude, not only for the region and the period, but the people. The intertwining of the various parts of the story is well done. His allusions to the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series -- among his worst, IMO -- have succeeded in making me give them another try.

I thought this book was one of the better to come out of the last 5 years. Bobby Garfield, Ted and Carol are very well developed and likeable characters.

I'm fascinated with his ability to weave the Dark Tower series into his novels and hope to see more of Ted in the series. I'm dying to know what a &quot;breaker&quot; is and does. Keep up the great work. I felt the next 4 stories were a little lacking. Did King think his readers would be daunted by the lengthy novel and not read? Come on Steve - we read the Stand and the Stand the uncut version.

Also, the first time I ever felt the need to write a &quot;review.&quot; I was about 3 years too old to be caught up in the college age 60's but, none the less, that era planted in me a strange feeling. Things that were going on in this country were not right, at the same time, kids were doing the right thing (whether they went to war or protested to bring home the ones who did go). His writing ability and accuracy in bringing it all back to recreate that eerie feeling was awsome. I took plenty of time to read this book so that I could digest it as I went along. I am glad I did. I will highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to know what the 60's were like. This book is a masterpiece and deserves space on everyone's shelf along with all history books.

Yet I keep coming back for more. This time I was rewarded! What a wonderful story....told in typical King fashion filled with the kind of insights that ring true over and over again.

WHETHER YOU ARE 20 OR 50 YOU CAN RELATE TO THE STORY IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. HE BRIDGES GAPS BETWEEN ERAS AND FOR THAT WE SHOULD BE THANKFUL! THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT STEPHEN KING IS THE BEST WRITER AROUND (HE HAS THE RECORDS TO PROVE IT) HOWEVER SOMETIMES THE STORY IS NOT WORTH TELLING. THAT HAPPENS TO BE THE CASE IN THIS BOOK. STORY 1 I THOUGHT WAS FANTASTIC, BUT THEN I ASKED MYSELF WAS IT REALLY A NECESSARY PART OF THIS PARTICULAR BOOK. IM WILLING TO LET IT SLIDE, BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE WE ARE INTRODUCED TO ALL THE CHARACTERS IN THE FOLLOWING STORIES. THE 2ND STORY WAS ALSO VERY GOOD, BUT A LITTLE TO MUCH TALK OF THE GAME OF HEARTS (VERY MUCH LIKE THE MOVIE ROUNDERS). I THOUGHT THE 3RD STORY WAS TERRIBLE--AND YOU JUST HAVE TO READ IT TO UNDERSTAND IT. I JUST DIDNT REALLY CARE ABOUT THIS CHARACTER. THE 4TH STORY WAS REALLY GOOD AND COULD HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT, EXCEPT FOR A LITTLE SILLINESS, AND SOMETHING THAT WAS UNEXPLAINED. I REALLY WISH THE WHOLE BOOK WAS MORE LIKE STORY 4, HE REALLY GETS A HOLD OF SOMETHING HERE AND SOMEHOW LETS IT GO. THE FIFTH STORY WASNT REALLY A STORY BUT CLOSURE TO THE STORY AND I LIKED IT.

I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK BECAUSE ITS FOCUS IS VERY MUCH A PART OF OUR HISTORY, CULTURE, VALUES, MORES, AND WAY OF LIFE."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"As you start off and meet everyone, you can quickly say that this is one of King's more heart-wrenching novels, and as I recall... he doesn't have that many, :)The reader quickly becomes attached to the characters emotionally, feeling sorry for events that happen to them, alost to the point of wanting to reach into the pages and compfort them... and yes I am still talking about a King book!There were some things I couldn't quite get a full understanding of... the men in yellow coats... for one thing. Then afterwards I found out that this was also a &quot;Gunslinger tie-in&quot;... after smaking my head and reading those I finally understood."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book starts out with one story, tells another, and incorporates both. After this book, I rented the movie and was deeply disappointed. It starts with a story of a young boy and a friendship with an older man who has a supernatural connection. You start to wonder as the book seems to end half way through. You are then introduced to new characters and events. Some of the characters are continued in the second half and tied into the rest of the book. The main character of the second half gets involved in a card game addiction almost causing him to flunk out of college. I felt myself identifying with the &quot;one more hand and I'll go study&quot; ploy. Around this character the Viet Nam war is happening. The book ties all the characters together at the end, some rather loosely. King narrates some of this audio book which adds to the enjoyment. After reading the book, don't bother renting the movie."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I am a Stephen King fan, although I don't like everything he writes. I thought this book was very interesting. I like the way he ties all the characters together. It was well read by both Hurt and King. After the book I rented the movie and was very disappointed."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I'm not a regular reader of Stephen King's work, but I wanted to read the book after seeing the movie. It was so much \\"my\\" era, it touched many chords in my memory. This version (the audio) of Hearts in Atlantis was recommended to me as the best way to experience the book.I wasn't going to listen to the entire thing -- just the first story, which was mostly what the movie was based on, and is by far the longest (8 tapes). William Hurt \\"becomes\\" 11-year-old Bobby Garfield as he reads the story. He's terrific. And I went on to listen to the rest of the stories -- I had difficulty stopping. It drew me in.Some parts are not easy to listen to, going back to Vietnam as they do, but I recommend it. The parts of the book that are not read by William Hurt are read by King, and he does an excellent job as well."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I was pleasantly surprised at this book. It is not at all like so many of his novels. No horror. No great mystery to be solved. At times I was on the edge of boredom, yet I couldn't put the book down; it compelled me to keep reading. Although several separate and distinctive stories, they are all linked and seem to represent the different ages and stages we all go through. The heart of the stories lies in the emotions and experiences of almost-everyday lives, with just a tinge of the strange and mysterious wrapped throughout.Note: If you plan to see the movie, do so before you read the book. Otherwise, you may be dissappointed as the movie only deals with a part of the book story."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"If you have read his book \\"On Writing\\" he has a small biography that parallels this book in nature. The story line and the details were intriguing. The only distraction from this was his constant potty mouth. He must have needed filler to flush (not flesh) out the book. I do not know if that is a recent phenomenon of they all are that way. The movies are not that way.This is one story with a few rest spots that make some think it is a series of shorts. Do not attempt to read this out of order as each relies on knowledge of the former. The first phase, about the \\"Low Men\\", is the only real supernatural section. And as he points out it is the moral environment around the story that makes the supernatural scary. In this phase he also does a dissertation books including \\"The Lord of the Flies.\\" There are real close corollaries to \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" single mother, kid named Bobbie, and a mysterious border. The second phase Deals with a collage life environment, which is a background for molding character and characters. I do not want to tell too much detail, as that is why you read the book. The third phase is broken into two parts, one a story of Willie during and after Nam, then the whole set of previous characters surround by death and near death experiences.The not so loose stories ingeniously ties together by a certain object that travels throughout the times to add as a catalyst and a conclusion.Hearts in Atlantis ~ Anthony Hopkins"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Read this book! Be aware of the unusual format (see previous reviews) and be prepared to really contemplate what King is trying to say AND do with this novel (also see other previews re: the &quot;several stories linked by a common pulse&quot; approach). This novel is such a poignant love letter to lost innocence and the harsh reality of the growing up of the person and the growing old of the spirit.The best testimonial I can give to this powerful read was that, after all the contemplation, patience, and effort expended to grasp King's message and follow his journey, I was rewarded, as I read the final chapter, &quot;Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling&quot;, with openly crying (this was in public, and I'm a six-foot, 230 lb. guy!!). If this book doesn't have a similar effect on you, then my only guess is that the child in you has died, or at least has not had much say in your life of late.By the way, if you enjoyed this book on the same type of level I did (see above), I highly recommend 2 other books - one a well-known classic, JD Salinger's &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, and one which in my opinion is destined to become a modern classic, &quot;Borderliners&quot; by Peter Hoeg, a Danish author."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book is disjointed somehow. It consists of 5 novellas that are loosely tied together. The first part, on Bobby Garfield in 1960, is the best of the lot, almost magical, and the most Steven King-like--but then the book shifts abruptly to another time and place in a whole different genre (introspective realism, for lack of a better term) and bores the reader with page after page of card games and cafeteria food. The 3rd novella didn't make a whole lot of sense and didn't come to &quot;closure.&quot; Finally, in the last part, King tries to sew all this together, but there are so many loose ends it's impossible (just who were the Breakers supposed to be?)Plus, King never really gets inside the heads of these characters to provide insight into their motivations. Where the main female character, Carol, is concerned, that's a real shame. I grew up in the 60s in the area where this book takes place and I can tell you it completely misses the spirit of the times. Despite my disappointment, I'll still remain a Steven King fan."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I liked this book. It had several different stories. I liked them all, I just didn't get how they related. I kept waiting for them all to come together. I feel like I missed a chapter or something. Worth the read, just expect to be confused at the end!!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book held me so close I couldn't quit listening, \\"reading\\", (audiobook). Stephen King has put out so many novels, and this one truly shows you that he is thee master of the typewriter. The story does not come at you immediately, but once it bites, your are in its grips. Then I went to the Movie version of this book. How truly sad. I had to immediately go re-read, (listen), to the book again just to make sure that I had not mad a mistake and I loved it more the second time....Stephen King is great and he is training Peter Straub (who may really need no training because he is awsome), to be great. Book was A+++++"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is the King of yesteryear. A very tight book- well conceived and very emotionally captivating. The book is divided into the three sections of very different lengths. The first section is terrific. The second section was interesting but I wasn't sure where it was going (not as riveting as Section 1). And then came the tidy little ending- the last section- which pulled all of those little loose ends together adding a poignant twist that'll bring a tear to your eye. A touch of the old supernatural from Mr. King. He knows how to do it right."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Don't let yourself catch by the title of this review. But as I see you did.. Unfortunately there isn't that much about the Dark Tower in Hearts in Atlantis but the long readers of king won't be disappointet anyway. The book, actually I listened the unabridged version of the audiobook, is great. The stories are fresh, deep, funny, sad (really), colorfull and you will get cought by them. And if you were a reader and are, like me, desperatly waiting on some news from the Dark Tower you will get some news of the &quot;crimson king&quot;... listen/read for yourself. Maybe a word to the Audiobook of Hearts of Atlantis... Great. William Hurt and Stephen King are reading. First I thought that maybe William Hurt's reading style is a bit dozy but hey, he takes you in before you know it. The second story is read by King himself and the change of style is big. Anyway, excuse my english, I'm from Switzerland (and not a low man with a yellow coat...)"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I quickly learned that the description on the back of the book did not do Hearts in Atlantis justice. A 70's child, I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to connect to most of the content here. I was in for a pleasant surprise! I was hooked immediately. Actually comprised of different stories (all from people who start out in the same town), it was very interesting to see how things were going to play out. King's observations of the sixties and especially the Vietnam War were amazing. He has such an ability to express ideas and emotions!Was it any accident that I just finished reading (finally) Wizard and Glass right before? As a fan of the Dark Tower series, I was especially thrilled with the &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot;, and how it tied in with the Dark Tower. If there are other readers who are wondering why the tie-in, I'd like to quote from the Afterword from Wizard and Glass:&quot;...I am coming to understand that Roland's world (or worlds) actually contains all the others of my making; there is a place in Mid-World for Randall Flagg, Ralph Roberts, the wandering boys from The Eyes of the Dragon, even Father Callahan, the damned priest from 'Salem's Lot, who rode out of New England on a Greyhound Bus and wound up dwelling on the border of a terrible Mid-World land called Thunderclap.&quot;And now we can add the likes of Bobby Garfield to that list.I think that you can still enjoy Hearts in Atlantis without being familiar with the Dark Tower series (if you aren't, just think along the lines of X-Files). This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"\\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" is a work that definitely shows a maturing King. Then again, once could see King was maturing, ever since works like \\"The Green Mile\\" onwards. From that book onwards, even from a few books back, King showed himself less concerned with relying on gore and scares, and portraying more character-driven plots, in more humane situations. Granted, that \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" seems to be a King paying a visit to the old familiar grounds he had trodden on years before. But that was it. This book is a homage to the 60's. While it works, on one level, as this homage, this tribute, it is not something you would associate with King having written.King has been first and foremost a horror writer, \\"America's literary boogeyman\\" as the Press referred to him at one time. Sure, as he got older, he ventured into newer, more mature directions, but there was always the element that made him famous, present in his works.Hearts in Atlantis, except the first story (that incidentally is more than half the book's length) is a complete departure from the style we all know King for. I am not too sure I liked what I read. If King continues on this very same path maybe I'll think twice (for the very first time in my life) before buying another book of his.I am terribly sorry, but this book just didn't cut it. Maybe because I wasn't around in the 60's, this book didn't have the meaning it should have, I guess. It just lacked in King's usual, traditional elements. Sure, it had memorable characters, done in a way that only King could...making you either care for them, or despise them. Then again, it ended and did so leaving me dissatisfied. Several questions hung in the air, unresolved. Was it King's intention to do so, or just sloppy editing?I am a writer, myself, and I pride myself in always tying up the loose ends in my stories so my readers never stay wondering. I hope he'd do the same...Sorry Steve."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The first King book I ever read was &quot;Christine,&quot; which I finished cover-to-cover during a week's vacation to Maine when I was 12. It scared me to death. Thereafter, I was a King fanatic, reading every King title I could get my hands on up to and through high school (my favorite being the &quot;Shining&quot; and the &quot;Gunslinger&quot;). At some point, however, I grew tired of King's writing style and completely abandoned his books, except for the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series. I even gave up on that eventually, putting down the &quot;Waste Lands&quot; halfway through because I thought the series was becoming something far different and much less interesting than what King had masterfully started in the &quot;Gunslinger.&quot;Then along came &quot;Hearts in Atlantis,&quot; which I noticed was garnering a lot of positive attention in the press, as well as on this site. Coincidentially, just before I was about to head back to Maine for a vacation, a friend of mine mentioned he enjoyed reading it. I figured, what the heck, why not give King another try?I'm glad I did, it was well worth the effort. King has come a long way from &quot;Christine,&quot; or even the &quot;Gunslinger,&quot; which I'm sure comes as no suprise to his fans that have stuck with him through the years. King's reputation for being a superficial, crowd-pleaser-type of author who's writing doesn't justify his income -- if still maintained -- is completely unwarranted; &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; alone has more depth, style and substance than all of John Grisham's novels combined.&quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; is really five interconnecting stories which span the Summer of 1960 to the present day, with Vietnam (and other relevant events from the 60's) serving as an ominous backdrop. The best story is &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats,&quot; a coming-of-age story set in Harwich, Connecticut that introduces the characters (as children) who appear in the remaining four stories. The story has a supernatural element, involving the titular &quot;low men,&quot; that really (for me, anyway) captures the essence of &quot;growing up,&quot; i.e., the loss of innocence. Bobby Garfield (the main character), a relatively innocent eleven -year-old boy, loses his innocence by the end of the story when he realizes that monsters really do exist, and that greater nightmares than any child could possibly imagine are lying in wait for you as an adult.Perhaps for the characters in &quot;Low Men,&quot; that nightmare is the Vietnam war. In the remaining four stories, Vietnam becomes an increasingly important factor in the characters' lives. &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; centers around a group of slacking college students wrapped up in a dorm-wide card game for money, who all run the risk of flunking out of school and getting drafted. At the same time, the story details the narrator's doomed romantic relationship with a girl who gets swept up in the anti-war movement. &quot;Why We're In Vietnam&quot; and &quot;Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling&quot; examines the lingering effects of Vietnam on its' survivors.The remaining story (and third in sequence in the novel) is &quot;Blind Willie,&quot; which follows a day in the life of a Vietnam veteran who's just trying to earn a living. This story was my least favorite because it seemed forced and out of place, and because it reminded me of King's earlier work (which comes as no suprise as the author himself notes that it's actually a remake of a short story he wrote and published several years ago). That said, the story is short enough and darkly clever enough for me not to quibble about it any further.And, for anyone who thinks King can't satisfactorily end a novel, &quot;Heavenly Shades&quot; cleverly ties all five stories together, and ends the novel on a very mature note (no pun intended, you'll understand after reading the book).All in all, &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; is a great read, and I look forward to what King will serve up next."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"If you grew up in the 60s as I did, this is a must read for you. I really enjoyed the entire book but my favorite parts were &quot;Low Men...&quot; and &quot;Heavenly Shades...&quot;. I have not read King's Dark Towers series but will be purchasing it to get a better understanding of Ted and the low men. It seems this must have been a very difficult book for Mr. King to write, the Viet Nam parts were gut wrenching for me and hopefully cathartic for him to write. I could not stop crying while reading &quot;Heavenly Shades...&quot;, especially the paragraph about magic and the purpose of childhood. It was a magical novel and I was sorry to see it end. Peace."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I had put off listening to the unabridged book on tape because it's rare that I truly enjoy short novels, short stories or anthologies of that nature. This book amazed me because even though it does consist of five distinctly different stories, Steven King brilliantly wove them together in such a way that the powerful threads snared me. I became ever more entangled emotionally in the stories as they progressed and secrets were artfully revealed.We do discover in the first story that THE DARK TOWER still stands and that the gunslinger is still hard at work (good for us fans to know who have been waiting forever for news of those exploits). That is pure, fun genius. King is at his best. Delightfully sly! The only complaint I really have is about the swearing. Particularly in the final story, the obscene language spoken in dialog between two Vietnam buddies just became outright boring listening. That said, the book closed graciously and still haunts me with sweet tenderness.Being a Baby Boomer myself, the book brought back many almost-forgotten memories. It also allowed me to see certain events and activities differently and perhaps with more open-mindedness. While each story had its own distinct \`flavor', together they satisfied in a way that is difficult to explain. Steven King makes characters live and breathe in that unique way of his. The book spoke to me on many levels, but most memorably, it spoke of innocence and of our loss of that innocence. Entertaining!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"H.I.A. is worth the price of the book for just the first story which is half of the book. I loved it.

All the things we love about King were in that. I particulary liked the way the character/circumstance were linked to previous novels. ( I just LOVE the way he does that). The second one I started out being dubious about, but stuck with it and was rewarded.I enjoyed all the tales and the way the intertwined worked incredibly well. A definate buy!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I am an avid Stephen King fan, and have read everything that he has written. This book has to be right near the top of the pile when it comes to rating his work.

If you're a true fan of Stephen King's work you will not be disappointed"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Don't take me wrong - this is not a bad book, and you may enjoy it. But the book is getting only 2 starts from me. The book is three (or was it four?) short stories that are somewhat connected (common characters at different periods of their life). The writing is good as usual, it's Stephen King after all. The story is almost non-existing. At least there is no original story that I love many other Stephen King's books for. If I could turn the clock back, I probably would not have spent my time on reading this again."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Yes indeed this is yet another great story by the master Stephen King. The movie was good but, as usual, the book is a hundred times better."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis is definitly not King at his best.

Learn how you should stand up for what you believe in and that life shound't be wasted doing things you may regret later in your life.If you don't read this I don't blame you. The first couple of sections were pretty well done, but through the rest of the book I had to force myself to finish."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"You MUST read this book. It is just incredible. It is also totally out of character for Stephen King. Being an avid reader of his books, i would know. This book wasn't your classic horror or suspense, but it still had the intricate plot of Kings. The story shifts from place to place, and as new characters are introduced, you realize that they are really old friends....Its is a twisting but intriging plot and a book that you must read before you can say that you've read Stephen King - or any good book for that matter."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I, like many of the other reviewers, was disappointed in this book. The first story was interesting and I enjoyed it, but it went down hill from there. I kept waiting for him to tie it all together at the end, and it seemed like he was going to, but it just didn't happen; At least not for me. There were just too many unanswered questions... like who were the breakers? Who were the &quot;low men&quot;? How did the glove go from &quot;Blind Willy&quot; to Sully? What did Willy ever do about the cop?"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I'm just 20, but I must say that this book brought the Vietnam War and the 1960s and 70s into a better light than any other fiction that I've read. You get a feel that King is writing from personal experience most of the time. King is at his best when he identifies totally with the subject of his story, as with novels such as It. This is a great book, and it apparently sheds some light on to the Dark Tower series as well as Insomnia, although not a lot, via the character of Ted.If you are a King fan, give this a read. If not, do it anyway. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I love King's work and have read about six of his books. My favorate was &quot;It&quot;. Even though I didn't grow up in the 60's/Vietnam, it was interesting reading about the time. I think think each story on it's own was great but, toward the end I kept waiting for a &quot;full circle&quot; (as Mr. King would say) back to the events in the begining, just insignificant references. There was just too little relationship between how the story began and how it ended. That's why I didn't give 5 stars."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is another great job by Stephen King. Although it is a lot different than everything he's written in the past it is still very good. You should know, however, that this isn't one big novel. It is a collection of 5 short stories.The first story: Low men in yellow coats is probably the best one. It's also the longest one too. It's mainly about a boy who has a new elder friend who lives in the apartment house upstairs. They both share a lot of the same hobbies. This old man however has some problems that arise. I'll just leave it at that.The second story is the title story and it's just about college kids starting to fail classes because they have become obsessed with playing the game hearts. Also the main character has some issues in the story containing a girlfriend.The other stories are pretty dumb but are VERY short.All in all this is a great selection of stories. However, I thought there would be a little more suspense in them. But they were still great reads. I didn't really get anything out of the last three and maybe you won't either but the first two are worth it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I read this with some doubts at the beginning, hearing and reading mixed reviews, but as I got into the first few chapters I began to enjoy it very much. When I read the synopsis, I thought 'well maybe the negative reviews were right.' Good thing I chose to ignore them! Certainly not his best work, but not bad at all."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Despite it's usual placement among Stephen King's works as strange, &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; impacted me greatly. As one obsessed with the sixties, this book was both accurate and entertaining, detailing the lives of several characters as the legacy of the vietnam war continues from the sixties to present times. A marvelous and richly told story."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I really liked the way in which each short story weaved its way into the next. It kept me reading."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis is a series of interconnected novellas and short stories all focusing on a small group of similar characters and spanning from 1960 to 1999. King successfully weaves these characters into the various stories, but still fars short in some areas.The first story is \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats,\\" which is the longest and by far the most poignant of the collection. The story deals with Bobby Garfield and his widdowed mother, Liz, who live in an apartment building in Conneticuit. Bobby and his mother don't get along well, but Bobby still has a rather happy childhood palling around with his best friends, \\"Sully\\" John Sullivan and Carol Gerber. But Bobby's childhood is beginning to change when an old sourjourner by the name of Ted Brautigan moves into the upstairs apartment. Ted becomes the father that Bobby never knew and teaches him about literature--particulary William Golding's Lord of the Flies. But Ted is prone to blackouts and asks Bobby to look out for \\"low men in yellow coats\\" who are after Ted (supposively they have to do with the Dark Tower series, but I haven't read any of those). Although Ted is Bobby's friend, he causes Bobby to see the dark side of human nature, an idea that catalyzes the end of Bobby's childhood. This story is the basis from which all of the other stories stem and has the best characterization and plot.The second story \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" is told by Pete Riley, a student at the University of Maine that is in danger of flunking out on account of his addiction to the card game hearts. Carol Gerber reappears as a love interest for Pete and becomes an aspiring activist. This story presents portents of the activist movements of the \\"hippies\\" to protest the war. Overall, I found this story a bit mawkish because it had too much card playing in it and never really drove the nail in about the whole \\"hippie\\" movement.The next two stories are shorter and rather inchoate. The third story, \\"Blind Willie\\" is undoubtly the weakest in the book. It deals with Willie Shearman, who made a minor appearance in \\"Low Men...\\" and his life after serving in Vietnam. Apparently, Willie is inveigling money by dressing up as a washed out Vet and panhandling. Needless to say, I didn't get the point. The fourth story \\"Why Were in Vietnam\\" deals with \\"Sully\\" John Sullivan and his flashback to Vietnam. Although I did like parts of this story, ultimately I felt that King's descriptions of Vietnam were feigned and only put into the book because he could not write a book about the 60s without mentioning it.The final story, \\"Heavenly Shades of Night are Falling,\\" deals with Bobby again, is short, and wraps up the book quite well.The overall theme of Hearts in Atlantis, is the loss of childhood innocence which is experienced by all of the main characters in one way or another. To illustrate this theme, King alludes to Goldings' Lord of the Flies frequently throughout the stories. For example, Bobby has a dream where the characters from the novel are hunting his mother, and one of Sully's flashbacks deals with a soldier saying that he was going to mount a Vietminese woman's head on a stick. King has said that he wished that he had written written Lord of the Flies, and this is his version of it. But in this version, the boys from the island have grown up and the jungle is Vietnam. King does do a good job of incorporating that novel into his own work, but he does it to such a degree that anyone who has not read Lord of the Flies will be lost, and Hearts in Atlantis will ruin the ending of that book.Overall, King steps out of his horror-comfort zone for this book. It is good, but not great. It is a little too similar to It in its themes, but not as well crafted. And the metaphor of America as Atlantis sinking from the weigh of the sixities didn't really seem to stick with me. It seems that King has written a book that some literary critics may be interested in analysing, but may be a bit insipid for his horror fan-base. Pick this book up if you like Lord of the Flies and other such themes or are one of those people who want to read everything that King has written. Sorry, but no matter how hard you try, you cannot re-write Lord of the Flies. But Hearts in Atlantis is not a bad attempt."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"My review is specifically about the CD audio book version of Hearts in Atlantis. I was impressed by the story line and the complexity King wove into the characters and situations. There are several powerful emotional moments that made me sit and listen longer than I should have - people were waiting for me! As noted elsewhere, the book itself is actually 5 novellas. The 1st, 4th and 5th are read my William Hurt, the accomplished actor. Novellas 2 and 3 are read by King himself. Hurt is a much better reader, and his slow, lazy delivery initially hides the complexity and depth of his voice characterizations. King is not an actor, but he does well enough. I think the 1st novella is a stand-alone volume, worhty of a 4 or 5 star rating on its own. The 2nd story is laced with profanity which I found difficult to listen to. Things pick up again when Hurt resumes reading in the 4th story. From the 4th story onward, I couldn't wait to get to the end! I was hooked!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I tried to listen to this audiobook while driving... I WANTED to listen to this book... but William Hurt reads SOOOOOO SLOOOOOOW and like some smarmy college professor trying to impress people with his reading inflections. It was so bad that I couldn't make it through the first chapter. Maybe I'll try it again when I have a speed control or if someone else reads it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I'm not a big thriller fan, and this is not a thriller. I want to read more king books because of this one."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis started out as a very interesting novel. As always, King is superb when dealing with the feelings and thoughts of a child (the main character of part I is an eleven-year-old boy). Everything &quot;realistic&quot; works just fine. The fantasy part of the story, though, did not work for me - and that's probably because although I'm a King fan I haven't read the Dark Tower books, and as a result certain plot details and some of the dialogue felt very unfamiliar to me.Moving on from part I, I felt less and less interested in this book. Maybe because this particular take on the Viet Nam war and its effects on the US didn't really reach out to me (I'm a Swede). Maybe you had to be there, had to live it, to fully enjoy King's book. I can't say &quot;That's just the way it was&quot; or &quot;No, that wasn't the way it was at all&quot;. In short, I'm not sure if King has captured the essence of that era or if he hasn't.The prose is, as always, terrific, but the novel itself left me feeling disappointed. Not only because I didn't feel it touched me, but also because the first part is decidedly the best part. That's never good in a book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis is divided into five individual books that are all linked together by the events and the characters therein.Low Men In Yellow CoatsDuring the summer of 1960 Connecticut, Bobby Garfield befriends Ted Brautigan, the old man who just moved into the third floor apartment in Bobby's building. Though his mother doesn't trust a man who moves in with only a few shopping bags containing all of his possessions, Bobby and Ted share a common interest: the love of reading. Between reading The Lord of the Flies and other books, Bobby hangs out with his two best friends, Carol and Sully-John. As the events of that summer unfold, it will change each of them forever.When strange messages and signs start to appear in the town, Ted knows the \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" are getting close. He has something they want but they'll have to find him first to get it.The \\"Low Men\\" are something more evil than Bobby could ever imagine - something out of this world. He learns of an unknown war that is happening far away, and all things serve the Beam.Hearts In AtlantisIn 1966, Pete Riley and his friends become obsessed with a tournament of the Hearts card game. While they continuously lose money and struggle to stay in the university, the effects of the war in faraway Vietnam slowly creep into their lives.Pete's girlfriend, a good-girl turned a fanatical peace advocate, gives him a copy of her old friend Bobby's favorite book, The Lord of the Flies, symbolizing the war in Vietnam.Blind WillieEach day in New York City, 1983, William Shearman transforms into other men as part of brilliant scheme: Bill, a family man in the business world, Willie the plumber, and Blind Willie, a beggar on Fifth Avenue who lost his sight in Vietnam.But no matter who he is, he cannot escape his penance. He must forever carry the brutal crime he committed against a little girl during the summer of 1960, the crimes he committed in Vietnam and the crime he may be about to commit.Why We're In VietnamIn 1999, Sully John recalls the war of Vietnam where the lives of most of the novel's characters are tied together: the man who saved his life while crying out \\"I'm blind! I'm blind!,\\" another man who brutally murdered the old Vietnamese mamasan (who forever haunts Sully-John) and even the lieutenant who ordered the death of one of his own soldiers.While Sully reflects upon the lives affected by the war, he realizes all have been robbed of the same important things over time. He reflects on the struggle to survive our own internal conflicts.Heavenly Shades Of Night Are FallingAfter four decades, Bobby is brought back to the town where his youth ended the summer of 1960. The same year when youth ended for many of the novel's characters and their testing soon began during the Vietnam War. A time of testing some of them want to forget but can't.The theme of the sixties is brought to life once again as Stephen King takes us back to a time when the country was torn between peace and war. A time which proves that people can be chaotic or orderly depending on their given circumstances and accountability, as demonstrated brilliantly in the novel."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"In this new book by Stephen King, we are presented five stories, each with an omniscent title that we can only wonder what they mean...\\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" demonstrates the ultimate fact that King may be running out of ideas. The reason being is that if you look into his novels, they can all be tied into the \\"Drak Tower\\" series, which is tied into the novel \\"The Stand\\" very slightly. All and all, the story is good, but the ending is rediculous.\\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" is the second story in the book, and by far the best work that King has ever written. It presents forth a college student and his friends who, if they cannot keep their grades up in college, will be drafted into the Vietnam War. This story portrays the mixed emotions that people felt in the sixties, as well as giving a human side to why students would go risk their lives just for a game...\\"We Were in Vietnam\\" and \\"Blind Willie\\" were two stories that portrayed what had happened two some of the characters from \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats,\\" and the give the feel that after the Vietnam War, the lives of some may have gotten better, but they still had to deal with their own personal demons from their past, as well as seeing their own mortailty...\\"Heavnely Shades of Night Falling\\" flashes forward about thirty years to show us what has brought Bobby Grafield home. Extremely short, it gives insight into Bobby's life since the end of the first story, as well as reunites him with a lost piece of his past. This story demonstrates that King needed a page filler, and was probably working on a deadline.Overall, by the book for the second story, because it is by far the best and most captivating."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The first half of Hearts in Atlantis is no doubt one of the best pieces of writing I have EVER read.It is about a boy,Bobby, who has become friends with a mysterious old man (Ted) that lives on the floor above them.Bobby deals with new friends,old friends,his mother,and many,many changes,but Ted is always there.He is like a father/friend to him.But Bobby notices throughout the first half of the book that Ted is a little different.He has blanks and mumbles about nonsense sometimes,and as the heart of the story unwravels,you will discover the meaning for it.The second half of the book is another story...literally...It had nothing to do with the first half,and lost my interest very fast.It did not have the same kind of story and writing to it that made me interested in the first half,and i was disappointed.Although the second half did not catch my eye,this book is definently worth picking up,whether your a stephen King fan or not."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This review is for the UNABRIDGED audio cassette version.If you first saw the movie Hearts in Atlantis, you probably felt happy being on the 'inside' of the book - listening to the details of Ted, Bobby and the kids. All the magic that was left out of the film was waiting for you here in the book. Then, as the book progressed, I am certain that you were wondering what the heck was going on!...If however you read the book first before seeing the film, then I'd imagine you were hoping, outta your mind mad. I know I would have been.I saw the movie first and then listened to the unabridged (don't EVER listen to anything abridged) audio version. The book is read by William Hurt and Stephen King. The beginning is read by Hurt. The book was slow to start and there were several times I thought I would put the book up - it just could not keep me interested-even though these were the details that were missing in the movie. The pace was so slow, particularly for a King novel.However - a few weeks before I listened to this book, I listened to Stephen King's \\"On Writing,\\" and he said he likes to tell a story slowly sometimes... and because I adore his pen, I continued on.William Hurt is Bobby Garfield in the book (and the grown-up Garfield in the film). His voice and animation deserves some sort of audio book award - it was captivating (and the reason the audio version is 16 tapes!). I felt a true range of emotions from all the characters in the book from Hurt's voice and tone.The first part of the story progressed slowly - the parts with early Bobby, Carol, Sully, Ted, Bobby's mom and the barking dog (which Hurt barked out for us). Then, it switched gears - and King took over the reading. I was fascinated at his description of Hearts, and enjoyed listening to them 'Chase the [female dog]'. Old characters and new characters intertwined by fate and circumstance. The third part of the book, a graphic account of Vietnam took me to the Green and we meet up again with old and more recent characters in the book. Again, their lives twisting together with time and places. At the end of the book, Hurt once again is Bobby Garfield. I felt the age of Bobby (in his 50s) in his voice. The union of two 'first love soul mates' was a nice touch from King.Again, Hurt's acting and animation of the characters deserves an ovation. With each book I read of Stephen King, I feel him as a person. I must say, listening to him read his own words is like chasing the [female dog] to me."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Oh dear... Stephen King has presumably given up, after reading nearly all of his previous books, and marvelling at his imagination and just having been totally impressed by his wonderful books - I'll be the first to NOT run out and buy his next tome. The first story &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; really whet my appetite, with references to his series &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;. It was a genuinely interesting tale, and left me feeling the rest of the book would be worth reading. However... I only read the rest of the book in the mis-guided belief that there was a point to all the rest of the dross. Alas no, while I'll concede the title story looked like it may have been going somewhere - by Kings standards it completely failed - this was unlike any of his other books - which all seemed to have a plot and a significant ending. I got the impression the whole purpose of this story was to arrange for a group of children to carry a friend in need - which was similar to an event in the first story. It just didn't need 144 pages, and an obsesison with a card game to tell it. I dont really know what the end was all about - I'd lost all interest by then and had given up on reading a good ending. I thought The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon was bad enough, but PLEASE STOP RESTING ON YOUR LAURELS MR KING... I'm looking forward to the next edition of The Dark Tower, but worried King will churn out more mediocre drivel instead of putting any effort into something to rival his previous works of masterpiece. In summary to all King fans, buy this book to complete your collection, and either dont bother reading it or only read the first story and keep your book in REALLY good condition."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book was a great read if you know the style of Stephen King. Since this was thefirst Stephen King novel I have ever read I feel that I missed an important part to thereading.The beginning of the story is about a young boy, Bobby Garfield, who's mother has veryrelentless feelings toward him. She seems to ruin his life without even trying. It was verycaptivating with the many adventures that he encounters. Then the story switches gearsto a new character. At this point of the story I was real perplexed about who this PeteRiley was. I began to think that it was Bobby a few years later. It turns out that it isabout an man in his late teens who goes to college but ends up getting addicted togambling with his roommates. Although it did have some connection to the first story.Carol Gerber was Bobby Garfield's first love. She ends up being great main characterthroughout the entire book. King uses great description of the sixties and the Vietnamwar. He seems to bring the past to life. He uses the many peace rallies and the draftvividly. He connects each character to the war.The next mini story takes place with a character from the first story. He turns out to besomeone that he is not. He has many personalities and it was very confusing to see whereKing was coming from.The end of the book refers to the first story and towards the end he had lost my interest tokeep reading.It was disappointing that Carol Gerber seems to be the main character. She does not havemuch depth to her. She is the character that everyone can relate to, but she does not keepthe reader interested as a main character should.These stories are very loosely tied together and that is was makes it confusing. I thinkthat King had many meanings to the story, but they were very hard to grasp. This book isa great read if you understand Stephen King. Hearts in Atlantis is not good beginnerbook, if you do not read Stephen King."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I was a great Stephen King fan but my interest in him dwindled rapidly over the years. After receiving two copies of this book for Christmas, I decided to give him a second (third, fourth, fifth...) chance in the hope that Mr. King had regained his old writing skills. Unfortunately this book confirmed for me has not. I really advise any newcomers to Stephen King to read his early works like Carrie, Different Seasons, Pet Sematary, Night Shift, The Stand, etc. Anything else will only prove to be a disappointment."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The only reason Hearts even got one star from me is that it was written by Mr. King. The literary content was worth the read but not the story. Although I felt the way all three stories overlapped (reminicent of The Regulators and Desperation) was clever, the story just didn't do it for me.Believe me when I say that I was so hoping I'd love it! I read a Carrie paperback in the fall of 1974 wrapped in a blanket, curled up in a chair on our porch and have been King-hooked ever since. Many of his books have made it past my eyes twice and now, since a lot are on tape, I have &quot;listened&quot; to many of them again and again. His books are so character driven that it's like visiting with old friends when I reread them! Usually I hate getting to the end of a King book because I have to &quot;say goodbye&quot; to those I've met within but with Hearts in Atlantis, I never really felt like I knew any of the characters at all.Don't worry, Mr. King, I am still your greatest fan (although no stalker as in Misery) and cannot wait for your next novel. I'm sure you are writing up a storm (er, pardon the pun). I have downloaded The Plant (sent the $1.00 and everything!) and find your unconventional style in that quite interesting. By the way, Carlos Detweiller could be a distant relative of mine!So, to all the other King fans out there, by all means read Hearts in Atlantis! It certainly may be your cup of tea even though it wasn't mine. dd"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I don't know why Mr. King felt the need to chime in on his Sixties views now, after more than 25 years of popular writing. I'm sick of hippies and their sob-stories--&quot;oh how will we get over, man? How? No more college, man. No more protests, man. No more tie-dyed, rose-colored acid trips, man.&quot; Who cares? Do hippies really care at this point? I'm guessing no. What Mr. King should've done was keep &quot;low men in yellow coats&quot;, the books first and longest story (and one of the author's best, I might add; in the same league with his early masterpieces, like The Body) and thrown away the rest. They're all monotonous, mirky and miserable--and in one case, just flat-out stupid. Mr. King needs to be a more efficient editor of his work."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I love Stephen King, I'm a huge fan, however I prefer it when he scares me. Low Men in Yellow Coats, the first story in this book is in that vein. It reminded me a lot of Insomnia and even Needful Things. I really liked the other stories but I didn't think they hung together very well. It was almost like King was trying to please his fans (who like to be scared - story 1) while being a *serious* writer as well (the other stories). Does he care that much about critical opinion? I noticed in Low Men that he makes some poorly veiled digs at literary critics (eg. about *real writers*) - does he have a complex that his writing is not taken seriously? My advice Steve if you're reading this (as if) is to forget the critics and think of your adoring fans - write for us, and scare us stupid, please!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I read this book as I read all previous King's books. I really enjoyed the fist story (Low Men in Yellow Coats) but I was completely surprised by the second one as I was not expected different stories but a novel. Those stories are too close to be read separately but not enough to be a novel as they're all linked together. I read most of the stories wondering how the circle will close at the end (as you can expect with King). For the fans only."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Nowhere on the label does it say Stephen King is reading any of this book. If it did, I would never have bought the CD. The first story is read by a very good reader. The rest is not -- at least so far as I can tell. I listened to King read for 5 more disks and that was all I could stand. I don't know how much of it he actually reads. I feel this was trick labeling of the CD and I will never buy another Stephen King audio book for fear it will not tell the truth about who is reading."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I loved the movie so much that I wanted to read the book. The book had dark and creepy undertones, where the movie didn't show that at all. The movies made growing up in the sixties look fun, the book was strange, for example cars weren't really cars, they were alive. Movie was great, book not so much."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I just don't understand the hype about this one.This book was a big yawn, and I realized this early on, but I continued reading all 700,000 pages (so it seemed), hoping for an eye opening ending. I never got it.First off, maybe somebody needs to help me understand the need for splitting the book into two completely different stories? Stories that had no climax nor reason, and where the 1st 'story' had no ending!!I would not recommend this to anybody who likes a page turner. Maybe you just truly have to be a King fan?"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I love reading King. From his finest (The Stand, The Dark Tower series, Bag of Bones) to his, well, clunkiest (The TommyKnockers, Christine). They all contain the greatest sense of drama, most intriguing use of description and other things that english majors mull over. But for me nothing beats the way he gets you into a characters head. Brilliant. And that is something he accomplishes so damn well in &quot;Hearts in Atlantis.&quot; Well, at least in &quot;Low Men...&quot;. I just got the book this afternoon and finished the first story an hour ago (its now 11:38 p.m.). Its the kind of story that after you finish you makes you put the book down, catch your breath and then feel thankful for having been given to read. I marvel at Kings skill and thank him writing these spell-binding stories for us to read. May he recover from his accident completely. Thankyou Mr. King."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book is one of Kings Best. I was worried after the release of Storm of the Century and The Girl who Loved Tom Gordon; however, in this book King returns more brillant than ever before. This is a excellent book, and King does an incredible job tying the stories together. Congratulations Mr. King: You have done it again!! GO out and by this book today, you will love it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"In each story Stephen King gives a little bit of himself as well insight into each character.The main character could be any person growing up in the era of the Vietnam war. We all have our ways of dealing with grief, Bobbys mother was young and had a hard time because there was no one to turn to, to say everything is going to be alright."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have to tell you the truth.I only read the excerpt of this book but it was enough to give me hope that stephen king's wisened and matured style evidenced in the great&quot;bag of bones&quot; may finally transform into the level of acclaimed literature, not just yesterday's best seller.I always knew he had it in him;there are hints of serious literature in many of his novels especially in characters'internal emotions that are so close to home sometimes it's scary.When did he write this book,surely not recently? Hope you are having a speedy recovery,mr.King."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"With his new book, King proves he's perhaps America's best popular storyteller. Often his best work has been devoid of supernatural elements, or just using them as an added color to his palette. His strengh is characterization and the narrative drive that only the greatest writers have. His insights into suburban America, into the minds and hearts of the ordinary folk is unparalleled, ironically blowing off the map most of the pretentious, fashionable fodder that is ritually pushed as the flavor of the month by the publishing gatekeepers of cool. The scarier thing about King's fiction is that , if he had had to break his career in the 90's, he would have never been published. The same goes for most of the great popular writers in America today. Luckily, he way beyond the grasp of the shallow, self-important yuppie creeps sitting on editorial and executive posts today. This book has tales about real people, real pain, real fear and real hearts. It tells them with wit, brains and soul. He belongs to that great tradition of Thomas Harris or the early Mario Puzo: a popular writer creating good literature for all. A great writer, and a great book. Let's hope Mr.King gets better soon after his accident and returns to the beat. We may not know it, or even like to aknowledge it, but in these days, we need him. Bravo."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The first story was the best, the sinister 'Low Men' in Low Men in Yellow Coats' are the most chilling evil characters I've experienced in a book since the secret police thug and executioner Boris Pugo in the war novel, The Triumph and the Glory--, i'd give this one five stars but Hearts in Atlantis wasn't all that great, the other three stories were OK."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Will Stephen King retire? Should he retire? Yes and no. Let me illustrate, using HEARTS IN ATLANTIS as a guide.HEARTS In ATLANTIS is really a bunch of novelettes and short stories. The first one is traditional Stephen King. A young kid, Bobby Garfield, gets a job reading to this kindly (and strange) old man, who's being pursued by \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\". Cool-sounding I'll admit, but really only more of the same clown staring up out of a sewer grate.The second one, HEARTS IN ATLANTIS, is more like it. It's about a bunch of college kids sitting around their dorm rooms playing Hearts. They're playing for blood. They skip class, they're flunking out of school, which wouldn't be all that bad if it weren't for Vietnam and the draft. This one is written in the vein of King's best book, MISERY, which had a valid theme (Obsessive fans with no taste) and finger-biting suspense (plausible finger-biting suspense). But King just doesn't trust himself. He doesn't believe the card game story can stand on its own and his editor hasn't got the balls to tell him he doesn't need all that other garbage. Remember THE STAND? An early editor actually made him cut a couple hundred pages of that one. So what does King do? When he gets the clout, he puts the padding back and publishes the thing again (Unfortunately this was the one I had the misfortune to read).There's a scene toward the end of HEARTS where things start falling out of the sky. If you're reading one of King's books, you can count on one of these sooner or later: \\"A vast rummage sale was falling out of the sky: tape recorders and rugs and a riding lawn-mower with the grass-caked blade whirling in its housing and a black lawn-jockey and an aquarium with the fish still swimming in it . . .\\" It goes on for another page. I'm a compulsive sort. I can't skip over anything, including footnotes, but I almost stopped reading after that.Don't get me wrong. I think Stephen King is a great short story writer. Even some of his horror stories are great. I remember one from SKELETON CREW where these people are trapped in a supermarket surrounded by giant bugs. Not exactly Edgar Allen Poe, but it was fun. SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and STAND BY ME were based on his short stories and they were two of his most successful movies. No, King isn't out of ideas; he's just out of clown-down-the-grate ideas. And those were stale after he wrote TOMMYKNOCKERS. IT's time to go straight, Steve. I was hoping you would after MISERY."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The book was written in a way that was different. It was the first king book i have read and it left me confused every time i stopped reading. It took me to a time long before i was born and to a place i have never been. It was hard to understand the extreme drama it shows about the Vietnam era. I was not in that era but when reading this book it obviously shows that the author wanted to tell about the time and place that he lived and how it affected so many people in so many ways. Just about everything in the book speaks the truth of the time but the plot and characters are mainly fictitious.Any other information you want about the book can be found in the editorial reviews."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Well-written, but the stories are so loosely connected that one wonders what the whole point must be. A few brief references to some of King's other stories (I'll let other readers find out about those) but they never really go anywhere, so one must wonder what King has planned for his future works..."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I enjoyed the first story, that in itself should have, in my opinion, been released as a novella and he should have left it alone. From there, it goes all downhill. The second story was good, but nowhere near the quality of the first. Continue this until you reach the end, which leaves you not only wondering where in the hell the plot went, it only brings more questions. The stories seem to make these people not only actors in a play that they so horribly mess up and we are forced to endure their mistakes, it brings us conclusions that make no sense. I'm glad that some closure is brought about by the last story (and relief that it is finally over), it also just makes you angry that the first story wasn't a novel in and of itself. As said before, it could have been better, but it could have been worse. It is no Green Mile, but it was better than Gerald's Rant, er, I mean Game."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Wait 'til this comes out in paperback-- better yet, get it out from your library. The first &quot;story&quot;-- &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot;-- was the only part of this book worth reading. However, hasn't King been through this territory before (i.e. &quot;It&quot;)? He'd have done better to develop that &quot;story&quot; into a stand-alone novel than to string it with the character studies he places after it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"As a recently returned fan of Stephen King's I have just loved his last 3 books. He is a storyteller without rival. This book swept me up and I even found myself checking the supermarket bulletin board for notices."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The master of horror, wit, humor and hair raising prickly skin, has done it again.

Both were excellent and I loved reading them. However, I could have done without the thoroughly forgettable parts two, three, and four. I think what King was trying to do was interesting, to take us through several decades and follow different characters from Harwich, but after such a great start with characters like Bobby and Ted, I felt entirely let down by the middle of the book. That being said, however, I think this book is definitely worth reading. &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; could stand alone as a novel, and a great one at that."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"As with all stories which deal w/VietNam, this carried the shattered lives syndrome which is so extremely sad. Thought he could have gone further with the first part of the book - GREAT story line!!! All in all, a normal S.

While H. in A. was a pretty good book it seemed to be just another &quot;grown up&quot; book of the type we've seen alot lately from King (Rose Madder, Bag of Bones). Come on, dude...where's the scary stuff? Just as I wouldn't listen to Madonna to get a dose of country western, I don't read King to have my heart strings pulled. For what it's worth though, it was his typically excellent writing."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"King's HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is one of his better books. I've read six novels of his and this one has a great plot and awesome character development. I would recommend it to King or nonKing fans.There's another novel out there called 'THE FIST OF GOD' by A.T. Nicholas. It's a phenomenal supernatural thriller!!!!!! The plot has some cool twists and the characters are realistic. The angelic character is real awesome."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I don't know how anyone could not LOVE this book. King successfully brought me into the jungle with the soldiers, back to college and, most importantly, let me revisit my own childhood. It was simply the best novel I have read in the past 5 years."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I can't say he is totally back but I will say he is on his way and getting in the old groove.There are 5 stories total. BUT stories 2-5 hang off story 1. Story 1 being the best and the rest unfortunately, like I said, just sorta hanging there. Especially Blind Willie. Don't expect roller coaster chills and thrills or even a strong ending. I was disappointed at it's lack of hills and valleys..and a strong end but then.... it was still a pleasure just to be reading Stephen King's words. The man has a way with em. His imagination and ability to relate are genius.Anyway, this IS a definite step in the right direction, especially after his two previous debacles, Storm of the Century(peeU) and that The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon (uck!). I didn't like Dark Tower IV either."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"If you're looking for the usual potboiler horror story, look elsewhere. If you are obsessed with tales of fantasy and monsters, look elsewhere.But, if you're looking for a real BOOK, this is it.

Read &quot;Hearts&quot; and you'll know why!!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book must've neen written in a hurry, but King has done it again!! &quot;Hearts&quot; was a surprise around every corner.

On page 225, there is a teeny weeny little allusion to the gunslinger. Here it is for all of you who haven't yet bought the book: &quot;I doubt if the Crimson King will thank you for a meaningless pretty if it interferes with his plans,&quot; Ted said. &quot;There is a gunslinger-&quot; &quot;Gunslinger, pah!&quot; &quot;Yet he and his friends have reached the border of the End World,&quot; Ted said . . . .end book quotation. You'll have to read the book to catch the rest of it. Well, I'll be nice. Except for this one part. &quot;Do I? I wonder. Until the Beams break, the Dark Tower stands-&quot; Seriously, that's pretty much it. Now, I'm not one to hunt for such things, but I thank Mr. King for throwing it in to check all of those zombified somnambulists!!! Hope you catch it, die-hard fans. We AWAIT the next in the Dark Tower series... One last thing to explain: The first chapter of &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; is called &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; and that is who the afore-stated 'Ted' is speaking to before they capture (or is it re-capture?) him. Perhaps these Dickensian &quot;low men&quot; have something to do with the scheme of things? Ah, alas, we must wait to find out. In conclusion, the book was awesome, a real 'trip' (hehe, double entendre ABSOLUTELY intended) from the present day, into the 1960's, and back. Though I am one of the countless millions of so-called blinder-wearing offspring of the &quot;baby-boomer&quot; generation, King still made the war come alive, made it more real than real. Upon banging the book shut, (something first-edition, hardcover books are MADE for) I felt out of place in the world, like the one I just left was too real to NOT be, and the one I lived in now was simply grey and dull; without any semblance of vitality or emotion. And it is only King who can make real life feel as tedious and existance-questioning as if one lived under a Communist regime. Thank you Mr. King. And with all due respect I beg of you to continue the Dark Tower!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I love how these five stories are related by both major and minor characters; the reader is forced to remember the minute details that make Stephen King such a great suspense writer. He constantly collides the real and the fantastic and makes one realize the possibility of all things good and evil. The reader is afraid of both the monsters and the men who they unhabit---the monsters being the Vietnam War, paranoia, and even one's own parents. What a great book!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I enjoyed the book as a whole. The &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Why we are in Vietnam&quot; were a little weak. The &quot;Men in the Yellow Coats&quot; is one of his best. I liked the connection to the Dark Tower series. I hope we get to see Ted and the little men later down the road."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I really liked the way the stories worked together ,especially liked Low men in Yellow Coats, and the next story brought me back to working in a record store with all the college kids &amp; their protests."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I loved Low Men in Yellow Coats, liked Hearts in Atlantis, enjoyed but was a little puzzled by Blind Willie, liked the last story, &amp; hated Why We're in Viet Nam. I do not like to read about the battles. When I read Nelson DeMille's Word of Honor (an excellent, highly-recommended novel), I skipped over most of the battle scenes except the scene at the hospital. Low Men was the one I could not put down. A fine story and one of King's best. I'm waiting for Dark Tower V."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Okay, I don't particulary like King. You go through about 5 horrible books before you get a good one. Also have you noticed his good books don't translate well to the screen?And King makes remarks about persons with disabilities that bother me BUT..This book was outstanding. If you don't buy the audio version you will miss out on a treat of a lifetime. If I'm wrong Ill buy you lunch."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King has done it again. I really enjoyed Hearts of Atlantis. The only drawback I could find was that I felt the story of &quot;Blind Willie&quot; was cut short. Perhaps Mr. King will expand upon him in a revised and longer edition of &quot;Hearts&quot; as he did with &quot;Trashcan Man&quot; in The Stand. One can only hope. Thank you Stephen for many enjoyable hours of reading."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"After finishing HIA, my daughter caught me crying and asked why? I had to tell her that this book made me remember guys who couldn't escape the draft by grades or being too young. King's story telling will make you fall in love with a character, even though they are never truly, physically described."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I fell asleep reading this. As i did with bag of Bones. I suppose when you've made a qaudzillion bucks you can get away with not dealing in horror anymore.oh wait - it is horror. Just a differnet kind of horror. Umm ok...I suppose I'll give it one star then for &quot;horror&quot;Hope he gets back to writing what made him rich in the frist place."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I love Stephen King's work. I've read everything the man has written. But am I the only one who notices the unnecessary racial slurs in his writing? I'm more than halfway through Hearts in Atlantis and I am enjoying it the same way I enjoyed The Tommyknockers, The Stand, Carrie, The Green Mile, and so on. But the consistent use of the &quot;n&quot; word, when it is so easily could be avoided has me a concerned. I think Hearts in Atlantis is another Stephen King triumph (even if I have 200 pages to go). I just hope I won't have to stop reading - and start boycotting - Mr. King - because of this offensive behavior."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I am not an avid reader of Mr. King but this book interested me based on the description. It is broken up into 4 short stories and a prolouge. The first two stories were enjoyable and heartfelt. The other two were just riduculous. King was trying to put so much symbolism into it that it became pretentious. I suggest readign the first two stories and then jump to the prologue."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Having read more than a dozen King books over the years this book made me angry. I feel like I was ripped off on this one for two reasons. One, I lived through the period he wrote of and to have the character who gets the most space in the book have no bigger problem in his life than getting addicted to hearts and falling behind in his studies at the University of Maine is slightly rediculous. Two, the book reads more like a collection of short stories than a novel. The characters in each story are tied together by the flimsiest of plot inserts, so that a character who is barely fleshed out in one part appears in another part as a wholly different character. It seems to me that King must have gotten addicted to hearts while he was writing this one. I give him a C-. It holds your interest but at the end it was all cotton candy!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Contains every demeaning and ignorant cliche there is about the Vietnam war and those of us who fought there. If you read this thing, please buy &quot;Stolen Valor&quot; and &quot;After Tet&quot; and read them for some balance.Mr. King, you're cordially invited to come and stay with us as my guest in Cambodia so you can see the results of the abandonment of the people of Sourtheast Asia due to the antiwar protests you find so neat and cool...you should be ashamed of what you have written."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"For years The Tommyknockers was Stephen King's worst book, but move over, King has hit a new low here. The first story is the one the Anthony Hopkins movie Hearts in Atlantis was based upon. It's a boring tie-in to his Dark Tower series which is a nonsensical mess in itself, but that's another review. But as boring and silly as Low Men in Yellow Coats is, it's the highwater mark for the book. The next story, the title story, is so pointless and stupid I couldn't wait for it to be over. I literally felt tortured but was determined to finsh what I started--no pain no gain, right? If you like the idiotic rantings of drugged out, shiftless college kids playing cards when they should be reading books and learning something, then this is the story for you. Otherwise, spare yourself the pain and go read something by James Patterson. After the title story, the silliness continues but the stories are blessedly shorter so easier to get through. But when I finally closed the book, I had an overwhelming urge to go read The Stand, so I could remember how great Stephen King was in his prime. In fact, if you're new to Stephen King, please don't start here or with Dreamcatcher, The Tommyknockers, Desperation, Insomnia or Rose Madder. Instead try The Stand, Salem's Lot, The Shinning, Misery, It or The Green Mile. Then read this book only for contrast."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis was an effort for me to complete. I wqnted to put it away many times, but forced myself to stay with it. It did redeem itself somewhat, but I can't say i enjoyed it. King seemed to be reaching for something but was unable to find the right words. I have lived through this era, also, and I found his characters to be unbelievable and boring. I had a hard time trying to remember Pete's name (hearts in atlantis) I'm not really sure what King's message was in the book. It was plodding and overdone. king's writing has usually been entertaining and well paced. This was not the case in this try. His voice so strong that it is a distraction. In his effort to try for a depth in his writing he seems to have lost his way and wallows around in verbosity. I'm sorry I wasted my precious summer reading time on this one."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The first half of this book is very, very good. I really like King's novels (GET WELL SOON) and have read nearly all of them. I'm proud to say.But this one... I frankly didn't think that there is a need for the entire Hearts thing. A good chuck of the book is dedicated to how addictive this game is to college students. I was once a college student, our game was pool, I understand. I just didn't need to read pages and pages about it. This may be a thing about Vietnam and that's great, but that deserves it's own book.It got to the point where I was frantically scanning for the names of the three kids that were in the first half of the book. I was severly disappointed when they didn't show up again till the end.I heard that the movie rights have been sold to Castle Rock. I really don't think I'm going to spend money to watch a bunch of kids play cards. That is not going to happen.Defeinitly could be better Mr. King."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Nothing much happens in HEARTS IN ATLANTIS during the 60 pages I read. I have a life, and 60 pages is all I plan to invest in this door-stop.I suspect King forgot how to write horror/thrillers when he was hanging out with Peter Straub. Stevie? Get with Thomas Harris for a refresher course.But I love King's first books."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This story started out with promise with Low Men In Yellow Coats. After that it quickly loses steam. When I buy a Stephen King book I expect to be frightened if not that at least to be entertained. This book did not fufill either desire. I am dissapointed that King did this to his fans who expect a lot more out of him. I wonder if he thinks because he is so succesful that he can just crank out anything he wants and people will just lap it up. Mr King please stick to horror what your good at if I want to read about the sixties I'll read a history book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I really enjoyed this book especially Low Men in Yellow Coats Which has something to do with the Dark Tower and Blind Willie a story of a Vietnam vet who walks around acting like he's blind to get money. The only story I wouldn't give 5 stars to is the title story Hearts in Atlantis which i thought was kind of boring. Why We're in Vietnam is a good story about Bobby's friend John who is haunted by a woman killed in Vietnam. The last story Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling was a good story were we find out what happens to Bobby and Carol when they attend John's funeral. In this story King has put believable characters in an unbelievable situation. Great book"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King is at his best when he is writing non-horror. Just peruse &quot;The Body&quot; or &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; or even &quot;Misery&quot; to see why I say that. In this big book, that includes two novel length stories and three shorter ones, he demonstrates that again. Sure, the first story, &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot;, features some strange looking leftovers from the cast of the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series. Ted Brautigan, who helps the main character, Bobby and his friends, get through life in the early '60s, will be featured in a new &quot;Dark Tower&quot; novel. Ted has healing powers ala John Coffey of &quot;Green Mile&quot; fame.But, to my mind, it is the second story, the full length novel &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;, that really steals the show. The title doesn't refer to love and kisses on some lost continent but rather to the card game and it's role in the lives of young people at the Valhalla of their lifetime, college, with the shadow of Viet Nam hovering over everything they do. Kurt Vonnegut said that college teaches us how we should have behaved in high school. I think college is a dry run for life. I loved this story because King had me in the palm of his hand relating so well to the main character, Pete. I'm the same age as King, so if it was autobiographical for him, I'm right there with him. I even had all the Phil Ochs albums he writes about. I partook of the weekly and nightly hearts games. I had a roomate my freshman year who went from the Deans List to academic probation because of those devil cards. As a geologist, I am amused and mildly miffed that it was geology that was the course Pete struggles with. When Pete returns home on Thanksgiving break with the self promise to buckle down academically and, regarding his draft board, has one foot in a rice patty and one foot on a banana peel, his mom reminds him again of Nam. &quot;Boys are dying over there&quot;. My mother said the same thing to me in 1969. And like Pete, there was a Carol in my life as well. This whole book hits home because anyone who went to college in the '60s will relate to it.While each story in the book may be read independently, if you read them in order, you will see what happens to selective characters throughout each of them. I liked it because the book takes you from the innocence of young childhood to a generation that maybe had to grow up way before its time. &quot;Heavenly Shades of Night are Falling&quot;, the last story, will bring some closure for some of the characters. But King shows us that sometimes the real horror comes not from the devils he and other authors make up, but rather from the devils we know. A great book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Its a personal book. Low men is probably the best story, but it was the title story that really hit me. I'm an Indian, born after the vietnam war and all the things that may make this book significant to US readers, but the title story struck so close to home, the obsession that sweeps through a dorm and leaves a trail of damage, the scholarships at stake, the game that was always going to be the last game, it really took me back, though its been nearly seven years since i left college- so much so that I kept thinking about my college days a week after I finished the book. Any book that can keep me thinking about it for a week afterward, I think, deserves 5 stars. The other stories are good, with probably the exception of &quot;Heavenly Shades of Night are Falling&quot;, but thats probably because it was more of an epilogue than a story."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"One gets the sense that Stephen King is becoming more and more obsessed with honesty, and that Hearts in Atlantis, at least that novella of the same name within the collection, is intensely autobiographical fiction. Some say they are disappointed that King is no longer writing scary stories. Others say that they are glad he's finally writing real stories. I would say that he's writing both, and if you're not scared by the actions of some of the characters in Hearts in Atlantis, you should be, because those characters are every bit as human as you and I.Low Men in Yellow Coats is a coming-of-age story about Bobby Garfield. For the first time, Bobby has to make adult decisions, and like many of us, his decisions are made poorly and people suffer because of it. Saying more would give away the plot, but this is most likely the best of the stories in the collection.A close vote for best would be the novella from which the collection takes its name, Hearts in Atlantis. Tracking the downward spiral an entire dormitory floor takes in the late '60's at the University of Maine, King tells a story which so many college survivors can appreciate. But again, the main character comes of age through his first sexual partner and a chance to defy the powers that be.Blind Willie doesn't seem to fit, but it is a tale of greed and complete moral descent which may epitomize many of the people of King's generation, who sold out peace and love for BMW's and Armani suits. The madness to Willie's method, however, is an interesting look at his psychological state of mind.Why We're in Vietnam continues the melancholy, despairing theme established in Low Men in Yellow Coats. Sully-John, Bobby Garfield's friend from Harwich, is not a Chevy salesman attending the funeral of a fellow platoon member from Vietnam. His companion, however, haunts him all the way home.&quot;Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling&quot; is King's wrap-up piece, in several ways. Bobby Garfield reappears, as do other characters from the collection. The sense of hope which still remains after all else is gone is a familiar theme for King fans, and King's brutal eloquence, honesty, and faith shine especially bright here. Friends and lovers always have a connection, according to King, even if the continent which birthed it has sunk below the sea."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have been a fan of Stephen King since I turned twelve, 18 years ago. His writing is both masterful and intriguing. He possesses an innate ability to delve into the human soul, no matter how dark, and expose it to the light of the printed page. However, with a few exceptions, most of his recent work has been dull at best, derivative at worst. Since Gerald's Game, I have begun to wonder what he's thinking. I still buy his books - loyalty and hope run wide through me - but I am often disappointed. Though rays of distinction do exist (Desperation, Wizard and Glass, Insomnia) Hearts In Atlantis is not one of them. I awarded both stars for the first story in this collection of five. The second story, though interesting, went nowhere. I read the last three because I'm a completist and hate to leave a book unread. King is writing better than ever. No one can spin a yarn so masterfully or entice readers into a plot with as much craft he, but, perhaps due to his early string of precedents for high standards, his novels have slowly become less engaging. Several since and including Gerald's Game should have been short stories. I've always felt that a novel should not just be longer than a short story but should also achieve a higher level of complexity. More than that, though, it should be interesting. During the third story in Hearts In Atlantis, I began to wonder if I should get checked out for ADD. Stephen King's gift for writing seems to be growing disproportionately with his gift for creating unique plot twists. I hope that changes. He is, after all, still the King."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This was a very easy read.Even though I read it more than 4 months ago, I can remember every page. You really get to know the characters and bond with them. This is great for a vacation or a few nights of bad weather. Get it, Read it, Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I've been one of Stephen King's Constant Readers for fifteen years now. I was 12 when I caught the reading bug big-time (from a book called &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;), and have thankfully never been cured of it. Reading has probably been the greatest pleasure in my life, and Stephen King's been there with me like an old friend from the beginning. For years, my favorite book of his was &quot;It.&quot; I just love the way Stephen King can so accurately and knowingly evoke the wonders of childhood, and make you so glad to be alive and to make you feel, from your own experiences, that you know exactly what he's talking about (even if you grew up in the '80s instead of in the '50s). He's got a terrific imagination and a great sense of story and skill for evoking very deep, stirring human feelings. I've read every book Stephen King has written, and though I've enjoyed many of his recent books, I've felt that most of them weren't on the par with his best writing (I would make the exceptions of the excellent &quot;Green Mile&quot; and the better parts of &quot;The Dark Tower IV.&quot; That is why I was so pleasantly surprised when I picked up &quot;Hearts in Atlantis.&quot; I repeatedly found myself setting the book down at the end of a chapter and saying aloud, &quot;Damn, this is a good book.&quot; It really is. A wonderful book from a wonderful writer. If you've ever really loved a Stephen King book, don't think twice about getting this one. You'll be glad you did.If you don't read Stephen King, you should start with &quot;Hearts in Atlantis.&quot; The first two of the five linked stories in the book are as good or better than anything he has ever written, and the other three are quite good, too."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The Heart Of Atlantis is one of the greatest books I have ever read and It will make you want to read more. Stephen King mesmerizes reader with fiction deeply rooted in the Sixties, and explores-through four defining decades-the haunting legacy of the Vietnam War. King probes and unlockes the secrets of his generation for us all. The book is full of danger, full of suspense, and most of all full of heart. It will take you to a place you have never been and a place you will never able to leave, completely."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book is simply amazing. I took it on holiday and read the whole doorstop of a book in 2 days. Firstly this could be the best characterisation king has done since, er let me think,yeah! thats right 'the dark tower' (what do you mean you havent read it....go on, get off your arse and go buy it) as you feel the characters come alive you the more the story progresses. As many know these are a series of interlinked stories, the emphasis on quantity &amp; quality lies within the first two main stories 'low men in yellow coats' and the second 'hearts in atlantis', the last three are relativley short by S. King's standards and generally tie up events that occured within the first two tales. Low men in yellow coats is a tale I cant wait to read again, I mean there is so much in there, you've got bobby, a wonderful little boy who makes a strange friendship with the new lodger in his mothers rent house, a fantastice bully avenging sequence and loads more. It grows progressivley more supernatural as it develops, and although essentially this book is no where near a horror novel, there is one dream sequence that will certainly have some people widening their eyes and putting their hands over their mouths and saying ,'jeeesus'. I will say no more. Humour is ever present and there is also a 'dark tower' tie in which will leave readers of this book and dark tower fans none the wiser..........cheers steve!. Now on to Hearts in Atlantis. I couldnt help but feel that King put his all into this story as it almost flawless. All the way through this tale I kept thinking back to J D Salinger's 'Catcher in the Rye' as it makes a point of telling us how important it is to get on with the things that matter and growing up, rather than dropping out and thinking that loser behaviour is ok and remaining immature. After finishing this tale I said to my girlfriend, &quot;Darling, our children are to read this when they are 13 yrs old!&quot;, (she rolled her eyes to the heavens and carried on reading 'Last Chance Saloon'). The other three as I said earlier tie up the lose ends and if there is a duff tale here its got to be 'blind willie' but its only 10 pages so I refuse to let it spoil the overall quality of the book. Yeah, so thats that, and when I finished this book I started on 'Needful things', which was absolutley brilliant.........what you havent read this either...........!!??"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"THIS is the Stephen King I've been waiting for! Mr. King, unquestionably an extremely talented and prolific writer, had begun to oversaturate the horror market with too many books that were sounding all the same. He lifted himself out of that rut with BAG OF BONES, and now has surpassed himself with the wonderful HEARTS IN ATLANTIS. Five separate, yet interconnecting stories tied together by the underlying themes of the 60's and the Viet Nam war, HEARTS is King at his very best. An obviously autobiographical work, HEARTS is engaging, full of humor, heartfelt introspection and a poignancy all too rare in his earlier novels. If, like me, you'd been burned out by King, read this book...you will NOT be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I hate parroting what sounds like a jacket blurb (in fact, it may have been a blurb), but after reading this book, I had to say &quot;Wow... I never knew King could write this well.&quot; I stopped reading King several books back after a growing feeling that the narrators may be changing but the voice stayed the same; in other words, a feeling of commercialism and formulaic writing. With this book, King steps over into the arena of literature, not merely popular fiction."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I would have to say &quot;Good Job&quot; if I saw Stephen King right now. I really enjoyed the novel. It was full of great writing and characters and it was one of the best by him I have ever read. Being only 16 years old, I can really relate to the Vietnam War through this book. I was really fascinated by how much effect the war really had, even after it was long over. Out of the 5 stories, I would say that &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; was the best. God, I love King's characters. I don't think anyone can do characters as good as he can. Also, the &quot;Blind Willie&quot; one was actually quite funny. Even though he was not a blind man, he was still a Vietnam vet and the book kind of portrayed it like he had a RIGHT to beg. I thought that was very interesting."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"To summarize this book bluntly, it took me 24 hours to read the 500+ pages of this book. The first of the five stories is by far the best mixing elements of horror and teenage love with expertise. The rest of the stories gradually start to fade a bit, with 'Blind Willie' being the complete bottom of the barrel. All in all though, another excellent edition to the King library."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I haven't finished the entire book yet, but have finished reading the first story, &quot;Low men in yellow coats&quot;. It was great, and really has some depth in character. Way to go, Stephen King!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Along with the Poisonwood Bible and Perfume, this is right up there in the pantheon of great unabridged books on tape. See my review under the hardcover version, but by all means listen to this story. It's a rare listener who will not be completely swept up in King's great story and Hurt's sensational narration. King also reads portions and is dandy, but Hurt is a wonder! If they give Oscars for this kind of performance, Hurt should definitely get the trophy. Hurt is even better than Frank Muller, reader of, among many other things, King's endless Dark Tower series of tapes. And that's high praise indeed."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is one of Stephen King's TAKE ME AS A SERIOUS WRITER novels. During his prolific and supersonic career, King has given us some of the best &quot;horror&quot; novels of our time: &quot;It&quot; &quot;Carrie&quot; &quot;Dead Zone&quot; &quot;Salem's Lot&quot;, etc. Years ago, he decided he wanted to be more than just a genre writer so he gave us &quot;Different Seasons&quot; and &quot;Four Past Midnight,&quot; and &quot;Nightmares and Dreamscapes.&quot; HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is the least impressive of all the King books I've read and I've read them all! Divided into five different sections, King weaves tales of psychodrama and Vietnam War drama. The first story (the longest) is the one about Bobby Hatfield and his encounter with Ted Brautigan and the low people in yellow coats. At times mesmerizing and frightening, it still is pretentious and overly talkative at times. Characters are established and King continues his deft handling of bringing us multidimensional characters. But at this part's end, we're still not sure of just who Ted is, and unless you've read THE DARK TOWERS, King's self-congratulatory epic series, you will be lost.The second part is about as electrifying as a gas lantern; we meet Pete Riley and some other King-like characters, we're reintroduced to Carol Gerber from part one, and the whole story focuses on the addiction to the card game, Hearts, with antiwar sentiment thrown in for creative balance, or imbalance.In the third story, one of the characters from part one leads a triple life and poses as a blind man. Ho hum. Next we meet Sully again, and this time he encounters objects falling from the sky during a traffic jam. Woah..where did this come from? And finally we meet Bobby again who meets Carol again and who tells us Ted has something planned.While one can admire King's continued artistry after so many novels, it's a shame to read a King book that doesn't at least scare you a lot one time??? King diehards will trash my review, but this is not a great book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The first King book I ever read was &quot;Christine,&quot; which I finished cover-to-cover during a week's vacation to Maine when I was 12. It scared me to death. Thereafter, I was a King fanatic, reading every King title I could get my hands on up to and through high school (my favorite being the &quot;Shining&quot; and the &quot;Gunslinger&quot;). At some point, however, I grew tired of King's writing style and completely abandoned his books, except for the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series. I even gave up on that eventually, putting down the &quot;Waste Lands&quot; halfway through because I thought the series was becoming something far different and much less interesting than what King had masterfully started in the &quot;Gunslinger.&quot;Then along came &quot;Hearts in Atlantis,&quot; which I noticed was garnering a lot of positive attention in the press, as well as on this site. Coincidentially, just before I was about to head back to Maine for a vacation, a friend of mine mentioned he enjoyed reading it. I figured, what the heck, why not give King another try?I'm glad I did, it was well worth the effort. King has come a long way from &quot;Christine,&quot; or even the &quot;Gunslinger,&quot; which I'm sure comes as no suprise to his fans that have stuck with him through the years. King's reputation for being a superficial, crowd-pleaser-type of author who's writing doesn't justify his income -- if still maintained -- is completely unwarranted; &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; alone has more depth, style and substance than all of John Grisham's novels combined.&quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; is really five interconnecting stories which span the Summer of 1960 to the present day, with Vietnam (and other relevant events from the 60's) serving as an ominous backdrop. The best story is &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats,&quot; a coming-of-age story set in Harwich, Connecticut that introduces the characters (as children) who appear in the remaining four stories. The story has a supernatural element, involving the titular &quot;low men,&quot; that really (for me, anyway) captures the essence of &quot;growing up,&quot; i.e., the loss of innocence. Bobby Garfield (the main character), a relatively innocent eleven -year-old boy, loses his innocence by the end of the story when he realizes that monsters really do exist, and that greater nightmares than any child could possibly imagine are lying in wait for you as an adult.Perhaps for the characters in &quot;Low Men,&quot; that nightmare is the Vietnam war. In the remaining four stories, Vietnam becomes an increasingly important factor in the characters' lives. &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; centers around a group of slacking college students wrapped up in a dorm-wide card game for money, who all run the risk of flunking out of school and getting drafted. At the same time, the story details the narrator's doomed romantic relationship with a girl who gets swept up in the anti-war movement. &quot;Why We're In Vietnam&quot; and &quot;Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling&quot; examines the lingering effects of Vietnam on its' survivors.The remaining story (and third in sequence in the novel) is &quot;Blind Willie,&quot; which follows a day in the life of a Vietnam veteran who's just trying to earn a living. This story was my least favorite because it seemed forced and out of place, and because it reminded me of King's earlier work (which comes as no suprise as the author himself notes that it's actually a remake of a short story he wrote and published several years ago). That said, the story is short enough and darkly clever enough for me not to quibble about it any further.And, for anyone who thinks King can't satisfactorily end a novel, &quot;Heavenly Shades&quot; cleverly ties all five stories together, and ends the novel on a very mature note (no pun intended, you'll understand after reading the book).All in all, &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; is a great read, and I look forward to what King will serve up next."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Steven King has always been reliable to fill that gap on long flights or kill a slow weekend enjoyable, but never to be taken too seriously. Hearts of Alantis changed all that, as boy who grew up in Ausralia in the 60's (and yes it may come as a surprise to many Americans that we were in the Vietnam war too) I suddenly found myself reliving all those childhood loves and fears.More strangly after serving 23 years in the military and with its natural right wing leanings, I was surprised to find I understood and even supporting Carol and her peace protests.The men in their Low Coats was a interesting diversion..was this Bobbies child like view of a every day adult trauma or something magical..does it matter...For two days after I read this book I seemed to suffering depression until i realised that I was missing Carol like some composite of girlfriends and times past.If you remember your childhood just a little ..read this book..And Mr King..thank you for such developed and real characters, I have been reading for 40 years and never have I fallen in love with a fictional character before."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King is my absolute favorite author and I have loved every book I have read from him. However, I did like this book, but it was a little off for me. I think it was because I expected it to be a whole story and instead it is put into three stories. They connect with each other, but very little. Each story by itself is interesting and pretty good, but they are also very different. The first part of th book is about three kids named Carol, Bobby, and John Sully. The first part of the story was so interesting I read it in two days. However, in the second part of the book it leaves Bobby and John Sully in the dust and is about some other new character. Carol is mentioned, but not very much. Then the third part of the book is about another character that was mentioned in the first part as one of the kids who hurt Carol. Further more it was good, but I just wish that the story separation parts would have connected better then what they did. This was a good book, but I honestly think that if he made each story section into its own story they would be out standing. However, I am 22 and growing up with a dad who loves the old days and just about every war movie on the planet, I enjoyed it because there were many interesting things that I learned while reading this book. Although if you do not like to be left hanging then I would not read this book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I pretty much quit reading Stephen King in the early eighties. But in the last few years I've become attracted to his less supernatural horror stuff, in part because of the superb film adaptations like Stand By Me, Shawshank Redemption and (for me) recently, the excellent Dolores Claiborne. A few years ago, I read some really good short stories, as well as The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon , which was gripping but didn't really move me that much. However, I just finished Hearts In Atlantis. Amazing. Just a thread of the supernatural is masterfully strung throughout these five separate pieces, though it could just as easily be considered a novel. It's about the 60's; the effects of the Vietnam war, the anti-war movement and the horrible things that human being do to each other, as well as the wonderful things that human beings are capable of. All the main characters fail at some point in realizing their ideals, and the book appears to be a subtle indictment of the baby-boomer generation. However it really seems to apply to all of us who have settled for microwaves, cell phones and PCs rather than trying to understand and perhaps heal the insanity that has become of western civilization. But it's also full of compassion, and I was moved to tears more than once. Although the first story/section, \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\", appeared to me to be the highlight of the book as I approached the ending, the last two stories recast the rest of the book in an unexpected and totally compelling light, and it made it clear that this may be his masterpiece. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis is actually four separate stories that blend into a sort of interactive novel. This was okay, as far as it worked, but in the end might be the biggest flaw.Part one, read by William Hurt, is \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats.\\" This is King at his finest. A young boy, baseball - buddies - bullies and young love. Awakenings on many levels, including the jump from Rick Brant and The Hardy Boys to The Lord of the Flies, a work that comes back again and again to haunt the reader as King uses first one, then another scenario to show you the pig-hunting wild boys that surround us all. Also the question recurs - who will save the crew?There is just enough of the otherworldly in Low Men in Yellow Coats to twist things so that htey don't really fit our reality, and just enough reality to the characters that you can cry with them, laugh with them, and share their dreams. Low Men ends on a down note, as so much modern horror seems to, not really answering any questions for the characters, or the reader, but then - you have the hope of parts II and III.Part II, the title piece, is \\"Hearts in Atlantis.\\" This is also wonderful writing. Kids caught in their first year at university, caught in the cusp of high-school and adulthood, the war in Vietnam looming all around them and the reality of scholarships dependent on grades haunting them day and night. Hearts in Atlantis is the story of a generation, its rise and its fall, and of addiction - the addiction of a game, in this case, but a study in obsession that goes well beyond the occasional beer, or the stack of magazines with Pamela Anderson in the corner. The kind that eats at you day and night, leaving you wanting to quit, even as you grin and call out for more.One character from \\"Low Men\\" comes back to us in this second part of this book, Carol, who was the love interest of the young hero of part one. Here is where it sort of starts to crumble, for me. This story would be wonderful if it weren't for the attempt to link it back to the first story. I don't see how the connection furthers the tale, really - it is more as if it were forced, making this a book-length work when it is really a series of novellas. The college, the \\"game\\" and the way King draws back in the Lord of the Flies - the at first we were joking, and then, we weren't mentality - and the coming of age - all of this is the kind of writing that leaves you aching - sometimes with memories, other times with the desire to reach people in that same way - and at times, to BE those characters.Then there is part three. \\"Blind Willie\\" has an interesting concept, to be sure. A man who is three men. A man who is so caught up in \\"penance\\" for an act of cruelty and violence he participated in as a child ( which you will have read about in part one ) that he has created an elaborate web of identities and ritual to try to cleanse it from his soul. A web he can't even see for the insanity it is, and, when you are reading, you see it as - if not normal - possible. That is King's gift. The problem with this, again, is that it is tied to the first story - even more tightly than Hearts in Atlantis is - but it is incomplete, there are huge gaps, and without the first story - it does not stand alone. Thus, Blind Willie is good reading, but not - to me - memorable. Not in the way the first two parts are.Part four is the conclusion. This is almost a sequel to Low Men in Yellow coats, characters meeting their ends - whether they be happy, sad, together or apart - the wrapping up of threads spun by the first three stories. Unfortunately, that is all they seem, in the end. It is as if King took these three stories, read them and sat down to write conclusion that would just tie everything up and let it go. Again, no truly happy endings for anyone. Again, really, no resolution of conflict, except for one character who checks out for good.There is also a small flurry of tie-ins to the Dark Tower series that are meaningless out of that context - tie-ins that, rather than strengthening the work - lessen it.Overall, I enjoyed this performance of Hearts in Atlantis. William Hurt is expressive, reads well, and has the perfect voice for a story with kids as protagonists...he still seems to understand, much in the way King does when he writes. The performance of Hearts in Atlantis and Blind Willie by King himself are good, as they always are. His is a voice that lends itself to reading - that understands the spoken form of the art. Once you hear him read his own work, you can't help but hear that voice when you read more on your own, and it changes everything.If you like audio books, you will like this one. It is entertaining, and, though a bit disappointing in the end, well worth the journey."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"A Must ReadThe book Hearts in Atlantis is a must read. It's a book about a boy named Bobby Garfield and his Meeting of and old man named Ted, a Yankees fan from out of town who had just moved in to his apartment building. Ted is on the run from the \\"low men in yellow coats.\\" But Mrs. Garfield (Bobby's mom) is becoming an alcoholic/heavy smoker and starting to be a real witch. She is putting a lot of resistance on Ted's \\"journey.\\"Meanwhile bobby has problems of his own. His main problem is three bullies from St. Gibe's catholic school. In the middle of the story the three boys do something to Carol that makes Bobby's mom expect Ted has done something to Carol. Then there is a big scene in the Garfield apartment.I haven't finished the whole book yet but so far Stephen Kings novel Hearts in Atlantis is one of the best books I have ever read and I hope the rest of the stories are as good as the first half."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I initially picked up the hardcover of this novel off a B Dalton bookstore due to the ultra low, bargain price of 6.99 (as opposed to $20+), and the fact that it was a King novel definitely added a plus to that purchase. I quickly found out about the plot of the book online, including the fact that it was tied to the Dark Tower series. Such a fact made me excited and pushed me to read it. After finally finishing it two nights ago, I find myself both gratified and yet somewhat dissappointed.The first story &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; is pure gold, and I can see why the film adapatation would pick this story in particular as its plot (although I still need to see it sometime). The relationships between Bobby Garfield, his mother Liz, his first love Carol, his friend Sully, and especially his close friendship with the old man Ted Brautigan make this story pull you in like a powerful magnet and not let you go until the end. At many points of the story, I felt myself emotionally attached to much of what went on, even losing my cool a bit from time to time (just a bit ;) ). The plot does well to tie into the Dark Tower series (of which I'm between books 4 and 5 at the moment), and yet keeps itself to what's ultimately important in &quot;Low Men,&quot; in how Bobby handles the conflicts thrown at him. This story alone makes the book worth a read, especially for DT enthustiasts.Unfortunately, King put his best story first, and left the other four as a fizzle down to the end. It wasn't necessarily that I didn't enjoy the stories, it just felt like half the time King was dragging on and not going to the action quickly enough. It's not as if King is a slow author (incinuating a waste of words), but he can leave a reader thinking &quot;why does this matter at all? Just go on!!&quot; until he finally gets around to making a pretty good (though not amazing compared to Low Men) climax/end for each story. I would say I enjoyed &quot;Blind Willie&quot; the least, but the other three helped lead to a final ending/epilogue to the life of Bobby Garfield that would come in the final story.Ultimately, I give it three stars. It's damn well worth the read for the first story, and the other four still ask to be read as attached as they are to the first. Nonetheless, the way I had to force myself to get through the middle points of &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; and drag through &quot;Blind Willie&quot; left me to decrease my rating of the book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I had really lost all hope of ever reading another Stephen King book after trying to attempt reading \\"Dolores Claiborne\\", which was the worst of his.Well, some ten odd years later, I picked up \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" at a yard sale. I had heard it was a good book, and that the movie was great. I always have to read the book before seeing the movie, so opted for the written page.It was awesome.\\"Hearts....\\" is a book broken down into five separate stories that all have a connection is some form. The first story \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" is the longest and best of the group. It is set in the Summer of 1960, Bobby Garfield, Carol Gerber, and Sully John are all 11 yrs. old and enjoying their youth in adventurous ways. Enter Ted Brautigan, who is an older man. He takes a room in the house that Bobby and his not so nice mother live in. He becomes Bobby's father figure, and the boy becomes emotionally attached to Ted much to his mother's chagrin.He askes Bobby to read to him, pays the kid for it, and thus they begins their bonding.It is extremely well written and the characters just burst with life. I felt as if I really knew Bobby, who was my favorite character in the book. I am glad that this story dominates the pages of this thick novel because it is the best work of fiction here as it's the most endearing.The four stories left, \\"Hearts In Atlantis\\", \\"We Were in Vietnam\\", \\"Blind Willie\\", \\"Heavnely shades of Night falling\\" all have a character in them that appeared in \\"Low Men\\". This is the connection of them all. In some stories, they are older, and the men have seen the horrors of Vietnam, and they have all had the war effect them in some way. Carol becomes a protestor in \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\", which is set at a college in Maine. This was my second favorite.The book certainly doesn't have much closure, as some reviewers were looking for, but I don't think that this is what King wanted with this work. He is just showing how life was in the 60's, and how the Vietnam war shaped the lives of the characters in the stories, which span from the summer of 1960 up til 1999.There is a lot of sadness, humor, and realism to this piece of writing.Worth reading!!! Just skip \\"Blind Willie\\" as I don't think it adds anything but just annoys. I hated it but read the whole thing anyway. It was annoying and boring. We get to see how the bad kid from \\"Low Men\\" turns into a bad man basically.Highly recommended!!Eileen Famiglietti"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I was vastly disappointed with this book. I went through high school voraciously reading every Steven King book I could afford. When he started writing series, I became disinterested. I looked to this book to pique my interest in his work again. But it hasn't.Hearts in Atlantis tells the story of some friends who grew up in The Sixties, fought in the Vietnam war, and came back to find eachother. This seems like a great recipie, but the plot is left hanging at nearly every point because nothing happens to resolve the characters and their problems. What of the low men? Why did Blind Wille do what he did? What really became of the middle-age of the veterans and their friends?Steven King still writes very, very well, but there are flaws emerging. He relies on allusion to music more than ever in this book. The story is well-told, but it's not a very good story to begin with. Perhaps the problem is that the story is well told and _too_ vivid; maybe there are too many details, leading you to expect to a more involving resolution for each of the characters. That just doesn't happen, though, and the reader is left hanging as a result."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Excellent novel, thick with imagery and wonder-- unlike the movie of the same name."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"One of the best books i've ever read!

He does well to make you feel you are with him through the stories, but I felt little sympathy for any of the characters but Bobbie &amp; Ted in the &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; and would have prefered the story to stick with Bobbie &amp; Ted.. I also felt as if King may have gotten tired of his characters toward the end as the sections kept getting shorter &amp; shorter.. Was there really nothing else left to say at the end or was there a deadline looming on SK's calendar?? What happens next to Bobby and Carol??My favorites btw, were: The Stand, Needful Things, Four Past Midnight (Library Police)and Dolores Claiborne. The last made a great book &amp; a pretty great film.. I *do* plan to see the movie adaptation of Hearts in Atlantis &amp; look forward to seeing what the amazing Anthony Hopkins does with his portrayl of Ted.. =)"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I read all 756 pages in four sittings. I usually am not a fan of Stephen King, but I was impressed by this story. If you have seen the movie that is due out about nine days from this review, you need to realize that focus or point of the story is not Bobby Garfield nor Ted Brautigan, but the Vietnam War.In reading the first part of the book, I suggest that you keep track of the following characters:Bobby Garfield, Carol Gerber, John Sullivan, William Shearman, and one character that is obsessed with the card game called hearts.The Atlantis in the title refers to the legendary lost continent. Bobby in the first part explains the reference. In the second part a character named Pete explains the reference, again. I feel that you are better off reading those parts instead of being told what it says. You might consider the card game to be symbolic of the human heart or the hearts of mankind. I will give you that much.There are five parts to the book. I have heard that the movie has parts 1 and 5 only, which will make it more about something magic-like rather than about war.I also do not usually like to read about any war in fact or fiction, but something about the storytelling had me mesmerized. I had to know where this was going and how it was getting there."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"With Hearts in Atlantis, Stephen King has managed to accomplish two impressive things. First, he has written a horror novel where the horror is on the backburner. It waits ahead in the future for Low Men in Yellow Coats, it's happening outside the smokey dorm rooms in the title story. And it's a distant memory buried within the spirits of men in the final three stories. Second, King has written a book about Vietnam without it conforming to the cliches that make this subgenre so dispicable. His characters are well crafted, act unpredictably (even to themselves at times), and have different feelings about the war. Essentially, the war happens, but they happen too.I find Stephen King's ability to provide us with this kind of book, after 30 some odd bestsellers behind him, utterly remarkable. Despite some of the criticisms he recieves for being a &quot;popular&quot; horror writer, I believe he is one of the most important writers of our time. If you've never read King, and aren't into &quot;monsters&quot;, then Hearts in Atlantis is a good place for you to start."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis was an endearing nostalgic book, a pleasure to read. It had frightening moments and nightmarish situations but there was a change in Mr. King's writing style. It would be difficult to explain this subtle change. Nevertheless, it is there and personally, all his fans will feel privileged if this change becomes part of his permanent style of writing."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book was one excellent read. All six stories were - though very sad - incredible. To many, this book brought them back to a decade they can remember as if it just ended yesteryear. Yet to others as myself, it is like going back through eons of time to another world . . . the 60s.With its hippies waving the peace sign in the air, and writing stuff on the college dormitories such as &quot;LBJ is a war criminal,&quot; Hearts in Atlantis seems not only to be a great book of the 60s, but a very informational book, as well. Much can be learned about that decade in reading the six stories.Peace, dude."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Firstly there are better SK books than this. Books that are scarier and perhaps more interesting, however few leave you pondering life the way this one does. It takes you on a surreal journey that brings you down to become part of the characters. It was about 3 months ago that I finished reading this book and it still leaves me asking questions and thinking about the characters. Its not a story (or stories)that is easily forgoten. While not being a war novel, it directly and indirectly explores the effects of war on individuals, and it does this from a number of different angles with related characters. It is a great story which is superbly written, had it been any shorter I think it would have lost something."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This collection of stories is one of King's best works. The first story &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; is prime King, featuring a story that plays into the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; mythology. This story was probably the most exciting and action-packed. I liked it alot. The second story &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; was my favorite though. There's nothing supernatural or unusual in this story. It's basically about college kids obsessed with the card game, Hearts. There's a bit more to it then that though. I thought this story was just incredibly well written and interesting. The third story I found to be enjoyable but somewhat odd and maybe a bit too short. The last 2 stories are mostly just there to bring everything to a closing. The middle 2 stories serve as a bridge between the first story and the last 2. The last 2 bring us back to the characters we started out with but all grown up. It's kinda sad. This is a summertime book, I think. It feels that way. It's about youth gone by and vietnam and nostalgia. I loved it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Although this book is five stories, they are all interconnected. We get to see different characters at different times in their lifes and in different situations. All the stories are good but the first two are really great. Truly a great read!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have read almost all of Stephen King's books. In &quot;Hearts&quot; he has developed a rather different, but appreciative style. A small section was developed towards his surrealistic dark side, but the majority was a well done story based on &quot;slice of life&quot; set in the flower child era.I have almost given up on King until I read Atlantis. For people new to King, don't view this as a stereotypical scary, ghouls and goblins book. Its not. A must read."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It brought back many memories of the 60's era and made me keep one eye on my Viet Nam vet husband. No sign of a Zippo lighter but....! I only wish there was mention of what happened to &quot;Blind Willie&quot; and did he ever get revenge on the cop? And how did the glove get from Willie to Sully? Although I know Ted had something to do with this. It was a great read."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book is fantastic! I echo some of the sentiments of other reviewers - it certainly not as good as &quot;The Stand&quot; or the &quot;The Shining&quot;, but it is definitely one of King's finer works. Of all of his &quot;departures from horror&quot; I think this one is my favorite. Looking to buy a book for someone who grew up in the '60s? You MUST buy them this book! I'm not even a '60s child and I thoroughly enjoyed all of the references to popular culture, Vietnam, sports, etc. This book even made me want to learn how to play the game hearts.

Stephen King does relatively little acting here, while William Hurt apparently does none at all, yet by the end of the book I thought it was one of the finest dramatic readings I had ever heard.Unlike what you may hear from Frank Mueller or Jim Dale, both readers seem to believe the text itself is sufficient to invoke the reader's emotion. King does this through a reading that sounds like his natural speaking voice. Yet, perhaps because this book has a special significance to him, his plain, unadorned reading, by careful use of pause and emphasis, sets a mood and draws out nuance and significance that I had missed by reading.William Hurt uses very little in the way of accents or attempts to act different voices. His reading at first seemed interrupted by ill-timed pauses. Yet as the reading continued, I realized that he was using silence, pace, and emphasis to wring out tremendous emotion. The simple moments of childhood were fresh, the scenes of confrontation edgy in a way I have rarely felt in a reading, and in the confrontation between Bobby's mother and Ted, you can hear every twist and distortion in her soul.I hope William Hurt reads more books and intent to listen to them."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"William Hurt does a phenomenal job with his sections of the story. He can capture the soul, joy and pain of all of his characters. He reads 3 of the 5 stories on the CD.Stephen Kin reads the other 2 stories. I am not as interigued by the stories or the characters they focus on. Couple that with his flat, New England voice, and the middle section is not as enjoyable.This is NOT a typical King story. There is a small amount of monster/supernatural element to it, but this is more about the human heart.I really like this and actually bought the CD to replace my worn out cassette version. You may want to read excerpts from the story to decide if it is to your liking."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I read this book straight after finishing the Dark Tower series, and fortunately for me, it did quell the withdrawal symptoms I found myself with after finally emerging from King's amazing adventure.In short - I thoroughly enjoyed it.It took me once again out of the square and allowed my mind to journey on a similar kind of path as did the Dark Tower books.In all honesty - Can anyone go wrong with ANY King title.Read it - you'll love it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I finished this book today, it rocked hard. What a great book! Stephen King is still agreat author. The way he did five stories that are all tied together is simply woderful. I recomend this book to all Stephen King fans."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I like Stephen King's books. I have not read them all but I have put a serious dent in the King inventory and believe him to be one of the finest writers of our era. His popularity and prolific writing attests to his skill to spin a yarn.Hearts in Atlantis disturbed me more than his other books (that are gory at times but are ultimately fantasy). It's to King's credit that I'm disturbed, and attests to his writing skill. I've witnessed much violence in my life in different countries and I'm intimately acquainted with human folly.Ultimately I found the book hard to read precisely because King is such a good novelist. Do I recommend it? Sort of."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I totally disagree with the previous reviewer who disliked this audio book.I do a lot of long distance driving. Five years ago I discovered that this usually boring activity becomes much more pleasurable when you can listen to a book on tape or CD. Over the years I have listened to hundreds of them.I can honestly say that of these hundreds, the absolute best reading I have ever heard was William Hurt's \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\". Hurt didn't just \\"read\\" this book - he acted out every role. And beautifully! The accents, personalities and nuances of every character were portrayed in the most mesmerising way possible. He just blew me away! If they had an Academy Award for this category, Hurt would be sure to win it hands down.And if you don't believe me, Google this title alongside Roger Ebert. This is part of what he said:\\"So, should you therefore read the book after seeing the movie? I would recommend the audiobook; William Hurt's reading is one of the best audio performances I have ever heard.\\""},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I thought this book was fantastic. It is called a \\"story-collection\\" which i think is stupid because it really is an all in one novel.It is well-written, as you'd expect from the KING himself, and is full of suspense and heart. probably one of the most heartfelt stories i've read of KING coz it's not the slightest bit scary, or creepy like very other king book i've read.\\"Low Men In Yellow Coats\\" is the first story, a novel in itself around 300pgs. This the film we see called \\"Hearts IN Atlantis\\". The story is brilliant. Young Bobby Garfield meets and befriends his strange new neighbour, who turns out to be hiding from someone and has a special gift. Bobby has to keep an eye out for him, and try to cope lvinvg with his constantly-worrying-about-money mother. The film made little of the book, because the book has so much more depth and suspense, and is connected ever so slightly to \\"The Dark Tower\\". In the film your left wondering why these people are after Ted, in the book you understand completely.\\"Hearts In Atlantis\\" is also brilliant. In this you see a new character, irrelevent to the first story, cope in Maine University with the pressure of studying while he and his entire dorm barr maybe two or three become totally addicted to the card game hearts. I thought it was great; the story shows us how Bobby's girlfriend, Carol Granger, is like four years later, and mild references to Bobby & Carol's old best friend Sully-John.\\"Blind Willie\\" is a story about a man who is scarred mentally by the Vietnam war. Sull-John is referred to in this story too, but isnt a main character. I think the story just portrays what a scarred mind, particularly from war, can do. Willie, or BIll, goes to work everyday, does nothing and writes in a notepad that he's sorry over and over. Then grabs his walking stick, and puts on glasses. he sits in the streets pretending to be bling and makes thousands of dollars a day. then goes home to write the same thing over and over again. An interesting story.\\"Why We're In Vietnam\\" is where Sully-John becomes a main character again. He's an older man now, and he too is scarred by the war. He meets another Viet Veteran at a funeral and reminices slightly on things. He's haunted by a woman who was killed by one of Petes, out of Hearts In Atlantis, ex card-playing buddies. A good story, one of the most heartfelt in the book.And last but not least! \\"Heavenly Shades Of Night Are Falling\\" is in 1999 where Bobby returns to Sully-Johns funeral. he meets an old friend - not to spoil anyhthing further!Overall, an excellent book that you will read again and again. Well, not straight away, but maybe after six months to a year you'd probably yearn to read it again coz it's just that good!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I put this book off for a long time. I kept looking at it on the shelf and thinking \\"Good God! Not another book about the 60's. Hippies? Viet Nam? 'Hey there Mr. Tambourine Man, gag a long-hair for me!'\\" I couldn't believe that King of all writers would pick such a worn-out subject.Then finally I broke down and checked it out at the library (there was no way in hell I was going buy another book about the GD Viet Nam war). I went into it thinking I'd be bored to tears. Boy was I surprised. This whole novel was great, from beginning to end. Each story was engrossing for a different reason, and it was in no way saturated with the same old tired themes that I've come to expect from novels about that bygone era. Examples: Peace, love, drugs, the JFK assassination, Woodstock, etc. It was every bit the typical King horror novel, as well as a social commentary. I just wish the movie had been better, but what the hell? You can't have everything."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I put this book off for a long time. I kept looking at it on the shelf and thinking \\"Good God! Not another book about the 60's. Hippies? Viet Nam?

We'll wait and see. Keep up the good work Stephen."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Although there is some continuity of character in this cycle of stories, &quot;Hearts in Atlantas&quot; works best as a collection of short stories or novellas. The first section comes closest to what we would have called &quot;a typical Stephen King novel&quot; five or ten years ago (he has since become too versatile for that judgment to have any relevance). It deals with the occult lying just underneath the reality and a young boy's fascinated horror as he discovers it--and I'd rather not get more specific. The second passage is part and parcel of the sixties and owes its oomph to college kids overwhelmed by their freedom, their studies, and the Vietnam war and their youthful inability to reconcile all these things. The third part is really strange--not impossible, I guess, but really strange. There also shorter sections. What results is a kind of Stephen King Whitman's Sampler--diehard fans as well as newcomers will enjoy it and even literary sophisticates may be impressed at how King can vary tone and voice to fit each new situation. Is it his very, very best work? No. But you're going to like at least part of it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King has an ability, or a talent, to tell a story which involves the reader to live, feel and breathe the emotions and surroundings his words describe. This book is the perfect example.King brilliantly takes you to childhood, college, middle age in such a swift and dramatic way that each of the seperate stories relate and feel like vivid memories.The seperate tales follow the standard King formula, good, bad and the moral qestion of what is right. But King in this novel manages to create new feelings and details from story to story that you actually feel like each one was written by a different author, but related to the same common story.Some reviews have proclaimed this novel as a one story book, with 'Low Men in Yellow Coats'. This is a great story and, as Ted tells Bobby, worthy of reading on after the first quarter. But for any one who has spent time in a dorm or bording situation, the second story shows how well this man can bring memories of fun, hardship, friendship, girls, the misfits and the feeling of being in a single sex college or dorm so vividly and brilliantly that you feel like hanging your drying washing out your window than on the line.King can scare the hell out of you with make belive monsters or supernatural abilities, but he can just as well scare you with realities or warm you with wit and compassion and humour that only the great authors can do.This is why this is a great read and a well added title to a great writers work."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I used to read Stephen King a lot when I was younger, The Shining, Cujo... I kinda stopped reading it. But I liked Bag of Bones, and it seemed different. I just finished reading Hearts in Atlantis, and it was totally different from any other King book that I've ever read- and I loved it! It was one of the best books I've read in a long time. I thought the stories dealing with Vietnam were very touching and strong and the ending brought tears to my eyes. It was wonderful! I would recommend this book, even to people who haven't read much Stephen King."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"A great combination of stories making one of King?s greatest books. The intertwining of the stories allows the reader to begin to explore the deeper consciousness of the beings. A needed change from the doldrums of some recent writings and a book that can be shared either with individual stories or as a combination of them."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I've read numerous Stephen King books. I am a very big fan of his, but I think this could be ranked among his best. Not only did it have a historical aspect to it, it also had the normal Stephen King paranormal aspect to it, as well. It really was a book that I just couldn't put down. I loved it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I purchased this novel for specific reasons to be honest. I had been informed that one novella had specific relations to the Dark Tower story, which was more than enough for this avid King reader. However, after reading the entire book I saw that the Dark Tower aspect was totally eclipsed by the sadness I felt by Kings attitude toward the Vietnam conflict. As always Mr. King was able to thread the stories together with my favorite being &quot;Hearts in Atlantis.&quot; Mr. King's switch between third and first person perspective also added to the allure of this collection. Compared with his other novella collections Different Seasons and The Bachman Books it is not any better or worse, just different and new. I think that we can expect one of these stories to appear as a film and I hope that Frank Darabont, who has done the best book to film transitions for Mr. King, gives the stories in this publishment a good deal of consideration."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Although I read a lot, I had never read a Stephen King novel. Why? I guess it's for the same reason that I stay away from horror movies. I'm a horror-baby. Guess the effects of the first Dracula movie I saw forty years ago are still hanging around. (And I was afraid to look in the mirror for a few months after &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray.&quot; And I still have PTSD about those big ants in &quot;Them.&quot;)So I was probably the only person in the U.S. to never read a Stephen King novel. That means his annual income has been $64,999,995 instead of $65,000,000. Sorry, Steve.But, you know, this guy may have a future. This guy can write. He's never going to win a Nobel but he is one helluva story teller.In &quot;Hearts of Atlantis,&quot; he almost writes out of his genre. Certainly, this has to be one of his more unhorrifying novels. Which is good if you're a horror-baby like moi. The only thing you have to look out for is &quot;low men in yellow coats.&quot; You know, like Mickey Rooney selling for Century 21.But what it lacks in horror it makes up for in humor and heart. &quot;Hearts of Atlantis&quot; follows up and flowers from the close friendship of three children, two boys and a girl, who pal around in the late fifties. Then, in five unique narratives, not necessarily via their point of view, it twists and weaves through that terrific and terrible decade of the 60s.By far the most unforgettable section is the title piece. Here, King switches to the first person viewpoint to cover the chaotic college years of the 60s. It's hilarity with heart, and the narrative voice is reminiscent of J.D. Salinger's &quot;Catcher in the Rye.&quot;My only criticism is the end. It's a little complex and a lot sappy.But the bottom line is that &quot;Hearts. . .&quot; is a tremendous tale for baby boomers - even horror-baby boomers like myself - that is VERY well told. I'm sold. Steve will make $65,000,000 next year."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"&quot;Hearts In Atlantis&quot; marks merely the second King novel I've read(&quot;The Green Mile&quot; being the first). I started this book unfamiliar of what it was about(the back of the book gives away little) and what to expect.&quot;Low Men In Yellow Coats&quot;(the first story of 5) was my favorite. It had the most story line and was written beautifully. And although I didn't understand the 'low men', I loved what King did with eleven-year-old Bobby's experiences with Ted, Carol, his mother, etc. I agree with another reviewer on the title story, &quot;Hearts In Atlantis&quot;, in that it was written like an essay from a 1st person view. Although interesting to see what these students went through, I failed to see the point of it. The only reason I could think of that King would put it in there was to include an autobiography(cause that's sure what it read like) and to incorporate Carol and update her charachter. What I want to know is why King titled his novel after this story. It had a weak, quik ending, as well. Putting all that aside, though, the style in this story was definately the best(even better than Green Mile) of the book. &quot;Blind Willie&quot; seemed like it was just...there, although I liked the minute-to-minute format King wrote it in. And the final two stories summed it up fairly well, although leaving many questions unanswered. I am giving it four stars for the outstanding style and that little bit of plot at the beggining and end. All in all it was a good novel, and a very enjoying novel."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Well folks, I've noticed a great deal of people seem to feel the need to jump to the 'King's defense lately. I wonder why exactly that is? I figure that is it because the illustrious, untouchable Mr King is no longer toying with the genre that made him a household word. He certainly has no claim to being the &quot;King of horror&quot; anymore. This tome doesn't do anything to contradict that point of view, either.Not to 'whine', as one of my more terse collegues put it in an earlier review, but as fictions go, this one is not too bad, nor is it anything to bother calling your old college literature professor about, either. The word &quot;milquetoast&quot; comes to mind. Occasionally there is a phrase that sticks to your mind, but nothing like the passages of Hemingway, or even even Hawthorne. So I guess Stephen King is not trying to be a major part of 'high literature', and if that's where he wants to be, who am I to argue?'Hearts in Atlantis' is a nice collection of novellas (not a novel, thanks). They are vignettes taken from a common cloth and culled from the sixties experience which clearly the author lived through and remembered a great deal about. Five tales of the decade of hippies, Vietnam, and turmoil.They are all nicely done in King's inimitable style, and I have to agree that 'Low Men in Yellow Coats' is probably the best of the lot because it deals with the innocence and unavoidable disappointments of youth. The rest of the book is well worth reading, but if your're looking for vintage King horror, better look elsewhere. I must say I'm rather annnoyed by people who seem to think that we are reprehensible who are saddened by the loss of one of the truly great horror writers to this whole cross-genre experimentation business. Do not mistake disappointment with stupidity. I realize that Stephen King is a good writer in any genre, but it is horror at which he excels. Argue with that if you want. Nowadays Koontz, Saul, or Higgins-Clark are the names that guarantee a chill. Not King.I absolutely believe that if Stephen King wants to publish ordinary fiction, then more power to him. Just don't be surprised if the results show up in the sales figures eventually. And don't expect those of us who yearn for good horror (a rare animal indeed) to give him our blessing.In closing (now that I'm off from my soapbox), this is actually a good book as long as you just like to read. Well-written, never boring, with a few twists just to keep things interesting, I'd have to say it's worth reading, but not worth keeping. By the way, I have read everything King has written since 'Carrie', so I feel qualified to offer an opinion. I still think 'Insomnia' is his best book, though..."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have long been a Stephen King addict, and I have not read a book of his that didn't appeal to me. &quot;Heart's&quot; is Great, it is a big leap for King to write a novel like this, but I was sold. The way he managed to link each story together was just magic."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The phrase &quot;un-putdownable&quot; is so frequently used these days that it has almost become S.O.P. for any new book to be described thus. However Hearts in Atlantis is definately worthy of the comment. The story of Bobby and the low men is classic King - fast-paced and continually building to a climax. It is also the only real &quot;supernatural&quot; story out of the five and the references to the Dark Tower are slightly confusing but scarcely detract from the tension. The second tale , about the college boys and their card games , is undoubtedly my favourite probably because I am also still in college . The switching to first-person narrative is a nice touch and it well expresses the confused feelings about the war in Vietnam prevalent at the time. The remaining three tales , while lacking any real substance as stories give a good view of how the Sixties still affects those involved in it and the constant cross linking of the characters lets you know what happened in the intervening years without having to go in to too much detail. Any long-time fan of King and his style of writing will be hooked inside a couple of chapters , just as I was."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The novellas that make up &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; each have a characture and uniqueness all their own and when put together, create a wonderful new book from your favorite author and mine, Stephen King. King's recent outburst of books from the heart have all been successful in my mind. I loved &quot;Bag of Bones&quot;, adored &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, and couldn't wait to finish &quot;Hearts in Atlantis.&quot; The charactures and settings were so vivid and easy to see, even if you did not live through the era spoken of. The way the stories were all linked in a way was a wonderful idea. It gave some insight on how people can change over years, yet still be haunted by foolish things they did in their past. These are great stories of overcoming the past, and finding new things."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book is actually the first King novel I have &quot;read&quot; and I love it!

For King fans like myself, Hearts shows the author's ability of tying together three new stories using reappearing characters and plot lines, and intertwining the story line of another King series - The Dark Tower. The creativity and language - as always - made me feel like I was with an old friend.Once I started reading Hearts in Atlantis, my usual King problem began. That is, how can I stop everything else in my life so that I don't have to put down the book!For those of you who love Stephen King, this book can only reinforce your hope that Mr. King's health (physical &amp; mental) return to the before-car-accident state."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I want more! I want to know what happened to Bobby and into what world did Ted escape. I want a reunion.... While the remainder of the tale(s) were definitely \\"thought provoking,\\" (and the obession for playing Hearts a bit tedious), they paled compared to the adventures of Bobby and his friends and the great character development in that story. I think I went to school with some of those people. Thanks, again, Mr. King for making the daily commute something I look forward to instead of dreading."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This audio book was a real treat for me.Growing up in the sixties, this was a trip down memory lane. King does such a fine job of writing about being a kid and all the feelings involved in being out of school for the summer and friendships and of course all the weird scary stuff too.If you havent experienced King's audio books. You're really missing out.William Hurt read most of this book and he did a spectacular job. That along with Stephen King reading the rest of the stories and the wonderful music of the era played throughout the book made this a most satisfying listen.I HIGHLY recommend the audio version.It was beautiful."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I am a very big SK fan and have read all of his novels. Hearts in Atlantis ranks in at least the top ten, maybe the top five of his best books ever. The first two stories are the best (also the longest). As many of his more recent works, Hearts in Atlantis does not fit in the horror realm - for which SK is best known. However, the things which make SK stand apart from his contemporaries (i.e. strong characters, great humor, surreal American themes, and vivid imagination) are to be found in this latest book and gladly welcomed by the reader. This would be a great book to recommend to someone who typically spurns SK novels due to an aversion to his reputation of producing books which are filled with gore, demons, and the like. Hearts in Atlantis is quality literature that most any open-minded, sophisticated reader will enjoy. And as far as the SK fans, like any of his works it is a must read. Don't mistake me, this is no &quot;The Stand&quot; but on the other hand - it isn't &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot; either. Some books inspire and amaze, others merely entertain or fill the void; Hearts in Atlantis is somewhere in between. But compared to most modern literature, it can't be beat. I give it a hearty thumbs up. You won't be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"At a time when the vanishing World War II generation is paid tribute through books and films, HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is Stephen King's homage to his (and mine), the Vietnam generation.HEARTS is a series of stories that take place, respectively, in 1960, 1966, 1983, and two in 1999. All are loosely connected through characters we meet in the first, 11-year old Bobby Garfield and his best pals Sully-John and Carol, and one from the group of slightly older boys who torment them, Willie Shearman. Each of the storylines otherwise stands alone, more or less. In 1960, Bobby, a fatherless boy living with an uncaring mother, becomes attached to the world-wise Ted, an old man renting the rooms upstairs who is being hunted by sinister \\"low men in yellow coats\\". In 1966, new character Pete is on the verge of flunking out of the university because of his preoccupation with an addictive card game. More important to the book's overall plot, he falls in love with a fellow student, Carol from Story One, and through her discovers the anti-Vietnam peace movement. In 1983, Willie Shearman, a Vietnam veteran, continues to pay a bizarre penance for past sins, chief of which, apparently, was the wrong he did Carol as a boy. In 1999, emotionally and physically scarred Vietnam vet Sully-John remembers his time \\"in the green\\". Also in 1999, Carol and Bobby stumble across each other after leading separate lives for almost 40 years. The threads between all five plots are Carol and a beat-up old baseball glove once belonging to Bobby.This is not one of King's more lucid works. Indeed, the Willie Shearman episode of 1983 needed much more explaining. (My reaction to it was just short of \\"Huh?!\\") However, a mediocre book by King is a gem by other standards, so it's impossible not to recommend it on some level. The point the author is trying to make, I think, is that the memories from our formative years, however deformed by succeeding events - in this case the Vietnam conflict - stay with us as powerful emotional catalysts, and perhaps as crippling psychological scars, even unto our twilight years and old age.The film version of HEARTS IN ATANTIS, based almost solely on the first chapter dealing with the events of 1960, was magical in its use of visual and aural images to evoke that period in the mid-twentieth century when those in childhood, and middle-class America as a whole, were on the verge of losing their innocence. Because both I and the fictional Bobby turned eleven in that year, I could relate. And, I think the book will stir up memories in anyone of my generation, whether he/she fought in Southeast Asia or demonstrated at home.Not a great book, but worth a read. Definitely see the movie for a more intense burst of the book's flavor."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"How do we begin to associate Stephen King with literature? Probably with the title of &quot; He who writes the scary and disturbing novels&quot;, am I right? I won't lie- I have read both The Shining and Different Seasons and I was disgusted with both. I vowed to never again read anything by or to do with Stephen King after having to endure these heartless tales. However, I was at my library and I found at the book sale a brand-new copy of Hearts In Atlantis and figured for a buck I might as well give it a try. It sounded like a book with actual story, plot, and King's vivid imagery, and it was. At no point in the story was I not amazed, nor taken into King's realm of creativity. Every line, every chapter was captivating, and one might forget while reading this book that King did indeed write it. Never have the sixties been so real that you can actually feel yourself in the novel, and this is another inclination of King's real ability to write a great story, as opposed to the traditional horror and gore that King is known for. Hearts In Atlantis breaks the stereotypes, and in this case, we can be glad. Kudos to Stephen King."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King has incredible character development. I literally cried at the end of the first story, and felt so disappointed not knowing what happened to those characters. But, lo and behold, he tied up all the loose ends in the last story. Made me feel so much better about the ending of the first.I read a few reviews here, where people said this was his worst book, or it was an &quot;uphill&quot; read, etc. I totally disagreed. With the exception of &quot;Blind Willie&quot; each story was compelling on its own, and I loved the way the characters were all intertwined.I will grant you that this book is different from King's other books, and although I am a little too young to appreciate the emotional turmoil of the sixties, I think he did a great job in presenting his representation of that era.Definitely worth reading!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"As any fan of audio-books knows the narration is key to the overall experience delivered by the book - I have heard fair to poor books come alive with the right person narrating. William Hurt is a great actor, but I could not believe the awful job he did narrating portions of this book - it really ruined the portions he read. His ability to read a sentence naturally without staccato interruptions (in the wrong places) made it difficult to listen to. I kept wondering when the producer was going to think...&quot;this is not working out, let's find someone else&quot;Overall I enjoyed the second story &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; the best and think this book is another fine piece of work by Steven King. Additionally, King, as always, does a wonderful job of narrating. As with Bag of Bones his style is excellent and well delivered - accents and all. It's just really is nice to hear the author put the emphasis and feeling into the verbal reading too!! What a treat!!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Oh my, oh my. I can't begin to explain to you how good &quot;Hearts In Atlantis&quot; was! Please do not think of this book as five separate stories because they are not. All of the stories connect at the end and in the book.You feel yourself as many of the characters. The books ending was so good you must read it over another 100 times to get the full extent of the end!Stephen King is a God! This book will truly stay in my heart forever.-Alex"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"For many years I stayed away from Stephen King. One of my friends read him extensively and highly reccomended his work. But, I was never into the horror genre. Finally, I picked up a copy of &quot;The Shining&quot;. I was hooked instantly! King can scare you, but he can also pull on your heartstrings and other emotions as well. What attracts me most is his developemnet of the characters. By the books end, you feel that in finishing the novel, new friends are leaving after a long visit. His insights into personalities of different people in different difficult situatioons is remakable. &quot;Hearts In Atlantis&quot; is exactly like this. While this is not the type of book you would expect from King, you are pleasantly surprise. Having grown up in the time frame of these stories, it was quite a sentimental journey for me. A long book which I read quickly. I hated to arrive at the end. Several short stories held together by a thread of characters common to all of them. Well written and capivating."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The book is made up fo 5 different stories - some quite long, some quite short, and are meant to handle the &quot;Vietnam&quot; generation - the guys that fought there, or just stayed at home.The book starts off with the story of an 11 year old boy, Bobby Garfield, who befriends an elderly new neighbor who suspects that &quot;low men in yellow coats&quot;. Bobby doesn't believe him at first, but of course he eventually gets the chance to witness these peoples and their signs in the area. Even though I've read some people commenting these stories were a lot like the &quot;Gun Slinger&quot; (??) which I haven't read, but I still enjoyed this part, which was actually my favorite.The next 3 parts are more related to the war itself: a story of a college student during that era, with the war in the background as a threat to anyone dropping out of school, the story of a veteran doing pennance for his sins, and a story of a meeting of 2 war veterans years later. These stories feature 3 characters from Bobby's story: his 2 best friends, Carol Gerber and &quot;sully&quot; John Sullivan, and a catholic - school boy they had known in their childhood. The final story is the reuniting of Carol and Bobby in &quot;Sully John&quot;'s funeral.It seems that the main thread connecting the book, besides the fact that all the characters belong to the &quot;Vietnam Generation&quot; are the 3 friends: Bobby, John and Carol. That made me feel the stories were somehow artificial and forced, instead of just flowing naturally - even though this &quot;characters in common&quot; thread might have been added to give them more depth. I didn't like the division into loosely related sub stories - even though the first two were relatively long, the last 3 stories were too short for me to fully get to know the characters and their motivations."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I suppose I could ramble on for awhile about this one, but I'll try to keep it brief.First, though, a short autobiographical note: I was born in 1967 and was 8 years old when the last American troops were withdrawn from Vietnam. The reason I bring this up is that I imagine individual reactions to this book will be profoundly colored by the age of the reader.Okay, moving right along...First, the great stuff; the first story, &quot;Low Men In Yellow Coats&quot;, and its companion piece, &quot;Heavenly Shades Of Night Are Falling&quot;, are wonderful - among the best work King has yet produced. Both pieces are beautifully written, deeply moving meditations on books, reading, love, and life - worth the price of admission by themselves. As a bonus, those like myself who have been eagerly awaiting next installment of King's Dark Tower series will be delighted with these stories' allusions to the world of Roland &amp; Co.Next, the good stuff: the third and fourth stories (&quot;Blind Willie&quot; and &quot;Why We're In Vietnam&quot;, respectively) are quite enjoyable - not inspired King, but still King using his not-inconsiderable storytelling craft as well as he ever has. &quot;Why We're In Vietnam&quot;, incidentally, also has a (subtle) tie-in with the Stand/Eyes Of The Dragon/Dark Tower cycle of stories (do the initials &quot;R.F.&quot; ring a bell?).Finally, the okay stuff: the second story, &quot;Hearts In Atlantis&quot;, is a pretty good short novel that is regrettably marred by a banal &quot;I am Spartacus!&quot; climax. Still, a fun yarn for anyone who's ever been a college student, in the 60s or otherwise.In conclusion - if you're a King fan, be sure to pick this one up. If you're new to his work, you may want to start with one of his earlier works - the aforementioned novel The Stand or his excellent Different Seasons collection remain, I think, the best places to start."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Five interlocked tales, each quite different from the last. Each with its own strengths and weaknesses, they combine, an an odd sort of way, to be better than any one of them would be individually. The best of the 5 is the first and longest, Low Men in Yellow Coats, itself making up almost half of the book's volume. Familiar King themes are re-visited. His uncanny knack for getting kids just right is again demonstrated. While I have been a King fan for more than 20 years, the Dark Tower fable does nothing for me. Still, the DT references here are innocuous enough that you can read &amp; enjoy the story on its own merits. The Lord of the Flies theme of mob mentality and the violence within each of us is explored in most of the tales, as well. The least compelling story is the title tale: I mean, a bunch of college kids addicted to a card game, who cares? The final chapter provides a loving coda. While there are one or two loose ends I would have liked to have seen tied up (Bobby's mom?), the atmospherics of that last chapter are all right on, &amp; leave you feeling bittersweet, just as the author wanted you. Not horror; no one story is as good as, eg, the Body (&quot;Stand by Me&quot;) from Different Seasons; but a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is a great book! I could not put down King's latest, Hearts in Atlantis. What can I say? Few of King's novels have ever disappointed me, and this collection of interrelated stories was truly compelling.

I highly recommend this book.Others I recommend: anything by Tom Piccirilli, You Come When I Call You by Douglas Clegg, Graham Joyce's Indigo, and Peter Straub's Mr. X."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"..because it's seldom so interesting that you can't put it down, and sometimes just boring enough to make you sleepy!Seriously, this was not an awful book, but neither was it great. In fact it could just as well have been 3 separate novellas as each of the stories is only linked by the faintest of threads. The first reads like sci-fi, the second long section like autobiography. The third section (Viet Nam) suddenly delves deeply into some characters we've not even met with in the first 2 sections in order to compliment the story of some secondary characters from the 2nd section who go to Viet Nam. And for the grand finalle, it wraps up with a quip of an ending relating back to the first story. The only thing that unifies this novel besides the somewhat distant relationship between characters of the 3 parts, is the 60s, how they got through it and what finally became of them.In a nutshell, it could be a frustrating read for folks that care about the outcome of the first story which is the most interesting. On the other hand, if you're feeling more detached and you don't mind a casual (long) walk down memory lane (from the point of view of college students in the 60s and then Viet Nam), you may find something in the autobiographical tone of the substantial second section (not autobiographical in fact) and the sorrow and nightmare flashbacks of the vets in the third section, though this seemed like it had been done before in too many Hollywood movies. Finally, what seems like eons later, we get around to wrapping up the original story in a dozen pages or so (I did like the name of the last section \\"HEAVENLY SHADES OF NIGHT ARE FALLING\\" - and it does end on a somewhat satisfying note).While overall the book has a number of good moments and as many or more than are occasionally tedious, I don't regret reading it - but neither would I recommend. For much, much better 'new millenium' Stephen King (not horror, but gripping all the same) check out \\"Bag of Bones\\"."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Ted's adventures as briefly described in the Dark Tower series.Yay!

The tie in was great...the story line was as good as ever but I just did not expect what I got out of the book.Well written, as you'd expect. Twists and turns...mostly predictable King.

With a war raging overseas in Vietnam, the \\"old guard\\" was pitted against the \\"new generation\\" in a clashing of ideals that shaped our nation from that point forward.Those turbulent times are the setting for Stephen King's wonderful novel \\"Hearts In Atlantis\\". Technically, one almost can't even call this work a \\"novel\\", as it consists of five different stories from five different time periods, but it is the broad spectrum the book covers that makes it so fascinating in the first place. There are two reasons why this book is so compelling...First, the first (and longest) of the stories in the book, which sets up the characters in the other stories. A simple (yet very dramatic and engaging) tale about a boy, his friends, his first girlfriend, a group of bullies, and an eccentric new neighbor set in the early 1960s provides the groundwork for everything that is to come. The tale is almost guaranteed to hook you right away, and it is the best single story of the five.However, as the \\"Hearts In Atlantis\\" movie proved, the real genius of King's storytelling comes in how he effortless weaves in the characters from that \\"base story\\" into all the others. The girlfriend goes to college, the bullies go to Vietnam, and the young boy comes back home for one final visit. Since you WILL NOT want the first story to end, your anticipation to see how those characters \\"turned out\\" will keep you flipping the pages.So, though straying (much like \\"The Green Mile\\") from his typical craziness such as manic clowns and little bald doctors, King still manages to put together a very compelling work of fiction with this book. For anyone who grew up in the 1960s, this novel will tap into your nostalgia for the decade. Even if you didn't, though, the simple themes of love, heartbreak, and redemption will keep you interested."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The 1960s were a very troubling decade for many (most?)

Each vignette is connected by characters from the first, \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" in which frightening supernatural events in the summer of 1960 (connected to the Dark Tower, by-the-way) profoundly affect the lives of eleven year old of Bobby Garfield, Carol Gerber, John Sullivan or Sully-John. Each successive vignette follows at least one of these characters through their experience of Vietnam during their young adulthood, and then onto how the War and the '60's shaped their adult lives through the turn of the 21st century. Each new story brings in new and old characters who are touched by Bobby, Carol, and Sully-John in special ways as they deal with the profound changes brought about by the '60s.In \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" three eleven-year olds are caught in the dangerous life of an unlikely fugitive and his horrifying pursuers. In \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" a mania for the card game hearts grips a whole floor of a dorm at the University of Main as the Vietnam War begins to grip the minds and hearts of a generation. In \\"Blind Wille\\" a penitent bully tries to find his own path to redemption for misdeeds in that long ago summer of 1960 and in the War. In \\"Why We're in Vietnam,\\" Sully-John, now grown up and reeling from his experience in Vietnam, assesses his part in an atrocity as he mourns losses that push beyond the normal. In \\"Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling\\" there is a reunion of sorts, but will anything be resolved?Only the first and the fourth stores are classic King dark fantasy/horror stories (and they barely qualify as horror, more like suspense thriller). After that he moves more into the genre of stories like \\"The Body\\" or \\"The Shawshank Redemption.\\" Overall this is a quick read with a lot beneath the surface to think about. Most of the characters are well drawn, and you'll find yourself drawn into their stories. This is especially true of \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" and \\"Hearts in Atlantis.\\" There is an introspective melancholiness to this book that some might criticize, but King is such an excellent story teller that I got past that very easily. A must read for Stephen King fans, and something worth checking out for those who don't usually go in for his writing."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I loved this story but I couldn't stand William Hurt reading the Book on Tape. I don't understand why another reviewer said he was so good. He was so monotone and he constantly emphasized the wrong parts of the sentences. He rambled on and on without taking a breath; I couldn't tell where one sentence ended and the next began. He didn't change the voices for the characters like a good reader does. He was the worst reader I have ever heard and I have listened to quite a few books on tape!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The book jacket advertised it as Stephen King's take on counter-culture, the Vietnam War, and the 1960s. (King being a member of the Baby boomer generation himself).It turns out the story isn't exactly as advertised, but it was still a great read nonetheless.In his book \\"On Writing\\", among other things, Stephen King emphasized that the best books are not plotted out before hand. You just start writing the story and see where it goes. (Chester Gould, the creator of Dick Tracy, used to say the same thing: \\"The best stories are the ones you make up as you go along, because if I don't know what's going to happen next, how can the reader?\\")There may be something to this, but all the same in my (albeit limited) experience with Stephen King, when I get to the end of one of his books I always think to myself: \\"you know, I could tell he made that up as he went along.\\" There's always too many themes and plot lines that don't seem to go anywhere.The same can be said about this book. It is not so much a single story as a collection of 5 stories with some overlapping characters. King makes an effort to emphasize some of the same themes throughout, but I highly suspect that these started out as 5 unrelated stories that he rewrote into one book.That being said: It's a real page-turner. I don't remember the last time I was as hooked on a book as I was on this one: staying up late into the night to find out what was going to happen next, sneaking in little breaks at work to read a couple pages, et cetera.The first half of this book takes place during the summer of 1960 when Eisenhower is still President. A mysterious stranger moves into the block, and he appears to come from another world. It probably more accurately belongs as one of King's \\"Dark Tower\\" series than a 1960s time piece. (I didn't get very far into the \\"Dark Tower\\" series, but I am familiar enough with the general concept to recognize the cross over).This part doesn't fit exactly right with the rest of the book, but it is well written and suspenseful.The next part is about a college experience in 1966. An entire boy's dormitory is in danger of flunking out of school because of an obsession with Hearts card game. At the same time the beginnings of consciousness about the Vietnam War.At first I had a hard time believing a stupid card game could be addictive enough to cause everyone in the dorm to be in danger of flunking out. (I played Hearts a couple times in college, and never felt it was anything I wanted to give up my GPA or my social life for). And then I remembered all the people I knew from college who almost flunked because of on-line video games. So I guess in the days before video games, Hearts is as good a reason to flunk out of school as any.Whether King accurately captures the atmosphere of the 60s is not for me (born in 1978) to say. However he does a good job of recreating the tension of a boy's dormitory. At times it reminded me of \\"A Separate Peace\\" or the beginning of \\"Catcher in the Rye\\". King never quite rises to this level, but at his best parts he gets close.The last 3 chapters are in the 80s and 90s, and deal with the legacy of the Vietnam War.The themes, like the plot lines in this book, are a bit too jumbled and numerous to come out too distinctly and be neatly summarized. King manages to touch on a variety of subjects, but doesn't linger on any of them: human nature and \\"Lord of the Flies\\", the potential of the Baby boomer generation and their failure to live up to it, the irony of the peace movement turning towards violence, the Mi Lai massacre and the horrors of Vietnam, the lives of the veterans after the war, et cetera.It's almost a pity King wrote this book in 1999, because I'm sure the conflict in Iraq now, and the similarities to Vietnam, would allow him a whole other direction to go in. As it is however this book should just be taken as a pre Iraq War take on the legacy of Vietnam.The book also showcases King at his usual macabre self. Even when not writing horror, King never seems to get away from his fascination with gore and death. Some of the Vietnam War scenes, with pilots getting their skin burned off, could easily have come out of a horror book instead. And yet at the same time, this book comes off as stronly anti-war."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"It really is a novel, not a collection. It is the best book King has ever written. Books rarely make me cry, but this one did. My all time favorite King book and my all time favorite work of fiction."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Think of Stephen king as a writer of the horror story. He indeed brings more to that table than any other author who has ever lived. This tome, however is not tale of horror. If you've never read the &quot;other&quot; Stephen King, avail yourself of the opprotunity to do so. HEARTS proves King's worth as a consumate author. An there's a romantic side to the &quot;horror king&quot;. This excerpt describes an 11 year old boy's first kiss: &quot;They drew apart from each other a little....Yet he knew already that kissing Carol that day at the top of the ferris wheel was going to be the best part of that day. It was his first real kiss, too, and Bobby never forgot the feel of her lips pressing on his-dry and smooth and warmed by the sun. It was the kiss by which all others of his life would be judged and found wanting.&quot; Could anybody have painted a better word portrait? I fell in love myself with the little girl, Carol Gerber. I fell in love with the book. As others have opined, I thought at one time King had lost his touch. I took a chance with Hearts and I am the richer for doing so."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"For one who swore off Stephen King after Gerald's Game, Hearts in Atlantis brought me back into King's fan club. The combination of William Hurt's narrative coupled with King's imaginative descriptions made &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; my favorite. When Stephen King's voice began telling me about college life at Chamberlain Hall in l966 I was hooked like Pete Riley and the card game. King's Foghorn Leghorn imitation alone is worth the price of the audiobook. I remain confused with &quot;Blind Willie&quot; and hope someone will explain it to me. Perhaps I'll &quot;start to understand it in time&quot; as Sully John did the old mamasan. Hearts in Atlantis is 21 hours of entertainment and years of thoughtful enjoyment. This review refers to the unabridged audiotape version."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"&quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; starts with the childhood memories of an eleven year old. As King writes of the friendship that develops with an adult, it is done in a way that touches the heart.As a fan of the Dark Tower series, the references to the the 'Beam' and other things from that series certainly left me thinking (and hoping) that we will see more of Ted Braughtigan, the adult the youngster befriends.The second story, set a few years later in the Freshmen college years during the era of the Viet Nam war also brought powerful memories back.This book may not be a favorite for all King fans. It is not steeped in the grim tension that is felt in some of the stories that has made the author popular. But certainly, anyone growing up in the 60's and 70' would have a difficult time not getting something from this book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"It took me a while to get into it, but once you start seeing the Dark Tower references, then the real essence comes through. Mr. King is telling a story about people who are not listened to enough. I think the book has to be thought about and really digested to enjoy it, it is one that you can read over and over and get something new each time. Also we DT fans now have more info on the Dark Tower."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is Stephen King at his best. If your looking for a book that will keep you up at night, this is it...but not because of vampires or creepy monsters; the subject matter hits too close to home for that. I finished the book a week ago and still find myself thinking about the ending - a superb blending of all the previous &quot;sub-novels&quot; (five in all) contained in the book. These characters will haunt you!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis is pure Stephen King. The first section, &quot;Low Men....&quot; reminds me of The Regulators. Just as intense, though not as frightening. The second and title section was my favorite. It helps the reader to understand the different viewpoints that the Vietnam War inspired/created. The last three sections pull all the characters together in a way that only King can. Stephen King and I have matured together. Hooray for making us think as well as making us look over our shoulders!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"If you are expecting vintage King, you may be disappointed. However, over the years, it has been exciting for me to see Stephen King's style grow and evolve. Starting with Bag of Bones, King's finger on horror has matured from stock-shock gory to a deep psychological terror. In HIA, King explores some dark little places that nobody likes to go, and does so with incredible insight and sensitivity. Even if you don't like the novel, enjoy it for the pure pleasure of how Mr. King puts words down on a page. With this novel, he has certainly proven he's no longer the &quot;Big Mac and Fries&quot; of the literary world."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"What can be said about Stephen King? This is classic King. He is still and will always be my (not that it counts for much) favorite author of horror. The stories bled easily one right into another. The book had a life of it's own and carried me right along with it. When it's a let down to reach that last page. I know I've had a great read. (It's like great sex your satisfied, but you want more) Hurry up Stephen I'm ready again."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I went into this book thinking it was a novel... low men in yellow coats, horror incarnate. The tale woven true and clear, and highly sinister. Typical Stephen King horror, right? But 250 pages into a 500+ page book, the story seemed over, because the horror had ended, and I was wondering where the rest of the thickness was going to lead. Part 2 started, &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;, and changed point of view (3rd person to 1st), and also absolved itself of the horror, going into future life crossovers of the characters from part 1. I kept on reading, and the story changed dramatically.Unlike normal SK, of when the horror is over, the story stops, this one, through four &quot;continuity&quot; stories, keeps going and tells you the result of the main character's lives from the first story. Epic and brilliant, I couldn't put it down. Excellent work, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King is an inspiration; a professional who became known as a pop genre novelist, albiet a wonderful one -- The Stand and The Shining are still throbbing, living things -- and struggled mightily with his own talent and his public's expectations to continue to grow his voice and expression. Hearts in Atlantis, King's latest, could only have been written by him, but it is, at once, a far more complex, ambitious and high-minded work than he has yet produced and still a true Stephen King opus, with all the trademark dread and ickypoo thrown unselfconciously into the mix. Frankly, I tend to think that reviewers give away too much detail, and so I am not going to review the story. Suffice to say that open-minded Stephen King fans, those who like Delores Claiborne and The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, are really going to get caught up in this one. And Dark Tower series readers will learn a little more about the tower while waiting for the recuperating Mr. King to finish the last two installments in this series.One small criticism, only, on this otherwise very fine, audatious novel, which in a curious way reminds of Don DeLillo's terrific Underworld. A central story based at the University of Maine and focusing upon obsession and the use of time is twice as long as needs be and is riddled with redundance. One must conclude that Mr. King is deep into his own memorabilia here, because he exercises little of his usual economy. But, no great harm done, because the rest of the book is letter perfect. Ted Brautigan will become your friend. The Men in the Yellow Coats will enter your dreams. You may develop an irrational fear that a grand piano will fall from the sky and squash you like a bug. And you will never ever again hear the oldie &quot;Twilight Time&quot; without thinking of Hearts In Atlantis."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Is there any way to give less than 1 star?

This story made no sense. It failed to connect the Regulators and the Dark Tower, which apparently was the only reason I could see for Mr. King having wanted to have written this book.Trivial story, problems and characters made this a waste of time.

IMO, some of King's early books were masterpieces, but in recent years, it seems like his books are just thrown together haphazardly, with not enough editing or fine-tuning."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"king couldn't decide whether he wanted the book to be a horror story or maudlin ,rambling tale of life in the sixties.

Infact i had never read any of his books, yes i'd seen a few of the movies based on his books, but hadn't read any books.

In a way reminded a bit of &quot;Stand By Me&quot;. A movie about childhood and how one summer all can change, your first kiss, your first adult book, etcBobby Garfield is an engrossing character and one you want to succeed. His friendships with the other characters, S-J, Carol, Ted and his mum that summer change his life forever... The second story, also reminds you how all can change in one year at university (heck! it did for me) and how you can get trapped in a downward spirial with no escape! Ok, so i wasn't around for Vietnam and &quot;first time i saw the peace-sign&quot; but i was around for other wars and scandals. The characters are brilliant, you love some and you hate some.

The last story &quot;Heavanly Shades Of Night are Falling&quot; pput all stories together and was a good, final read.

Ultimatley I did enjoy the story, The novel is broken into five &quot;short&quot; stories, all linked together by the childhood friends from the first story,Low Men in Yellow Coats-which I really enjoyed. However, the second story, the title story, was very tedious to read. I did find that there were some interesting,sometimes intense characters, I just got so tired of reading about the obsession with the card game, it was downright boring! The one thing that kept me pushing through the story was the character of Carol, the childhood sweetheart of Bobby from the first story (Low Men). I was just reading on, hoping that it got better, wondering where her presence in this story was going. The last three stories were shorter and held much more interest for me, I found the end to be very touching, and overall, I felt that it was a good story. It just would've been SO much better if the title story were trimmed down considerably. I do think that the story is worth telling for the sake of the entire novel, but it was just......too long-I just can't get into a blow-by-blow account of a card game like that-jeesh! One last thing, as much as I have always enjoyed Stephen King's writing, I really wish he would go back to writing a book that will scare the hell out of me,...a real good-ol' bogeyman-under-the-bed type of book,...am I alone in this?"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is really a mixed bag. I would definitly read this before I bought i so I wouldn't be dissapointed. This is a collection of interconnected Novellas. The first story, \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" is easily the best. It is the story the movie Hearts in Atlantis was pretty loosly based on. Young Child Bobby Garfield is having a hard time as a kid growing up in the 60s. He is a poor kid living in an apartment with his mom. A mysterious old man moves up into an apartment above him. He spends a lot of time with him, talking about books and the such. This story is really about growing up, and how people change, the loosing of firends and the such. With a supernatural twist. King mixes in the Dark Tower and we learn a little more about the old man, he comes from that place, he's a breaker for the Crimson King. The story is reall sad, but very good.The seconf story, takes place when Bobby's childhood girlfriend goes to college. It takes place during the Vietnam era. There's a bunch more new characters. The story shows two things, how a game of hearts can make many kids fail out and be drafted, and they show the protesting side. This story was sad because Bobbies Girlfriend is not with bobby anymore.The third and fourth story were pretty terrible. They were about some of the bullies that Bobby grew up with and were darn near unreadable.The fifth very short story is a tying together of loose ends. IT brings back Bobby and his childhood sweetheart as seniors back in the old hometown. It wasn't really that satisfying. I would get this used or just baoorow it. If you like it, that's great. But I thought this was too much of a mixed bag."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book starts out really good but severly drops off at then end. I do kind of like how he showed how different people's lives intertwined based on 60's events but overall I think the book lacked. I think if he just would have stayed with the characters in the begining and not gotten into the side stories it would have been a much better book. However I am sure any who grew up in the 60's would probably really like this book, myself on the other hand did not."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I was very disappointed when I read this book. None of the stories really caught my attention, and none of them was interesting enough to make me rush through the pages, like many other Stephen King books did. The first story, \\"Low men in yellow coats\\" is the best one, but only because of its link with the Dark Tower series. Someone who doesn't know those books won't find it as appealing. As for \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\", is also a little bit interesting, but it doesn't justify its excessive length. The same thing happens with \\"Blind Willie\\". As for the two final stories, \\"Why we're on Vietnam\\" and \\"Heavenly Shades of Night are falling\\", well... they just bore me to death. I guess even the King can fail sometimes. Better luck on the next book, Stevie."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"In my opinion I think this may be the best book Stephen King has written, I'm not a big fan of the horror side, but I read his horror books for the work, not the blood and guts that most of his fans read for, I enjoyed this book from the first page to the last, I had listened to this on Audiobook, William Hurt Reads The First Story Low Men In Yellow Coats, The 4th Story Why Were In Vietnam and the 5th Story Heavenly Shades &amp; Nights Are Falling, Stephen King reads the 2nd Story Hearts In Atlantis and the 3rd Story Blind Willie, In the First Story Low Men In Yellow Coats, set in 1960, we are introduced to Bobby Garfield a Kid living in Harwich, Conneticut, his friends Sully-John aka John Sullivan and Carol Gerber, he lives with his mother Liz Garfield. He befriends a man who moves into his apartment complex, his name is Ted Brautigan. Throughout the story he experiences different adventures.The 2nd story Hearts In Atlantis, set in 1966, is told through the eyes of a student in a college his name is Pete and his friend Skip, he tells the adventures of College, he also befriends Carol Gerber, gets hooked on cards, and stops, this part starts to influence the rest of the book on the Vietnam War.The 3rd Story Blind Willie, set in 1983, is about Willie Shearman, who had a part in The 1st Story, it will tell you about him and what goes on in a day lived by Will Shearman.The 4th Story Why Were in Vietnam, set in 1999, is about Sully-John, and how he survived the Vietnam War.The 5th Story Heavenly Shades Of Night Are Falling, Set in 1999, Bobby Garfield returns to Harwich for a funeral, a place which will now tell Bobby if love is waiting for him, and the memories of the summer of 1960.Overall this book is simply sensational, it was extremely sad at the end, I recommend you Buy it. Grade: A+"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis is a book that every slacker college student should read. For me, you could substitute playing hearts for playing Quake II. Mr. King does a wonderful job painting a picture that relates to today's young adults seemlessly. So you mean to tell me that the baby boomers once felt as rebelious as the youth of today? I guess the seed really doesn't fall that far from the tree. These stories are engaging and provocative, provided you can open your head to the concept of the Dark Tower for one of them."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Its five storys about Bobby, Carol and Sully John, three childhood-friends who after a while discovers that they really are very different from eachother. Its a story about growing up, that after a while the children inside you dissapers completly. The story is also a part of the dark tower series, something that makes it very powerfull. Sceary: Abit, but no horror. Funny: Not much. Stephen Kings best? NO!, but it a relly good one. Read it!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book appears to be a collection of three different, although intermixing stories and each was written from a different view (first person, third person, ect.). It's mostly confusing with the switching of perspectives and sometimes annoyingly slow. It refers to &quot;The Dark Tower,&quot; which is another of Stephen King's work, remarkably often with no real direct information. So, unless you read &quot;The Dark Tower,&quot; you'll be pretty lost when it comes to the mentioning of the &quot;blood red rose petals,&quot; and the &quot;beams.&quot; Finally, the ending is terrible. It's so abrupt and empty that for a second I thought pages were missing, surely there would be more - but there isn't. It would be wonderful for a sequel but that's something this book just doesn't deserve."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The book began as classic king, with that fascinating descriptive writing I just plain adore.... then proceeded quickly into a kind of rambling and disjointed tale. maybe I was expecting too much? By the end of the book I was wondering if I was dumb because I did not get it, or if the story was just too loosely thrown together. I long for the days of king's novels such as The Stand but, alas, those days are gone for good, it seems. Let's hope he tries again soon.... he is still the best writer alive!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"In which Stephen King writes a \\"Wonder Years\\" episode. Well, more like the whole series. Ugh.Hearts in Atlantis is not a horror book at all. It's been out a while, and picked it up for cheap used, and didn't know this about it. It follows the life of an uninteresting kid from the Northeast leading an unremarkable life in the 50's, becoming a rather timid \\"radical\\" in the 60's, and an aging boomer father by the end. In the mean time, we meet the mundane people of his life, childhood bullies, bad influences in college (why study when there is money to be made playing Hearts?), friends who go to Viet Nam; some who suffer from debilitating illness. I didn't care about a single one -- for the first time, King's power of character creation was utterly lost on me.Other King books have started out slow but managed to generate SOME interest by the end. This never did. I kept waiting for a justification that I did not waste 19 hours of my life listening to this, but it never came."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"ok first of all i dint understnad the story properly with all tht regulaotrs thing...........i hate the fact that i have to read KING's another book to really understan this book.......which almost felt like a WASTE of time....but none the less the story still holds its grounds..........the segments and stories of many people are interesting and specially the one with the BLIND GUY.........none the less it isnt KIngs Bad book......its actually pretty Good if u can just see past its Regulators thing........but none the less KING is able to creat strangeness in his stories and still keep it believable........3/5"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book, a Stephen King version of Vietnam. From reading the back cover, I was expecting a book that was somehow divided between four decades and illustrating one individual's life from his critical youth years to post-Vietnam reflection and redemption.Instead, you get the first half of a book portraying a tacky round of villains from The Dark Tower series called Low Men in Yellow Coats. Come on, these people feet don't touch the ground when they walk? Just as the main character's life is taking shape, the story gets cut off. And you get thrown into the second half of the book, made up of different stories that basically go nowhere, made up of different characters,leaving you feeling unsympathetic and dry, and in the end feel like you wasted all your time. It's like listening to someone talk about their lifestory with incoherent reflections and philosophies. Boring, boring, boring.The book would have been better if it had taken the main character and challenged what he learned from the old man Ted and Lord of the Flies. It would have been really interesting to have seen how his disillusionment and understanding would carry him through Vietnam and afterwards. I really believe this."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King is a fine, talented author, but Hearts in Atlantis was not my favorite. A few of the segments were good reading, but I found myself skipping over pages...the book held little interest for me. Bag of Bones was excellent; one of his best."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have never before almost given up on a SK book, however, Hearts in Atlantis almost did it for me. Honestly, I am wondering what has happened to the old Stephen King style. In Hearts in Atlantis we are introduced to drivel such as &quot;cars that aren't really cars&quot; but evil entities, more mind-reading and other non-scary, non-compelling ideas. My next Stephen King book will be borrowed from the library and purchased only if I have had an enjoyable reading experience. My favorite book is still Misery, a book that is horrifying because it is something that could truly happen."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I can't say I've always been a King fan. I tend to enjoy those that are shorter on horror and longer on character development and plot i.e The Green Mile or Shawshank Redemption. I hated his stuff like The Pet Semetary and Desperation. So, I picked up this book with great anticipation. Low Men in Yellow Coats is the best of the lot. Since I had not read the Dark Tower series, I must say that the references to the Dark Tower lost me. King does such a great job of capturing the real and imaginary worlds of children. The real horrors are not in ghosts but in real people like the pedophile in the park or the bullies. Hearts in Atlantis, although introducing us to what will be continuing characters, is far too long and very redundant. From there on, the book becomes just a jumble of who's connected and why, what happens to many of them and why, and then a lot of unanswered questions. Would somebody please tell me how the glove got from Blind Willie to Sully. And, what was that stuff with Jasper the Smurf cop and getting rid of him? Where did that go? I know this book was supposed to be about the 60's and the war's effect, but haven't we been there done that with the bloody jungle scenes (nice slap at The Deer Hunter). I read this on two overseas flights, and it kept my attention. But, if I'd have been at home, I don't know if I would have finished it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis has been one of the most difficult books I have ever reviewed. I just keep wondering what the exact purpose of it is, why did King write it? The story is a shade different from anything King has ever written. It isn't horror, suspense, or fantasy, but rather a true to life story about how different people have been affected by the sixties and Vietnam. The book is basically a composition of five different stories. I think King brings them together alright in the end, but during the ride we are often puzzled.The first story, and the best, is about a young Bobby Garfield and his coming of age through a magical friend named Ted he meets. Bobby is eleven years old. His mother is a harsh, prideful woman who does not trust others easily. Bobby has a girlfriend named Carol and a friend named Sully. Bobby's mom rents out her house to people coming into town. One of these people is named Ted. Ted is an interesting older man who thinks that people are out to get him. He even gives Bobby signs to watch out for in case these \\"men\\" somehow find Ted and send him back to wherever he came from. At the core of this story is Bobby's relationship with Ted, his feelings of anger towards his mother, his friendship with Carol, and his confusion over his deceased father. This is the best story of the lot, full of clear dialogue. Only near the end does it falter and bring in unneeded elements of fantasy which downplay the theme of coming of age that it is supposed to portray.The second story is about a bunch of college boys. The main character who tells the story is Pete. This is an entertaining, if crude and overlong, adaptation of what it might have been like to be in college in the late 60's during the Vietnam era. Pete is addicted to the card game of hearts, which is affecting his school work, but so are all of his friends. Large tournaments are created and we are introduced to a host of different characters, all of which have a unique voice. Pete falls in love with Carol, the same little girl in the first story. Now she has grown up and will soon become an activist against the war. I am not sure what the point of this story is other than to show characters in the 60's as they might have been.The third, and weakest, story of the lot is \\"Blind Willie\\", which is about a man named William who is married and served in the Vietnam War. In his childhood days, he stole Bobby's (story 1) favorite baseball mitt and served the war with Bobby's childhood friend Sully and even saved his life. Now, Willie mysteriously goes blind in the afternoons, only to regain his sight in the evening. He pretends to be a vagabond and preys off the goodwill of others to make his living. This story felt out of place here and the novel would have worked without it.The fourth story is about Sully. This might be the most consistent of the five stories. It is by far the saddest. It tells the story of Sully, Bobby's childhood friend, who has had devastating after the war scars, due to his time spent in Vietnam. One in particular is an old, dead Vietnamese woman that he saw one of his fellow soldiers savagely murder during the war. Sully sees her everywhere. Of course he is hallucinating, but the hallucinations feel very real. Sully also hallucinates about the world crumbling around him. At times he can be normal, but most of the time the war has left him scarred beyond repair.The fifth and final story is not really a story but rather a bridge that connects the beginning tale and gives us a feeling of closure. Bobby, now a carpenter, married with three children, returns home to attend the funeral of one of his friends. He hopes to see the girlfriend Carol, who is believed dead, but might still be living. Bobby also tried to make some sense about why he is drawn back home after all this time.Although Hearts in Atlantis doesn't seem to have any real powerful meaning behind it, it is written with the usual reality and skill King puts into most of his novels. I definitely wasn't blown away by anything here, but it felt like an entertaining read. Hearts in Atlantis can be uneven, overlong, and even pretentious at times, but at least King brings it together nicely in the end. Just stick with it through the times where you wonder where it is all supposed to go and what it is supposed to mean. Although I didn't like the fantasy element in the first story, I think King does a good job of explaining what it all means in the final section.This is by no means King's greatest work, but he has written some real bombs as well. At least this isn't one of them. Overall, a forgettable book, but marginally recommended because of the interesting characters and dialogue that are presented here. They feel as real as any King has drawn up....too bad the story couldn't match the same quality. If you are looking for great stories about the Vietnam War and the Sixties, however, this isn't the place to go....but it's a not a bad little piece of escapism.Grade: B-"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"don't get me wrong, i love SK. but this book sucks. the first story &quot;low men in yellow coats&quot; was great, but that was a result of the connection to the Dark Tower series which i LOVE. wizard and glass was one of SK's best books ever! but this book went downhill after low men. i do appreciate SK's attempt at literary acceptance, or whatever it is he wants. but i miss the old, big, huge, monster books he wrote. ones with plots, many characters that you know better than you own parents, etc. hell, the green mile was one of the greater books of the 90's, and different seasons was an excellent collection of stories. if those cannot grant literary acceptance, then SK will be hard pressed to write something that will. and if he outdose those books, i'll be in heaven enjoying every word.

Heartfelt appreciation to Producer-Director-Composer Eve Beglarian , and all concerned. (I put in close to 20 years in ADR, Eve, and know whereof I praise.) The reading, direction, music, editing and production work on this presentation are entirely worthy of the book, itself. I can think of no higher praise.The book is a masterpiece. A classic. One of the most rewarding literary experiences I have ever absorbed. And if one can afford the unabridged audio version, I recommend it as being worth infinitely more than said sticker price. I've read a lot of Stephen Kings work, and have enjoyed it, but this time the experience was so profound, King has risen, in my esteem, to the level of the Masters.How can I possibly let King know how affected I am by his work? Just let me say that I am every bit as stricken by \\"Atlantis\\" as King, himself, is by \\"Lord Of The Flies.Sincerely, Robert V. Barron"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Mr. King remembers what it's like thinking and feeling like a kid and how as grownups, we are still pretty much that same little kid. I liked how the characters connected between stories of youthful relationships, college life in the sixties, how music of that time impacted us, and with Vietnam War always in the background. I had quit reading Steven King, but for some reason I was inclined to read this one and very glad I did."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Isn't it amazing how this man manages to turn out a masterpiece of contemporary American literature every six months or so? Hearts in Atlantis is great, so are they all. A note to all the arrogant academic imbiciles who seem obsessed with distinguishing the high, exalted SERIOUS LITERATURE from that low, popular genre trash; the books that are truly great are the ones people read. The obsessive nature of King's fan base is anagolous to that of Dickens. ALL of King's books (yes even the great, maligned automotive-Orestia, Christine) are not only good, but &quot;serious&quot;. Hearts is no exception. As one who appreciates GOOD literature (I am not one of the snobs who claims that if it ain't Updike, it ain't good, nor am I one who drools over every bad bit of horror, fantasy, or sci-fi drek that comes along)I loved all the stories in this remarkable book, and was neither dismayed by the supernatural occurences in the first piece, nor the lack of any in the rest. (This is, by the by, not entirely true; there is a supernatural being waiting in the wings in the latter parts of the book, or am I the only one who noticed that the man who seduced Carol into the violent activist group bears the initials R.F.?)Hearts is great, but not because &quot;King has finally written a SERIOUS book; Pet Semetary and IT are just as serious. The book is great because of King's power to write whatever he chooses well. Along with Salman Rushdie, Umberto Eco, Tom Robbins, and Kurt Vonnegut, he is one of the absolute masters of modern literature. Hearts in Atlantis is simply one more reason that Stephen King will be around centuries after the last of his &quot;literary&quot; detractors are turned to clay and stopping a hole to keep the wind away."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Masterful. Stephen King at his absolute best. Perhaps this book will finally grant him the praise he deserves as one of the world's greatest writers. Hearts in Atlantis is an emotional tour through the soul of all human beings. It is an ABSOLUTE masterpiece.

Keep 'em coming, King!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"In the letter to readers, King writes:&quot;Of Los Angeles, Gertrude Stein said: &quot;There is no there there.&quot; That's how I feel about the sixties, when the consciousness of my generation was really formed, and about the years after the sixties, when we won our few victories and suffered our any appalling defeats. It was easier to imagine swallowing a brick than it was to imagine writing about how America's first post-World War II generation moved from Red Ryder air rifles to army carbines to mall arcade laser pistols. And yeah, I was afraid. Allen Ginsberg said: &quot;I have seen the best minds of my generation rot&quot;; I have seen some of the best writers of my own try to write about the so-called Baby Boomers and produce nothing but bad karma laced with platitudes. &quot;Well, it wasn't LA, it was Oakland California that had no there there. And anyone who had even a touch of the beatnik in him knows that Howl starts off--- &quot;I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix, angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night ... &quot; etc.But then King being a novelist doesn't have to get the facts right."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King just may be the best American writer of the Later half of the 20th century. Hearts in Atlantis just may prove my theroy. This is King's personal best in quite awhile, comparing to his greats as Different Seasons and The Shining.

When you take his output as a whole, however, you can't but realize that there has been a slightly uneven but definite advance in his use of a novelist's tools. &quot;Hearts&quot; shows a marked advance over nearly anything King has done. The title alone resonates through the book on a number of different levels, out of a number of meanings. The stories, not really separate, dovetail on more and subtler ways than is immediately apparent. Images and implications &quot;circulate&quot; through the stories and echo off one another in a very sophisticated way. And underneath it all is King's consistent compassionate insight into his characters (young people and kids in particular) and, perhaps his greatest skill, giving what is in a way genre fiction a solid foundation in a reality we can identify and identify WITH. A fine book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Time Flies -- it also heals -- and brings back memories long burried -- a fine collection of stories that I looked forward to finishing, but was disappointed to put behind me -- not because they were bad -- rather because I was so drawn to the world they created for me -- wonderful story telling -- wonderful stories -- highly recommended for both the Constant Reader and the reader who has never experienced Mr. King's haunting tales -- enjoy --"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"In my opinion, this is Mr. King's best novel in years.

Should be a classic because it's fantastic."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I bought this book without reading reviews or summaries, and I was pleasantly surprised. I was so excited to read the first story since it ties into the Dark Tower series. The characters are well-developed and I love the way he ties them together. SK has an amazing ability to tell stories when he's not caught up in gruesome detail. I really enjoyed this one."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have just finished reading this book and am pleased to say that Stephen King has captivated me again. Hearts in Atlantis is composed of five stories that blend together like one complete novel. You will not find rabid dogs, haunted Plymouths, psychotic ex-nurses, or vampires in this book. What you will find are five engrossing stories by a writer who, in my humble opinion, has still not reached his literary peak. The five stories revolve around the generation that came of age in the sixties and what became of their idealisms and dreams. Being 27 years of age, I do not understand the Vietnam era, nor will I ever truly understand it. King's book, however, brought me closer to illumination with respect to the Vietnam era than I have ever been. The title story, in particular, drew me in. It is a first person narration from a freshman college student at the University of Maine in 1966 that explains what events led him to protest the war in Vietnam. King's book puts human faces on an era that many of us are accustomed to simply studying about in history class. I have been an avid Stephen King reader since the mid-eighties and have been particularly impressed with his most recent works, such as The Green Mile, The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass, and Bag of Bones. I strongly recommend Hearts in Atlantis to anyone, as I have now added it to my list of Stephen King favorites."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I work in a bookstore and was thrilled when we got in the advance copy. I read it in two days and can honestly say that I couldn't in good conscience recommend it to anyone.

This novel, NOT a collection of loosely joined stories as some might suspect from the overleaf, which must have certainly been written by someone elso who didn't read the book, is a complete work from one of America's finest writers. The three sections of the book are inextricably connected. To separate one from the other is a sin of the highest order. This is perhaps King's finest work, one which caused tears to flow from this reader than any other, ever. It is a sensitive, compelling, accurate account of a group of characters and their participation in a period of history. King beautifully and tragically weaves a story that few other authors could match on their best days. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING I have ever read has moved my mind and heart as much as this great story. (Reference the movie version: To take just one tiny part of a masterpiece and grind it into some freakshow Hollywood pile of crap is an unspeakable tragedy.) This book is a complete package, take it or leave it. But it must never be read as a collection of short stories, such as The Green Mile could be read as one or two disconected parts of the whole and still contain the total effect of a masterpiece. This can only be taken as a complete work, and in its completeness lies its strength as a chronicle, albeit with a supernatural twist here and there, of a time and place in American history that has never been captured with such accuracy, sadness and triumph before now. The tears I shed for these characters, the situations, and the manner in which they are told were real. This book belongs to be listed with the great novels of all time."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"As a long time King fan, I am always amazed that so many people still think he is a gory horror writer, when most of his work for the past twenty years or more are stories about the human condition, innocence lost and nature versus nurture.I found this series of stories to be some of the best he has ever put out.

He chose Hearts in Atlantis for me because it is his favorite. It's not what I consider a typical \\"Stephan King book\\" because it is not horror or scary, but does have a touch of sci-fi. The book is broken into pieces, each focusing on a different character, the last of which is focused back on the first character to tie things together.

King loves to interplay his work between each other and this one is no different. King takes a lesson from the Sound and the Fury here: each of these stories takes a view of a character, but the main link between all the stories (caddy in TSATF and Carol here) is never given a chance to be the focus. It works brilliantly, especially the second story, which will haunt anyone who has struggled through romance in college (&quot;hearts are strong, Pete, most hearts don't break, they just bend&quot;) and for anyone who has ever cherchez la femme noire in a good game of hearts. One of the finer works of literature this decade by any writer."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"...too bad the rest of the book has nothing to do with Ted and his &quot;low men&quot;. Read the first story and the last. The Vietnam war stuff in the middle just seems out of place and has little to do with the outcome. Not one of his best, or even very good."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"and King is still the King. Baby boomers will enjoy this collection -- related stories that hopscotch through lives of different characters. Yes, (to Author's Note) it is difficult to believe that the 60s are not fictional - and there is so much more out there. A sequel? Please? I'd love the SK \\"spin\\" on the Cuban Missile Crisis, the assassinations, The Cold War. I was struck by the fact that students today have to worry about drugs, gunmen (many produced by our generation); studentscoming of age in the 60s were focused on nuclear annihilation and fighting an unfathomable war; and our parents' generation was traumatized by Hitler. Pure, powerful evil, whichever generation you come from -- it is the same battle. These are awesome tales that allow the reader to crawl into someone else's head in true SK style. Actually, I'm prepared to pre-order the music CD. Soon?"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I couldn't put this book down. I got the book on Friday night and finished it Sunday at about 4:00 a.m. This book was SO gripping and poignant and meaningful. It's just amazing how Mr. King can scare us AND bring tears of joy and sadness to our eyes (as he did here -- in a fashion somewhat similar to the story that Stand By Me was based on.) I give this book my highest praise and have already encouraged others who had been a little disappointed with Bag of Bones and Tom Gordon to read it. I'm sure they and you will be greatly impressed."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I read this in its unabridged audiobook format and was initially held spellbound. At first glance, this isn't a book I'd pick up and read on my own which is is probably why I didn't purchase it before now but I always enjoy Stephen King's voice and the first story \\"Low Men In Yellow Coats\\" is no exception.It clocks in at 320+ pages and is a novel in and of itself. \\"Low Men\\" tells the story of Bobby, a young boy growing up in the 60's with a bitter, angry mother who claims to love him but who definitely does not like him. He has a small group of friends who dodge town bullies but finds true kinship with an old man named Ted who has an odd secret. When Bobby's mom goes away on business Ted looks after Bobby. During their time together Bobby learns many truths, some ugly some stunning. It's funny and heartbreaking. Great stuff.The second story \\"Hearts In Atlantis\\", unfortunately, didn't do it for me and I often found my drifty mind floating away as I pondered all of the laundry that I had left to do when I returned home from work. The rewind button got a lot of use during the rest of this audiobook . . . It's basically about a group of college students living through the Vietnam War. The boys do a lot of trash talking and play a card game called \\"Hearts\\" which becomes an obssession for many of them. As the Vietnam war protests heat up and these guys fear expulsion for their lackluster grades the plot plods on . . .Next up is the story of one of the unlikable kids featured in the first novella. Will is all grown up but is haunted by his past, particularly the incident that made him such an unlikable character for me in \\"Low Men\\". This story, like the previous one, was unremarkable and tough to get through. Same goes for the next two stories which wrap up a few loose ends. I wish I had stopped the audio after reading \\"Low Men\\" but I'm a glutton for punishment."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I really, really liked this book; however, despite the somewhat happy ending, I think beneath it all there is a very dark, disturbing message -- we are all basically damned by our own human nature. The bridges to all of the stories is &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; and Carol Gerber. Carol could have fit right on that island with the rest of the boys in &quot;Lord.&quot; Her eventual loss of innocence and descent into violence is very similar to Golding's characters. It also has its genesis in events completely beyoond her control just as the children on the island.Because of the tragedy that befalls Carol, her &quot;ka&quot; is to be at the center of violence for the rest of her life (until her rebirth as Denise). There is nothing she can do about it. She can only go along for the ride and hope that all works out all right. In the end, like all of us, she will make it off the island, but will be much worse off for the experience.Carol is typical of all of the other characters in the book. In one way or another all of the characters fall victim to their most base instincts, and in one way or another, attempt, with varying degrees of success, to overcome the hells they have created for themselves. In the end, none are completely successful and almost all are just one cigarette away from completely spiraling toward a self-destructive end.Another theme running through these stories is that the very people charged with caring and prtecting for children, adults, almost always do harm to those children. This is most clearly embodied in the unseen old men who send other people's kids off to die in wars that have nothing to do with those actually compelled to do the dying. However, a more subtle take on this theme is seen through the Ted Braughtigan character. Ted is certainly not a monster and would never willfully hurt any of the children in the opening story; however, Ted very much did hurt Bobby Garfield. By touching Bobby in spite of his best instincts he opens Bobby up to the true horrors of the adult world to which no child should ever be exposed. On the surface, ted never did molest bobby, but symbolically Bobby is an abused child and develops the behaviors of an abused child. This is Bobby's demon to overcome.There are few truly likeable, decent, adults in any of these stories. All have been molested, and like many of the molested, go on to be molesters themselves.In the end, one has to ask two questions about &quot;Hearts in Atlantis.&quot; First, is the ending happy or sad? Second, who will save us (adults) from ourselves? The answer largely depends on your outlook on life.Great book with great words."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Like any longtime Stephen King fan, I was dismayed when I heard he will soon quit. HEARTS IN ATLANTIS, while enjoyable, made me think he may be quitting at the right time. Like George Lucas before him, he is nearing self-indulgence. Although I am tired of hearing about the 1960s from aging Baby Boomers reliving their youth, I was intrigued to read King's take. I knew he would write, at least, a great coming-of-age story, and at most, a new take on the 1960s -- something rarely seen in the Boomer nostalgia marketing. I was right, but still disappointed.Many characters receive short shrift, most notably Carol Gerber. In his early days, after CARRIE, King idealized his female characters so they were two-dimensional. However, in recent years, especially in DOLORES CLAIBORNE, King seemed have outgrown that problem. Here, it returns. Carol's two most important turning points -- her savage beating as a child and her involvement with a radical group as an adult -- are vaguely described second-hand. Worse, the explanation for her second turning point seems incongruous with what little we know of her.If the stories are treated individually, the problems become more apparent. The first, \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats,\\" starts as a gripping story of Bobby Garfield's loss of innocence. The seeds of Bobby's disillusionment have been sown by the time he befriends mysterious Ted Brauttigan. Few authors capture the magic and awe of childhood as well as King, but his story unravels as he reveals Brauttigan's connection to THE DARK TOWER. Removed from the context of the Spaghetti-western-meets-Conan-the-Barbarian epic, the elements seem, in this realistic setting, more like dopey fantasy novel mysticism. By the time King stops the action at his climax for DARK TOWER exposition, Bobby's story has been muddled to the point of incomprehension and annoyance. This hackneyed set-up weakens all that follows.The second story, \\"Hearts in Atlantis,\\" is the best. Not only is it a dark, funny portrait of addiction and self-destruction, but it presents a side of the 1960s often glossed over in the nostalgic fairy tales. King stops where most retrospectives linger: the point when students protest on campuses, grow their hair out and paint peace signs on their jackets. His story reveals how they got to that point in a span of mere months. As a stand-alone story, \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" is almost as compelling as the game it depicts.The last three stories are all short. His slice-of-life \\"Blind Willie\\" is well written, but its premise of a Vietnam veteran posing as a wounded vet in penance nonetheless borders on implausible. \\"Why We're in Vietnam\\" is a preachy historical analysis interspersed with a decent war story and a haunting surrealistic fantasy. Finally, \\"Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling\\" barely wraps up the main plotlines of the book.Overall, HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is a frustrating read -- some great ideas hindered by King's exposition, pointless interweaving of outside stories and half-baked supernatural mumbojumbo. First-time King readers will be lost, and longtime fans will often be left disappointed."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I'll start with the positive. The writing is good, very good. Stephen King has come a long way since &quot;Carrie&quot; which I often describe as the worst written book I have ever read. It has taken me many years to pick up a Stephen King book again. This came from my daughter who felt it explained the Sixties to her. The first story is great with interesting characters and plot. It is evocative of a time in the early 60's that has long since ceased to exist except in the imagination. I co~tinued on to the second story which does a great job of humorously describing the milieu of the mid-60's at college campuses, especially the obsession with musical correctness. Unfortunately, after so many silly heart games, one loses interest. I played hearts in college and never found it as compulsively addictive as King makes it sound. From there it was mostly downhill. King didn't capture the Viet Nam War for me. I would have been just as happy to read the first story in the collection and move on to something more interesting. That being said, I am glad to have read Hearts in Atlantis. King does a nice job of tying together lose ends of the plot at the end."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis takes a story that starts in the 1960s and strings it out into many stories that conclude in the present day. All of the characters in Hearts in Atlantis are described in great detail pertaining to the characters personality. Throughout the book the reader is able to logically follow why the character feels or acts the way they do. A good example of this would be in the first story. The reader can easily follow reasons of resentment that the main character harbors toward his mother.Hearts in Atlantis also vividly depicts the decade. King uses his characters to paint the time. Characters go to peace rallies that turn violent; characters go to college to avoid being drafted and characters flunk out and go to Vietnam. King also uses music as a device to convey the times. Specifically, music was used to convey the 1960s. Most songs mentioned were songs of protest by folk singers but there were also oldies included.I thought Hearts in Atlantis was a very good book and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading historical fiction. The book is very accurate when it portrays the times from 1960s to the present. The stories, particularly the first and second ones, are enthralling. I could hardly put the book down."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King speaks to those of us who lived the college life of the 60s. Hearts in Atlantis brought back so many memories, good and not so good, of my experiences in a small midwestern college. The characters are real people. The incidents really happened. It is exciting to find a fictional read that is able to ellicit such historical and universal truth. By changing names and details, the story could have occured on any of thousands of campuses in the country. A great story teller, King magically weaves the pre-campus and post-campus threads into the fabric of the whole. Insight is a gift given freely and gladly accepted by this reader."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Except for the men with the yellow jackets, the first story brought back a lot of memories of the best times of my life, childhood playing with my best friends in the summers'. I couldn't get enough of it. I was disappointed at first with the second story because I was continuously waiting to come across the kids from the first story and more of their childhood adventures but realized he wanted to hit every age group (and their take on what was going on in the world) through this very rough time period and I thought that was a great idea. Overall, once I realized what his purpose of totally shifting gears through the different stories was, I thought this was the best book I ever read (then I read Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Lord of the Rings and now this is third place on my list: the first sub story in this is tied for first though!!) YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED with this book, give it a chance and try to see his purpose in changing the characters story to story, and you will see that this book could not have been written any better!!!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"There's a touch of the supernatural in this offering from Stephen King, but it takes a back seat to the human element of the story, which is going to really hit home with those who were in collage-- or of that age-- in the \`60s. \\"Hearts In Atlantis\\" is an especially poignant tale that follows the lives of a number of individuals in five interrelated sections, beginning in 1960 and finishing up in 1999. And, be forewarned, there is going to be no middle ground with this one; depending on where you were in your own life during the times depicted here, you're either going to love it or hate it, because quite frankly, it is so well written and so very real, that it is going to take you to a place you want to revisit, or to a place you may have spent a good deal of your life trying to forget. How you receive it is going to depend greatly on your own personal experiences and frame of reference. One way or another, it's going to take you on a journey that evokes a sense of time and place that will have an impact on you, the likes of which few novels are capable of producing.King deserves a lot of credit for this one, because even though it is a work of fiction, he obviously had to open himself up and take a journey of his own to so succinctly and honestly capture the events and lives of the characters he presents here. This is an examination of human nature that explores relationships on a number of different levels; how people relate not only to one another, but to the events of the times and the short and long term effects of it all on those involved. It's not always a pretty picture, but it certainly is real. And the characters to whom he introduces you quickly become more than names in a book. These are people you're going to care about, and you will probably find more than one with whom you are going to be able to relate and identify very closely.The single frustration I had with the story was that by the end of the first section, \\"Low Men In Yellow Coats,\\" there is no resolution to the situation of one of the characters; I wanted a sense of closure to the episode that simply was not forthcoming. All I can say is, stick with it-- by the end of the book you'll know everything you need or want to know, and in the final analysis, \\"Hearts In Atlantis,\\" beside being somewhat different than King's usual fare, is also one of his best. It's definitely a journey worth taking."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I had been out of the reading loop for quite some time. After seeing the film &quot;Hearts in Atlantis,&quot; I was eager to read the book, even though the movie was based only on the first story, that first story porved to be the jumping off point for many of the young characters, as they entered into Vietnam, into the field, those who protested against it, and some having to live with painful memories.The first story deals with young Bobby Garfield and his mom, who constantly complains to Bobby that money is scarce for them (even though almost weekly she brings home brand new dresses from department stores). One day, a lodger in the floor above them moves in, and Bobby meets Ted Brautigan, a strange old man who helps Bobby see the bright side to the gift his mom got him for his birthday (all he got was an Adult Library card, allowing him to check out the more serious fiction). Ted helps bobby to get interested in reading, and helps Bobby and his friends Carol Gerber and Sully-John. But Ted is not all that he seems, as he is seemingly on the run from some suspicious characters whom he refers to as &quot;Low-men,&quot; people who wear yellow coats and drive rather scary and flashy automobiles. Ted sets the story and possibly shapes Bobby's life for the future.The second story deals with several University students some years after the first story. One student dates Carol Gerber, but the young man is in a school where his grades are important, and in that sense, he gets hooked into playing a card game called &quot;Hearts.&quot; The story also sets up the campus thoughts and reactions to the war.The third deals with another person from Bobby's young life, this time in the 1980's, as the man comes to grips with the aftermath of Vietnam and a strange &quot;sense of duty.&quot;The 4th story deals with Sully-John, a man who became quite distant from bobby after that summer that Ted Brautigan showed up, now Sully-is getting older, noticing the war veterans that he and his friends have become, and wonders about change.The 5th story deals with Bobby, as revelations and such convince him to return to the place where it all began, but of all the people, Bobby never was quite as touched by the war as his friends were.The stories and all have some depth, but can wander at times. The main story was quite involving, but several took some time to get through. It's not the best read, but it made me finish it in about a week, which is usually a good sign of a book if it can make me spend a lot of time reading."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I was looking forward to seeing the movie and I thought I should read the book first. Now, I am not so sure. I had no idea what the book was about going in and I am still wondering. My advice, realize ahead of time that these are &quot;stand alone&quot; stories. It is true that some of the characters make more than one appearance. However, the tales could have been told without that. I feel that I would have enjoyed the stories more had I realized this wasn't one novel, but a collection of short stories. I kept wondering what the low men were and when they were going to show up again which distracted me througout the rest of the book. I did enjoy the writing and that is why I gave 4 stars. I found the Vietnam stories especially engaging."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Being a Stephen King fan (even though I've only read about 4 or 5 of SK's books) and a fan of things from the Sixties (The Beatles, Hendrix, and all those people are my favourite performers) I found this book to be one of his best. The storytelling is superb, as well as the characters and the way the spirit of the sixties is kept.Of the five stories the one I liked the most was Low Men In Yellow Coats because it is the one that is the most Stephen King-like. It makes you remember about when you were a kid, how your mind used to be focused on just a few things before it all became complicated. This one will sure be interesting to watch in the movie of the book.The second story, Hearts in Atlantis was one that I loved as well. It somehow gave me a glance at how my parent's college life must have been. The story itself is worthy of a movie all by itself (*hint* any movie producers reading?! please!)The third story (Blind Willie) was kind of interesting, even though it is the weakest one. While the main character is related interconnected to the rest of the characters in the book, this story seemed as if it was copy/pasted from somewhere in King's computer. The story is good and it reveals some kind of redeeming in the character's life, but it's not that big of a story.The fourth story is &quot;Why We're In Vietnam&quot;, an excellent look at the lives of the veterans of that terrible war. This story is the preamble of the book's full circle story, as it is continued by &quot;Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling&quot;, the story's &quot;epilogue&quot;, which will bring goosebumps to your skin with the story being told.This books is a must read for all of King's fans, and for those who haven't read him, this is a great book to start with (then move on to Bag Of Bones :-).As an afterthought, I read that this book's movie focuses more on the first and fourth story, but I don't possible know how you could tell this story without at least some deep look into the second story, just a tiny little glimpse at the third story and it MUST end with the fifth story. I think the movie would not be complete with out that last story.Anyway, get this book, you will love it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"&quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; is a very, very good read. Deep, emotional, and really quite interesting. I reread &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; right before starting &quot;Hearts&quot; - and I highly recommend that everyone else try that too.The characters were well sketched and I felt connected to them, especially Carol, Ted, and believe it or not, Ronnie too. I felt sorry for the poor guy.There were many subtle connections that kept me thinking and considering. And the ending was truly great... maybe war ISN'T the human condition, but we could never dispute that without being INSIDE it first. A beautiful book.I am still trying to assimilate the information and make all the connections. It took me a week to read, and it'll take me another week until I'm not thinking about it all day, every day.Highly recommended. King opts for the emotional and the intellectual, leaving behind the suspense and terror of his works past."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"As a former Stephen King fan I have found his more recent books weaker than the novels of his first period. But this one is possibly his best! Born myself in 1944 I grew up in Germany and our problems may have been slightly different from those of of our American contemporaries. But the context was the same. It starts with the music and ends with the card games - on the surface. And knowing the spirit of that time I feel that everything in this book is genuine. A troubled post war generation is shown: in their youth they were educated by stubborn elders and had to flee into books like &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; and others to see themselves and their dark sides mirrored in them. Their dark sides, which also emerged in a war which was not theirs but which ruthlessly destroyed many of them morally, psychically and physically. Their dark sides, which came into the open in a desperate fight for a better world, in which they destroyed themselves and their humanity when they became dehumanized terrorists and criminals. But they could not avoid becoming members of the establishment after all and probably now make the same mistakes of their parent generation all over again. So the ending is not a typical King ending, but it is reflective and perhaps marked by a certain resignation. King describes his era as an insider, as member of our generation, and this makes him so good. In addition, he speaks the language of his generation perfectly because he has listened to them all his life. A compelling study of our Western culture, a literary must, an excellent book!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King continues to grow as a writer with this excellent 60s flashback with five interlocking stories rooted in incidents that occurred one confusing summer in 1960. King has been quietly tackling some very meaty subjects over the past five years (e.g, recovery in &quot;Desperation/The Regulators&quot;) and his writing has begun to approach poetry in some passages (&quot;Bag of Bones,&quot; &quot;Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot;), while still delivering the chills and breakneck narrative flow his readers salivate for amidst the metaphysics. &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; is one of his most ambitious efforts to date, dealing with the effects of the 1960s on the generation that came of age during the Vietnam War, seen through the eyes of five characters linked not only by that one summer but by Vietnam itself. The first story, more a novella really, &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats, is classic creepy Stephen King and is the most viscerally successful. The title story and &quot;Why We're in Vietnam,&quot; while accurately capturing the flavor of the time, are less compelling. &quot;Blind Willie,&quot; detailing one Vietnam vets' manner of coping with the past, is a real page-turner and eyebrow-raiser. It is, however, the brief final story, &quot;Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling,&quot; that demonstrates King's genius and growth. It is so sweet, so poignant, so full of regret and wisdom, that it brought tears to my eyes. I have read all of Stephen King's books, and enjoyed every one. He continues to surprise, and &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; is no exception."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I was wandering through Meijers late one night with a friend when I decided to buy a book. King is about the only auther whose books I actually buy. I don't think I've read another book so quickly in my life. The first two stories were great! The characters were easy to relate to and the story flowed superbly. I found myself rushing through the third and fourth stories to find out what happened at the end. I regret reading them so quickly. King depicts human nature in a way that makes you lie awake wondering at night. This was not his best work, but definatly good enough for him to be proud of just the same. I'm glad I bought it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have this book on tape and got it to pass the time while taking a long trip. The trip was only long enough for half the book and I found myself setting in the car so I could continue to hear this fantastic book. This is one of his best. He brings together characters from other novels and creates a fantastic version of the world. This is a book of short stories that all tie together in an strange way.The first story about the men in yellow coats is the best. You want the story to continue and it does in later stories.Hearts in Atlantis is about the addition or cards at a college. My son and I both were compelled to play hearts again after reading this one.Having grown up in the same era as King I appreciate the changes in the lives of the characters and the world - Vietnam, college, protests, the peace sign - etc. This is his bests. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I Just finished Hearts in Atlantis and was thoroughly pleased. The four novellas were able to stand on their own, and made for a tremendous book when combined. I once heard a reviewer say that of all the American writers that King is the most likely to write the next great American novel. This book gives some credence to that thought. It was a departure for King and one that welcomed by this reader. I highly recommend this book, but make sure you read it over the weekend because you won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Kings work has always been about defining his characters and their relationships in a way that connects the reader to the inevitable battle between the forces of Light and Darkness-in whatever form it might take.In &quot;Atlantis..&quot;, King certainly does capture and revive the underlying anomie of the '60s establishing a mood that remains constant throughout the interconnecting stories. The Dark Tower Cosmology is familiar to Mr. King's fans and works quite well as the grand struggle overlying the more mundane but none-the-less overwhelming problems of the various characters caught in the '60's mileau and its aftermath.The opening story sets the scene and introduces the most sympathetic characters. The partnership of the boy from the 1960's and the Breaker of the Beam recalls the protagonists of Bradbury's &quot; Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;. King's use of the inter-generational connection is every bit as powerful as it was in the Bradbury work.Later chapters may seem somewhat anti-climactic. They are, nevetheless interesting in their own right. and the reader may rest assured that Mr. King will bind them neatly together by the final page."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"What a great read! This is a novel to get into the depths of the complex people of the 1970s. Hearts in Atlantis would have been even better without the horror aspects. If anything it detracted from a story that kept me reading for its shear humanity and closeness to those seventies years when America began to grow up.If Stephen King wrote more like this, I would look to his books, as books to read and reread again and again. The only other book like that was 'Salem's Lot, which also has that same humanity and loss of innocence and bonds of limitless trust."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"From someone who has read most of King's novels, including the recent Dreamcatcher, Green Mile, Insomnia and the Dark Tower series, it is enjoyable to see a great writer bloom into a greater one. Hearts in Atlantis caught me off guard, showing a side of King that I have never seen... the emotional one. I don't want to scare the fans of the earlier, darker King books away , but the moment I began this paperback, I could not stop reading. It's the most interesting and original narraration that I have read in a long, long time.The book follows a bunch of friend's from children to their golden years, each separate story following from the point of view of another character. We get the Vietnam War , the college, the protests (ups and downs) and come out feeling refreshed, with a hit of nostalgia in your vein.If you've seen the movie, it's nothing like the book. In fact it's only a little similar to the first 90 pages.Also for the Dark Tower fans, (a group composing of anyone who has read the series), inside is some really interesting information.Happy Reading. and for further reading check out Scott Smith's \\"A Simple Plan\\"."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Finally I found a book I could get lost in again. Every once in awhile a book just grabs you from beginning to end. Of course the switch between two stories in one book is always hard (I wanted to learn a lot more about Bobby Garfield, actually!) but easy to get over. Also, the red line that seems to run through a lot of King's books, The Dark Tower, is fascinatingly woven in this book. I WANT THE DARK TOWER 5! But if he keeps writing books like this one, the wait won't be that long..."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I'm a non-fiction guy--and Well I hadn't read a fiction for fun, since the last Bush was throwing elbows in Iraq, and I bet that book was Charlie and The Chocolate Factory. But I was entranced by the Anthony Hopkins film, and figured this would be a sure bet.Well, I could get into great details about how the book differs or enriches the experience one has for the movie but I won't.Stephen King has a magic of mesmerizing the times surrounding this tale, and an omnipotence in the lives of all the Characters, from the wonderful Ted Brautigan, Bobby, Carole, to some of the despicable characters. You feel them.I am certainly drawn back to the beauty of being a child through this story, the bonds between children and grandfather figures, the moments of true hapiness, simplicity & love. The timeless attatchments to baseball gloves and vintage schwinns, as well as feeling the struggle to remain young, vibrant and not jaded, while quickly maturing into the world. King is a master in this tale.The movie is most certainly the \\"Coles notes\\" version and allows you to draw your own conclusions about what you saw and what will happen next. The book is far more complete and has it's own beauty to it. At times I thought the book might wreck how I felt about the film, but in the end I like it a whole lot more. It fills in the blanks where your imagination had before.As I mentioned, I won't get into details about these deviations, but if you loved the film, as I did, you'll definately get sucked into the book.My paperback copy will no doubt be read many times over the years, as my point of view alters, not changes, and it will always be a timeless tale and a beautiful story I'll treasure."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I got hooked on the first story, where Bobby and Ted have their super natural adventure, and I was amazed at the writing. Emotions inside me where stirred with the conflict between Liz, Ted, and Bobby, and the first love between Bobby and Carol was uncomparable to any thing I have ever read, however after the first section it shifted. there were no more low-men, no more Ted and I found myself scanning threw the pages to make sense of WTF was going on. Eventually I read it all and understood. But it seems the premise / genre of the book shifted entirely. I cant say I was happy with the book after the first section."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"&quot;Five stories&quot;?? The first &quot;story&quot; was 282 pages. It started well then slipped into some bizarre fantasy. Originally it captured well the youth of a boy in 1960, but then it went over the edge.The second story is an interesting tale of the awakening of a college freshman in 1968. The next two stories (progressively shorter) deal with two veterans from the neighborhood of the boy (who tangentially come in contact with the college freshmen).The four stories all have a girl in common. She is never a main character, but is always around the periphery. The last story is a feeble attempt to bring all five together that again bumps up against the fantasy.The reason this book gets three stars is that the writing is good and I thought two of the stories were good, one fair and two weak. TO be honest, I do not enjoy fantasy/sci fi, maybe those who do would not be so put off by those aspects."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis isn't the best thing King's ever written. It's also not that bad either, and still delivers a fair bit of suspense and social commentary to the reader. It's a compendium of short stories, and the best of the stories is 'Low Men in Yellow Coats'. It focuses on the travails of Bobby, an impressionable young boy, and his exposure to the morally corrupted real world. The rest of the book isn't that great, but fans of King should definitely have a look."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This rating is a comparison with King's earlier works. Compared with others in his bent, I boost the rating to 4 stars. I read several King novels in the late 70's and early 80's (heck, I read &quot;The Stand&quot; twice) but I after &quot;Pet Cemetary&quot; his books seemed to lose some imagination and power, so I stopped reading his work. The cover reviews of &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; were glowing (aren't they all) but what really got me was that this was supposed to be unlike anything he had written before. Wrong -- No -- Not a chance -- same old thing. The first part was very good but, as usual, the crisp style and detail died by the middle of the read and I was left with a feeling of being cheated in the end."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I thought the first story &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; was very good, it did start out slow and left me wondering when it would get moving, it finally did. The rest of the book was boring, so much so that I could not finish it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I read this 512 page book in 44 minutes while I was on the can. It really is wonderful, and so am I. King says &quot;Don't let the bed bugs bite&quot; and I won't. Not as long as the emperor is around with his greekstick. I love the America."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Put me among the loyal lovers of King who have to admit this this effort isn't worth 600+ pages. Like most, I felt Low Men was the best of the bunch, but even that ended with major holes. Does anyone have any idea what was the deal with Bobby's mom? Surely an affair doesn't explain all of her actions. What really happened between her and Bobby's dad? I'm close to King's age and just don't remember the 60's quite the way he does. Maybe life was that different on the East coast? While I thought Hearts in Atlantis did a good job of showing how an era changed (from &quot;what is it&quot; to peace signs everywhere), ultimately I didn't care about these characters and was only mildly interested in what happened to Carol since the teenage version wasn't too well fleshed out. My advice is to borrow this one from the library. Stephen has enough money that he won't be hurt financially, and maybe it'll send him a wake up call that you can't slide just anything past your readers. I find myself wondering if the reviewer who suggested that King does the same thing his writer in Bag of Bones does (revive old discarded stories to publish), isn't right."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I love Stephen King and I can appreciate when he writes a &quot;non-horror&quot; novel -- Hell, I enjoyed EYES OF THE DRAGON -- but HEARTS IN ATLANTIS just didn't do it for me. As per the book jacket, there is no mention that it is made up of several short stories that don't really connect so I kept waiting for the pay-off. Also, I didn't read THE DARK TOWER series (which the Men in Yellow Coats section pertains to) so I didn't &quot;get&quot; the significance of their existence in the book. I don't want to trash this prolific author because of his importance in American literature and because of his humility when talking about his own level of writing. King knows he's not the best and I admire that. And someone who has written as many novels as he has is surely allowed a &quot;stinker&quot; every now and then ... I just think this is one of them. I don't believe (as some do) he's lost his touch, because BAG OF BONES was truly a great read. Here's hoping his next one is better."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis starts out like a true Stephen King novel. Vivid characterizations,intriquing plot and all the supernatural elements that keep us reading till 3am! But what happened to parts 2 - 5. Gone are the horror and suspense to be replaced by two dimensionel charactors and political rhetoric. I felt cheated out of an ending. And though part 1 makes reference(s) to THE DARK TOWER series, I never read those (tried to - but found them plodding and uninteresting!) Did I miss something? Is the real ending somewhere in THOSE books?"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Another &quot;wordy&quot; King book. The first part was ok but nothing else happens that would warrant all these pages/words. The stories are related, but big deal, they go nowhwere. I wonder at how King can come up with excellent stories (Shawshank, Misery, Needful Things, The Stand to name a few) and then come out with wordy go nowwhere stories. I've started to check him out of the library before I invest...not something I use to do with King."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have read several of Stephen King's books and was anxious to read this one. I found the beginning to be pretty interesting. The story about the boy and the men in yellow coats and the interesting new neighbor were pretty good. I just kept waiting for something exciting to happen and it never did. The last half of the book seemed to really drag. I was waiting for Bobby to walk in somewhere. It was almost 4 totally different books combined. It just seemed to drag on forever. I never really got into this book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I liked, this book interesting eventhough I wasn't born in the 60's it's good, I read few of the stories there good and, some humor which I like this is good."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is a must read, even for non-Stephen King fans. Someone has already said it, but I'll say it again... No one scares like King, no one builds characters like King and in this book, if you have a soul and a heart you will be touched."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"O.K. we baby boomers eventually go back to the 60s and Viet Nam - but hey who could tell it better than King. I have read King's evolution from a shock doc. to a great writer, and in this one he finally breaks through and gets over. King, we don't need the shock any more, we lived it, just give us great characters and great writing. Loved it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have been a King fan for many years, and have enjoyed all his books. This one is no exception. I enjoyed the way he tied the Dark Tower into the first story. The other stories, while not having elements of horror like &quot;Low Men&quot; were well written and following the characters through the years was interesting. I hope to see Ted again in the Dark Tower series."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"OK. Maybe second best. The Stand will likely always be first in my heart. Not that anyone will read review number 96 anyway... This is simply an exceptional work. Each story stands on it's own, taken together, the sum is fantastic. Somewhere in the future, this will be required reading in a high school literature class. Much as 'Lord of the Flies' was in mine. You have written the 'Lord of the Flies' of the 60's Mr. King. Bravo."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Bag Of Bones and Rose Madder made me believe in King again. Hearts of Atlantis is the book I am going to recommened to all the people who say King cannot write or lost his touch. Atlantis is about people, about life and love and lost souls. It is about growing up and looking back and making ammends. And yeah, it is also about the sixties."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I remember the day when a new book by Stephen King was a big event in my life. As soon as copies appeared in the shops, I would buy one and settle down to an evening of enjoyable gluttony. Often I would devour a book at a sitting.Somewhere in the last ten years it's all gone wrong, and I must confess that I didn't even manage to finish Rose Madder and Desperation - just flicked to the end to see what had happened.So when I picked up Hearts in Atlantis at an airport bookshop it was with no great expectations - in fact I didn't start to read it until nearly 4 days later. So I suppose in this state of mind at least I was fairly immune to disappointment, and indeed I was not disappointed. The book is ... not bad. The first story &quot;Low men in yellow coats&quot; is probably the poorest - it starts out well and builds up likeable and believable characters then SK has to drag in elements from the dreadful fantasy the Gunslinger. &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; is, in my opinion, the best in the collection and the rest are also ... not bad. Nothing in this book comes anywhere near, for example, &quot;Different Seasons&quot; but it far encompasses the appalling &quot;Nightmares and Dreamscapes&quot;. I would encourage SK fans to buy it but don't expect too much - you may be pleasantly surprised. Horror, it is not. But overall the stories are well written and mildly entertaining."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Low men in yellow coats was great, and the way it intwined itself with the dark tower series, ( my personal fav. of Kings) was great. I hope this means hes getting ready for the next in that series, and I hope we get to hear from ted again. The rest of the stories were good, but none of them as much so as the first, this book gives us a chance4 to look at our darker sides at times, especially with the character Bobby comparing real life to the book Lord Of The Flies."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The Green Mile was such a wonderful read. But then I got away from King. Thankfully, I decided to read his latest novel. I grew up in the time that this novel was written...the 60's. My friends served in Viet Nam. There was enough of the mystical to pique my interest...but then there was sooo much more. I absolutely loved the way King presented information...a little fact before he clarified it. His characters became my friends...and I shed tears for them. I am passing this on to my 82 year old father, and I know he will love it as much as I did. Stephen, you have such a wonderful way of telling a story. Your game of Hearts was my game of Bridge in college. I almost flunked out playing it. Ted is my hero!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"King can scare like noone else scares. He can also touch like noone else touches. In this book, King touches the hearts of those of us who lived through the 60s and its aftermath. The stories intertwined and left me wanting more. Simply put, it's one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"A really great read that made me remember why I like to read King. He is at his best in the first story when the characters are talking about books and reading. &quot;Sometimes you just read for the story...&quot;"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Ok, this book is good, and proves old SK can write more than just horror, but the thing is, I kinda like his horror better. Not to say this book is bad, it's not. It's just that, well, Steve should just stick to his old supernatural roots. And the references to the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series were stupid and unnessecary, that'll throw some readers off."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King is one of the few authors who makes the transition between the supernatural and realism so smoothly. I'm not real sure what I was expecting, but I really enjoyed this book. He continues to grow as a writer. This is in another league for him. Terrific book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I just finished &quot;Heart of Atlantis.&quot; It was not at all what I expected from Stephen King. I expected horror and chills. What I got was the most touching, heart-wrenching book I've read in a long time. If you are a low-level SK fan, you will probably be disappointed. If you read King, as I do, for the sheer beauty of the man's talent, this book will surpass your wildest expectations. Fifty or a hundred years from now, Stephen King will be required reading in high school, the way Edgar Allen Poe is now. This book is one of the reasons why. No, it wasn't what I expected...it was much more."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Absolutely astonishing. I just finished the book and am completely numb with admiration for King's sheer storytelling power. And I mean POWER. This book fairly glows with it. Sure, there are some minor points that I could be fussy about, but to nitpick stories of this quality would be like throwing mud at the Statue Of Liberty. You may dirty it up a little, but by God it's still the Statue of Liberty, isn't it? Forgive me for babbling. Maybe I should go cool off after finishing &quot;Hearts In Atlantis.&quot; I envy those of you who haven't read it yet. You are in for a treat."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I really enjoyed this book! King has created characters that are alive and moving. He shows how unforgiving the past can be but also how much hope the future holds. I'd love to see a story about Ted, there's a whole novel about him just waiting to be written. For King addicts this one is a real fix. For anyone new to King this is a great book to break in on. It's not quite as mind bending as some of his other work. You won't be diasappointed!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts of Atlantis weaves a poignant tale tracing the lives of 60's children to the present day. A rich commentary on the human condition, social values, and especially meaningful to those of us who lived through these years. An epic tale at King's best. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I could read this book all day long. In fact, I did one day. It took me 21 hourse of straight reading to get through it, but I managed to finish. I couldn't eat or sleep until I had finished it, it was that involved. I still can't sleep because of that whole &quot;Langoliers&quot; mini-series. This book was just as haunting. It left me wanting for nothing....except more Stephen King. Gee, I sure hope I don't hit him with my car again. Oh well.."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The book was delivered on Wednesday, and the entire household had to wait for me to finish it. I simply loved it. Thank you, Mr. King."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I just finished and am delighted by the stories in this book. I love how all the stories intertwine. I love his use of songs, every day items and common places. (I live in R.I so he is always in familiar territory with me) It reminds me a little of Peter Straubs &quot;KOKO&quot; maybe just because of the Vitenam inluence , but I think it's more than that. He proves once again that he is the king.

So naturally I had to have the book. :)"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Awesome, trippy and sort of Sci-Fi work. I enjoyed it a lot, and anyone with half an open mind will as well. One will be obsessed with the \\"Low Men\\" for the rest of one's life."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The book Hearts in Atlantis was published a few years ago, and the movie came out last year with Anthony Hopkins. Now it is possible to listen to the entire story on audiobook, read by the soft, deep tones of William Hurt and the sharp but familiar nasal spats of Stephen King; complete and unabridged.The first story is \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats,\\" read by William Hurt, it is essentially what the movie version of Hearts in Atlantis was based on. Though some prior Dark Tower knowledge is recommended, it is not mandatory as the story naturally has a lot more details with further development of the tale.In the title story, read by Stephen King, the reader is taken to a college in the sixties, where the war is gearing up, protests are growing, and this new symbol is becoming omnipresent - the peace sign. The college students have one big problem though: they cannot stop playing hearts, even to the point of dropping out of school. But if that happens, they'll be shipped off to Vietnam.In \\"Blind Willie\\" and \\"Why We're in Vietnam,\\" the reader receives viewpoints from two survivors of the war in Vietnam and how they deal with returning to ordinary life where death is not an everyday occurrence. They each have their own unique and outright insane way of dealing with shell shock.In \\"Heavenly Shakes of Nigh Are Falling,\\" the main character from the first story returns to his old hometown and meets up with his first love. In each of the stories the characters from \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" inevitable show up in some way, creating a vital link between all the stories.This is Stephen King's Vietnam story, but at the time it is much, much more. It takes the reader back to the time of Atlantis, when the great civilization that was American fell beneath the waves.Originally published on October 7th, 2002.Go to BookBanter ([...]) for over five hundred reviews and over forty exclusive author interviews, and more."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I was surprised to see that anyone would give this book a mere one star rating. I loved it and it's one of my all time favorite King books."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is another winner from Stephen King, especially for fans of his Dark Tower series. The book is different in structure from his other works. It isn't a single novel, with one story taking up all the pages. Nor is it a collection of unrelated novellas or short stories. Instead, while it does contain novellas and short stories, they all are related in some way (for example a small role character in one story might be the main character in another story). When viewed all together, the stories cover the 1960s, mainly the atmosphere of the '60s above all else.A non-Dark Tower reader might find some of the story beats to be confusing or incomprehensible (especially in the first story). I really enjoyed all the stories we got, but I know my knowledge and appreciation of the Dark Tower series added to my experience."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"What real cops do.I'm 61 now and as I read through the pages of this book, finding it hard to put down, it brought back so many memories. The innocence of childhood. The carefree life of a child. Finding that simple things can be the most fun and exciting. It also brought back memories of Vietnam, or should I say that era. I was a soldier between 1969 and 1972. I did not serve in Vietnam, but I knew many that did and I know of those who came back messed up physically and mentally. I was drafted and I knew of those that managed to stay out of the draft by going to college or going to the National Guard. I also knew a few that failed in college and went anyway and of at least one person who did not attend Guard meetings as required on was activated.It also made me think of my first love.This is a great read, and I would encourage anyone to read it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"A serious mixed-bag, this book by King has some of the best work the author has shown in years, as well as some of the most mediocre. His writing feels most assured when he's exploring idyllic childhoods and safe, suburban settings. The tone, the characters, the \\"feel\\" of the world is so lush and nostalgic, yet unsentimental. Throw in the David Lynch-ian danger lurking just below the surface of the \\"perfect world\\" and King is fully in his element. Fortunately, the first of the four interconnected stories, \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats,\\" accomplishes all this master work in spades. Unfortunately, the other 3 sections of the book pale by comparison. Overall, it's better than some of his other recent missteps, and LOADS better than the Anthony Hopkins movie that just reeked of awful. So, read the first section, skim the college section (if you must), then save yourself the trouble of finishing it. There's a pretty cool sequence late in the book involving a traffic jam, but the work involved getting to that part just may not be worth the trouble."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Synopsis: This book is a collection of five stories, each linked to the first, and covers the years from 1960 to 1999. The stories are overshadowed by the Vietnam War and its impact on the generation of children from the 60s.This is the first Stephen King book I have read in a long time. I recently made a statement on another persons blog that I thought I had read pretty much everything Stephen King had written. Boy was I wrong! I looked up his bibliography and found I had only read just over half of his books. So I set myself the challenge to read everything he has written, and this was my first choice for getting back on the King bandwagon.This book first made me think about why I stopped reading Stephen King books (he seems to keep telling the same story over and over, young children and their friendships in the 60's, a bicycle, bullies, the loss of innocence) and then promptly reminded me of why I love Stephen King books. I have often wondered if his writing is a cathartic process for him, and he has to keep writing and writing the same thing over and over until he's resolved it for himself, or if he just keeps writing the same story until he feels he's got it right. Well, whatever he's doing this time he really got it right. This book is Stephen King at his best. It's got horror, but it is packed with the kinds of insight into human hearts that make it so moving. Each story is a different representative of the kinds of story vehicles he uses to comment about people and living. It is a great commentary on his generation and the loss of innocence that it doesn't seem to have recovered from, and made me think about the way we live now. I really enjoyed this book, and strongly recommend it. It is in my top five of Stephen King books."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The story in this book is good, but I'd say William Hurt's reading of it makes it great. It is a nostalgic story, and his voice has that slightly dreamy quality that makes you think of an old man on a front porch, rocking and telling you about his childhood. I will admit that his voice takes a little getting used too, but this is true of any of the great readers I've encountered. the ones who put their personality into it and breathe life into the story. Stephen King does a good job, but William Hurt is where it's at here. I've listened to this book at least 5 times since i bought it back when it first came out."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I saw this movie years ago. I didn't realize that it was by Steven King. It's a coming of age story but really well done (the move starred Anthony Hopkins).It's not the usual King, more along the lines of Shawshank Redemption than Carrie or Christine."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is the first Stephen King book I have actually read. I've listened to a few on tape and seen a few movies based on his books, but actually reading his words is a moving experience.I purchased this book mainly because it is divided into five stories and, since I was going to be travelling on business for a few days, I thought it would make great airplane reading. It turned out that I couldn't wait for my meetings to end so I could go back to my room and read!I was born at about the time the second story takes place and was raised in a college town, so I remember the tail end of the Viet Nam War era and the college demonstrations. I was too young to experience the whole era and, consequently, there were parts of the book I didn't understand, but I can recommend it highly nonetheless.It was interesting how he carried the characters through the book and showed us how they were changed throughout their life experiences. The last few pages tie it all together nicely.I plan to read much more of Stephen King after reading this book. He can turn a phrase and provoke a thought like few authors can."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"First off, in fairness to Stephen King, I have enjoyed his previous works.This book is broken into five pieces.&quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot;, is set in 1960. Eleven-year-old Bobby Garfield lives with his widowed, controlling, miserly mother in an apartment. Life is humdrum for Bobby until an older neighbor Ted moves in upstairs. Bobby's mother is highly skeptical and suspicious of Ted, and warns Bobby to keep his distance from this new neighbor. In time, Ted introduces Bobby to ''Lord of the Flies'' Bobby grows to admire Ted, despite Ted's &quot;problem&quot; Ted tells Bobby that he is being pursued by &quot;Low men in yellow coats&quot; He hires Bobby to be his sentry, watching for signs of their presence-- lost-pet notices, stray kite tails, upside-down supermarket flyers, etc.Low Men is the best part of this whole book. But just as the story really starts to develop, WHAM! It turns a corner and goes straight off a cliff.&quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;, or story #2 revolves around a dormitory of several pathetic University of Maine college students whose lives are being consumed by the card game of Hearts. Bobby Garfield doesn't exist in this, the largest segment of the book at all. Several new characters are introduced, and we focus on their addiction to this card game, which is keeping them from studying, sleeping, bringing down their grades, flunking out of school and into the Vietnam War...YAWN...it's unimaginable how much time King wasted on this silly story. It reads like a high school English Lit. essay.King's voice is so overwhelming in this segment, that I honestly thought he had shifted from fiction to autobiography. Like many Baby Boomers, King wallows in nostalgia, and reminisces about his generation. He says:&quot;I like lots of people our age when they're one by one, but I loathe and despise my generation. We had an opportunity to change everything. We actually did. Instead, we settled for designer jeans, two tickets to Mariah Carey at Radio City Music Hall, frequent-flier miles, James Cameron's Titanic, and retirement portfolios. The only generation even close to us in pure, selfish self-indulgence is the so-called Lost Generation of the twenties, and at least most of them had the decency to stay drunk. We couldn't even do that.&quot;In the book's two short stories, Willie Shearman &quot;Blind Willie&quot; takes the train from his comfy house and loving wife in the suburbs, to the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral where he transforms from mild mannered Willie Shearman, into begging Blind Willie. He leads a double life, as passersby don't realize Shearman's sight is intact.The final story features a revisiting character, John Sullivan (Sully) whose haunted, literally, by the war. Plagued with feelings of guilt of a murdered Vietnamese woman, readers discover that Sullivan is frequently visited by her, yet she says nothing, only staring at him.So what's wrong with this book? The separate stories are connected by small threads, a character here, a baseball glove there, but have no real unifying purpose, and lead to nowhere of any significant meaning. I found his characters to be unbelievable. At times it reads very slow, with pointless detail, or story that serves no purpose.I get the feeling that Mr. King is trying to make the transition from Horror story teller, to a Dickens or Faulkner novelists, but instead falls into a chasm. The ending is abrupt, leaving many questions unanswered, and many readers like me disappointed. Maybe King plans to put the missing pieces together in another book?"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Born in 1970, I grew up on Stephen King. From the time I was old enough for my own &quot;orange library card&quot; (see the book!) I have seized and gobbled up every King I could get my hands on. I stayed up all night and scared myself silly, reading about frightening other-worldly entities.Over the last few years, I've seen King move away from the &quot;scary monster&quot; genre into a style that is increasingly philosophical, almost metaphysical; increasingly these stories have a feeling of &quot;This could happen&quot;.&quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; is definitely one of these.From the moment I recognized elements of the Dark Tower creeping in, to the finale that comes around full circle 40 years after the story starts, I was enthralled, lifted to new heights, and plunged back down into the underground tunnels of a runaway mine train. By the time I got to the end, I was breathless. Literally. As I closed the book and slowly put it down, exhaling, I could do nothing else but remain thoughtful. Wanting to pick it up again right away, read it again. That had never happened to me before, with anyone's work.It took me a while to realize I'd been virtually holding my breath over the last few pages. Even when I scared myself as a child in the middle of the night, reading &quot;Carrie&quot; or &quot;Salem's Lot&quot;, that had never happened to me before, either.I think he must be very proud of this book, for in his own style he is emulating L. Ron Hubbard, a writer who influenced his career by virtue of the admiration King holds for his work. I think he is doing a wonderful job."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"A 250+ paged \\"novella\\"? We're in King country, folks. Though not as beautiful or as successful as his collection of novellas titled \\"Different Seasons,\\" Hearts in Atlantis has its moments, and it has King writing some of the best prose of his life. We're talking \\"literary\\" here -- shoo away that bad ol' King who clinked and clunked over his choppy sentences. Really, all kidding aside, there are some gorgeous moments in this novel, moments that King should really be proud of.Let's take this baby in order:\\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" -- the most recognizable King. Kiddie protagonist, bad supernatural dudes, tie-in with other King work (The Dark Tower series). This section was just mediocre until we hit the last twenty pages, the final chapter. Then something amazing happens: Bobby Garfield grows up and there's so much sadness in his growing up, the way he so quickly learns the ways of the world, that it almost breaks your heart. And talking about hearts...(segue music, please)\\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" -- the strongest section. Like \\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,\\" there's not a hint of Kingish horror to be found anywhere. This is a regular story, and nobody can tell a better regular story than Stephen King. The people are real, the main character is as American as apple pie and as everyman as Big Mac. From start to finish, a great story; the last line will almost have you in tears.\\"Blind Willie\\" -- tries to be a bit too artsy and fails. Everything seems a bit too much and a bit too unbelievable, heavy-handed. Didn't buy it. Weak.\\"Why We're in Vietnam\\" -- ibid. Was King trying to do a bit of magical realism himself, a la Tim O'Brien? Doesn't work.\\"Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling\\" -- nice to see Bobby again, but that's about it. Really quite unnecessary. Felt tacked-on, like the way the last chapters of \\"It\\" and \\"The Tommyknockers\\" felt tacked on, to make sure you feel good about everything.So all in all, it's an uneven mixture. Worth your time, though, just for the last part of \\"Low Men\\" and \\"Hearts\\" in its entirety."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King's Hearts in Atlantis starts off really fast and interesting. The first story is about a young child, Bobby Garfield, and I couldn't help but be absorbed into his life. It was extremely easy to relate Bobby's experiences of growing up to my own. The second story is a little slower paced but is still a touching story of college boys during the Vietnam draft. Sad to say the last three novellas were nothing too special but they were still charming in their own sense. This is a great book to read when you are looking for a no-brainer with a good story to bundle up with on a cold winter's night."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Steven just keeps getting better with age. Easy flowing page turner that has slight tie-ins with the Gunslinger series. &quot;Hearts&quot; is truely one of Steven's finest works of literature. This is one of those rare books that keeps you emotionally attached well after you finish reading it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"For those of you who think King can only write outright horror novels, think again. This wonderful collection of novellas shows King's strength as an author of emotional tales. There are elements of fantasy woven throughout, but this one concentrates more on character development. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts is a collection of short stories, only the first has the particular brand of King writing that can have your hair standing on end. The other stories still exhibit King's unique way of painting images with words...they are alive, and vibrant...unsettling in their own rights, warm in others. The stories twine over the turbulent 60's down to the 90's...with the Vietnam era the central post that they wrap around. Not his best for riveting reading, but an enjoyable read for sittting by the beach in the sun...."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"HEARTS IN ATLANTIS by Stephen KingTHE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON by Stephen KingTwo reviews in one? What up with that? Well, I read HEARTS IN ATLANTIS some time ago and, beyond \\"rah rah go read this,\\" I said it exposed my inadequacies as a reviewer. How stupid was that? I'm going to try again.I finished reading MY LIFE by Bill Clinton late one Tuesday afternoon, then immediately picked up THE MAN WHO LOVED TOM GORDON. I figured my old friend Stephen King could clear my exhausted mind. He immediately pulled me in, and I read it in a single sitting. It's gripping stuff. Incredibly realistic, insightful regarding human nature, and it'll scare your pants off. The Master is most definitely at the top of his game with this book. Ditto with ATLANTIS.Authors, how do you feel when you spend months (years?) writing a book only to have some reader say he polished it off in a single evening? Actually, I think you oughta feel good. No writer, not even Isaac Asimov, could/can be sufficiently prolific to be the only one a reader ever needs. I think this is very cool, and I love working with fellow authors to promote this thing we do.Okay, back to my book review. King was always great, right? But there came a point where a certain sameness crept in. It's hard to define, perhaps, but you know what I mean. I don't think he was having as much fun as he used to, and after a time, neither were we.Then came ON WRITING, which I never run out of breath raving about, and now books like these. He's scaling back the supernatural, which never bothered me at all, because he's found even scarier things to write about. The Master has raised his game, and it's a joy to know I've got a big old pile of unread Stephen King novels downstairs. Expect more rave reviews.Oh, and Stephen, if you're reading this, and you ever get the desire to raise your game yet again, just let me know. I'll go rent a truck and hit you with it. (It's a joke. Just like the idea that YOU subscribe to MY rag. I know you'd rather read DAVE'S RAG.)"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"What really sets this book apart from many others is the wonderful use of language and image. The evocative idea of \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\"...by itself is almost silly and certainly not scary, but as it is repeated with added bits of observation, it becomes ominous.King has always excelled at taking the everyday and spinning it just slightly to where it takes on more meaning than it should have. He achieves that agian with this collection."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"In his final novel of the 1990s, Stephen King has shut the door on his normal assortment of nightmares and created a series of stories that deals with another kind of horror. In Hearts in Atlantis, King writes about loss of innocence, struggles of conscience, and the Vietnam war.The first thing readers will notice is that Hearts in Atlantis is not a novel, but five stories. The first two are long novellas (which together constitute 400 pages), while the last story is a mere 13 pages long. But all of the stories are interconnected, spanning the lives of four Connecticut youths from their pre-teens in 1960 to 1999.The first story, &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats,&quot; is traditional King. In fact, the story is something of a companion piece to King's popular Dark Tower series. Here the reader is introduced to three kids, Bobby Garfield, Carol Gerber, and John &quot;Sully-John&quot; Sullivan. Although it doesn't deal directly with the Vietnam war, it helps set the backdrop for the stories that follow.In the summer of 1960, eleven year-old Bobby takes first steps out of childhood innocence. He begins to see the evil of which men are truly capable, a parallel to the book Lord of the Flies, given to him by his new neighbor Ted Brautigan. But the old man has another kind of evil chasing him. The &quot;low men&quot; are tracking Ted and want him to return to their world, a place where &quot;All things serve the Crimson King.&quot;&quot;Hearts in Atlantis,&quot; the second story, changes to a first-person narrative. Pete Riley, a freshman at the University of Maine, and his friends become obsessed with the card game Hearts. Many jeopardize their grades and thus their scholarships as a result, but the real threat is greater than flunking out. In 1966, leaving school means drafted to Vietnam. The story, although told from Pete's point of view, is also about Carol Gerber. She left Connecticut behind her, but has found a new life in protesting the war.The third story, &quot;Blind Willie,&quot; deals with Willie Shearman, a minor character in &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats.&quot; Now a veteran of the Vietnam war, Willie is doing penance for his misdeeds, those from his childhood and the war.Sully-John attends the funeral of an old army buddy in &quot;Why We're in Vietnam,&quot; set in 1999. In reuniting with his lieutenant, they discuss the war and the affects it had on the men who fought there.It is in this story that the most frightening, most vivid account of the war is relayed. If the other stories were preamble, this is the final climax where the whole book comes together. For Sully-John, haunted by the image of a dead Vietnamese woman, everything after the war has been about trying to &quot;get over.&quot; Get over the physical pain, get over the trauma, get over the war.In the short closing story, &quot;Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling,&quot; Bobby returns to the town of his youth to pay his respects to one departed friend and discover the fate of another.I really liked the first story, &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats,&quot; but I am also a big fan of the Dark Tower trilogy. The fact that it tied together with the Dark Tower stories made me tingle. I hope to see more of Ted in the future.The others stories were also good, but not normal Stephen King-type fare. They didn't scare me or give me that creepy gooseflesh sort of feeling, but they made me think. My only complaints would be that &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; (the second story) ran long, and &quot;Blind Willie&quot; has an unsatisfying ending. Is it good writing? Yes. Is it King's best? Probably not. But King tries something different in this book than in his last several books. For that alone he deserves a nod of respect.When Ted discusses Lord of the Flies with Bobby, he states, &quot;[G]ood books don't give up all their secrets at once.&quot; And that's true of Hearts in Atlantis. At first, the stories appear to be a series of glimpses into American life, but there's something else going on here, something deeper.Atlantis becomes a metaphor for America, literally sinking beneath the feet of its people. The dreams and ideals of the 1940s and '50s become lost in the '60s, as the Vietnam war divides the country. Later, the hippies trade in the ideals of the '60s for junk bonds and cocaine. Now, that generation has nothing to show for it. &quot;What have we done since Nam?&quot; one character questions. We've created video games, trash television, and porn on the Internet. All we like to do is watch. &quot;But there was a time... when it was really all in our hands.&quot;And there are moments in these stories when that is literally true. The image of one person physically carrying another is often repeated, showing heroism of the individual under extraordinary circumstances. Bobby Garfield carries Carol up the street when she is injured. Pete and his classmates carry a crippled student out of the icy rain when he falls. Of course, the quintessential moment of heroism comes during the war when Willie carries Sully-John to a waiting chopper in Dong Ha Province.In the midst of a story about the loss of a country, we have moments of hope created by acts of heroism of the individual. As we leave the 20th century, we continue to drift as a nation. But in the individual there may still be hope. Hope to carry on.As Ted Brautigan said, &quot;Consider it. Good books are for consideration after, too.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I've been a constant reader of King's since 'Salem's Lot (Gee... I guess that dates me). I've watched with growing wonder the changes in his style, the themes he tackles, etc. And I must say I'm rather annoyed at those who say he's lost his touch or whine because he doesn't write &quot;real&quot; horror anymore (what IS that, exactly?). Face it, folks -- King is one of our greatest, most important writers. He isn't just a &quot;horror&quot; writer, nor is he now trying to be a &quot;literary&quot; writer. For the most part he simply writes plain ol' fiction -- you know, the good stuff, or as he's often called it, &quot;the truth inside the lie.&quot; He's an original, and there'll never be another with quite his narrative power again. Yes, his style may have changed a bit (but, hey, I thought life was supposed to be about change), but no one else can turn a phrase so it'll stop your heart the way King does, or write a sentance that's just so damned right it'll bring tears to your eyes. Everyone needs to read this beautiful book about love and loss. The so-called &quot;great American novel&quot; might be a pipe-dream, but after you read this book you may not be so sure. If this ends up being King's last novel, then it makes a fine capstone to a brillaint career. If not, then maybe the best is yet to come. Get well, Mr. King. As I said before, no one writes like you..."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This short story cycle is packed with vivid, real characters that seem like you've known them all your life. King embodies different viewpoints masterfully, plausibly capturing the perspectives of innocent children, college revolutionaries, vietnam vets, and baby boomers.The first story, &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats,&quot; kicks off the action but is the weakest of this strong set. It's too tied into the Dark Tower series to seem as real as what follows. That said, it's still scary and moving, it just won't be as accessible to those who haven't read the Dark Tower series.The remainder of the stories concentrate on real people in real situations with only a smattering of the supernatural. That's not to say there's no horror -- Vietnam certainly qualifies -- but this is the closest King's gotten to straight fiction.What surprises literary types (and doesn't surprise those who've actually read King) is how well he pulls it off. He gives us social commentary, believable, complex characters, and engrossing storylines without a single vampire or undead cat.I read this book in two sittings, then closed it and wiped away tears. King is not merely a fine horror writer, he's a fine writer, period."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"With a novel as rich, delightful, and fascinating-in one word unputdownable-as this, no matter how hard you try to write a thorough review about it, it's very likely that you will leave something out.The story begins while the main characters, Bobby Garfield, Carol Gerber and John Sullivan, childhood friends growing up together in a small American town, are eagerly expecting the coming summer vacations, unaware that before the summer is over their lives are going to be changed forever.Spanning four decades, the novel shows us how, though the eyes of a wide group of characters, directly and indirectly related to Bobby, Carol and John (Sully) and through their own eyes, their lives unfold.Stephen King's narrative all through the book is at his best. He incorporates supernatural elements using his mastery of the craft and creates characters so humanly natural that they feel to the reader like old college friends. The experiences of the main characers are so well balanced between the quotidian and the extraordiary, that I almost felt this was a true story about real people. The supporting characters are so interesting that one cannot help wanting to meet them face to face and know more about how their lives unfold. The places are so richly and vividly described, and the time periods so pictorially represented through fashions, ideologies, settings, and even music, that you actually feel the richness and evolution of American culture as you read, even if you didn't live through those times.Of everything this novel has to offer, what I liked the most, without a doubt, is its spectacular, believable, satisfying and sweet ending.This novel is charming, entertaining, surprising and fun, for both fans and non-fans of Stephen King, and for everyone who enjoys the twists and turns of life and the hidden connections between the lives of strangers. A must read.--Reviewed by M. E. Volmar"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Reading books that make you think is much more satisfying than just being entertained. This book has me puzzling out much about what King is saying about the 60's and our national loss of innocence. Is it any coincidence that the three male characters in &quot;Low Men&quot; are named for the Kennedy boys? (John, Bobby, Ted?) This first story seems to be about the decade's literally stealing innocence from that time's youth. &quot;Hearts&quot; may be about, besides a fairly accurate portrayal of the Frosh experience, the Boomer's tendency toward self-destruction,even when all common sense tells us to stop. It also casts a cynical eye towards &quot;causes&quot;, implying that it is nearly impossible to stay true to beliefs based upon the inherent cynicism in us all--for an update of this story, see what happened in Seattle last week during the WTO fiasco. &quot;Blind Willie&quot; appears to be a statement both about the Reagan 80's and PTSD's largely unknown effects on combat veterans. The final 2 stories detail coming to grips with the experience of that decade as well as the potential for redemption for us all. Mr. King seems to be telling us that we should not forget what it was like to be a child. These memories can heal and preserve us. This is definitely Mr. King's most personal book...I apologize for trying to read his mind. Not as good as &quot;Bag of Bones&quot;, my personal favorite of his, but one can never fault a writer for trying to say something and challenge our perceptions of events and the world around us."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I am a twenty-year-old English major who has read every work Stephen King has ever written. While I consider many of his recent books to be large disappointments, I view HEARTS IN ATLANTIS as hugely successful, a brilliant novel and by far his best since MISERY (which remains my favorite of all his works). It is passionately written and conveys bold, momentous messages, everything from the questionable purpose(s) of war to the difficulties of growing up, of becoming an adult while clinging to the sweet memories of childhood and adolescence. It is a rich, beautiful story, expertly crafted and perhaps the most overwhelmingly poignant of all Mr. King's works. It is, in short, a jewel of a book, a monumental achievement, and a piece of literature which I truly believe shall one day be considered as much a classic as Salinger's CATCHER IN THE RYE, Steinbeck's TRAVELS WITH CHARLEY IN SEARCH OF AMERICA, Kerouac's ON THE ROAD, and Kesey's ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST. (At least, it DESERVES to be regarded as such.) And I fervently hope that HEARTS IN ATLANTIS at last convinces all the skeptics out there that King is quite capable of producing more than &quot;horror garbage,&quot; that he is, in fact, one of America's most talented and moving story-tellers, one who can not only transcend his chosen genre but surpass in deftness many of the best writers of those genres into which he only sporadically ventures; such, I believe, is clearly the case with HEARTS IN ATLANTIS. I unreservedly and whole-heartedly recommend this masterful piece of fiction not only to King fans but to all those who love good writing and good stories. HEARTS, I assure you, offers both."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I've been reading a number of reviews for this book and I'm not sure if I could add anything else that would make you (yes, you over there, the one reading this thing, the one not so sure about buying a book from the &quot;horror guy&quot;) pick this beautiful, entertaining and thrilling collection of short and not-so-short stories. The characters work very well in so many levels, but most of all, I'd recommend &quot;Atlantis&quot; out of its faith: its faith on the human spirit, on the power of long lost love and on the miracle of magic, very human magic. It moved so that I'm willing to do something I swore I'd never do: Anni, if you are reading this, I still think about you, I still dream of walking snow-covered streets with your hand in mine and your hair dancing in the wind. It's been almost ten years."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Whenever I recommend this book to somebody and they ask me what it's like, I always reply, 'Remember how you felt when you read 'Catcher in the Rye'?' I have only encountered a few books in my life that filled me with so much intense emotion. (A Prayer for Owen Meany by John Irving is the only other example I can think of right now). King's evocation of childhood friendship and long-ago summers and innocence lost is so rich and deep and real that when I finished this book the only thing I wanted to do was go back to the start and read it all through again. I have read all of Kings books and I think he has succeeded on this level a number of other times...It, The Body, Apt Pupil, etc...but never to this extent. This book is epic in depth and scope and range of characters yet he never loses track of those bittersweet moments that make your spine tingle and push you to the brink of tears. While the first story is undoubtably the best, I don't agree with other reviewers who consider the rest of the book to be 'mediocre'. It's true that older characters can't bring about the same emotions as the eleven year old characters, but they are fascinating nonetheless. This is not only one of my favourite Stephen King books, it's one of my favourite books of all time."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I've read a lot of other King novels and many have been a disappointment because of their endings. After reading the story &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; I can say King has let me live the 60's through his words and I enjoyed every crazy second! I don't think he will write another great piece like this ever again. I've seen a few other reviews that have not been impressed by his work but most of them expected tales of horror. This book is not that at all. The stories are about lost love, lost dreams and lost innocence caused by the experience of the 60's. It will touch your heart and you too will become lost in the pages of this great story."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I can't say that Stephen King gets better with every book, but Hearts in Atlantis makes a definite leap forward. King has always been fairly good at creating characters, but the characters in Hearts in Atlantis are individual, distinct, and humanly complex.Yes, there are elements of the supernatural here, and references to his Gunslinger series might slightly confuse the reader unfamiliar with those books. The supernatural element, though, no matter how well it works--and I think it works very well--yields in importance to characterization and, even more, to a vivid and disturbing sense of an era.King has almost always been a better writer than his general reputation might allow, but The Green Mile stepped out of the genre and this book leaps out. King may well yet be the author most remembered from our time."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Halfway through Hearts in Atlantis, I was thinking this was a four-star book. The first and longest story in Stephen King's collection is an intruiging tale of a young boy in 1960 Maine and his relationship with a mysterious lodger. It has interesting ties to the Dark Tower, but stronger ties to books like From A Buick 8. We meet Bobby Garfield -- a young man on the brink of both adolescence and the 60's -- and we watch him try to work through the unexpected perils of watching for the Low Men in Yellow Coats -- a danger he think is a figment of the imagination before discovering that they are all too real. It held my attention consistently and I was hoping the rest of the book would continue to do so.Alas, it did not. If there's anything worse than Baby Boomer self-indulgence, it's sulf-indulgent stories that lement that generation's self-indulgence. The rest of the boook has tenuous and frankly unmoving ties to the trio of young characters in Low Men, telling about how several people move through the 60's to the 90's. The title story about an out-of-control hearts game, is slow, dull and the climax feels forced. The next two are the usual garbage positing that Vietnam was the first time people realized that war is hell. The last is an unsatisfactory climax that tries to tie everything back together.Contrary to popular belief, King *can* write good fiction that has no supernatural element. I refer you his collection Four Seasons, for example, which contains three excellent non-supernatural stories. But these stories are nowhere near that quality.The frustrating thing is that there *was* a good story here somewhere. Had King stuck with Bobby, Carol and Sully-John, the second half of the collection might have been interesting. But as it is, it was a painful read, something I'm unused to from King.Buy for the first story and then put this on the shelf."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I figured out as I read this book, that Bobby was born about 1949 and I was born in 1946...yes, one of the first of the \\"baby boomers\\". The time period of this book was my time growing up, the innocence of the 50's and yes, the 60's till about 1967. I graduated college in 1968 and learned that the boy I had a crush on in elementary school died in Vietnam a year before. (I have been to the Wall in Washington DC and found his name) Staying in college as in \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" was the thing to do if you were a male at that time!I have read MANY Stephen King books and like many others could not put this one down! As always, his characters draw me in, I care about what happens to them! He weaves these five stories in and around the main characters and I felt very satisfied with the ending...And lastly, King certainly brought back to me all the grusome Vietnam news footage they showed us on the nightly news. I was struck most by a quote near the end of the book by Dieffenbaker, a Vietnam vet, talking about the war. \\"...we never got out.We never got out of the green. Our generation died there.\\" That was my generation, and my only hope is that we remember that horror...and do not repeat it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"When I saw the movie adaptation of &quot;Hearts in Atlantis,&quot; I knew I had to read the book. What I didn't expect when I picked up the book was to have the movie cover only the first 200 pages, and the differences to be so extensive. The movie is wonderful, the book is a masterpiece. Both exist in completely different worlds of storytelling, yet both bear the same name. Never before have a book and film existed so separately while complimenting each other so greatly. But they do, and while &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; is arguably the best film of 2001, it is also arguably one of Stephen King's best books. From the very first page of every story told, I was sucked in and absorbed into this novel so completely that I would lose track of time and spend hours in a chair, practically immobile. Not many books have done that for me; this one did.The first story, the one the film is about, discusses the short time period after Bobby Garfield's 11th birthday, and how his life was tossed upside down with the arrival of a friendly stranger named Ted, who we learn has a very special gift. A gift so special that it has him on the run from the &quot;Low Men&quot;, and also very contagious through the simple act of touch. The story follows Bobby and his friends Carol Gerber and Sully-John through their youth, but the bulk of the story is about Ted and Bobby, who develop a sort of father-son-best friend repore even as Bobby doubts Ted's sanity. The story comes to a climax in a supernatural meeting that is very intense and scary, and then levels into an ending that sets the tone for the second story, which follows Carol Gerber to the University of Maine in 1966. With the main character in the story being Pete Riley, the story explains the novel's title with more clarity as the third floor lounge of Chamberlain Hall becomes a stomping ground for a bunch of automatons who are obsessed with the game of Hearts. It becomes such an obsession to the people in the dorm that scholarships are revoked, people drop out, and the Vietnam protest finds its way into the realm with a simple &quot;sparrow track&quot; on the jacket of a crutch-wielding activist. But what really drew me into this story (the best one in the book) was the interconnections made as the love story between Carol and Pete develops and climaxes (you'll get the irony in that choice of words when you read the book) with her first participation in a Vietnam protest. The second story is so wonderfully thought out and original that I was upset to see it end. It is brilliant, funny, delightful, lovingly written, and it gives even a youngun like myself a true understanding of the nature of the Vietnam struggle in the US. But it's really only the mid-point. The last three stories are shorter, but no less absorbing. There's Blind Willie, which follows the life of a very minor character in the first story through his routine during the Reagan era, and then Sully-John resurfaces right before one of the most original and unsuspected events I've ever been privy to as a reader. And then we are brought full circle with Bobby Garfield as a middle-aged man returning home.I was left completely breathless when I turned the last page of this book. If you just looked back on the collection of films that have been based off his works (aside from &quot;Shawshank&quot; and &quot;Green Mile&quot;), you would never suspect such an accomplishment of literary genius from King. But even as an avid reader of King, I was surprised to feel the feelings that he evoked from my soul. &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; is a true masterpiece of all the genres it encompasses in all the stories. This is King at his very best. Please read this soon."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This collection of five linked stories that try to chart the birth, growth, and death of the sixties hulla-baloo starts off strongly with two great tales. Low Men in Yellow Coats is not only a parallel chapter in the long running Dark Tower series, one that drops hints and clues about the coming battle to right the incorrect turn the world has made, but it is also a cynical turn on King's earlier coming of age tale The Body. The second tale, Hearts in Atlantis, is another coming of age story set in college, and is a beautiful yarn of how King's generation woke up, tried to change the world, and then 'blew it', choosing instead to live the good life while striking a pose. Both tales feature King at his most emotionally powerful but sadly feature weak endings, not surprising considering that each tale is meant to be a part of a larger patchwork narrative. The remaining three tales, while well written, are poorly focused and come nowhere near the emotional wallop of either Low Men or Hearts in Atlantis. As the tales converge and close with a blurry whimper instead of a focused bang, the over all vision of the patchwork is lost. But despite the book's many weaknesses I still feel that the first two remain required reading for King fans."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"O.K. So everybody but everybody reads Stephen King, right? No, not right. There are lots of bookish sorts of people who don't read him -- and who look down their nose at King and his readers. I guess I picked up their gist/prejudice at some point and just never paid any attention to King--until one day I picked up Bag of Bones and discovered a ratehr interesting story--well told with values I understood and admired--so I decided I'll read another--so I went out and bought Hearts In Atlantis.Again I discovered --not a great book-- but a good book--made us of a series of moving tales, tied together by placing characters from the first story in the book in the later stories so there is a continum -- a linking of all the stories -- even though each story can stand separately. All these characters are placed in a universe from the 1950s and then we spot them again in the 60s seeing how the 60s impacted them. It is a nice structure for trying to get a grip on the diversity of what happened during that much talked about and deeply misunderstood generation. In the process King is able to pull to the surface and weave into the stories the things that haunt and hurt and motivate people--their needs (for a mother's love that isn't fully available) their obsessions (an out of control game of cards) their hopes &amp; dreams (a base ball glove).King is even handed with his characters &amp; the reader easily falls into caring about them. He isn't a fantastic wordsmith--he seldom turns a phrase that wows you but he is a able to go directly to where we live, tell a good story, locate our fears &amp; concerns and present people in a fair handed way. All in all--I think King's detractors (those who haven't read his stuff and judge it negatively because it is popular) are snubbing the wrong guy--there is stupid literature in the world--but based on my limited sampling of his work King isn't the one writing it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"With Stephen King books it's just like with smoking - you just can't kick the habit. This is a book of rare literate quality and certainley something King can be proud of. Hearts In Atlantis take us back to the early sixties, takes us back to where hearts are. The first two stories of the book which consists of five inter-connected short-stories, are one of the best words I 've ever read. They are nostalgic, impulsive and sort of alive, like holding a beating heart in your hand, feeling it pumping, struggling and twisting between your fingers. The atmosphere, King creates, makes you feel you really kind of stranded in a period more than forty-five years ago. I'd say, this book is a true landmark in American literature, but I won't say no more, because telling the story would be like cheating on your classmate. Read the book yourself, face an forgotten era's atlantis."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"First of all, this is the first Stephen King book I have ever read. Secondly, I am a 50-year old child of the 60's and am sick and tired of the attempts of Congress and sundry talk show hosts who have been trying to repeal the 60's ever since the ascendance of Bill Clinton to the Presidency. I shudder to think of what may happen in the next four years, but that's for a different time. . .I thank Mr. King for writing this collection of five interlocked stories. As an earlier reviewer remarked, your reaction to these stories will be tempered by your age. That observation is dead on. Having lived through the time period the tales cover, I was profoundly affected by each one. Mr. King beautifully captured a process that each of us who came of age during the 60's and the subsequent end of the Vietnam War went through. Whether you were for the war or against it, you spent a lot of time thinking about it, and for many people, a lot of time acting on it. My own active service was limited to four months Army basic training in 1972. Although I was against the war, my activism was limited. (My college roommate, Jim, described he and I as \\"apathetic left-wingers\\", an interesting oxymoron.) Mr. King captured my role perfectly in the character Nate Hoppenstand, Pete the protagonist's own roommate in the \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" novella in the collection. Like me, Nate had strong passions and ideals, but not enough to push us from the periphery into the forefront of radical organizations and active demonstrations. After all, a body could get hurt, or worse, arrested, and how to you explain that to Mom and Dad back home? I don't know a lot about Mr. King's own life, but I have to believe that much of this book is autobiographical; the characters are too real for it not to be. He captured the spirit and the personalities of the time to a \\"T\\". Anyone who grew up during this period knows someone that fits the description of each person in the stories. (Except, perhaps, for Ted Brautigan, I suppose.) Paul Simon in \\"Bookends\\" sang of the 60's as a time of innocence, and he was right. But it was also a time of turmoil, a time of love, and a time of social and moral upheaval. In other words, it was a time of contradictions. The Doors, Steve and Edye, Jimi Hendrix, Nancy Sinatra, and Sonny and Cher were all on the Billboard Top 40 at the same time - and it was perfectly acceptable to like them all. Gen X'ers, say what you will, but the 60's were the most passionate time to be alive in my lifetime and a great era to be rooted in.As I said, the stories are inter-related, but each is strong in it's own right, and each is moving. The writing is tight, and the time just flies by. After 672 pages, I was not ready for the book to end.I suppose there are some weaknesses - you really never know why Bobby's mother was the way she was, and maybe you had to read the Dark Towers novels to fully understand some of the references. But these are minor points and in no way detract from the overall impact and enjoyment of the stories. This is contemporary writing at its finest.I may read more of Stephen King or I may not. In either case, I'm sure glad I read this one."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"&quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; contains some of the best writing of Stephen King's career. In five stories of varying length, King traces the path from childhood through adolescence to adulthood and (inevitably) death. He mourns and celebrates his own lost generation -- tracing the missed opportunities, the squandered promise, but also finding the redemption still possible at the end of the road. A heartbreakingly beautiful book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The title story, &quot;Hearts in Atlantis,&quot; is as profound and moving as any of the great coming-of age novels (&quot;This Boy's Life&quot; et al). Like a stateside &quot;The Things They Carried&quot; King has gotten to the heart and soul of the Vietnam-era generation, and he does it in his own unique voice, fleshed out with his own New Englandish experiences. This book will knock your socks off. At last King, in my mind, is up there with the Great American Novelists, and has written himself up and out of the genre mode. The first story of the book, &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats,&quot; may delight King fans who relish his weird stuff, but the rest of the book will delight and surprise and profoundly move those readers who relish great writing. As a librarian I will be recommending this to many non-King readers."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is a great horror novel because it is an intense psychological study of characters in overlapping stories. If you didn't know about the Dark Tower series or recognize Flagg's cameo (so now we know how he got all those revolutionary pamphlets in the Stand!) you could read the &quot;supernatural&quot; events as taking place in the characters' minds and being the product of living through one of the most turbulent decades in American history. King does a great job of bringing out the real terror many people went through in the Vietnam War and in dealing with the social upheaval of that era. What's really interesting is that we see how these events effected these people as the war ended and they entered the materialistic 80's and 90's.The characters are realistic in their emotions and are the basis for their extreme actions. We see how Bobby begins to realize how harsh and unstable the adult world(s) is/are as his best friends leave one by one, and Ronnie and Carol bring home how easy it is to get caught up in self-obsession and violence when everything in their lives seem out of control.Overall, a great worthwhile read, especially the &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; which was my favorite. I definitely hope Bobby, Carol and Ted are back in future stories and we find out exactly what it is Breakers do for the Crimson King!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Once again, Mr. King gives the constant reader a spectacular work of literature. Hearts in Atlantis is a collection of 5 interconnected short stories and novellas. The story begins in the early sixties and traces the lives of a group of people and the effects of the Viet Nam war on their lives.The first story long enough to be considered a novel, LOW MEN IN YELLOW COATS centers around Bobby Garfield and his coming of age in the Connecticut suburb of Harwich--Bobby's difficult mother, teenage bullies, the recent death of his father, and his growing affections towards Carol. What helps Bobby through this period is his relationship with a strange man by the name of Ted who just moved into the building Bobby and his mother live in. Ted acts as a father figure to Bobby, giving him a birthday gift of LORD OF THE FLIES to read. Ted also just happens to be a traveler from the world of King's fantasy masterpiece, THE DARK TOWER. While the elements of the DARK TOWER are part of this story, nothing is lost if you haven't read any of the DARK TOWER. The title characters are the baddies that Ted instructs Bobby to keep an eye out for. Of the 5 stories in this book, this is the one that has the most supernatural overtones. It (supernatural) works very well in the context of the story so well with Bobby's character being young and very imaginative and open to believing in things not of this world.The second story, HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is one of the best piece of literature that Mr. King has ever written. Pete is a freshman at the University of Maine and with everybody else in his dorm gets caught up in a very distracting card game by the name of Hearts. King evokes such a sense of realism as he tells the story of adjustment to life at college, (sex, drugs, procrastination) with the foreboding war in Viet Nam. This story is linked to the first by means of Carol who gets involved with Pete in this story. This story also shows the way college kids reacted to the Viet Nam war, and the craziness that it put the American mindset into. One of the more striking characters in the story is Ronnie Malenfant, the best Hearts player, who eventually gets kicked out of school and goes over to Viet Nam-the real horror of this book. The interactions and struggles of the characters are so real and genuine, you feel as if you really know the character as if you were a fly on the wall.The third story, BLIND WILLIE set in 1983, tells the story of Willam (?) who was a bully to Bobby in the first story. Willie suffers from multiple personality disorder, as result of his experience in Viet Nam. We see a day in life of this disjointed character(s). I just didn't like this story.The fourth WHY WE'RE IN VIET NAM shows us more of the Vets, circa 1999. The central figure in this story is another one of Bobby's friends from the first story, John. John attends the funeral of one of the guys from his Viet Nam troop. As the story progresses we see flashbacks of John's heroic efforts in Viet Nam featuring some of the characters from the other stories in the book. This story conveys the sense of disattachment and long lasting effects that the Viet Nam war.The final installment is HEAVENLY SHADES OF NIGHT ARE FAILING. Bobby and Carol make their return to Harwich, Connecticut. Not really planning to bump into each other but hoping that they do, their brief meeting helps them catch up on some lost times before a final farewell.It has pretty much everything you would expect from a King book: Superior children characters, a little bit of supernatural, americana, and an overall excellent story. Looking forward to seeing Anthony Hopkins play Ted Brauting in the film."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"It is said that you can't go home again, but reading this book takes you darn close. Though a thin supernatural thread runs through the stories comprising the book, the central theme is rites of passage and coming of age amid the social upheaval of the 60's in the shadow of the specter of the Viet Nam war. The characters are as flesh and bone as any ever created by King. Their stories cover nearly 700 pages and I still wasn't ready for it to end. This is a must-read for those of us who grew up in America in the 60's and have brought with us into the 21st century a social conscience and fond memories of great music, bell bottoms, and &quot;sparrow tracks.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis really surprised me. I had expected his traditional horror novel, but instead I read a book where the horror was more subtle and aimed at the heart. I honestly could not put this book down, and believe that even people who don't like Stephen King's earlier works will love this novel. I find it thrilling that he has brought in parts of his other great works into this one. In subtle ways, and not so subtle ways. It seems to me that he is building towards something, that all his works are coalescing into one statement, and I can't wait to read more."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"As a Vietnam veteran who grew up in the exact timeframe of these stories I was greatly entertained by the five stories. I'm a long time King fan, and have read 95% of his work. The Dark Tower series are some of the books I've missed, and I guess the first story uses some of the plot lines of these books. I was very moved by the second story- it focused on the college scene during the war. Since I was in Danang at the time, my perspective was very different. King really hits home the essential trajedy of Vietnam. Wonderful kids were dying for some strange reasons. WE had leaders in Washington who would not let us win the war. As a combattent in the war, I resented some of the things said about us. When I returned I was shunned. I never expected to be congratulated, but as a 20 year old serving my country honorably, I guess I expected more. A great read, and a very good history of a war where good and bad were seperated by a very thin line."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis is a continuation of the genius that is Stephen King. The expanding plot line reminiscent of &quot;The Stand&quot; works wonderfully in this new novel. The storytelling has never been better. Unlike some novels of this length there is no &quot;padding&quot;. Every word is intricately woven into the story. I would personally love to see the storyboards and database constructs he uses when creating his masterpieces. Now on to &quot;The Plant&quot;!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The world needs another review of Stephen King's HEARTS IN ATLANTIS about as much as it needs another ozone hole, hokey sitcom, tire recall, or presidential candidate. After all, many fans and critics have already made up their mind about King's work: either he is a schlockmeister unworthy of comparisons to Edgar Allan Poe, or he is a twentieth century Charles Dickens. The opinions are set, and what I say will make little difference to anybody else.This time, however, there is definite need to sing King's praises. It's not just because HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is good, although good it certainly is. And it's not just because King has managed, with this book, to rid himself of the title &quot;literary boogeyman,&quot; although there are enough supernatural thrills and moments of nightmare surrealism to keep many fans sated. No, this time out King has outdone himself to produce his most heartfelt, and heartbreaking, work. A lazy reader might say that this is his best book since FOUR PAST MIDNIGHT or DIFFERENT SEASONS; he or she might even go as far back as SALEM'S LOT or THE SHINING in their assessment. I'll go them all one better: HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is Stephen King's best book. Period.The book consists of four connected novellas (and one short story, a coda, really) dealing with coming of age in America during the 1960s, the Vietnam War and its aftermath on the American psyche. Each work stands alone, but they resonate when viewed as parts of a whole.Horror fans will be most taken with &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats,&quot; the opening novella and the most overtly supernatural of the bunch. The year is 1960, and Ted Brautigan, a strange older gentleman, has taken up residence in the apartment above that of twelve-year-old Bobby Garfield and his mother. Bobby and Ted strike up a friendship, and Ted offers him a job: keep on the lookout for unsavory sorts (&quot;low men&quot;) who might be looking for him. The story is a companion piece to King's &quot;Dark Tower&quot;, but one may enjoy the story without familiarity with the series. King's characters are fully realized, making the themes of loss, the cost of friendship and growing up all the more poignant.The characters in the title novella are also fully realized. Pete Riley is a freshman at the University of Maine in 1966, and he and his dorm mates have become obsessed with playing hearts. Vietnam has not yet exploded into the public consciousness, but it is on everybody's mind. He also falls for Carol Gerber, a fellow student (also Bobby Garfield's first love) and rising student activist. As he and Carol become more serious, the war begins to escalate, and Pete loses himself in the game. The game is symbolic of a generation's preoccupation with trivial pursuits in the face of reality. The themes of loss and growing up are present again, and again are complimented by the characters.Following &quot;Hearts&quot; is &quot;Blind Willie,&quot; the best story in the book. A seemingly normal man rides the train to his office and, after a series of transformations, becomes the title character, a homeless Vietnam vet who has lost his vision. The subject is redemption. Willie Shearman was a bully during his adolescence and committed acts of unspeakable violence in Vietnam; King suggests that he will also commit murder. He uses Blind Willie to pay penance for his wrongdoing. Here is one of King's most fascinating characters, so rich in detail that he threatens to leap from the page.And then there is &quot;Why We're In Vietnam,&quot; the novel's climax (if you decide to read the book as a novel). Here we meet an adult Sully-John, trapped on a freeway clogged with cars, who has visions of a Vietnamese woman murdered by his platoon. He contemplates his past in general and the war in particular, and meditates on how much he and his world have changed. In a flashback he reflects on the funeral and his conversation with his former lieutenant, whose words regarding his generation are less than kind. The lieutenant's speech, I'm sure, echoes King's sentiments about his own generation, but it never feels preachy. As if to hammer the point home, King engages in a moment of incredible surrealism when the detritus of his generation falls on the traffic jam: cellular phones, baby grand pianos, desks, chairs, catcher's mitts shower the freeway, smashing cars and crushing skulls. The symbolism may be obvious, but it is effective.In the coda, &quot;Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling,&quot; we meet Bobby Garfield again, meditating on his own childhood as he attends the funeral of a friend. King ties up loose ends here, reuniting some characters, grieving for others. It is a satisfying closure.After fifty books and a career spanning more than twenty-five years, most writers would be lucky just to match their earlier high points. To actually grow and improve, as King has done over the past couple of years, is an amazing feat. It makes one wonder what King might do in the years to come."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"King has always had a fascination with children and adolescents, and they show up in this book as well. Recently he's been interested in older characters and the process of dying, and we get a little bit of that here too. What adds impact to _Hearts in Atlantis_ is the way that certain events in the characters' childhoods reach out and shape the courses of their lives. Growing up in the 50s, living through the 60s and 70s, by the 90s some of them are dead, some are insane, and others appear to have finally conquered their demons.Reading it I couldn't help thinking about the events from my youth that have shaped my life. In that sense, this book is a &quot;true&quot; story, or at least one that gets at the truth inside people."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"King is a very talented writer who knows how to tug the heartstrings as well as how to raise the hairs on the back of your neck. This time around, there's not much scaring going on, but rather an engaging tale of lives lived through some very crazy times in America.I found the book to have a completely different format than what I've become accustomed to with King. There are dissimiliar time periods, points of view, and characters throughout the book. However, there are connections that hold the entire thing together and keep you wondering up until the very end.I've read many of King's novels through the years, and this definitely ranks in the top ten (maybe top five) for me. With over 50 books to the author's credit, he shows no signs of slowing down or getting boring. You should definitely give this one a try."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"To those of you who find the sixties scarier than vampires might want to check this out...but that just doesnt describe the amazing ride and emotional splendour of Hearts in Atlantis. Where King has always been a storyteller of great magnitude, here he becomes a sociologist and observer in a decade he knows very well. Not quite a novel, but a series of interelated stories, this book wears it's heart on it's sleeve. The work inside this book is clever...but also wise and introspective, the work of an author at the top of his game in a realm he has obviously thought about. With elements of paranoia, fear, humor and intensity as well as a very welcome dose of humanity,character and dignity, Hearts In Atlantis won't dissapoint fans, and will leave new readers thinking about it for days."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"A wonderful book, showing the maturity of the the author Stephen King. Known mostly as a horror writer, this book, I think, once and for all proves that Stephen King can write about any subject and make it interesting and enthralling. He talks about &quot;Getting Over&quot; not &quot;Getting over it.&quot; He took me to a place I have never been, and most possibly, a place I will never forget. This made Vietnam a real place for me, and the war's meaning a little clearer. May we all &quot;Get Over.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I listened to this collection of Novelettes by Stephen King in the audio format. William Hurt is not one of my favorite readers but his droning voice suited the stories he narrated. King's voice is more pleasant than Hurt's to listen to (a TOTALLY scary thought) but...My biggest complaint about most recent King offerings is &quot;Where's the Horror?&quot; While I am a product of the &quot;Vietnam&quot; generation (and the war was a Horror in and of itself), I don't find it (the war) to be the cause of my own personal problems. It is simply a fact of my life. The &quot;Magic&quot; element within the story makes it slightly more interesting than it would have been without it, but that slight bit of magic doesn't really &quot;save&quot; the story. All-in-All, I was satisfied with the story, just disappointed that it was written by Stephen King and not some lesser author."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was a little too sprawling, but the stories were quite engrossing and there were many nifty threads that connected them all together. You have to work a bit to get there. but when you do, it is worth it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Very disappointing. This is really a book of 3 stories VERY loosely linked togather by one or two overlapping characters. The first part of the book is very good and typical King (though the movie did not do it justice!) Unfortunately, the second part is about an entirely new character with a secondary character from the first part as a secondary character in the second part. The third part was about mostly about another secondary character from the first part of the book and some almost unrelated new characters.Confusing? It is as if King had 3 short stories in mind but wanted to write a lengthy book. I felt somewhat deceived. He does, rather weakly, try to tie the parts togather at the very end.Net, net. Borrow the book and read the first part and the last several pages! Sorry to be so hard on a writer I usually love.. but not this time!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I enjoy reading Stephen King and was very pleased to receive this book as a gift for my birthday. Right away I bonded with the main character Bobby and then Ted, the old man who befriends him. What a delightful story full of imagination with a little bit of real life thrown in this was. I was very disappointed to get 322 pages into Bobby's &quot;adventurous&quot; life only to be taken away to a college where all the guy (who was not related to Bobby but knew Carol) did was play cards for 300 pages! I never read the back of the book first so I had no idea this was three stories in one. The third short story took us back to a grown up Bobby but it just wasn't enough to draw me back into the book and I can't get over how poorly it ended. Buy it for the first story if you enjoy Kings books and skip the second chapter unless you're still in college and can possibly relate to whatever is happening for those 300 pages."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book is a really great Stephen King book. He writes non-horror books as well as he writes horror and fantasy. I have read just as many non-horror king books as I have read horror books, but I am a new King fan. In order I have read The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, The Green Mile, The Shining, Hearts In Atlantis, The Gunslinger, and now I am on The Talisman. Hearts In Atlantis was good because all of the stories mentioned the characters from the first story and showed how they experienced the 60's. My favorite stories are Low Men In Yellow Coats and Hearts In Atlantis. Low Men In Yellow Coats is so good that a lesser author could get by with just that. I gave it only 4 stars because in some places it can get a little slow and some stories aren't all that great. My third favorite story was Blind Willie but I didn't get why Blind Willie did what he did. It was still pretty good though. I can only hope the movie is half as good as the book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts in Atlantis was an excellent book. I throughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a great story. I liked how all the parts flowed together. Though I found the middle section to drag a little, I am obsessed with the Bobby/Ted/Carol plotline. I haven't read the Dark Tower series yet and now I can't wait to start. This was a really emotional book that leaves you feeling satisfied, but yet craving more. I know that's contradictory, but many things in life are. This a must read."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Several years ago (my early teens) I was obsessed with Stephen King and for some reason vowed I would read every single one of his novels. Well, I grew out of that stage before I could get to every single one, but needless to say I have read more than a few, so I feel confidently saying that this is definitely one of his best. It is composed of four different stories with similar themes and characters who are generally seperated by a few degrees (of seperation) and weaves them together really affectively. If you've read King before and are not sure that you like him I would definitely recommend this book. I find that I generally like King's writing when it is more reality based (I think that the words I am looking for), as in when it focus more on realistic characters and events instead of fantastic monsters. Plus I think that this book is more chilling because the monsters are more hidden in the background. King is also great at telling coming of age stories because he can capture the magic of childhood as well as the fear of becoming an adult. And I think that this book is ultimately a coming of age story although it deals with the coming of age of a whole nation through the Vietnam War."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"In Hearts in Atlantis, Stephen King gives us his usual - brilliant storytelling. The first two stories in particular are excellent. I found myself losing interest toward the end, although my attention was held by trying to find out what happened to Carol Gerber, the only character who is relevant to every story. As a college student who spent several months playing cards instead of doing schoolwork, the second story has me hooked. I really relate to the protagonist of that story, Pete Riley, as he struggles with girls and college life. I've read it half a dozen times already, and still can't get enough of it. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of great storytelling, and, lets be honest, if you're reading this review you probably are."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"...in which King weaves a unique tale that is four tales in itself. He takes the general themes that made up the sixties and spins a tale around each of them, questioning Viet-Nam while making fun of the senseless patriotism of the era. Besides, the first story of the book; &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; is the latest add-on The Dark Tower chronicle, writen in a much different style that deliciously resembles &quot;It&quot;, albeit in a milder way. Maybe Blind Willie should have been left out, but that makes up for a gap in the overall story. Read...you'll not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"this book was great. i loved it. i wasn't the regular Stephen King book though. it was king of a love story with some other things also. i would recomend this book to anyone who has just started reading Stephen King books. if you are just looking for a horror story, try &quot;IT&quot; (although &quot;IT&quot; is unbelievably long) or &quot;The Shining&quot;."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Avid King fan, I was devasted when he got hit by the car, thinking if he died or couldnt write anymore, I would never know what happened to Roland.

Even though I have not liked some of his books in the past... Even though this book is long... This book deserves 5 stars.

Excellent!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Before staring &quot;Hearts,&quot; my previous two King reads were &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; and &quot;The Green Mile.&quot; Both are about as different as you can get, and &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; proved to be different still. While I enjoyed the first segment, &quot;The Men in Yellow Jackets,&quot; I thought it dragged. But, in retrospect, I appreciated it more in relation to the other segments that followed. But my favorite, without a doubt, was the title segment. King vividly describes college life in the '60s, making me wish the the entire novel centered around the two central characters, Carol Gerber and Pete. King's description of the interplay between Carol and Pete is so telling, as Pete talks about &quot;that smile,&quot; .. that &quot;look&quot; she had. It made me think of a woman in my own life as a teenager -- blonde, blue-eyed, and with a smile that was just so. Carol truly came to life for me in that segment, and I only wish King could have been more clear in the end when Carol -- or her vision -- reappears. I wanted Carol and Pete to be together in the end, but see what King was trying to do in describing the confusion of being an 18 year old .. and the added dynamic of being that age at the height of the Vietnam War. In the end, Carol and Pete were going down differnt tracks (as she tells Pete), but later in life, there is profound sadness in her remembering and losing him from her life, and her own reflection of what was and what might have been.The central segment of the book could easily be adapted into a movie. Call me a hopless romantic, but I want more Carol!LOVE + PEACE = INFORMATION"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book is a departure from King's more mainstream work, choosing to focus on drenching the author and the reader in an atmosphere, an unsettling ambiance where all is not quite as it should be.The book encompasses four decades, although is largely two earthquakes with three minor aftershocks. Low Men In Yellow Coats, the first and longest of the entries, discovers the approaching darkness that, while personified in the form of the low men in mustard yellow coats, is more wide-reaching, encompassing the civil unrest of the years immediately prior to Vietnam, even in the quiet town of Harwich. King once again shows us his remarkable insight (memory?) of childhood, deftly balancing the needs and wants of your average 11 year old with the bigger picture being forced on them too early during the decade where innocence was lost.Hearts in Atlantis, set in 1966, shows the gradual political and social education of college grads who most visually reflected the conflict of the times, from their days and nights of intoxicating Hearts games to their realizations that maybe rebellion only becomes valid when one knows what one is rebelling against.The other three stories are served up more as codas to the first two books, offering conclusions for minor and major characters from the first two. They are effective, but not essential. Tying up loose ends more than standing in their own right. Still, it put to rest some of the tantalizing little asides that King is so effective at dangling in front of his readers, earlier in the book.Richly textured, this is an excellent, thought provoking take on an era where it wasn't so much about what you thought but whether you stood up and said anything about it, written, no pun intended, from the heart."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This collection of stories is one King's best works. The first story &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; is prime King, featuring a story that plays into the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; mythology. This story was probably the most exciting and action-packed. I liked it alot. The second story &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; was my favorite though. There's nothing supernatural or unusual in this story. It's basically about college kids obsessed with the card game, Hearts. There's a bit more to it then that though. I thought this story was just incredibly well written and interesting. The third story I found to be enjoyable but somewhat odd and maybe a bit too short. The last 2 stories are mostly just there to bring everything to a closing. The middle 2 stories serve as a bridge between the first story and the last 2. The last 2 bring us back to the characters we started out with but all grown up. It's kinda sad. This is a summertime book, I think. It feels that way. It's about youth gone by and vietnam and nostalgia. I loved it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I will just have too say how blown away I am by this book. First, the concept of the whole thing was intiguing and I just coundn't wait to get into it and see just exactly how these four novellas would read like a novel. As I got into the story I was just mesmerize by the writing. Stephen King just gets better and better. I loved the way that &quot;Low Men In Yellow Coats&quot; tied into the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series. The exact way it ties in might be a little confusing though if you have not read any &quot;Dark Tower&quot; book. The novllas (I'm sorry to say) do not get better as the book goes on. Like some other reviewers have said, I have to say it does go &quot;down hill&quot;. But it is a huge hill that its going down and it doesn't even make it a tenth of the way down. Very compelling and realistic characters throughout the whole thing. I can still picture the disgustingness of the pimple-faced Ronnie Melanfant. This is really a great read. I totally recommend it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"What can be said? King brings elements of his other stories and worlds into this book. His writing is amazing: you can read for hours and not notice the time go by. :)"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is an interesting book. It features King taking a stab at historical fiction and pulling it off reasonably well. The best story of the lot, Low Men in Yellow Coats, tells of the learning experiences of childhood and the realization that fear lies not just in the hearts of children but also in those that children look up to. It also involves childhood notions of Justice, and incorporates these notions in the following stories. Really interesting story. Overall, the writing is good, although he uses a floating metaphor throughout the text, (hearts and Atlantis) that becomes a bit muddled at times. Good read overall though. If you're looking for classic King, consider the Stand, or It. But if you've got a weekend to kill, this should do nicely."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Dont give up on this book. In the end you will be wishing it would continue."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Masterfully thought out & written. Not your usual supernatural, horror King story. Written in 4-5 completely different chapters there is some supernatural, but it begins as a story of some friends in childhood, follows them through the years & culminates with them as adults. Each chapter is completely different yet ties some characters in. At the end they are all tied together in some ways years later. It's ingenious in it's finale and I advise you set aside some time for reading. It's very difficult to put down. Once it grabs your interest, it just sucks you into the story. If you remember your childhood friends (we all do) you'll identify with the story"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I loved the book and bought the CD to listen to while on long drives. It's one of King's best restrained writings, with no stomch turning descriptions of blood and gore and very little off the wall, meaningless intrusion of aliens which characterize some of his other novels (Dreamcatcher, Regulators etc.) The only thing off-putting was the extremely poor diction of William Hurt. He routinely pronounced t's and d's as \\"tha,\\" which may come across as laid back in a movie role, but in a reading sounds just plain sloppy. I would have given it five stars except for Hurt. I sincerely hope he is not used in readings again, at least until he receives some speech therapy."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I don't read much King, or the horror genre. But I got this as an audio book and decided to try it out. The narrators were quite good and didn't distract you from the story while at the same time, letting you picture the story in your head.The first story, I fell in love with. It had all the right elements; coming of age, a troubled young boy, a mysterious mentor and a brush with the fantastic. Whenever I see the Infiniti FX, I think of the Low Men. That story alone was all I needed to enjoy this book. Or so I thought.The other stories were harder for me to get into. I didn't know what connection they should have, except for sharing a couple common characters. I am also not of the same generation, and couldn't relate as well to the times. I almost put the book away, but was curious to see if Ted would come into the story again. It wasn't until the end, Heavenly Shades of Night, that I saw the connection through the whole book. I also noticed that each story seemed as if it was set out on a spindle, to come full circle in the end.The connection in all the stories wasn't Ted or Bobby. It was Carol. She is the symbol of the hope of the generation; the innocence of childhood, the hurting youth at war and in the end, the symbol of life for the generation who went through the Vietnam War. They fought like a lion on either side. It is almost bittersweet in the raw telling, the words in the first and last story have a cadence of their own. The end story is poignant as you mourn the loss of childhood innocence.The audio version had the song, \\"Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling\\" on the end. The song stuck with me several days after I had listened. The story itself is one that sticks in my mind and pops up now and then, to think about. King is a masterful storyteller and I hope he has more of these types of stories in years to come."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I think that this was a really good book. In about the first half of the book, it is the story of Bobby and the strange new neighbor that moves into the apartment on the 3rd floor. Bobby becomes friends with this man, whos name is Ted, and starts to notice some somewhat strange things about him, and starts to get a little scared and confused when Ted tells him to keep an eye out and alert him right away so that he can leave if he sees the \\"low men\\" in yellow coats. The rest of this book is the personal stories of all the important people in Bobby's life. Each new section in the book tells what happend to Bobby's friends and some of the not so friendly people in his life, and eventuelly tells what happend to Bobby himself when he grew up.I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Less horror and more drama, I would say this book is, although there are still a couple \\"weird\\" parts. The first half could be a book by itself--that's what the movie is based on, anyway. An engaging read, as is Stephen King's custom."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I always wanted to read a book full of vivid descriptions, lively characters. A book that talks rather than author telling some boring plot.This is my first book by stephen king. Although, I am not going to read other books by him just because this is good, this one is good and more than worth of every minute spent on it.The book aims to introspect the inner struggle of guilty conscience poeple struggle all life. Mostly by looking at heroes made by thier own self-convictions. Book is a compilation of six stories, five of them completely independent of each other, referring to other stories at some places to other stories in an unimportant manner. The last story is just a wrap-up.They go in this sequence,1. The story of the Self made hero who is centerpoint.2. The story of completely un-related guy that starts exploring self-deprivation. The compulsive nature of addictions, marvelously told.This also lays builds alot for following stories3. Wrap-up of this unrelated story4. Introspection of a guy who could not be bad or good. Who is aimless, senseless. It reminded me of the guy in Fountainhead, who tries to compete howard roark and whose life goes totally miserble5. Introspection of a crazy guy. This is the cheerful lot u find very often in your life. This guys life goes upside down artly because of his own crazyness and partly due to vietnam6. Wrap up of hero showing up telling us he is just another ordinary guy.Overall it was a good read. Even though stephen king did a good job on self introspecting, it somehow lacked the conviction it had in the first two stories. But, it still is worth a read, a collection item if you ignore the later short stories"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I give this book a four star but if I could break it down, I'd give the characters a 5 and the story a 3. I pretty much missed the 60s (born in '66) and I never really understood how the 60s generation got off bragging about all they did when I see that many of them are Republican voting, church going, BMW driving hypocrits (OK, I'll get off my soap box now). But this book gave me an idea of what could have happened to some of that generation and I understand a little bit now (but I must say, I still don't get it completely).While I am a lover of good vs evil stories (this book NOT being one of those) the thing I loved about the characters in \\"Hearts\\" is that many of the main characters are seen doing both good AND bad things. So many fictional characters are either one or the other, but think about it, how many people do you know that you COMPLETELY like or COMPLETELY hate? I can't think of any. These characters are among the most real I've come across in fiction.For you Dark Tower fans, it's our first meeting with Ted Brautigan..."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I've listened to this audio book twice and I'll listen to it again. King's story telling mastery shines in this one tieing the world of the \\"low men in yellow dusters\\" (agents of the Dark Tower's Crimson King) who search for and finally catch Ted (an escaped breaker - psychics who are captured by the Crimson King and forced to aid this monster in trying to destroy the tower - the object of Roland's quest in the Dark Tower series); with the world of Bobby, a young boy just entering his teen years who lives in the same rental building where Ted takes up residency while trying to hide from the low men. Bobby strikes up a friendship with the much older and mysterious Ted who hires Bobby to read the daily newspaper to him and to watch the neighborhood for signs that the low men may be close by. When Bobby starts seeing the signs he is supposed to watch for, he doesn't tell Ted because he knows that Ted will flee the low men if they are near.Bobby's two closest young friends are Carol and Sully John who also are drawn into Ted's wierd and mysterious circle of influence. Before he is captured by the low men Ted uses his abilities to help heal the injured Carol when Bobby carries her home after she is beaten by the neighborhood bully boys with a baseball bat.In the later short stories tied into this book so smoothly by the King, Bobby and Carol are reunited during their college years after being separated following Ted's capture when Bobby's mother abruptly leaves the neighborhood for a new town and a new job after she was horribly attacked and sexually assulted by her boss and 2 of his croonies at a real estate convention where the ambitious and not so gullible mother has manuvered herself leaving Bobby in Ted's care while she is gone.Bobby's life in the college dorms is a nostalgic trip for those of us who entered college during the Viet Nam era, and his passing reunification with Carol has a striking resemblance to the ships-passing-in-the-night relationship between Forest Gump and the love of his life. The beginning and ending of this book involves Bobby's return to the old neighborhood to attend Carol's funeral.For those who are Dark Tower junkies like me, the timing of this book fills in some vital facts about what is wrong with the Tower which King has not yet revealed in the Tower series books. You can also pick up more insights regarding the cause of the problems with the tower in Insomnia, and Black House.In all this is another great story by the master story-teller of our time with magically vivid characters and richly described worlds for them to live in. NOBODY but King could take 5 short stories and tie them together so smoothly while revealing as yet untold details for an entirely different series of Books which he has been creating over the last 30+ years. Amazing."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"People that typecast Stephen King as a horror author obviously have not read 'Hearts in Atlantis'. As the writings of Stephen King progress over time we learn that there is much more to the genius than just haunted hotels, and demonic automobiles. 'Hearts in Atlantis' is a fantastic read for those looking for just a story, but furthermore it is another &quot;link&quot; in Stephen King's 'Dark Tower' series.Those who came of age in the sixties, lived in the turbulent seventies, and faced reality in the eighties will definately enjoy this book. Everyone else who reads this will transcend time and become apart of atmosphere represented in this magnificent story.A definate must read for all fans of fiction."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This was a very strange book to read, because of the shifts in the stories, which kept a previous character from one of the previous novellas and further enhanced our understanding of him/her and the troubles that have besaken him/her later on in their lives. The first story in this collection, essentially a novel(it weighs in at 323 pages),Low Men in Yellow Coats, is one of the most touching and brilliant stories ever made. That is why I am giving this book 4 stars, because really only the 1st and the last story you should read,which I think Mr.King should put into an independent book, as I would assuredly give it however many stars are allowed.Low Men revolves around Bobby and his tenant, Ted Brautigan, and weaves a story of coming of age and learning to love even under the harshest of circumstances.This novel also surprised me with a connection to another one of King's writings, but I want say because it was a genuine surprise to me. After this story it goes downhill, and there is really no point to reading the middle stories unless you want to learn what happens to the characters or just have to read the whole thing( like me), but it is imperative that you read the last story, because it is a very good follow up to the first story. Also after finishing this book, see the also very good movie, with one of the most obvious roles for Ted Brautigan, Anthony Hopkins.ENJOY!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I went to college in 1967, one year after Stephen King. Nothing in my 30 years of reading since has better captured the experience of being alive and angry in that era. Whether you fought &quot;in the green&quot; or fought in the streets, this book will remind you why, as one of King's psychically damaged veterans puts it, this country &quot;never got out&quot; and why &quot;our generation died there.&quot; This was my first King book. (I generally read non-fiction). Thank you Stephen King."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I have to admit to being a HUGE King fan, so I may be biased, but...I loved this book! (I can be objective- I was really disappointed in Bag of Bones, and I LOATHED The Tommyknockers.) King uses the 5 interconnected stories to weave a tapestry of life in the Vietnam era, not by putting the reader IN Vietnam, but by showing us the mood on the homefront. The lead story, Low Men In Yellow Coats, is by far the best; Dark Tower fans will especially appreciative of it. I was impressed by the title story as well. While I miss the &quot;Go for the guts&quot; King of old, to judge by &quot;Hearts In Atlantis&quot; and &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot;, the kinder, gentler King is pretty damned good too. And P.S.- I you love Randall Flagg as much as I do, try to pick out his cameo appearance in this book. OK, Steve.....when are you gonna finish The Dark Tower...?"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"As a slow reader (my excuse is looking for the imagery), I finished this book in 4 days (nearly a record for me). I especially liked the characterization of Bobby's mom in Low Men. We've all met those people who are just never happy and are maybe just an innocent comment away from being mean.Hearts in Atlantis seems very real for me only we had contract bridge disease and dope at Northwestern in 64-65, but I remember the signs posted in the bathroom near the end of the quarter reading: &quot;Study Now Or Vietnam&quot; or maybe it was a rhyme. It's been a long time and thank God, when I was drafted, they didn't take me anyway.Blind Willie was an interesting story that just didn't seem to fit. It should have really gone on longer and it seemed contrived as far as its connnection to the other stories (you really don't have to read the Author's Note to realize that). A personal aside to Mr. King who's not going to read this: Don't do that again. We know where you live.Why We're In Vietnam did a nice job of tying up some loose ends and untying some others. A look into Carol's life since U of M might have been fun, but I'm hoping she meets a gunslinger soon."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Having lost my faith is King over the last few snoozy novels, I regained it back (and then some) after spending an intense day with this book. As a literature teacher, I have read some of the all time classics and some of the all time losers and this rates closer to a classic than anything else I have read by King. The characters were interestingly vibrant and the events that affected them were also hauntingly real. Having been born in 1968, I don't remember the era he recalls so affectionately in the first story, but that didn't dampen the sense of tragedy I felt as I watched the specter of the Vietnam War destroy these characters to whom I became so attached very quickly. The first story, with its supernatural edge, is a brilliant way to attact us and hook us on the lives of these kids who grow up to appear in the other stories. It was like seeing an old friend any time one of the kids from Harwich turned up in one of the other stories. This is a masterfull work; however, I am certain King's die-hard horror fans will be disappointed. Sometimes real life is more horrible than any monster lurking in the closet-which may just be the scariest thing King has ever had us consider. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I am a great admirer of King's story-telling abilities. The man is amazing: he can take the most unpromising premise (haunted car, haunted dog, haunted writer, etc.), and weave a compelling, scary, can't-put-down page-turner out of it. While I have found some plot turns (Pet Sematary) and features (King evidently has never met anyone, of any age, whose speech doesn't feature a constant flow of filthy language; nor has he ever met a practicing Christian), I have always marveled at his ability to weave a yarn.But not this time.The first part starts a promising story, and then drops it. The next and largest portion is a yawning, endless, go-nowhere chasm of a non-story, written as if it were a parody of all of King's pet obscenities and phrases *without* the redeeming factor of a hurtling plotline. I read it solely out of faith in King; I was sorely disappointed. Then a re-warmed short is stuck in, which goes nowhere; then the book ends, like a song dropped mid-verse.Someone may need to tell King that it's OK, he can rest and take a year off. We won't forget him. Go out, meet some *different* kinds of people, broaden your scope. Then by all means get back to it, and weave your spell again. We'll be waiting anxiously."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I'm an avid King reader, and eagerly await the next Dark Tower novel. So I appreciate the few Tower references thrown into Hearts in Atlantis. But this book is just so much more than a bridge between his other novels. To those who can't appreciate anything of King's if it doesn't have Roland or a some element of the supernatural in it, and judging by some of the reviews below that's quite a few, I truly feel sorry for you. I've always thought the best thing about King's novels was his characters, not what happens to them, and this is a powerful work about real characters and themes that I think all of us can relate to. I'm only 22 and still a college student myself, obviously with little knowledge of what the 60's were really like. But after finishing this incredible book (I read it straight through), all I could do for at least half an hour was lie in bed and contemplate the twists and turns that life (my life, maybe) may take. And to leave me truly thinking and deeply affected, as well as being a great read, well... I can't ask for anything more from any author."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"What a great read!! SK is genuinely one of America's national treasures. I hope the literary pundits will award King with one of the major awards for this book - it truly is most deserving.This book evoked a lot of memories (good and bad). Growing up in the &quot;sixties&quot; was special and King has captured that extraordinary time in four interrelated stories. What was it like to be a child then; a college student on scholarship fighting to keep his military deferment? Why were we in Vietnam and what was it like to have been there? What were the long-term effects of those turbulent times?King's story about &quot;Bobby'O&quot;, &quot;Sully-John&quot;, Carol Gerber, Pete Riley, Skip Kirk, &quot;Blind Willie&quot;, et al (and of course Ted), answers those questions. The stories will remain with you long after you've read the last page and have you yearning for more.King noted (paraphrasing), &quot;there are books with great stories and those with great words and some with both&quot;. This is a book that does have both and it certainly will find a place in my collection.Thanks, Stephen, for the book and the wonderful memories."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Once again, Stephen King grabbed me by the throat and held on tight until I finished the last page. &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; proves (After 25 years, how much proof do we need?) that King is not only a master storyteller who writes from the gut, but an artist who paints his characters in such a way as to make me care what happens to them at every turn of the page. From the moment I met Bobby Garfield in the opening &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats,&quot; I was committed to knowing him and those in his life as well as King would let me. King's unselfconscious use of language to create each scene with mere words allows us to forget we are reading words. As someone who is King's age, I lived through the Vietnam era and marvelled as he brought me back there so swiftly and effortlessly. But I struggle to express my appreciation of this new King story. He did it best in the voice of Ted (&quot;Low Men...&quot;): &quot;There are...books full of great writing that don't have very good stories. Read sometimes for the story, Bobby. Don't be like the book-snobs who won't do that. Read sometimes for the words--the language. Don't be like the play-it-safers that won't do that. But when you find a book that has both a good story and good words, treasure that book.&quot; Like so many other King titles, this is a good story and good words and I will treasure this book."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"It's easy to see why Stephen King has sold about 100 million billion books - the man can flat out write! The clever observations and turns of phrase were, unfortunately, the only things that kept me reading throughout this whole book.The long first story (&quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot;) is terrific, featuring two characters to really care about in Bobby Garfield and Ted Brautigan, along with some fun supernatural stuff (but not too much) and a good story. But after that, the stories slipped into a fog of VietNam, 1960s angst, and characters I couldn't get a feel for. Pete Riley was OK - King sure puts some great words in his characters' mouths. And I lost interest in Carol Gerber - too bad, because she started out so well.The final story (which is short) brings back Bobby Garfield in kind of a wrap-up segment but, by this time, I was ready to read something else. It's good craftsmanship; just too many stories trying to be woven together over too many years for this cast of characters."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King has done a rare and marvelous miracle. Its name is &quot;Hearts in Atlantis.&quot; It is real and heartbreakingly sad and joyous and bittersweet almost beyond bearing. It is the story of the generation I now feel so fortunate to have been a part of. There is a luminosity on each and every page. I can't believe anyone will ever write a better, more sensitive, more complex, more heroic book about the people I grew up with. The fear of Vietnam. The terrible brutality of the imminent shadows of Chicago and Kent State. And a wise writer's eyes on how humanity can overcome so much. The tenacity and courage of the young and not so young. How good it makes me feel, this book, to be a person who has been scalded by those years, and molded by them. I simply cannot recommend this genuine masterpiece highly enough. I've had problems in the past with other King books. But this one--soars. It seems so amazing that any one writer could have gotten so many disperate things so accurately, and has knitted together the fabric of those years-magic, childhood idealism, fantasy, friendship, water color drug dreams, trust, and death, and keening for the dead, and those so fortunate to come back to life again--so expertly in language that is lyrical and filled with poetry, and so much closer to reality than non fiction could ever be. It is impossible to read this book and not to weep. It contains the pure heart of childhood and how remembering that heart is so needed in adulthood, but so often forgotten, and the winnowing process of high school and college and war and coming back to a world that is so sadly different, and so sadly the same. Congratulations to Mr. King for giving a road map to anyone younger or older who would like to know what the Age of Aquarius and what came after was like. And to remind us who were there. It does not stint on criticism of the phoniness of those years. It explores Vietnam right in the jungle pain and grotesque death tableaus. But it is sweet and it is at heart, the resurrection of a lost kingdom, a now dim and forgotten Atlantis that King remembers fully, bell bottoms and roach clips and all, for good times and bad. And persons who were soul bled and built up again by Morrison, Dylan and Stevens and the Stones and ideals that just had to be real. That, as in King's novel, we would make it so, because we were there. We were just so sure--flower children and love that embroiders King's book that is just such a mammoth love song, so heart felt, though so clear eyed as to see the realities of back there, a tribute to that era and those who populated it. We just knew we would be young and protest always. King has not forgotten what it was like. And all of us readers are so fortunate he has not. The book links me in its images to my own. The crucifixion of that first casualty in Vietnam that I knew--a boy I remembered from the seventh grade, always now in my mind a boy. They sent children there to die. King does not lumber in this. His characters gradually come to realize death is real. And war. Too real. And he shows compassion to those of us who hid as best we could. He paints a portrait, all his own,colored somehow by our own memories, that is far beyond love beads and hair length. It is the core of us. And the mark of a great novel when we see our friends, our loves, our dead, in these characters, and when we finish the book, I, at least, weeping uncontrollably at that flower tender sunshine and autumn sky and sadly dressed for Fall conclusion. Thinking, he got it right. And I for one am intensely eternally grateful."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Another one of King's 'serious' books as they are called by horror despiters. Here he proves that he can write them as well as horror books. Maybe even better.This book is about war. Of course it's about Vietnam especially but where is the difference here?The book is divided into five stories which are divided into years. Except the first and the last, they are not really connected except in this strange way King connects all of his stories.The first in 1960 is a story about a boy who gets to know a man who becomes his best friend, but has strange problems. I won't tell more for surprises but Dark Tower-fans should read it!The second in 1966 is the best one, a story about a young man and what he experienced when he was in university in this year. Since Vietnam began here, war begins to play its first role in this story. It's funny and sad and wonderful.The third in 1983 is about a veteran who has a very strange way to earn his daily money. Nothing more told here too. Very unusual.The fourth in 1999 is about another veteran and how he has to fight with his traumatic experiences in Vietnam. Very unexpected things happening here. Great story!The last one is also in 1999 and is connected to the first one.King says wonderful things about war and since he never was fighting in Vietnam it's even more surprising how good he writes about it. This one gives me hope again that King can still write unusual great books and doesn't think to much of money. A must!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I've always had a soft spot for Stephen King. The first novel I ever read was &quot;Pet Semetary&quot;, and that was in the third grade! I even did a book report on it, which must have been very interesting for my teacher to read...she must have thought I was a twisted little boy!Anyhow, to the point... When I pick up a King book, it's like hearing the voice of a long-lost friend. There's very little of his work that I dislike, but some that I definitely like more than others. &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; falls into the latter category (along with &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; and, of course, &quot;The Stand&quot;). King certainly does a great job of scaring folks, but he is best at creating characters with whom we can empathize or at least identify. And even though I grew up in the '80's, I'll be damned if King doesn't make me nostalgic for the '60's! How can that be? The answer: terrific writing.The way that this book is constructed is extremely interesting -- not distracting or pointless, as other reviewers have written. It's as if he took one from the Tarantino guide to unconventional story-telling. The way that he follows the characters throughout the book is fascinating and enlightening. He creates a more complex story with more complex characters by weaving them in and out of the story, and exploring the same situation from different points of view. What he has done --his thesis, if you will -- is to explore the aftermath of &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, which plays such a large part in the first story in this book, &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot;. Does this have a happy ending? What happens to the children now that they are saved? And, of course, are they really &quot;saved&quot; at all?While many King books dissapoint me with their endings, this one did not (perhaps it's because there were no giant space-spiders!). The ending was perfect, and fit well with his theme. I, for one, really like King's new &quot;literary&quot; style, and hope there's more to come. He has done a marvelous job with &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;, and I would reccomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Without a doubt Hearts in Atlantis is the best Stephen King Novel yet. The characters in the first two stories, Low Men in Yellow Coats and the Title Story - Hearts in Atlantis, are characters everyone can indentify with in some way. The stories are emotionally gripping and when you put the book down you keep on thinking about those characters and how you may have lived through similar experiences yourself. The way King intertwines the characters into all five stories is amazing. This book is fantastic I loved it."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"While this was far from my favorite King reading, I enjoyed the 5 stories that King combines in Hearts in Atlantis. It was quite different from the majority of his horror novels, comparable to such works as Shawshank Redemption, but perhaps that is what makes it so interesting. The story itself is slippery, quite cunning in fact, and I found myself unable to grasp it. Everytime I thought I had a handle on the events and could predict what would arise with the turn of a page, the story would take a turn and slide out of my hands. A wonderful book to take on vacation of for a weekend read."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is one of the best books I have read by King. He's the most talented Author along side Sidney Sheldon. If you read Lord of the Flies,and loved it then this book is for you. Everyone will understand and love &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"With this book, Stephen King takes a step away from the unmitigated gore that, while entertaining, can become repetitive. &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; is simply a good story, told with sympathy, an almost nostalgic attention to detail, and his typical, down-to-earth language and humour. While reading the Dark Tower series would make the first chapter more accessible, I haven't read them and I still thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope we can expect more novels like this. Stephen King is obviously a gifted storyteller, even without resorting to his trademark horror genre."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Give Cosby's first half-dozen standup albums a listen, and you will find that the theme of childhood predominates his work. But while Cosby's stories of his own childhood make a fun time out of his urban upbringing, King reminds us what a chamber of horrors childhood can be. Those of us who shake our heads at how our kids make a big deal out of &quot;meaningless&quot; things forget how very real such things were to us at that age. This is what makes this book a worthy successor to &quot;It&quot;. What we get here is a set of stories that are so related to one another that King could have claimed they were &quot;Book I&quot;, &quot;Book II&quot;, etc. of the same novel. The common denominator here is a girl named Carol, but the two novellas are not from her perspective--but from the perspectives of two guys involved with her at different points of her life. There's a mysterious elderly stranger who's on the run from agents of a mysterious enemy called the &quot;Crimson King&quot; (I find myself wondering if that's some myth separate from this story--the early progressive band King Crimson seem to derive their name from it, as well as the tile of their first album &quot;In the Court Of the Crimson King&quot;). There's also a semi-allusion to the movie &quot;Storm Of the Century&quot; where a character says the same thing at one point that &quot;Storm's&quot; main character keeps saying throughout the movie: &quot;Give me what I want and I'll go away&quot; (I still wish King had made that one into a book). But although there are mysterious demons here like in King's other books, our heroes suffer just as much at the hands of other mortals. Like three ordinary bullies beating on Carol with a baseball bat, dislocating her shoulder, for instance. Cosby's lesson is that no matter how tough your childhood was, your buddies were pretty funny. King, however, reminds us of childhood peers that we did well not to turn our backs on. Well, Nietsche put the same point about as well: &quot;I find that I owe more to the hard times of my life than I could ever owe to the easier times.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"The opening piece, LOW MEN IN YELLOW COATS could (should?) stand alone as a single short novel. It reminded me of THE BODY (published forever ago in DIFFERENT SEASONS and incarnated as Rob Reiner's STAND BY ME in film). I've always held that King's greatest strength is character development. There's nothing more horrific than learning to know and love a character, then seeing something horrible happen to them. As King continues to grow and mature as a writer (an intriguing thought that his best work is yet to come, isn't it?) I think he's recognizing his strengths. The horror in this opening salvo is muted (though still creepily evident) but the character development of Bobby, his mother, and the old man, Ted, is King at his best. They all unfold as people we know and are. Bobby's mother may be despicable, but King lets us know her and understand her in the same way many of us came to know our own parents; this is a subtle literary feat which many might miss. The second and title story, HEARTS IN ATLANTIS, is &quot;pretty good&quot; but suffers from the overplay of everything about the 60's. King's honesty as a writer is overwhelmed by our own memories, understandings, and stereotypes of the 60's. I told my wife it's like Michael Jackson's music - it's brilliant but when you hear it a million times it loses its charm. He's done as good a job as anyone could, though. LOW MEN IN YELLOW COATS is the best because it takes place IN the 60's, but doesn't depend upon the era as a part of the story. The final works are worth reading, but don't stand up to the first two works, in my opinion. Perhaps if they had been published separately I wouldn't have to compare them to the other works in the collection. Summary: An uneven work (as much of King's collections are), but worth borrowing, buying, or stealing and reading as this is one of King's more accessible works for the non-King afficionado. Write more, Mr. King!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"In many of his previous books and stories, SK has shown a flair and instinct for recreating the ambiance of \\"growing up\\" or coming of age in the \`60's. The difference here is that the \\"horror\\" at the centerpiece is not some made-up monsters but the specter of the Viet Nam conflict.These are cleverly interwoven novellas which share \\"carry-over\\" characters. One segment metaphors the \\"60's generation\\" as citizens of the since-sunken-and-gone-forever civilization of Atlantis. (These citizens also become engrossed in the card game of Hearts - hence the unifying title.) There is a memory tweaking trip about the advent and proliferation of the peace sign (sparrow track?) Where were you when you first saw it?One of my favourite King-isms in another segment: \\"Agent Orange - the gift that keeps on giving.\\" (talking about the high incidence of lung &amp; brain cancer, dental problems, etc., in Viet Nam veterans.)In the premier story in this book, King has a wise old character say that some books have a great story and some books have great writing. \\"read sometimes for the story, Bobby. Don't be like the book-snobs who won't do that. Read sometimes for the words - the language. Don't be like the play-it-safers that won't do that. But when you find a book that has both a good story and good words, treasure that book.\\" Me thinkest that in this compilation, King writes both good story and good words, and that he dost sell himself short. It is a grand accomplishment.I read the book last winter and it \\"zinged\\" many dormant memories. This summer, I listened to the Unabridged audiocassette. The bonus with the Audio version is that both William Hurt (harking back to The Big Chill and some of my other favourite quotes about the 60's) and the author himself give excellent readings. On audio, there is also a \`free surprise bonus\\" at the end."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Hearts shows a continued progression of change in King's novels. It tells several stories each one takes place in a different time from the early sixties to today. Each story is connected to the other in a subtle way, but yet is a key to each story. The stories are written each from a different perspective, giving you a different feel with each one. I have read several of Kings books and find his new trend to be refreshing and quite interesting, as with &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; King continues his fantastic writing with a new style and flare. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"For S.K. fans, this one is right up there with Gerald's Game and Wizard and Glass. &quot;Hearts&quot; goes beyond anything S.K. has ever done. It grabs your emotions in the first chapter and doesn't let them go until well after you've finished the book. With slight tie-ins with the Gunslinger series, &quot;Hearts&quot; makes you think even deeper as to what might become of our four gunslingers, as well as take you on a journey through the lives of two very special, very real kids. I personally think Bobby and Carol would make an excellent pair of gunslingers."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"King's Hearts in Atlantis tells four different stories that are joined together somewhat indirectly by sharing some of the same characters. Think Tarantino, only instead of jumping back and forth along the timeline, these progress straight forward starting in the idyllic early 60's and finishing in the 00's. We catch the childhood of one set of characters, the college years of another, and then the middle age yet another. And of course, they all come together in the end. King's purpose is to conjure up that warm and fuzzy nostalgic feeling of childhood, and then to explore how that time was \`lost' during the Vietnam era.The first section is easily the best, both from a writing standpoint and from an interesting story standpoint. It also happens to be the sole subject of the film made about this novel, but that's another story. We follow a group of three close friends: Bobby Garfield, Carol Gerber, and John Sullivan as they grow up in a sleepy, idealized suburban neighborhood. The story takes a very unusual turn when an older gentleman, Ted Brautigan, moves into the apartment upstairs from Bobby. We come to learn that he has an unusual power, and that he is on the run from the \`low men' who seem like something out of a sci-fi novel.The character of Bobby's mother is probably the best written in the entire novel, her cruelty is terrifying at times and the reader really feels it. From here the book takes a bad turn. The point of view shifts completely off Bobby, and onto a new and completely random character who is just starting college. The only connection to the rest is the fact that he meets Carol Gerber. The story line is interesting at first - a big university at the beginning of the protest years. It doesn't seem to go anywhere though, and the next section of the book is another odd jump.We pick up on the story of Blind Willie - a bully from the first section who now earns money by pretending to be a blinded Vietnam vet. Another section focuses on John Sullivan, also from earlier, and his battle with post Vietnam trauma.Overall King is an excellent storyteller, but Hearts in Atlantis seemed a little disjointed to me, the connections between sections were abrupt and could have been transitioned to a little better. Obviously his goal was to create a nostalgic and \`important' reflection on the events surrounding Vietnam - something sure to appeal to the very wide demographic of baby boomers and even some post-boomers. The topic has been better covered and King really adds nothing new. We already know that Vietnam was terrible and unfair and it severely affected even those that survived it. King rehashes many themes: the loss of the idealized childhood that never really existed, and the self-importance of the 60's era protesters. Sure many great things were accomplished by a few in this time, but much of it was just nonsense. Kings worst offense is sympathizing and rationalizing an act of protest terrorism that inadvertently has deadly results.The greatest insight of the novel is one King probably didn't intend, which is a window into the mind of his generation and how badly it shaped their future thinking."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I hated Insomnia for the longest time. I had tried to get into it to no avail. Then I learned it tied into The Dark Tower series, and I fought tooth-and-nail to get through. Even though it took a huge amount of effort, I still fell in love with that book. I fell in love with Hearts in Atlantis for completely the opposite reason. To me, it was open and yielding; very easy to fall into, like a dream that you don't want to wake up from. I would probably go so far as to say that this is my favorite Stephen King book of all time. It finally puts to rest any doubts about his talent to write stories other than those about monsters (which are really, end the end, also stories about people). Low Men in Yellow Coats I liked the best for reasons I've already mentioned (*cough* ties-in with The Dark Tower series *cough*), as well as the way it was written -- making even the unbelievable seem believable concerning the low men, and showing strong parental bond that started to develop between Bobby and Ted. I would even go so far as to say Ted is probably my favorite character in any King novel. To me, he's reminiscent of my sixth-grade teacher who instilled in me a great love of literature and language, much like Ted does for Bobby in the story. Hearts in Atlantis (the titled story) tied with the rest in my opinion (it did also make me want to learn to play Hearts). I liked them all pretty much the same. All in all, this is my favorite tie-in book. I also like Black House, but not as much as this one. Words like &quot;complex,&quot; &quot;bittersweet,&quot; and &quot;haunting&quot; come to ming when I think about this book.This book definitely gets high marks from me. If any of you out there have always wanted to try some Stephen King, but weren't too big on his &quot;horror stuff&quot; I highly recommend this. I am aware he has written other non-horror stories (being a fan, I would know that), but I'll save those other reviews for another day."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Starts out great and then gets progressively bad, just like many other King books. (Remember the awful endings to Needful Things and Tom Gordon)? Also, it seems as though King is starting to recycle material--the relationship between Bobby and Ted is remarkably similar to that of the young boy and former Nazi in \\"Apt Pupil,\\" one of King's best stories. Anyway, King should leave the Vietnam stuff to Tim O'Brien, a writer who was actually there. (Incidentally, he's also a MUCH better writer than King.) I have read almost every King book, but this one is mediocre at best."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"As a fellow New Englander, I wanted Mr. King to remain the--well, the king--of pulp fiction. Sure, he will never write like Jonathan Franzen, but at least King can keep my eyes glued and an occasional belly laugh will eminate from my bowels during a hootish read. But not in \\"Hearts\\", an overdrawn, sappy atmosphere piece; mostly pulp, not enough fiction. The boy meets Ted story swims in local charm, but truly never goes anyplace interesting. Please note in the other Amazon reviews of this novel--the favorable ones--most of the emphasis is on bringing the reader back to a bygone era. Sure, I am 38, I get the nostalgic bent. But is it, as a stand alone beast, enough to drive a novel of rather weighty proportion. I vote \\"no\\". For what it is worth, I think Stephen King's \\"On \\"Writing\\" is a pleasurable read for the correct audience (King fans and creative writers), and I suggest that for it's humor, clarity and fun value. Stephen, as you state in your own non-fictino prose, \\"above all, tell a story\\". Writer take thyne own potion. Reader's save your money."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I've been a &quot;Constant Reader&quot; since seventh grade with It, and I've read almost everything written by the &quot;master of Horror&quot;. I've only a few times been disappointed in the middle. This was one of those times. I finished &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; and wanted to stop. Let me explain, because I didn't and consequently loved &quot;Blind Willie&quot;.With &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot;, the story was SO exactly Stephen King-like, so exactly what I expected him to write, in such the exact style, that it wasn't hard for me to transport myself into Harwich, Maine, in 1960. The problem is that this style is so much like other work, what with the thoughts floating in and out, the references to songs and movies, the &quot;knowing&quot; that the central character inevitably has, all come from other books, and this could have been just a chapter in almost any other novel, with just the names and places changed. [For example, see Insomnia, Rose Madder, Bag of Bones for examples of the style that plagues King.] What was hard for me was the almost annoying references to the Dark Tower series and the Regulators. Fifty pages in, I thought, &quot;I've heard of the low men before...where?&quot; Then I realized, they're the regulators that the little kid drew in the Bachman book. If you don't belive me, go read it for yourself. Not exactly the same, but King's just recycling, doing his part for the environment. No big whoop. The low men weren't as annoying as the Dark Tower references, because it seems as if King is so completely obsessed with the Tower that he can't write anything without putting reference in somewhere (Insomnia, Rose Madder, etc.).The problem is that this reference ruined Hearts for me, because since I've been conditioned by recent books to expect a DT reference, I spent the whole of Hearts looking for it, and I couldn't just enjoy the story. Unfortunately, I hadn't separated the stories, especially since the characters continued, and logically I expected similar themes to come popping through, like Pete waking in the middle of the night with &quot;All things serve the Beam&quot; on his lips as a half-remembered dream, or Carol sleepily mumbling &quot;The Good Man is coming&quot; after their shotgun-seat interlude. I was hoping for a DT-free set of novellas, and when I didn't get it I was tainted. I was soiled by the expectations that King had ingrained in my mind, and I wasn't able to start Blind Willie until three or four days later, after I had a chance to clear my mind and go into it with no expectations. And what I got was excellent.Please, write me an e-mail at &quot;s_mathys@hotmail.com&quot; to continue this discussion further. Maybe we can talk about how King has already written the story of the Tower in &quot;The Talisman&quot; with Peter Straub, but, hey, do your part to help Mother Nature, reduce, reuse, recycle. You've got an example in Stephen King."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"If it is possible for a novel to suffer from multiple personality disorder, Hearts in Atlantis is so diagnosed. It appears to be many things, but never really coalesces into any of them.For the most part the stories here can be read separately, and in many ways have the ability to stand on their own, some better than others. Having said this, you should at all costs avoid the second, eponymous Hearts in Atlantis installment as one of the most tiresome narratives ever. If you are looking for a good scare then this story will frighten you only in its ability to illustrate how absolutely boring and ultimately pointless a story can be. With that sole exception the individual stories show some faint promise, but taken as a whole work, which appears to be the intention, the effort finally falls flat.If you do take a shot at this, stay away from reading the dust jacket (hardcover) as it gives away a final chapter element you may wonder about as you read through the preceding stories.(Yes, bachman is really my name)"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Have been reading Stephen King since I was a child, and have gone from hating some of his books to absolute adoration for the story telling ability of this genius.

You read a clever idea by a less talented writer and turn it into something visual and emotional with a setting you're familiar with. After The Dark Half, you've committed to using original concepts. It doesn't work. You were doing fine before. Nothing of yours exceeds like the variation of twice-told themes we find in The Dead Zone (Simak meets Updike) The Gunslinger (Tolkein showdowns with Max Brand) even a potboiler like the Stand has incredible storytelling(Pat Frank and Tolkein send Thorton Wilder and Jim Thompson to the Rapture). It's a gift to blend these voices. Others can't do it. If you were trying for a Tim O'Brien meets Stephen King in your new book Hearts in Atlantis, well just one more ingredient and you'd have made it. Low Men in Yellow Coats is an original approach.

Johnny Cash, Bruce Springsteen, and Janis Joplin are among those musicians who have this quality; among painers, Salvador Dali is one such. And among writers, certain names leap to mind: Sophocles, Euripides, Shakespeare -- and Stephen King. Lest you laugh over this comparison of an American pop author to some of the greatest writers of all time, think about this: quality or not, King fills precisely the same niche in our culture that Sophocles and Shakespeare did in theirs, as messengers from the Gods of those cultures to their people, revealing to them the terror, joy, misery, and wonder of life and the Gods Who make their lives possible. Stephen King does this for us in spades -- or, perhaps, I should say &quot;hearts.&quot; When you read his books, his stories, you know he's been there, somehow he's been there -- and reading him, you are there, too. And you can't ever again kid yourself into believing you weren't there with him, in the midst of all life's raw horror and glory. Here are the 1960s, in all their wonder and horror, and here are the 1990s that grew out of the 60s.

Half of the book is read by Stephen King (who is great) and the other half by William Hurt.

They are tedious to listen to and subtract considerably from the story.

This is practically a book of three short stories, with the characters sort of intertwining throughout.I was thoroughly engrossed with the first of the three scenarios. A young boy with a single mother and the old man who lived upstairs. The old man teaches the boy about reading and many other things. The mother is always leery of the man's attention to the boy. This portion of the book was touching.The second portion of the book was okay, but not as good as the first. It tells the story of college kids in the 60's. One of those college kids was a friend of the little boy in the first part of the book. The kids go in different directions, have an addiction to playing Hearts, and being involved in anti-war protests. What I enjoyed most about this portion of the book was the look back at the sixties.The third part of the book was just bizarre. I can't think of how to put it better. It covered some Viet Nam vets in the 90's. Of course, one of the vets had been a friend of the little boy in the first part of the book.

If you have read the soppy review from from the Primary School teacher which precedes this one, ignore it. No child with any red blood flowing through his or her veins needs protection from the verses penned by Belloc. Rather, they will urge you to read them more.Matilda is a modern version of Cry Wolf, and is none the worse for it. Belloc, who was half French, wrote the best rhyme I've ever seen in an English verse. I quote it from memory with a big grin on my face:\\"Matilda told such dreadful liesIt made one gasp and stretch one's eyes.Her aunt, who kept a strict regard for truth,Attempted to believe Matilda.The effort very nearly killed her,And would have done so had not sheDiscovered this infirmity.\\"My elder daughter, who is a Primary School Assistant Head Teacher in Hackney, has no qualms about reading to her small pupils this delicious account of disaster for the girl who was incapable of telling the truth.

The title might be somewhat misleading because most people won't immediately think that it applies to their work. My particular use of it is as a nonfiction writer, and this book presents good ideas for how to gather information, take notes, and write about the subject. The writing assignments are helpful and more specific than others that I've seen. I like the way the book can be used by both students and teachers or individuals outside of academia. I could also see the assignments being altered slightly for other fields entirely, which is undoubtedly the reason the book is entitled Field Working rather than Field Writing or some other such name. For example, an art historian can benefit from the free writing exercises and force herself to write without self-editing in order to get out some ideas. One good point made was that so much time is spent not writing that it can become a habit. Also, note-taking is almost never taught (in high school or college unless by a tutor). There are several different methods of notetaking presented in this book, all with the awareness that the notetaker may need to review the notes months or even years later. I could have used such knowledge in my college years even for science lectures.I do think that even high schoolers could benefit from this book. If that were the case, I think it would be best if the writing samples and assignments were separated into a teacher's manual while the figures of such things as the actual fieldnotes could be left in.

Phillips, is a gripping nonfiction tale of the Vietnam War. The \\"about the author\\" section inside the book's back cover notes that Phillips served in the U.S. Marine Corps and is himself a Vietnam veteran. Phillips' sources for this book include interviews with a number of the participants in the battle. Retired general William C. Westmoreland contributed the book's foreword. The book's poetic title is an allusion to one of the United States military's highest decorations for valor in combat.Lang Vei was a Green Beret outpost that was the object of a major attack in 1968. Phillips strikes a very effective balance of technical details and human elements as he tells the story. The book is full of intense combat scenes. The straightforward, fact-driven style is well matched to the subject matter. Intriguingly, Phillips notes where there are disagreements or ambiguities among his sources, thus reminding us of the difficulty in capturing history on the printed page.The book is full of revealing details about weapons, vehicles, and tactics. Phillips looks carefully at the complex interlocking aspects of 20th century warfare, including human intelligence, air support, illumination, communications, first aid, and leadership. He vividly captures the \\"Murphy's Law\\" aspect of combat, whereby weapons malfunction and other things go unexpectedly wrong. Particularly fascinating is the human complexity of the battlespace in this account; the story involves not only U.S. military from different branches, but also Laotian and ethnic Vietnamese forces, as well as different tribal peoples of Vietnam.Phillips weaves the personal stories of a number of the battle participants into the overall story. He also goes into detail about the long odyssey faced by the mother of a soldier who was declared MIA in the battle. The text is further enhanced by several pages of photographs and other illustrations, as well as by a bibliography and index. Written with intelligence and compassion, \\"Night of the Silver Stars\\" is a fitting tribute to the remarkable heroism shown by the warriors of Lang Vei."},{"Title":"Night of the Silver Stars: The Battle of Lang Vei (Special Warfare Series)","review":"This book fortells of the horrors to come of the Marines at Khe Sanh and the courage of the Green Beret detachment stationed Lang Vei to defend their small outpost against overwhelming odds against the first armored assult against Americans in the war.

One thing that was right was Sgt Ashley's heroism and dedication to his brothers in the camp. If the Marines at Khe Sahn, and the brass in Saigaon or Da Nang had had such dedication to these fine men, the ending would not have been so tragic. I have read Dan L.

The author points out how the marines at Khe Sanh, only nine miles away, refused to first believe that armored vehicles were being used to assault the SF outpost and then they refuse to help the few defenders when there is no question that the post will be overrun without reinforcements. However, once he points that out, the author then tries to justify the marine decision to sit idle while fellow combatants are being killed. He says that the marines believed an ambush was waiting for any reinforcements that attempted to help so they are justified in not doing anything to help except provide artillery support. They preferred to sit safely inside their base and leave the funny dressing, unconventional SF guys to their own fate. The author even spends time explaining how tough the marine commander on the ground had it by making the decision not to help his fellow Americans. It was simple wrong not to help those few, brave men at Lang Vei and the marine commander was derelict in his duties. If others acted in such a manner, then American pilots shot down would not feel confident in the fact that all efforts will be done to rescue them even in the face of certain ambush by waiting troops.It is tragic that two PJs were killed while attempting to rescue wounded Rangers and Delta personnel after being ambushed in Mogadishu but coming to the aid of fellow American combatants in the face of almost certain death is what Duty, Honor and Country is all about - atleast for most of us!It is too bad that someone of the caliber of Bull Simons, Col.Hackworth of Col Hal Moore weren't on the ground at Khe Sanh on that day!"},{"Title":"Night of the Silver Stars: The Battle of Lang Vei (Special Warfare Series)","review":"Author William Phillips donates a large section of his book trying to explain why the marines failed to do their assigned duty in relieving the pressures dealt the defenders of Lang Vei.He explains their refusals as being based on suicidal odds.Yet after their pilots were ordered to take in volunteers the SF SOG troops went in mass.It's an Army airborne creed that you leave no one behind!

This book is for people who are presently (or are studying to be) counselors or clinicans. You won't find any information about forming better relationships or self-help."},{"Title":"Assessment in Counseling: A Guide to the Use of Psychological Assessment Procedures","review":"This book aims at helping the practicing counselor in choosing, administering and interpreting psychological assessment procedures and it does its task well! It's not a desk manual for the tests themselves, but teaches you about the nature and use of psychological testing, measuring concepts and testing interpretation in sufficient detail so that I recommend it as first choice if you are considering using assessment tools in your counseling practice. Counseling education should make a book like this one \\"required reading\\".The body of the book (some 340 pages) gives a good overview of what the different types of questionnaires aim at. This includes chapters on intelligence testing, career choice testing, values and interests, personality, and mental health assessment. Finally, the last section covers professional considerations such as minority testing and testing of special populations, communication of test results and ethical and social issues. All by all, this is a pretty complete book for what a counselor will typically need.Of course, a book review is not complete without some suggestions for improvement. Having been building questionnaires for jobEQ.com over the last year as part of my PhD, I certainly have some recommendations. First, those that know me you might expect me to look for a link to emotional intelligence. Well, for a book revised in 2002, I found it a bit disappointing that some types of tests such as competence tests (e.g. testing for emotional intelligence) and 360 feedback instruments seem to be missing. Secondly, linked to my view as an \\"outsider\\" living in Europe, even if it treats \\"cultural aspects\\" this book is less useful at this side of the ocean, because, for instance, most instruments discussed are not translated into most European languages, let alone have European Standard Groups. Thirdly, the book isn't very critical about validity. I'd preferred it if it was more outspoken on the validity of certain tests. Also the book would be easier to digest if it included a few extra cases. And a last thing to mention is the huge difference between what the American Counseling Association (ACA) members pay for this book, and the list price \\"outsiders\\" have to pay.When not to buy this book? As indicated in this review and in the book's title, this book is aimed at counselors. If you want to a more theoretical book, helping you to evaluate tests from a test design perspective, I'd rather recommend \\"Psychological Testing\\" by Kaplan & Saccuzzo (even if that is a *very* expensive book).Conclusion:if you are a counselor, this book is a \\"must have\\" Especially if you can buy it at the price offered to you as a member of the American Counseling Association, it will be a \\"no-brainer\\" investment.Patrick Merlevede, MSc - author of \\"7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence\\""},{"Title":"Assessment in Counseling: A Guide to the Use of Psychological Assessment Procedures","review":"The book arrived soon! and looked fine, without any notes/ lines in it.

It's clear the author has relied too much on written sources and lacks an intimate knowledge of the language, which is a pity, considering the reputation of the university she works for.Worst of all is the contextualisation of the grammar. 'There are no trees in this forest'. So where's the forest then?

MacDonald's &quot;A Time For Trumpets&quot;, yet this, too, is an excellent and inspiring cover of the events leading up to and including the Battle of the Bulge. This book follows in the vein of detailing at the unit level what the war was like for the man on the ground, and incorporates a lot of first person testimony a la Stephen Ambrose.Thus, the reader is treated to a very thorough look at what the moment-to-moment experience was like from a number of the men who were there to fight it. As Col. Eisenhower was also a career military man following in his famous father's footsteps, he speaks with obvious authority and knowledge about the multitude of factors leading to the engagement on both sides, and one gains an appreciation for his expertise if not for his somewhat pedantic and limited writing skills. Still, the book is an interesting and accessible reading experience.Of course, since I had already read a number of other titles covering the same ground, much of the material was repetitive, but my impression after finishing it was that &quot;The Bitter Woods&quot; is a very authoritative single volume on the campaign, and that it competes favorably with all the others, although I should not want to so limit myself to a single such source for this, one of the finest moments in American war history. It is stirring to read about the first hand experiences of the tired, overextended, and under armed units of the American forces as they first engage the overwhelming German juggernaut. Beaten to a pulp, they regroup, and surrounded, outnumbered, outgunned, and outmaneuvered, in a desperate hand to hand combat, fight back with hellish ferocity and beat the German forces back.This account puts to the lie the idea that the only reason we won the war was superior number and endless logistics. Deprived of those two advantages during the extremely bad weather during the worst part of the battle, the U.S. Army simply outfought their German attackers. I personally would recommend you read this book hand in hand with the Toland book (&quot;Battle&quot;), for together they provide a really complete and quite varied look at all of the aspects of one of the most tenaciously fought battles on the western front of the European theater of the Second World War. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The bitter woods;: The dramatic story, told at all echelons, from supreme command to squad leader, of the crisis that shook the Western coalition: Hitler's surprise Ardennes offensives,","review":"The Bitter Woods, historian John S. D. Eisenhower's insightful account of the Ardennes Counteroffensive in the winter of 1944, is one of the best books yet written about the Battle of the Bulge. Along with John Toland's 1959 classic Battle: The Story of the Bulge and the late Charles B. MacDonald's A Time for Trumpets, this volume is a must-read for World War II buffs.The Ardennes Counteroffensive was the brainchild of Adolf Hitler himself. Even as Soviet forces raced toward Berlin from the east and the Western Allies advanced steadily toward the Rhine in the west, the Fuhrer squirreled away hundreds of tanks and artillery pieces plus thousands of soldiers -- some of them either old men over the age of 50 or young boys no older than 16 -- and planned a daring stroke reminiscent of the Third Reich's triumphs in 1939 and 1940. Three entire armies would strike the Allies in the \\"quiet\\" Ardennes forest region of Belgium and Luxembourg and drive to the crucial port of Antwerp. Hitler hoped to drive a wedge between the Anglo-Canadian armies in the north and the American armies in the south and cause inter-Allied political strife. At the very least, the seizure of Antwerp would slow the Allied advance just enough so Nazi Germany could develop \\"wonder weapons\\" and rain V-1 and V-2 missiles on London and other Allied cities. At the very best, the Grand Alliance would fall apart and Hitler might be able to negotiate a separate peace with Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.But even though Hitler's offensive caught the Allies by surprise on Dec. 16, 1944 and created much havoc and confusion, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, supreme commander of the Allied forces, remained relatively calm. The Germans did penetrate the thinly held front and created a salient or \\"bulge\\" in the Allied lines, but Eisenhower and his field commanders (Bradley, Hodges, Patton and the various corps and divisional commanders) soon recovered and took decisive measures to contain the German assault.But generals and colonels, no matter how skilled or determined, can't win battles alone. The Bitter Woods contains many accounts of brave GIs and junior officers who fought tooth and nail to slow and stop Hitler's last desperate gamble in the West. Readers who are just beginning to read about World War II will be in awe of the paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division who helped hold the surrounded city of Bastogne, whose capture by the Germans was deemed by Hitler as a principal objective if his plan were to succeed. (Bastogne is where Brig. Gen Tony McAuliffe replied to the Germans' demand for surrender with the pithy one-word refusal, \\"Nuts!\\") The author, who graduated from West Point in June 1944 and is the Supreme Commander's son, writes about the stand of St. Vith's defenders, the combat engineers who blew bridges in front of the advancing panzer units, the ill-advised massacre of American POWs at Baugnez (the misnamed Malmedy Massacre) by SS troops and the harrowing baptism by fire of the green 106th Infantry Division, which lost two of its regiments in the largest American surrender since Bataan in 1942.Eisenhower also writes extensively about the campaign in Northwest Europe both before and after the Battle of the Bulge, allowing both the new reader and long-time buff to place this, the largest single battle in U.S. Army history (there were, by January of 1945, over 600,000 soldiers involved), in the context of the liberation of Europe from Nazi tyranny.Because the book was originally written in 1969, five years before the revelation of the Ultra secret, the account of the Allies' intelligence failure is not as well-explained as in the 1985 book by Charles MacDonald, but aside from that, The Bitter Woods still stands as one of the finest \\"case studies\\" of a major battle of World War II."},{"Title":"The bitter woods;: The dramatic story, told at all echelons, from supreme command to squad leader, of the crisis that shook the Western coalition: Hitler's surprise Ardennes offensives,","review":"I've read this book more times than I can count. To me, that's the highest praise I can give. Eisenhower (the author) writes as an historian ought to, with no axes to grind in describing Montgomery's actions, etc. His firsthand knowledge of Army ways and wherefores holds him in good stead: the reader is being shepherded through the material by one in the know who always provides a down-to-earth rational perspective. The story he tells stands on its own as, alternately, a mystery, an excellent character study of the participants (particularly the commanders), and an exciting tale of an event that represented, in my mind, the climatic event of World War II in the European Theater."},{"Title":"The bitter woods;: The dramatic story, told at all echelons, from supreme command to squad leader, of the crisis that shook the Western coalition: Hitler's surprise Ardennes offensives,","review":"COL Eisenhower initially wrote this book to be an analysis of American commanders in a moment of crisis. However, in writing the book, COL Eisenhower gradually changed the book from the analysis of leadership to that of telling the story of the Battle of the Bulge.The book opens by telling the background of the players and the events leading up to the battle. COL Eisenhower brought up some interesting items (like how poor the US Intelligence arm was during the 1930's) and his opinion on some of the leaders. Unfortunately, while I consider his opinion to be a valid opinion, I found it very prejudice against different leaders, particularly General's Eisenhower (he found no fault with Ike's leadership or handling of the Bulge situation), Bradley (I felt his opinion of Bradley was that of a loyal lap dog), Hodges (very complementary toward him, seemed to feel he was the best Army level general we had), and Patton (his comments about Patton being a weak leader when dealing with a static situation was very interesting). COL Eisenhower follows this with a very good breakdown of what Hitler and his generals did to prepare for the upcoming battle.COL Eisenhower then told the story of the battle. This was done different that most books I've read on the subject. Initially, he described the entire situation along the front, with the different breakthrough attempts by the Germans (a traditional telling shall we say), working north to south. Unfortunately, the subsequent chapters didn't follow the traditional tell what happened on that day. Instead, focused on telling one situation and how the leaders handled the situation. While good for an analysis of leadership, it makes for telling story of the battle a little harder on the reader (ok, it's December 21st, St. Vith is crumbling, what's the situation down south...). Something that I was very interested in, was how COL Eisenhower felt sorry for General Jones (commander of the 106th ID). This is something that I've never really seen before from other writers on this subject.Part of the books description says that the book looks at leadership at all levels during the battle. This was something that I felt was done weakly at the lower-to-mid levels (squad to battalion). While COL Eisenhower does describe some of the actions different battlefield leaders made, most of the focus is on the higher leadership. I conceder this to be a weakness in the book.Rating wise, this has been very difficult. Some parts of the book are very good and thought provoking, while others just lay there. On an Amazon rating of 1-5 stars, I have to give it 3 stars, mainly because it failed it's initial mission (providing a meaningful analysis of American leadership during a crisis) and it's secondary role (telling the story of the Battle of the Bulge) isn't as strong as other books on the subject (Battle by John Toland for example)."},{"Title":"The bitter woods;: The dramatic story, told at all echelons, from supreme command to squad leader, of the crisis that shook the Western coalition: Hitler's surprise Ardennes offensives,","review":"Eisenhower has a way of bringing you right into the fight. He covers in great detail the extreme conditions the American GI faced in winter battle. I have read over 25 books on WWII and this is a good one. My one complaint is the book uses so much military jargon that it can be overwhelming for a non military person. He should at least explain in the beginning some of the military terms used. For example, how many men in a platoon, division, etc...(I have the same complaint about most WWII history books). Overall this is a good read for anyone interested in WWII."},{"Title":"The bitter woods;: The dramatic story, told at all echelons, from supreme command to squad leader, of the crisis that shook the Western coalition: Hitler's surprise Ardennes offensives,","review":"This is considered one of the four great books on the Battle of the Bulge. The others are John Toland's Battle, Hugh Cole's official US Army History: The Ardennes: Battle of the Bulge and Charles B. MacDonald's A Time for Trumpets. I have read all but Hugh Cole's book and will review each of them.The Bitter Woods starts with a good background of the breakout from the Normandy beachhead and takes you up the start of the Bulge. Eisenhower gives you a strategic view of the events leading up to the Bulge. He discusses the strategy that the Allies were using against the Germans. His book gives you much more background of the operations before the Bulge than either Toland's or MacDonald's.As this book was written in 1968, the knowledge of the Enigma intercepts was not released yet. Eisenhower is still able to discuss the deception operation that the Germans were able to successfully conduct against the Allies.Once Eisenhower gets to the battle he does a good job of taking you to soldier level battles. MacDonald does a better job but he doesn't set the strategic context as well as Eisenhower. All of these books are detailed enough that they keep you referring to the maps to understand what was happening.Eisenhower also gives more details of other events that happened during and after the the Bulge such as the German offensive Operation Nordwind. Finally Eisenhower shows the strategy that led to the end of the war in Europe.Eisenhower provides many details about the leadership. He personally knew them and his father was able to provide many personal details.While Eisenhower knew both General Omar Bradley and Field Marshall Montgomery, I felt he did a pretty good job of describing the personality conflict between them and did not defer from taking on the issue.If you are looking for a good book on the Battle of Bulge that places it in its historical context, discusses the leadership, and gives you the big view as well as individual actions, the Bitter Woods is the best book of the three."},{"Title":"The bitter woods;: The dramatic story, told at all echelons, from supreme command to squad leader, of the crisis that shook the Western coalition: Hitler's surprise Ardennes offensives,","review":"The detailed account of the Battle of the Bulge is well written and exhaustive.

The only drawback is that at times I found the geography and the various unit displacements hard to follow even with the sector maps provided."},{"Title":"The bitter woods;: The dramatic story, told at all echelons, from supreme command to squad leader, of the crisis that shook the Western coalition: Hitler's surprise Ardennes offensives,","review":"The Bitter Woods is the story of the Battle of the Bulge. Eisenhower succeeds in presenting a clear and concise history of the famed Nazi offensive, though the vastness of the battleground and the number of men involved can make keeping track of the action a daunting task (in defense of the author, neither the huge amounts of men involved, nor my lack of geographical knowledge of Belgium are his fault). Also, he sometimes uses jargon which a non-student of WWII might not know (what is a German burp gun?).Not to sound as if I am damning The Bitter Wood with faint praise, I would like to say what is right with the book. Eisenhower's organization of the facts could not have been done any better. The inclusion of maps of each engagement greatly help the reader follow the action (though a full size fold-out map of the entire theater would have been welcome). Also, his knowledge of the personalities involved (on both sides, and especially Ike's) make the reasons behind the Allied victory easy to understand.Exhaustive without being exhausting, The Bitter Woods is what all historical novels should be."},{"Title":"The bitter woods;: The dramatic story, told at all echelons, from supreme command to squad leader, of the crisis that shook the Western coalition: Hitler's surprise Ardennes offensives,","review":"John S. D. Eisenhower's \\"The Bitter Woods: The Dramatic Story, Told At All Echelons - From Supreme Command to Squad Leader - of the Crisis That Shock the Western Coalition: Hilter's Surprise Ardennes Offensive\\" is a tour-de-force piece of historical literature. As a former WWII junior officer and son of the Supreme Commander, John Eisenhower writes from a solid first (and extremely close second) hand experience as a soldier in the Allied forces that defeated the Axis forces in NW Europe. More than just a former soldier and son of the leader of the armed coalition of victors, Eisenhower emerges with \\"The Bitter Woods\\" as a military historian of the first class. Few accounts of the Battle of the Bulge (as Hitler's Ardennes offensive was oft referred in Allied press accounts and writings since) are as thoroughly researched and broad reaching.Eisenhower starts his book by providing short, but informative, biographies of the top commanders on the Allied and German sides (unnumbered pages in the 1995 DaCapo Press paperback version reviewed here), followed by an insightful Forward (pp. 17-23) in which he describes the genesis of the book and his views on how \\"The Bitter Woods\\" might fit into the literature dedicated to the Bulge. Even if one does not read \\"The Bitter Woods\\" in its entirety the Forward alone is worth a look for budding historians and historical authors as a potential guide to understanding ones own work and its worth.While Eisenhower does not cover in detail the German side of the equation that led to this greatest of American armed conflicts, he is mindful to place the conflict in perspective, both from the Allied and German sides. In fact, 'Book I' of \\"The Bitter Woods\\" (pp. 27-102) covers the event leading up to the Ardennes conflict, minus the actual pre-attack preparations (covered in 'Book II'; see below). He deals with strategic and tactical errors made prior to the battle on both Allied and German sides, and sets the stage for the rest of the book, which represents a detailed accounting of the action from grunt to Ike's command.In 'Book II' (pp. 105-176) Eisenhower details how the Germans prepared for their Ardennes Counteroffensive, and how the Allies missed their chance to snuff the attack before it started. While much of the discussion on the German side remains as valid today as it was when Eisenhower first penned \\"The Bitter Woods\\" in the late '60s, his analysis of Allied blunders might be considered by some to be less thorough. It is fair to point out to readers that when Eisenhower wrote \\"The Bitter Woods\\", Ultra, the Allied deciphering of German coded communications, was still a Western secret and no historian was yet privy to all of the INTEL that the Allies had at the time of the Ardennes Counteroffensive. In this regard if Eisenhower does miss the mark a bit it is not from a failure on his part in researching or writing the book, but rather from the time in which the book was written, relative to what exactly was available in terms of Allied intel reports. Having said all this it is still arguable that even with Ultra intel the Allies still could not have effectively divined Hitler's intentions (while not the overt intention of the book, \\"The Ghost Front\\" by Charles Whiting effectively demonstrates this latter thesis), especially given the Allied mindset that the war was effectively over and the Germans were incapable of mounting a serious offensive, along with the fact that the Germans quite effectively limited use of radio and wire messages during the lead up to D-day (16 December 1944). Thus, in the end despite having a less than complete Allied intel picture, Eisenhower's analyses of Allied blunders are still on fairly solid ground.In 'Books III (pp. 179-257) and IV (pp. 261-375)', Eisenhower gives his prose to a discussion of the bulk of the battle (16-26 Dec). In particular, Eisenhower presents a lucid and moving, not to mention highly readable, account of the initial attack and breakthroughs the Germans achieved in critical sectors of the US V and VIII Corps sectors and the brave stands of pockets of US forces in stemming these initial breakthroughs. Robert Merriam (\\"Dark December\\"), John Toland (\\"Battle of the Bulge\\") and Charles MacDonald (\\"A Time for Trumpets\\") have also done these events justice with their historical writings. When Eisenhower's accounts are added into this mix one gets a quite full account.'Book V' covers the US and Allied (Eisenhower gives fair - not too little and not too much - credit to the contributions of Monty's 21st Army Group) final reduction of the German forces west of the Rhine, as well as a chapter entitled 'The Final Analysis', in which he tries (quite effectively) to place the battle in perspective of the ETO and ultimate defeat of the Axis forces in Europe. Like the 'Forward', this final chapter alone is worth reading on its own independent of the great material that precedes it.In the end \\"The Bitter Woods\\" is a 5 star effort that should be read by ALL interested in the greatest of US Army battles, one that to this day exists in the American conscience."},{"Title":"The bitter woods;: The dramatic story, told at all echelons, from supreme command to squad leader, of the crisis that shook the Western coalition: Hitler's surprise Ardennes offensives,","review":"I have read Col John Eisenhower's book and found it rather interesting.

Those looking for a David Glantz-like, academic study of the campaign should pass this one by. Eisenhower is a very skilled writer, and his description of the first weeks of the German offensive is very well done.The book does have some problems. Being the son of the former commander of the ETO and President, Eisenhower had access to interview for his research many of the top commanders who fought in the battle. However, that strength could also be a weakness because most of those commanders interviewed were friends and comrades of his father. Thus, Eisenhower is rarely if ever critical of any of the commanders despite the fact that serious errors were made on the eve of the campaign on the part of the American high command. Also the book is full of GI slang such as \\"burp guns,\\" which may have been recognizable to readers in the early 60's, but not so in the 21st century."},{"Title":"The bitter woods;: The dramatic story, told at all echelons, from supreme command to squad leader, of the crisis that shook the Western coalition: Hitler's surprise Ardennes offensives,","review":"Deception in the Bulge!\\"The Bitter Woods: The Battle of the Bulge\\" by John Eisenhower covers the contribution of deception to the success of the German's Ardennes offensive is discussed.

On the one hand his own activities were restricted by lower level officers not wanting to accept the risk that Ike's kid was killed or captured. At the same time he had more access to much higher ranking individuals than would the normal low ranking officer. This included the ability to meet with people like Patton, Bradley, Montgomery and so on. This was an ideal situation for a budding historian.The Battle of the Bulge was the biggest battle ever fought by the U.S. Army. During the battle the Army lost 20,000 killed, 20,000 captured, 40,000 wounded. This was more casualties than the total number of men in the Army of Northern Virginia at Gettysburg.This story begins on day one of the battle, backs up a bit to give some understanding of how things came to be, tells a detailed story covering every level from commander to squad leader, and wraps up with the aftereffects of the battle.

The word examination is used rather than....as stated on the book cover \\"the dramatic story\\"..of that battle since it tends to read like a military report and/or college thesis rather than a thrilling historical non-fiction book. The author somehow manages to drain any drama from the story at all and frequently makes it dull. No mean feat. He also starts his story way too early in the European theater at the Normandy invasion and then continuing long past the end of the battle to the German Surrender on May 7, 1945. The battle does not start until page 179 and, after it ends on page 430, he still natters on until page 469.Though he seems a bit to preoccupied with demonstrating how wondeful dad was, the book is still a highly detailed if dizzyingly so description of the admittedly gigantic battle and is certainly a required research source for anyone interested in the nuts and bolts of what happened.But for \\"the dramatic story\\", this is not the place to go.Recommended with that understood."},{"Title":"The bitter woods;: The dramatic story, told at all echelons, from supreme command to squad leader, of the crisis that shook the Western coalition: Hitler's surprise Ardennes offensives,","review":"I have read this book several times and each time find something I missed the previous times.

The book was published in French as &quot;Delivrez Promethee,&quot; in 1978. If, like the author, your interests run a gamut of the arts and sciences, you will probably find this a very interesting read. (Otherwise-- or if you've discarded your open-mindedness-- you may not.)In a nutshell, the theme of the book is that life, via mankind, is at an epochal crossroads, in which our current false conceptions are leading to an ecological apocalypse-- a trial by fire, in which the human race will evolve to the next stage or else perish in an inferno arising from an accumulation of our falsehood and folly. Or, to put it another way-- from Nature's view-- we will shortly be either ending up as another one of evolution's deadends, or else we will be moving on to the next stage (a description of which the author generously provides).Along the way, Deshusses leads the reader through an absorbing, and very ingenious, investigation of a dazzling range of human ideation and institutions, including physics, cybernetics, linguistics, philosophy, art, law, literature, psychoanalysis, myth, commerce &amp; industry, nationhood, sex, and religion, in order to establish the plausibility of his thesis. If you follow the thread of &quot;The Eighth Night of Creation&quot; or not-- and whether you agree with its author's theories either some, a little, or not at all-- you will come away from this book with a revised conception of many things you thought you knew and a gratifying awareness of much you may have, so far, never considered. A lot to enjoy in 405 pages!The book is certainly not for everyone, though. Its occasional flights into semi-mystical language, its unstinting cleverness of phrase and poetic fervor, its assumption that the reader already have a basic familiarity with many details of the subject matter, and its tendency to venture into philosphical abstruseness-- all these features of the book undoubtedly kept much of the reading public at a safe distance.Too, since most of the &quot;false conceptions&quot; Deshusses takes to task are my and your nearest and dearest commonplaces and consolations, it's not surprising that the book is out-of-print and greatly neglected. Yet, it is a real marvel and may be one of the most thought provoking books of now limited availability!"},{"Title":"The Eighth Night of Creation","review":"I cannot agree more with the previous reviewer. Decades ago, I first heard about this book when listening to an interview of J. Deshusses in French on Belgian radio. When asked what other book he was planning to write he answered he had no intention of writing another book because he'd said all he had to say in The Eighth Night of Creation. What answer could be more blunt and more honest than that? I've read tons of books in my life, but this one changed my outlook on life for good. There are not many books which can do that. Why then is it and its (now dead?) Swiss author virtually forgotten? Probably because unlike other books of ideas, this one does not set out to substitute one lie for another. It does not criticize one system to propose another (but equally flawed) one. It does not censure one aspect of the social order to better thurify another. Quote: \\"If you want to fight the Leviathan, you must fight Leviathan as a whole and not just a part of it\\". The book is scathing towards religions but equally so towards communism and consumerism. It puts its faith in science and technology but has only harsh words for the destruction of the environment which it regards as both an unspeakable crime and a threat to the survival of the human race. It denounces modern art and psychoanalysis as scams. It regards the ban on marihuana as typical of a hypocritical and alcoholic Society. It considers the Family as nothing less than the root of all social injustice. I am mostly a reader of fiction and I set very high standards to a work of non-fiction before I consider it worthy of my time. Indeed, most non-fiction books bore me one third into them. But this one is so full of insights that it comes as close to being a page-turner as any non-fiction book can. I hope that one day this book will be republished and take its rightful place as THE classic of 20th century thought."},{"Title":"Wiggle Your Toes","review":"We love Karen Katz books! Our 18m old has enjoyed all of the lift-flap-books from a very early age. Plus, who can resist \\"Counting Kisses\\"?That being said... this book is disappointing! My child has many lift-the-flap books and she's gentle with every one of them.On the very first page, the arm \\"swings\\" to point to a nose and my child always expects it to fold open like all other flap books (it's barely hanging on now). The next page has 10 toes that \\"wiggle\\", but the flaps are so tiny they are impossible for little fingers to pry up (do we expect our toddlers to use their fingernails?). The \\"pull the ears\\" page is the most ridiculous. The mechanism makes it look like there's a flap under the baby's chin, so of course, my child lifted that flap and proceeded to tear the page by accident.I'm definitely a proponent of children learning new motor skills, but this wasn't what I had in mind during storytime!"},{"Title":"Wiggle Your Toes","review":"I love all of Karen Katz's books, but this one gave us problems.

We recently bought \\"Wiggle Your Toes\\" and I was slightly disappointed by it, mainly because it seemed geared towards a child older than two. As is typical in Katz's books, each page has some sort of hands-on flap or tactile item; however, several of them are not as easy to manipulate as the simple flaps in many of her other books. Within the first hour of owning the book, my daughter had ripped off the movable arm on the first page, and within a week or so had also ripped the 3-D arm on the last page of the book. She hadn't been rough with the flaps in the book but it seems they are better suited for an older child who can move them more smoothly and easily.

(I had noticed immediately how careful we needed to be with it and would never leave the book on a table or the floor where she could reach it herself.) But then I realized it wasn't them or my daughter at all... the arm on the \\"point to your nose\\" fell apart first. I've tried carefully taping it tons of times, but it continues to fall off. Then the arm on the last page fell off (again, more tape!), and the last straw was when the bottom of the cover to the book fell off.

It was so engrossing, I could not put it down-- it is interesting because it involves real people --the author's description of his own life-story and struggle from agnosticism to a clearer understanding of the mysteries of faith. What makes the book interesting is that the author weaves a presentation using sometimes seemingly disjointed pieces of knowledge into an integrated view of a point which sheds light on a mystery of the Christian faith. The book was written in the 1920's and re-issued again in 1994. It is most entertaining because it describes the struggle of an individual with the articles of faith. It is a book that will satisfy both the orthodox for the clarity (certainty) of the arguments, and the liberal mind because it is non-judgmental -- an extraordinary feat! In addition, the book is interesting because it provides the reader with a view of some key issues of doctrine and faith Christians were struggling with at the end of last century and the beginning of this one. It certainly helped me gain an appreciation for the struggles mainland Protestant churches, as well as the Catholic Church is currently experiencing with their congregation and clergy. The author organizes the chapters by postulating individual difficulties of faith he faced, and then proceeds to show how he resolved some of the conundrums. He gave excellent references to support his arguments. The English prose is superb; the logic used to tackle the difficulties posed is impeccable; the arguments, tight. After reading the book I could understand why Christianity has survived two thousand years. When all the arguments fall in place like weaving a complex tapestry, one can appreciate that while certain truths are not self evident, those seeking it with persistence and an open mind, will eventually find it. I would recommend this book to anyone who is seriously interested in understanding the tenets of the Christian faith, or want to understand why Christians believe what they believe. The book is engrossing."},{"Title":"Rebuilding a lost faith","review":"I found this book in a rummage sale of books and recommended that TAN reprint it.

I recommend it to anyone but remember that it was originally written early in this century, so it is from a different time and perspective on religion in America."},{"Title":"Rebuilding a lost faith","review":"The author explores his troubled journey from sincere Protestant seminarian to full-fledged agnostic and finally to a devout Catholic. While the book was published in 1922, its themes and ideas are as fresh as if they were written yesterday. It clarifies why Protestants seem to have a deep-seeded dislike for anything Catholic and the Pope, specifically, whom they reject as Vicar of Christ. Stoddard emphasizes that, in the case of Protestants, it's not the person, it's the message which creates havoc in matters of theology. At one point in the book, the author lists all the Protestant sects he could think of (several pages). This is not anti-Protestant, rather, it looks tenderly at the inheritors of Protestant traditions. He is not so kind regarding the instigators of the Protestant Reformation. He also explores Catholic traditions and theology (Pre-Vatican II); particularly things that Catholics accept and simply do as these practices have been handed down over the past 2,000 years. Whether one agrees with his conclusions or not, his perspective is refreshing."},{"Title":"The Marketing Audit: Translating Marketing Theory into Practice (Marketing Series: Practitioner)","review":"This book bridges a gap between the theory of markting and its every day practice."},{"Title":"The passionate people; what it means to be a Jew in America","review":"This is a panoramic survery of American Jewry. Kahn is a first- rate journalist best- known for his work on baseball, \\"The Boys of Summer\\". And this work also includes a chapter on sport on the Jewish relation to sports. The best part of this and one of the highlights of the book is Kahn's interview with former Cleveland home-run slugger Al Rosen in a Bache brokerage office. Rosen tells the story of his struggle to become a major- leaguer and also tells a tale of his encounters with Anti- Semitism. His toughness and courage are apparent. And he makes for one of the best interview- stories in the book.Kahn provides throughout the book stories of individual Jews from all different walks of life. He intersperses with the interviews general observations about the Jewish relation to the particular field of endeavor. Here I feel he could have done a bit more in regard to Jewish cultural creators, writers, artists scientists academics.He presents in the course of the work the historical story of the Jewish people in America. He echoes the theme of works similar to this one that America has been the greatest land of opportunity for Jews.The book was published over thirty- five years ago as of my writing here, and is a bit dated. It touches upon the problem of assimilation but has no sense of how acute a problem this is going to become. It does not foresee the 'orthodox revival' in America . Nor does it speak about the greying of the general American or especially Jewish population.It is however an outstanding piece of journalism, well - researched and written with great verve.A truly fine book which still today provides much insight into the American Jewish community."},{"Title":"Lights, camera, action!: A guide to video instruction and production in the classroom","review":"This book appears simple and also shows a multitude of sall activities that students who are beginners in the world of video production (and range from 15-20 yrs) can cover easily.

While I expected it to be full of useful words, and it was, nothing prepared me for how beautifully the illustrations were laid out on the page, with rich color and lovely presentation. Words are grouped by topic and do provide a good language resource, I think - one of my newer ELLs was keeping it underneath his desk for easy access. This would be even more useful with younger children (I teach fourth grade)."},{"Title":"The Life of Forms in Art","review":"Although I ultimately disagree with most of this book, I would neverthless wholeheartedly recommend it to anybody trying to think through the issue of form in art. What is form? How do forms evolve? What is the relationship between forms and space/ time? In particular this book begins from the curious problem of how, while individual artists do not conceive of their work as a develpment of existing forms, nevertheless, viewed historically, forms do seem to have their own life, their own temporality. How do we account for this. Focillon's prose is limpid and occasionally poetic, in an almost Proustian way. I loved reading this book."},{"Title":"The Life of Forms in Art","review":"I found a fascinating quote from this book while reading Dufrenne's The Phenomenology of Aesthetic Experience. Reading the glowing reviews here on Amazon, I reckoned myself in for a real treat. How wrong I was. I found it extremely dull and lacking any real substance beyond \\"beautiful sentences\\". If, as I suspect by the final essay In Praise of Hands, Focillon fancied himself a 20th century Friedrich Schiller, then frankly he simply doesn't measure up in my opinion. He frequently makes assertions and then claims there isn't time to explain or discuss it in detail. Many of his musings are filtered through a strong affection for French Romanesque/Medieval/Gothic art, especially architecture, which seemed fairly limiting for the scope of his ambitions. My curiosity aroused, an internet search turned up Focillon's biographical information on The Dictionary of Art Historians website. Focillon's academic credentials are undeniably impressive; I've given an extra star in consideration of that, but really this is a one star book as far as I'm concerned. I was surprised at how very familiar I was with the authors/historians associated with Focillon: W&ouml;lfflin (Principles of Art History, The Sense of Form in Art, Classic Art, Renaissance and Baroque), Von Hildebrand (The Problem of Form in Painting and Sculpture), Riegl (Problems of Style, Historical Grammar of the Visual Arts, The Origins of Baroque Art in Rome); all of the works I have listed in parentheses I have read. But then I noticed in the article a characterization of Focillon's methodology that I thought was telling: non-analytical and subjective. I would certainly have to agree with that characterization. However, the article also describes him as a formalist, which makes no sense to me, because even though Focillon writes about \\"form\\", he denies that there is any real distinction between form and subject matter (p. 95), and places emphasis upon \\"sociological conditions\\" (p.154, which to me suggests the influence of Marxist aesthetics). If there is any preponderance of an actual theoretical/methodological approach in this book, in my opinion it would be semiotics, a real bust as far as I'm concerned when used as a visual art methodology. After looking at the reviews again, I suspect this book is intended for, or appears to be far more significant for, those with a general interest in humanities (as hinted at on the back cover) or those with a particular academic interest in literature and literary theory, and is offered as a kind of synapse into visual art (in contrast to the more visual art specific and in-depth work of a true formalist like W&ouml;lfflin). That would certainly explain a previous reviewer's \\"thrill of beautiful sentences\\" such as \\"Their very immobility sparkles with metamorphosis\\"."},{"Title":"The Life of Forms in Art","review":"This book is indispensable to anyone who wants to understand art and begin to comprehend its inevitable intricacies. It is an agreeable blend of art, its history and philosophy. The author explains his positions in crystal clear form and shows many of the myriad relationships among form itself and imagery. He almost always writes well-informed by an understanding of techniques and materials. The English edition requires more concentration than the French version which is eloquent."},{"Title":"The Life of Forms in Art","review":"One of the most influential books in art history, The Life of Forms in Art is nonetheless horribly tedious. It was originally written in French, which is reportedly much more lucid. However, if your background in art historical study is strong, it is imperative that you understand Focillon's thesis. But I must tell you, I am a first year undergraduate at Yale, and I had to read it three times before some degree of understanding crept in; my graduate student TA read it twice!

As is the case in nearly all of Sally Watson's historical novels, the protagonist has a significant character flaw--here, a vicious temper--that she learns to overcome, in the course of which she also manages to do some good and find chaste romance. Okay, it's a formula--but a formula that works, and is bedecked with lively prose, believable characters, and plenty of humor. FYI, a small publishing company has reissued this and other Watson novels in paperback, so there's no need to pay the exorbitant prices of the used-book sellers unless you're a collector."},{"Title":"Mistress Malapert","review":"It just kills me that my favorite book from my adolescent years is no longer on the library shelves. Maybe it makes me feel a little better when I hear the've actually been stolen from said shelves, though that means really high prices when I find them used, here. As the earlier reader said, thank heaven that Image Cascade books has all of Sally's older books in new, shiny paperbacks.Mistress Malapert was, and I think still is, my favorite of Sally's historical novels for young people, because it sets a believable tone for the story and makes the Elizabethan era instantly identifiable to readers, today. Her heroine, Valerie, drives her family to distraction with her wilful ways. Completely outrageous, flying into tantrums when crossed, yet altogether sincere and charming when trying to make up. When she doesn't wish to stay with her uncle's family for the summer, as he is determined to tame her, she cuts her hair, dresses as a boy and runs away to join the theater!The book teaches a good bit about the era, the colorful world of Shakespeare's stage, of how different the clothes and life styles were then, and also how, essentially, things remain the same. No man, or teenager, is an island, and you have to give a little to get along in life, happily. Still lessons we can learn from today, and enjoy a rollicking good story along the way."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Italian (CD): Learn Italian While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"I have to say I was reluctant to purchase this because it was such a reasonable priced language cd but I am so glad I did.

I listened a lot while driving and was well prepared for my first and second trips to Italy, at least in being able to get around and ask questions and understand the answers. A lot of Italians assumed by what I said that I was fully conversant and knew more than I actually did!I liked that there was variety in the way the information was presented - first the conversation in Italian spoken fairly rapidly, followed by the words, translation of the conversation, repeat the dialogue, answer questions based on the lesson, etc. so the information was repeated several times but in different ways so as not to be boring or tedious. I preferred it to Pimsleur, which seemed just to repeat the same words over and over to the point of being annoying and some others which I found not at all helpful. I would definitely recommend this series to someone wanting to get a good start in learning to speak Italian, especially for travelers who do not feel the need to become fully conversational in Italian."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Italian (CD): Learn Italian While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"Recently got this to learn some italian.

The 1st disc, however, uses words related only to driving -- car, bus, motorcycle, large, small, colors, etc. -- that arene't too usefule day to day. I also find it is dangerous for me to try to learn while driving because my attention is taken from the road. This may be my own personal learning style, but I don't recommend drive-learning. Also, I do need to see the written word before I can assimilate it.

Following that disc however, the speakers do not repeat, and the pace is very quick. In additon, the instructor uses technical terms such as 'the infinitive' out of a context to provide support for adult learners who have been away from formal schooling for awhile. The lessons need to be done more slowly, and with much more repetition. The Italian and the English version should be used together so that the learner knows what is being said, and the progress the learner is making. I am very disappointed in this set of CDs and believe they were not worth the money I paid."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Italian (CD): Learn Italian While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"This my first review on Amazon but I was compelled to write based on my experience with this course. The first CD is fantastic. It starts off slow and gives you a solid foundation to build upon as you move from lesson to lesson. Within a few weeks of driving back and forth to work I had mastered all the lessons on the CD and could easily translate the English phrases in the final review lesson into Italian. I was confident and had a good grasp on building sentences and nuances such as how words changed when the subject was masculine or feminine. My opinion is that most people write their review based on the first CD.And then I put in the second CD. I thought there was some mistake, as if I had switched to a completely different Italian course. The slow, clear speaking narrators were gone and replaced with fast talking Italians who didn't repeat anything, and certainly didn't give you time to repeat in the pause. The assumption appeared to be that I already understood the language and this was merely a refresher course. Within ten minutes I knew this was no longer the course for me. I listened to the entire second CD just in case this was all a joke and at some point they would slow down and actually help me learn Italian. No such luck! I have gone back to using the first CD for practice while I wait for the Pimsleur Italian course to arrive."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Italian (CD): Learn Italian While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"This CD set is excellent! I recently took a semester of beginning Italian and this tape serves to reinforce what I've learned as well as prepare me for the next level course.

I recommend this set to anyone wanting to improve on their speaking the Italian language and sustaining their knowledge of the language between subsequent course taking."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Italian (CD): Learn Italian While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"The entire playing time of this set is 4 hours, so the time is fairly limited. There are a pretty good amount of words introduced and the speakers are very good - they enunciate well.I think there could have been more exercises, that would be my only gripe, plus it's a little bit overpriced in my opinion (around $15). The booklet that comes with it is good and covers all the words learned on the disks."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Italian (CD): Learn Italian While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"I've had this CD for about 2 weeks now. My husband and I got this to prepare for our trip to Italy in a couple months. He is a native Spanish speaker and I was a minored in Spanish in college. Knowing Spanish has really come to our advantage in learning Italian. We have been listening to this everyday in the car without any radio or music. It's so fun to learn that sometimes we find ourselves taking the longer route home so we can listen to more of the lessons.CD1 was basic, but still very challenging. We listened to the CD1 for about a week. The key is to listen to the lessons over and over again. We must have listened to each lesson at least 10 times to make it really sink in. You learns pronunciations, colors, basic vocabulary and a lot of feminine/masculine grammar rules.CD2 was quite a shock since the Italian is spoken at a much faster pace. It covers more everday conversational Italian that you would find in a restaurant or the airport as well as the alphabet and numbers. Again, the key is to repeat the lessons over and over again.Just after 2 weeks, I feel that my husband and I have had good progress in learning Italian. With less than 8 weeks until our trip I am confident that we can get by on the basic Italian that we have learned."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Italian (CD): Learn Italian While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"My husband is Italian and lived in Italy for 2 years.

The first CD is marvelous just like the other reviewers said. From then on, some lessons are very helpful for the tourist, some less helpful. I listen to each lesson over and over because they allow very little time for repitition. Whereas on the first cd they repeated things 3 times which was a lot, in the second and subsequent cd they give you only once chance to practice a word, phrase or sentence. The grammar lessons get a little hard going as well. The two native speakers, a man and a woman, have slightly different ways of saying things which is helpful to hear. All in all I recommend this for someone who needs to learn some key things in Italian for a trip."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Italian (CD): Learn Italian While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"I have purchased other teach your self courses in Italian and this is the best one I've heard. It starts out slow and even though some people say it speeds up and gets too fast, it still keeps a slow pace with the Italian. If you think this CD is too fast, try taking a trip to Italy and talking to one of the locals. The English speaking people in this course are very soft spoken with easily tolerable voices and the Italian speakers speak very clearly. I went through the first two CD's in just a couple of days and have been on the third one for about two weeks. I already can put together basic sentences and can interpret most spoken Italian.

There's no time to repeat after they say things. There's no way you can learn this without a book to see what words they are actually saying. Everything rolls together so fast you can't tell what the words sound like. It's quite ridiculous actually. Going back to my Pimsleur discs. They are much better. I really don't understand how this got rated so high. You really need an Italian foundation to understand this after the first disc."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Italian (CD): Learn Italian While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"I had a difficult time deciding between a 2 and 3 star rating for this product. I settled on a 3 only because I realize this is meant for a beginner and I have been studying Italian for 4 months. Also, for the price what you are getting isn't terrible, just could have been much better. Anyway, what I don't like about this product:-There is a ton of spoken english on the CDs, more english than italian. I was hoping for something that would help me get used to hearing people speak in italian but there are only short phrases (haven't gotten to disc 4 yet) followed by someone speaking for a fairly long time in english explaining the grammar. Ugh. Ok for a classroom or if I'm reading at home, but while I'm focused on traffic I have a hard time focusing on grammar. Also, once I've heard the grammar rule explained a few times, it is a waste to have to listen to it over and over again in english while I'm trying to internalize the spoken italian sections. I would have preferred more of the sections where they have a short conversation entirely in italian spoken fairly quickly (as it will be in italy) followed by each peice of the conversation broken down more slowly and translated into english.-They have a weird number and letter system for the sections that don't have anything to do with the CD track number. How do they expect me to remember where section 7c is on the CD while I'm driving? Not a big deal but just unnecessary.-The car horn noise they use between sections is pretty loud compared to the speaking volume and really annoying.What I do like is the selection of topics they cover. Most of it is very relevant for an adult tourist. Also, I didn't think disc 2 was that much faster than disc 1 as other reviewers have commented. Sure, there are bits where it is fast, but they usually follow it with a slower breakdown, and again you will need to be able to listen to someone talking fast in italy so get used to it."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Italian (CD): Learn Italian While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"I am an intermediate level Italian learner who bought this set mainly to keep my skills fresh.

But Shoptaw is not just a patient and scrupulous researcher; he is also, quite simply, one of the most brilliant and persuasive poetry readers I've ever encountered. Every chapter is full of revelations--this is a book to be read slowly and savored, bit by bit. Every reader will have personal favorites; some of mine are the stunning analysis of \\"The Nut Brown Maid\\" (constructed, Shoptaw shows, from discarded manuscript fragments) and the wonderfully textured reading of \\"Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror,\\" a poem I think I hardly was reading at all until I read it again with Shoptaw as my guide.It's also worth noting that Shoptaw was the first critic to bring Ashbery's homosexuality into the story, not as a \\"hidden content\\" but as something that helps shape what Shoptaw terms Ashbery's \\"misrepresentative poetics.\\" I often find other versions of this kind of criticism vulgarly reductive, but Shoptaw's readings, even when they draw on Ashbery's biography, always hold up--probably because it is so clear that it is Ashbery's poetry, not his life, that is Shoptaw's real subject.In short, this book provides an unsurpassed introduction to Ashbery: learned, subtle, and intelligent (and engagingly written to boot). My main caveat is that it is not suitable for anyone looking for the one key that will all at once unlock Ashbery's difficult and protean poetry. Though theoretically informed, Shoptaw's study does not cleave to any single perspective or agenda; theory serves reading rather than the reverse. Indeed, like its notoriously elusive subject, the book is simultanously conservative and avant garde--as one might deduce from the back cover, which carries enthusiastic blurbs from both Harold Bloom and Charles Bernstein."},{"Title":"On the Outside Looking Out: John Ashbery's Poetry","review":"I am doing extensive research for my master's thesis on Ashbery and this was by far the worst resource I could have invested in. My main complaint is that this book lacked coherence, though it seemed to have done thorough research. It did not clearly articulate ideas, but rather used every opportunity to quote fragments and attribute random details rather than clearly get at the heart of Ashbery's poetry. I found no useful arguments and it was very difficult to get through to what the author was saying. Very disappointed."},{"Title":"On the Outside Looking Out: John Ashbery's Poetry","review":"I am alas an ordinary reader and I was curious to see what this Ashbery fuss was all about. I found Ashbery's poetry to be quite obscure and thought Shoptaw's book might help me make some sense of it. I was greatly disappointed. The book was clearly a tour de force of rank archanery. Shoptaw seems quite impressed with his ability to dazzle us with obscure jargon but it left me baffled. In the end I was no closer to understanding or appreciating Ashbery. To write that the \\"cryptographic process is indecipherable\\" is itself on the very face of it patently indecipherable. This book may impress fellow members of his academic cult but it did not speak to me and,I venture to guess, other ordinary readers."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"This is an incredible book about real friendship,chastity and honesty written in the most humorous fashion.Fielding brings out the true values of friendship beteween Parson Adams and Joseph and true love between the latter and Funny.He points out the sad but true &quot;false&quot; nature of the upper class and brings out questions about real life.I like this book because it encourages chastity and esteems honesty."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"The prize of this novel is the ability of the author to actually poke fun at his own readers...Fielding encourages us to stop, take a break at each short chapter; at some points he even laments that certain passages aren't worth reading, and just skipping over them would lose nothing in the reader's understanding of the content. This of course, works for us in that it makes us more prone to envelop ourselves in every chapter, following the always clumsy journey and comic circumstance of Parson Adams and Joseph Andrews. The journey from country to city is a prevalent theme in the novel, and through these distinctions, we are able to pinpoint the nuanced comedy Fielding finds in living in his own time period. To understand this you must put yourself inside of the 18th century, and more helpful would be to read the novel that this book is a parody of, \\"Pamela\\". Fielding challenges the notions of love and chastity in his time in a hysterical way; that is, if you can follow the winding text and dated grammar....But what a great book. Really."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"Second only to Voltaire'sCandide: Or Optimism (Penguin Classics), Henry Fielding's Joseph Andrews is the funniest, most intelligent, satirical commentary I've ever read. Actually, let's get rid of the qualifiers, Joseph Andrews is one of the two funniest books I've ever read. (I first read it in college and it introduced me to the idea that important old books could also be highly entertaining, interesting, and illuminating.)The book was first published in 1742 under the title \\"The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews, and of His Friend Mr. Abraham Adams\\" to some controversy. Fielding did not hesitate to poke merciless fun at just about everything 'respectable': religion, the law, lords and ladies, and sexual mores. Fielding attacked the moral hypocrisy of Joseph Richardson's popularPamela: Or Virtue Rewarded (Oxford World's Classics). (Fielding also wrote a short work, Shamela, that was a direct response to Pamela. Shamela is often sold together with Joseph Andrews See e.g.,Joseph Andrews and Shamela (Penguin Classics).) Pamela created a huge literary controversy; Shamela and Joseph Andrews were just two of many mocking responses, although few others survive (see, e.g.Anti-Pamela and Shamela).Joseph (who is Pamela's brother!) is a genial but nave rustic and a footman in the service of Lady Booby (wink, wink, nudge, nudge). When Joseph rejects her very direct and bawdy advances, Lady Booby sends him packing. Joseph then begins walking home from London to the country to seek out (and marry) Fanny Goodwill, his lifelong sweetheart. Along the way he meets his hometown friend the amiable and forgetful Parson Abraham Adams. Parson Adams is on his way to London to sell his sermons for publication. When Adams discovers he has forgotten to pack said sermons, he and Joseph decide to travel home together. The trip is the departure point for many adventures and mishaps that expose the society's hypocrisy and inequities. Along the way, the reader meets many colorful characters whose pretensions often land them in dire circumstances - furnishing much hilarity to us.Fielding purported to aim at nothing less the invention of a new literary form, the \\"comic epic-poem in prose\\". He says in his Preface, \\"it may not be improper to premise a few words concerning this kind of writing, which I do not remember to have seen hitherto attempted in our language.\\" Fielding, however, was also known to write 'serio-comic', ironic introductions to his works, so some caution is in order. Nonetheless, the Preface accurately describes his \\"comic epic-poem in prose\\" as \\"differing from comedy, as the serious epic from tragedy: its action being more extended and comprehensive; containing a much larger circle of incidents, and introducing a greater variety of characters. It differs from the serious romance in its fable and action, in this: that as in the one these are grave and solemn, so in the other they are light and ridiculous; it differs in its characters, by introducing persons of inferiour rank, and consequently of inferiour manners, whereas the grave romance sets the highest before us; lastly in its sentiments and diction; by preserving the ludicrous instead of the sublime.\\"Absolutely the highest possible recommendation."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"I bought this book for one of my literature classes at the beginning of the term (It was the last book on the syllabus) because it was only available online and no longer in printing production. The book arrived late compared to when it was supposed to arrive ( I live in OR and the book was coming from CA). Other than that, I was satisfied with my purchase overall."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"Henry Fielding has written a very funny novel that attacks the hypocrisy and vanity of the times (around 1740's London). Just about every character in the novel suffers from one or both of these traits. The barbs the author throws at these characters are often hilarious. His writing style is a treasure, and his sentence structure is overloaded (lots of commas, semicolons, dashes, etc. in his sentences). Furthermore, the author quite readily goes off on very long tangents.For example, the main characters Joseph Andrews, his friend Parson Adams, and Joseph's love Fanny, happen upon the home of a very noble gentleman. The book then goes and liberally describes the history of this man they met - which really has nothing to do with the novel (at least at the time it occurs). Now that I think about it, this wasn't an unnecessary tangent, as it has meaning at the very end of the novel.Nonetheless, there are many instances in the novel where the main character happen upon someone, or someplace, and all of the sudden we are fully thrust into this direction that takes us away from the simple journey of these characters. This stream of consciousness is seen in the later novels of Thomas Pynchon - and this is important to me as Pynchon is one of my favorite authors. As I read the novel, I really felt a strong presence of Pynchon's novel \\"Mason and Dixon\\".Now, Fielding writes in a very fluent, and complex dialogue which I found a little easier to read in a flowing way than I felt with Pynchon. His flowery wording perfectly describes scenes, people, and attitudes, and the laughs are much funnier with his writing style than if told straight up.Everyone is exposed as a hypocrite or quite vain, except for Joseph Andrews himself. It's evident that the author uses him as a paradigm for how to behave in this world. Parson Adams comes a close second, but even he suffers from some of the things he preaches against. Fanny doesn't really do much but look pretty and serves primarily as Joseph's love interest - although I believe the author indicates that she is very virtuous.The primary plot of the novel involves a journey by Joseph and Parson Adams, and the adventures they get into along the way. Near the end of the novel, it shifts focus to some elderly ladies who fancy Joseph to the degree that they lose all sense of propriety in trying to have him. Additionally, the supposed gentlemen of their relation desire to have Fanny. If I had to hazard a guess, I would say the author is indicating that the only people who are good enough for either Fanny or Joseph are Joseph and Fanny, as they seem to be the only ones lacking in either vanity or hypocrisy. Additionally, each of those two hold onto their virginity, waiting for their impending marriage (which is not a sure thing as the novel shows).The ending of the novel allows for what the author promises at the beginning of the novel, and that is in the realm of the ridiculous. This part of the novel - I don't want to say much - had to be the inspiration for some of our situational comedies of today.Please read this novel, if for no other reason, because it can be screamingly funny in parts - I laughed out loud in several places.As a last note, the themes addressed by Fielding are very relevant today, so this novel has a certain timelessness to it - but just know that it does occur in the 1740's, so there will be some things common to that time which are unusual to someone not acquainted with London in that time period. But the writing is so good and easy to understand, that I don't think it will be much of a problem."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"Henry Fielding wrote one of the great comic novels in Tom Jones. Joseph Andrews is similar in nature but falls far short of Fielding's, masterpiece. The book starts out well enough. A handsome, viral young man of low birth (Andrews) is placed in the family of Lord and Lady Booby. The mistress takes a fancy to Andrews and makes him her footman. Lord Booby dies and the lady tries to force her affections on poor Joseph. Being virtuous, as well as attractive to the opposite sex, he refuses her advances and is promptly dismissed. Joseph then sets out to London to meet his true love, Fanny, and along the way joins up with his mentor, Parson Adams, a kind of Don Quixote character complete with a stumbling horse. Before too long Fanny joins the retinue. A good start.But Fielding gets into trouble because he can't seem to make up his mind as to who his protagonist is. As Joseph begins his journey he is set upon by a group of robbers, beaten, and left naked in a ditch. A coach comes by and the passengers debate whether or not to save him. At last, persuaded that if they did not try they might be liable to be sued for his death they agree to take him up. But a \\"lady\\" riding inside the coach refuses to allow a naked man to be placed beside her. There then ensues a debate over who will give their coat to cover Joseph. This depiction is both humorous and a telling commentary of British values in the first half of the eighteenth century. But Andrews it seems is too staid and pure to be the target of the kind low slapstick comedy that Fielding has in mind, thus much of the remainder of the book focuses on the adventures and foibles of the good parson. Joseph is reduced to the role of defender of Fanny and the parson from various assaults on their person and character.Fielding also goes off on tangents such as the story of Leonora, Mr. Wilson's life history and the tale told by the parson's son toward the end of the book. Fielding's intent is to display some aspects of the social mores of the times, but these asides distract from the flow of the story. At the end of the book Mr. Wilson's history does, in fact, come to play an important part in the story, but the others are mere sidebars to the action. One interesting diversion does occur when Fielding, as an author talking directly to the reader, interjects into the story to provide a rationale for why books are divided into chapters.Finally, after a series of humorous and often outrageous adventures Joseph, Fanny and Parson Adams return home and face a new series of problems when Lady Booby re-enters the picture and continues her pursuit of Joseph. At his point other characters including Joseph's sister, Pamela and her husband, Mr. Booby (Lady Booby's nephew), a pedlar, an obsequious character, Beau Didapper who lusts after Fanny, the elder Mr. and Mrs. Andrews and finally Mr. and Mrs. Wilson add to the complications. This section of the book is filled with rollicking humor (including a wonderful scene where Parson Adams mistakes Mrs. Slipslop for a man and battles with her in bed and then wanders into Fanny's bed where he is discovered by Joseph), mystery, and problematic situations (including the possibility that Joseph and Fanny are really brother and sister!), until after a tortuous series of events all ends well with even Lady Booby finding love, or at least lust.I give the book four stars because it really is not on a par with the great comic novels. But it is a fun and enjoyable read. Joseph Andrews is a humorous book and Fielding provides a look at the foibles and character of various English types in his era. The book is well worth reading even though it falls short of the great pieces of satire and humorous literature."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"This is a fine work both to allow the reader insight into England in the 18th century away from court and cathedral, and to provide a peek into the early invention of the English novel.Fielding's characters paint a vivid picture of how well, or how poorly, people reside within their assigned class levels. Parson Adams, though often playing the naive fool, establishes an expectation of noble Christian behaviour against which Fielding's 'Canterbury Tale'-like characters can be measured. At the same time, Fielding uses Adams to allow the title character to evolve from the pure innocent, who falls into difficulty, to become resurrected as the fully realized, real-life hero.As a story of life among the lower and middle classes, this is a fine read. But I found the brilliant, excellent construction of this novel to be a real eye-opener as far as the development of the early novel is concerned."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"This book was assigned to me in my British Literature class for a book club. Shortly after being assigned this book, I quickly went out and began reading it. While Fielding's writing style does seem to run on a bit, his narrative wit and dialogue is enjoyable.I found myself liking the three main characters, Parson Adams in particular. He told some interesting stories, and has kind of an older brother relationship with Joesph, making him a good side character. The brief moments of action were pretty good in the story, as were the humorous bits. Its easy to see why this novel will go down as one a classic in literature."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"Henry Fielding wrote SHAMELA for the best of all reasons: he needed the money. The fact that Richardson's earlier PAMELA had been begging for burlesque in its absurdities and pretensions can be seen only as a contributory reason. In his preface, Fielding makes it clear that he has placed Richardson's heroine squarely in his sights. He attempts to expose \\"the many notorious Falsehoods and Misrepresentations of a Book called Pamela, Are exposed and refuted; and all of the matchless Arts of that young Politician, set in a true and just Light.\\" He makes it pretty clear that in the controversy as to whether Pamela's motivation for marrying the cad who tried mightily to seduce her are innocent or mercenary Fielding sees as the latter.Like PAMELA, SHAMELA is a novel (much briefer than PAMELA) written as letters. But in Fielding's hands, Shamela is seen as the master manipulator. Where Pamela faints whenever her Mr. B. grabs her, Shamela swoons too-but in coarse delight. With each passing episode, Fielding inverts the moral universe of Richardson so that when one considers Richardson's subtitle of PAMELA as \\"Virtue rewarded,\\" one now sees with crystal clarity that virtue does indeed earn a reward, but the virtue of Pamela and the virtue of Shamela are alike only in their spelling. I am glad that I read PAMELA first, for if I had come across SHAMELA first, I am pretty sure that I would have hooted and guffawed at a young innocent whose only crime was to follow on stage a deadly mimic."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"I enjoyed Fielding's sense of humor, his appreciation of human foibles. Joseph Andrews is a good story and becomes more entertaining as it moves along. Parson Adams is my favorite character."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"Fielding's basic concept is describing 'manners, not men.'His main characters are two paragons of chastity (Joseph and his girlfriend Fanny) and a model Christian (parson Abraham Adams).During their tumultuous itinerary, they are confronted with vanity, avarice, envy, ambition, ingratitude, selfishness, intolerance, venality, hate, lust, folly, malice, deceit, rage and all this behind a veil of hypocrisy (Do as I say, not as I do): 'Lord, it is true I never obeyed one of thy commandments, yet punish me not, for I believe them all.'The overall mentality is calvinist fatalism: 'We must submit to Providence', and 'no accident happens to us without the Divine permission ... the same power which made us, rules over us, and we are absolutely at his disposal, he may do with us what he pleases, nor have we any right to complain.'There is also a Malthusian accent: 'he shall not settle here, and bring a nest of beggars into the parish.'Christianity is only a tiny film of varnish: 'that it was possible in a country professing Christianity, for a wretch to starve in the midst of his fellow-creatures who abounded.'Socially, the few wealthy rule over the many poor. 'The worst consequence of poverty is dependence on the great.'Another characteristic is the blatant misogyny, through its picture of the lewdness and vulgarity of women (in sharp contrast with Fanny's manners): 'I am no meat for a footman.'This rich, lively, fresh and satirical text contains anti-novel sparks and many modern ingredients ('a set of jolly companions ... Their best conversation was nothing but noise.')But the novel as a whole is loosely built (no real plot) and sometimes too scholarly and boring. It ends in a pure Menander-style.Still, it is a worth-while read."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"As I first time reader of Fielding I found this book unexpectedly comical. In the same line as going to church to hear a boring old pastor and finding your self humoured throughout the sermon. The charactors keep their distance through the third person narrative which allows the reader to judge, pity and find in the case of Fanny and Joseph perfection which is annoyingly unreal.As for Parson Adams he well may be a saintly man but surely someone other than myself finds his lack of tact, condenscending tone and total innocence extremely irritating."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"This book actually pokes on Henry's contemporaries and describes series of events which will eventaully lead to a horrendous headache to be suffered by the reader. On the other hand, Fielding's Tom Jones is a delight and mustn't be missed at any cost! This book is a total waste, though!"},{"Title":"Mechwarrior: Dark Age #12: Hunters of the Deep (A BattleTech Novel)","review":"Many Battletech fans have yet to embrace the new Mechwarrior Dark Age series, and - unfortunately - Randall N. Bills' Hunters of the Deep isn't going to help matters in this regard. Bills is something of an expert when it comes to Battletech technology and hardware, which makes it all the more disappointing that there is so little actual Mechwarrior action in this novel. Most Battletech fans want battle action, and plenty of it. Hunters of the Deep consists predominantly of politics inside Clan Sea Fox, and there's really not much of a tie-in with events taking place throughout the Dark Age universe as a whole. There is talk of an invasion of the Republic by House Marik, but that invasion is given exceedingly short shrift in these pages. To put it mildly, I found the politics of this novel somewhat confusing. Worst of all, there is really no one to admire in this story; indeed, I wasn't even sure who I should be pulling for until I got about halfway through the book. You basically have two ovKhans of Clan Sea Fox pitted against one another; one, ovKhan Sha Clarke, seeks to break away his Spina Khanate from Clan Sea Fox, a most un-clan-like thing to do, while the other, ovKhan Petr Kalasa, is a weak leader with a history of loss and defeat at the hands of Sha. Petr's only saving grace is his loyalty to Clan Sea Fox, but I couldn't help but wonder throughout the novel how such a tainted, rash leader who allows his primary aide to endlessly bait him for his past failures has managed to hold on to his position for so long.Clan Sea Fox should be an interesting clan, for its members spend almost all of their time on naval vessels, wandering from one world to another making trade deals by negotiation and/or intimidation. As space naval men, though, they spend comparatively little time inside 'Mechs practicing or waging battle. As such, they are not exactly experts at battle maneuvers or strategy - Petr certainly isn't. His rashness has allowed Sha to best him more than once in the past, and there's no reason to think that things will change when his current negotiations with the merchants of Adhafera are disrupted by Sha's own bid for trade rights with the planet (for such disputes are generally settled with a duel between ovKhans). Sha is up to something, though, and Petr finds the most unusual of information sources in a female assassin named Snow. Their clandestine meetings become exceedingly tiresome because they always consist of little more than bizarre flirting sessions, made all the more unbearable by the frequent descriptions of Snow's exceeding ugliness of features and perpetual filthy, smelly state. Still, Snow, who seems to be linked to the Republic in some way and certainly knows more about Sha's plans than Petr's intelligence agents even suspect, makes it possible for Petr to try and protect Clan Sea Fox (and the Khan) from Sha's traitorous power play.Bliss has the annoying habit of starting at the end and working backward when it comes to describing important events - such as the one-on-one duel between Sha and Petr in the Rituals of Combat surrounding a Trial of Bloodright. Sometimes, I found little explanation of any kind for certain major happenings. In the end, I can't help but feel that Hunters of the Deep represents the Mechwarrior Dark Age series at its least appealing, as it seems to specialize in the very things many classic Battletech fans like least about the new series."},{"Title":"Mechwarrior: Dark Age #12: Hunters of the Deep (A BattleTech Novel)","review":"At best this book is an awkward read with numerous typos and some name transpositions. What kills it are the countless inconsistant pieces of story and illogical plot functions. The story is summarized here: Two rival Sea Fox ov-khans conflict with each other and the unappealing protagonist ov-khan wins at the end. (He is so unappealing that his aid and friend for years treacherously abandons him at the end of the book to side with the apparently more appealing Antagonist who of course promptly loses) Almost a sidenote is that House Marik launches an invasion of the Republic and fails (In the book this part of the story takes up less space than my review).Unless you want to read some hundred odd pages about meaningless Clan Sea Fox politics and their leaders acting like dishonorable Spheroids (while thinking about how Clanly they are), then don't waste your time reading this book.The Clans are becoming less and less Clanly. Without the plentiful Quiaffs and Affs these Clanners would be difficult to distinguish as such since their conduct is very unClanny. Kerensky would not be proud."},{"Title":"Mechwarrior: Dark Age #12: Hunters of the Deep (A BattleTech Novel)","review":"I have read numerous sci-fi novels and all of the current mechwarrior novels. This one is not an easy read or an intriguing story. As the other reviewers noted, the typographical errors and the name transpositions are distracting. In addition, Mechwarrior and Battletech novels usually feature the behemoth machines that give the series its name, but this novel falls short in this regard. In addition, the novel doesn't advance the plot of the the series overall. I am 140 odd pages into the novel and that is as far as I will get. This is only a good purchase if you feel the need to complete a set of novels; it is not a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Mechwarrior: Dark Age #12: Hunters of the Deep (A BattleTech Novel)","review":"It was interesting to learn something about little known Clan Sea Fox.

He's written and edited countless tech manuals and resource guides that all us BT fans love. Unfortunately, all that skill and knowledge doesn't translate well into his story telling. From what I understand this is Randall's first novel, ever. And it painfully shows. I didn't make it past the first three pages of the Prolog before putting this book down. The hard to follow conversations and rough descriptions made the prolog very tough to follow. Essentially, this book needed more attention and assistance from the rest of the writing staff than it got. Too bad really because I really respect Randall Bill's other works. Unfortunately I think he needs to spend more time perfecting his story telling before releasing another book. If he wasn't already part of the BattleTech and Mechwarrior Dark Age communities he would never have gotten this first book published without a lot more spit and polish."},{"Title":"Red Light, Green Light (Blue Ribbon Book)","review":"This is my daughter's FAVORITE book.

Then in the end he try's to prove to everybody that he is the son of Big Red.What I liked most about the book: was that Mike was able to put all that running in the woods to catching a bog and caught it.What I didn't like and why: I didn't like the fact that Ross and Danny had to work with Joe Williams because he was working for John Price, who only picks a dog if they're a nice breed.My favorite character and why: My favorite character is Mike because he shows no fear no matter what. Also he just lives his life cool.The scene, line, or passage that meant something to me and why ( page#): Danny, Big Red, and Mike looking for a partridge.

Irish Red is a sequel. Danny Pickett and his father Ross live in a cabin on the Wintapi estate of Mr. Haggin to help him raise Irish setters for hunting and show. After Big Red was injured while killing the bear Old Majesty, Danny and Ross own him, but his mate Sheila and their four puppies still belong to Mr. Haggin. However, Haggin's nephew, John Price, has come to convince his uncle to raise English setters instead. Big Red's son Mike is the best hunter, but when Danny and his father try everything to train him, Mike seems to be a bone-headed, self-willed misfit and loses a birding contest to one of the English setters.While Haggin is away, Danny and Ross are supposed to work with Joe Williams, the new trainer for the English setters, but the two quit after a major disagreement on how to treat the dogs and move back into their old cabin off the Haggin estate. However, as winter draws near, Mike escapes the kennel and makes his way to the Picketts' place. While Danny and Mike are out trapping marten on Tower Head, Danny is hit by a falling tree during an early blizzard and is in danger of freezing to death. Will Mike have enough sense to do anything to help save him? And will the dog ever make a good hunter?The book is a heart-warming story that is characterized by perceptive writing and an interesting plot. It leaves the message that a person can do just about anything if he or she really tries hard enough. Those who like dog stories should relish it. The only warning is that Kjelgaard is not above using an occasional \\"h---\\" or \\"d---\\" word. Personally, I would prefer that authors not use such language at all, especially in books for children, but to be honest I have seen a lot worse in much of what passes for children's literature today. The story of Big Red's descendants continues in Outlaw Red."},{"Title":"Irish Red, son of Big Red","review":"Some authors just have a knack for bringing a natural setting to life, and Jim Kjelgaard is one of those rare authors.The story is a by-the-numbers tales of survival in the wild, pitting the initially-inept Mike and woodsman Danny up against a host of natural dangers, including a mammoth snowstorm and a bloodthirsty Puma.The writing is clean and simple, and the events are exciting enough to hold the interest of the reader.I think that Kjelgaard has written better books in this vein, but it is nice to see some continuity between these kinds of books. The relationship of Irish Red to the ever-popular Big Red lets us experience Big Red all over again.I do recommend this book, but not as an introduction to this author. Snow Dog or Big Red are better books to cut your teeth on; this book is a nice return to an established world."},{"Title":"Irish Red, son of Big Red","review":"Runt, mistake, muttonhead.

Although he may lose a pig, and get into the garbage, Mike helps to save the day.

There's plenty of information for someone wholly new to the subject. What's harder to find is a book for someone like me, who knows the general differences between grape varieties but is far from confident in ordering or picking a bottle for dinner.Despite its age -- this book dates from 1996 -- A Perfect Glass of Wine does the job. St. Pierre covers each grape variety in detail (5 or 6 pages), as well as a worthwhile section on choosing glassware and accessories (corkscrews and decanters). You'll also find lots of pretty photos, though they add no illumination to the text.The book is entertaining for the anecdotes (such as a story about the Rhone Rangers, fans of Rhone wines). However, it's especially educational for people who want more than a description of riesling's acidity or even which dishes work well with it (the author recommends cold, cracked Dungeness crab and sourdough, for instance).St. Pierre includes these, but what I found most valuable was his unabashed opinions about wines from each geography. For instance, still in the riesling section, he says, \\"California has had success with both styles, but not enough . . . They had great fun challenging Germany's best, but consumers, not sure of what they were getting when they bought a bottle, opted out.\\"The writing is often simply great, including quotes that make the wine business seem personal (\\"As Dan Duckhorn, one of the prime [Merlot] movers, later said wryly, 'We had a steep experience curve.'\\"). And he explains the variations in, say, Merlot, in terms understandable to a not-quite-beginner.You DO have to keep in mind that the book is dated. From the text, it's evident that the pinot-grigio-everywhere craze hadn't quite taken off when this was written. But so what? I really enjoyed this book, and I think you will, too."},{"Title":"A Perfect Glass of Wine: Choosing, Serving, and Enjoying","review":"It was quite revolutionary in 1996 for a British wine writer to approach to wine from a varietal rather than a regional perspective. St. Pierre had worked at the Wine Appreciation Guild in San Francisco, however, and was more in touch with New World perspectives on wine. He didn\\"t assume that a straightforward listing of red and whites in order of popularity would be the best way for his readers to learn about varieties. Rather, he organized them by the intensity of the wines they produce. He also bothers to address some things that might have been confusing to readers at the time, such as the mislabeling that had been prevalent in the '60 and \`70's in the United States and discusses wine styles and food and wine pairing, although he took that to a much higher level in his 2001 book The Perfect Match. The book benefits from a nice layout and beautiful photographs. I still recommend it to friends as the best introductory book currently on the market, even though many others have been written since. There is a surprising amount of detail packed into little more than 100 pages and the book is nicely written. However, it makes the assumption that the reader will absorb a straightforward exposition of facts without needing much handholding. While most of the people I have recommended it to report back that they enjoyed it, many have confessed that they didn't \\"study it\\" well enough for them to improve their wine selection skills or to feel comfortable talking to a retailer or sommelier."},{"Title":"A Perfect Glass of Wine: Choosing, Serving, and Enjoying","review":"I am new to the world of wine and this book has given me a little directing in wide etiquette. The pictures are vibrant and clear, and the information is very informative."},{"Title":"Action Books (Diversity Breakthrough! Strategic Action Series-Set of Six Books)","review":"If you look at all of Debbe Kennedy's writing, there is at least one thread connecting all her thoughts: talk is nice, but action -- making something really happen -- is the only path to achievement.What's great, then, about this &quot;Strategic Action Series&quot; is that, page after page, Kennedy suggests, profiles, highlights, or lists things you can do to move diversity from the discussion table to the office suite or plant floor.The series is a perfect blend of philosophy, reporting, and move-on-it-now lists. Thus, when completed, the series not only helps you see diversity in a new light; these books also help you think about your own potential for converting diversity into actions with both a personal and organizational payoff."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke's America","review":"This is a fun narrative of US history from exploration times up to the late 20th century!

As a former teacher I highly recommend this book as a primer to get young people interested in our glorious past."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke's America","review":"This is probably the very best book ever written on the history and culture of this Nation. It is a must read for anyone who desires more knowledge on America and why we succeeded when other \\"democratic experiments\\" failed. Written first as a series for PBS and then expanded into a book, it will challenge many of the concepts that you learned in school. And, with all of that, it is still a great read."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke's America","review":"There are some books that are just so informative that no library should be without them. There are some books that are written so well that it is a positive joy to read the text. There are some people who have such a way of looking at the world that you feel comfort hearing them speak. There are people who have seen so much that their opinion is something you seek.All of these traits are combined in this volume that only Foote's Civil War trilogy can compare with. The small stories that are routinely missed (such as the origin of &quot;the real McCoy) and the relevence of these ordinary people making extrodinary things happen are coupled with the tales of the extraordinary people who had their ordinary vices. (Franklin's advice to take an older mistress because they are both more discreet and more grateful) Both named and unnamed he tells their tale as it fits in the piece of this puzzle of AmericaUnlike much of history which seems to have an agenda, Cooke's masterpiece is classical, telling a story of grandur without fawning and of warts without lambasting. It is a grand overview rather than a list of presidents, wars and laws. He captures the essense of what is importnat. It is as if he wished to give a consice guide to his compatriots in England of what facinates him about this land that he eventually settled as did many in his story.It captures what America and Americans are very well and would be an excellent guide to any person who wants to understand us. With so many Americans ignorant of their own history it would be an even better guide to todays college or high school students to make them understand this land of their birth and how it came to be what it is.This book is 30 years old as I write this (July 4th 2003) at the time he wrote this Cooke was in his 27th year of his Letter from America Broadcast for the BBC. When you finish this book you will find yourself wanting more. Have no fear Mr Cooke is now in his 57th year of his broadcasts telling the story of America 15 minutes at a time continues. Lets hope he dictates a sequel filling in these 30 years."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke's America","review":"No stiff upper lip Brit here, not at all. As a transplanted British journalist Alistair Cooke who studied in America's Ivy League universities and then returned to America as a BBC correspondent seems to have been deeply affected and impressed by what he saw here. He stayed here and became a citizen. If the little man and his small cracker-barrel anecdotes represented the collective spirit of the country Alistair Cooke's fascination of the common man's philosophy captured that spirit simply and eloquently in his writings. This simple eloquent approach addressed and exposed the heart and feeling of the people that drove the great country for higher aspirations of the human experience. This is what he wrote about. His observations and examination of the Civil War capture the fervent feelings that Americans held be they morally right or wrong. Yet at the end of this struggle the common purpose of the people did not deter them to find their destiny in this land. The spirit never died and that is what Cooke seems to capture, explore and explain in such eloquent words."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke's America","review":"Besides being a beautifully written, poetic portrait of America's history, the author's British background provides for a totally different perspective. This viewpoint provides a different insight on people and events that an American writer might not have grasped and that I found very interesting and refreshing."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke's America","review":"Alistair Cooke, who died very recently, was a Briton who first came to America during the dark days of the Great Depression as a very young BBC correspondent. The venerated justice Oliver Wendell Holmes was one of the very first people whom he met - and he writes eloquently of that encounter in the Civil War chapter of this book. Finding our spirit and our optimism contagious, Cooke spent much, if not most of his life here for the next seven decades, getting the know the best and the brightest, the celebrity and the common man on the street, learned about our history with an appreciation that very few - even many Americans - have for this country.The result is \\"Alistair Cooke's America\\" first published as a loving tribute to this country at its Bicentennial in 1976, with a revised forward in 2002, though with no mention of the tumultous events of September 11, 2001. Cooke writes movingly of our history and of the spirit of the American people, the fight for Liberty during the American Revolution, the move westward, that \\"firebell in the night\\" (to quote Thomas Jefferson) as the country tore itself apart over the question of Slavery. He writes of the Civil War, interestingly considering Antietam to be a much more significant battle than Gettysburg. His views on Abraham Lincoln are also surprising, in his view that President Lincoln was venerated in great part due to his death, and being the leader of the winning side.Cooke also spends much more writing space on Woodrow Wilson, whom he clearly admires for his domestic and foreign policies, but either ignores or just wasn't aware of Wilson's Racist policies. By contrast, Theodore Roosevelt, whose Presidency bridged the gap between the Civil War years and America becoming a major power, gets barely two pages.Cooke's chapter on the \\"Arsenal of Democracy\\" is a revelatory look at how America's policy of \\"Lend Lease\\" and our subsequent entry into World War II did save the world from Hitlerism, especially when France had fallen and Britain was on the ropes.Despite some of his views, or perhaps because of them - This well-written and profusely illustrated book deserves the five-star review because Alistair Cooke wrote a history that belongs on every thoughtful American's bookshelf alongside Stephen Ambrose's \\"To America\\". The things we take for granted about how great this country is were never missed by this great British writer."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke's America","review":"His prose depicting the American people throughout our nation's historical record are eloquent and shear poetry to read. His endearing objectivity and love of this land through his insightful words are stirring and heartwarming. You do not come across this type of writing with genuine devotion, respect and love for what comprised the greatness of the American spirit."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke's America","review":"I am a huge fan of Alistair Cooke. The book is wonderful, the writing is delightful, BUT the formatting for a Kindle is atrocious!The font is not well suited to the Kindle screen, and I had to read it in large-print because in regular size the letters were too thin. I could not change the font. Some letters are split vertically down the center, with a gap between the left and right sides.Figure captions appear to be randomly inserted into the text, and are separated from the actual figures by several Kindle pages. This means that as you are reading along, it appears that the subject has changed abruptly, whereas in fact you have simply struck a caption. (It took a while to recognize the slight change in font).This is the worst formatted Kindle book I have encountered. My 3-star rating is a split between 5-stars for the writing and content, and 1-star for the presentation. Such a shame..."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke's America","review":"Cooke's America series on PBS was one of the best historical TV productions. His warm presentation made American history come alive. He did not bore you to death with minutia. As I watched it many years ago, I often remarked that if we had more Cooke-types in the classroom, learning history would have been fascinating, engaging and fun. This book, much expanded from the original TV scripts, is a pure joy to read and captures the style and delivery of one of the 20th century's greatest observers of American culture."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke's America","review":"The reviews above mine reflect the quality of penmanship and historical research of a personal kind that is to be found in Cooke's America, so much so that there is little left for me to add. This is no dry retelling of American history, but is a personal journey in words, based on the accompanying 13 part television series (now released on dvd)broadcast in 1974. According to Cooke, his book is more substantial than the documentary series itself because of a lesser restraint on information, but over all each is an excellent complement to the other. If you have the book, but do not yet have the series on dvd, be well advised to purchase it through amazon.uk It is both a sheer joy and a sad reflection of how great TV documentary series were once made.Ironically and sadly the opening sequences pan New York with the Twin Towers fully in view, one of them apparently still under construction. From beginning to end, Cooke takes the viewer on a journey throughout the United States to the places where history of personal interest to the commentator occurred. And so the viewer has the juxtaposition of the present alongside the pleasure of Cooke speaking directly to camera, (and at one point illustrating New Orleans jazz history with his own excellent piano recital) while telling the story of its past - with many anecdotes included. Absolutely enthralling, with so much in each part that it might be best to view just one at a time so as not to induce information overload."},{"Title":"Alistair Cooke's America","review":"When I received the book it was preserved very well.

Save yourself the time and don't purchase this nonsense."},{"Title":"Fortran Codes for Mathematical Programming: Linear, Quadratic and Discrete","review":"The title says it all; this book lists the source code for various Mathematical Programming algorithms: linear, quadratic, integer, branch &amp; bound, and parametric linear, plus discusses enough of the mathematics involved to make it all rational. The codes were developed at the London School of Economics to support coursework, so they have been debugged by generations of students. This author has used the code for Quadratic Programming to do mean-variance optimization for selection of efficient investment portfolios and found it to be solid."},{"Title":"Introduction to Homeland Security, Second Edition (Butterworth-Heinemann Homeland Security)","review":"This is one of the first generation texts on homeland security. As such, it has a somewhat ad hoc feel to it, as though these (and other) authors are feeling out just what a text on homeland security is all about. The purpose of the book is described on page xiv: \\"The intent of this book is to provide a primer on homeland security for emergency managers, students of emergency management, and for the countless public and private sector individuals who find themselves suddenly thrust into the ever-expanding domain of homeland security.\\"The scope of the book is wide, as it covers a lot of territory. One necessary consequence of this is that coverage of individual topics can be a bit thin. On the other hand, the breadth of coverage is itself a virtue. One must trade off a bit of depth for breadth.The book begins with a discussion of an historic overview of terrorist threats. As such, it does \\"set the table\\" for the rest of the book. However, there is actually very little on terrorists, their tactics, etc. Thus, the chapter seems to be written in something of a contextual vacuum. At some point in the volume, there should probably be a chapter on what we know about terrorists.The book also explores the statutory and organizational infrastructure for homeland security. The resulting chapters are serviceable. Chapters proceed with coverage of safety and security; mitigation, prevention, and preparedness; response and recovery; communications; technology. The final chapter is forward looking, exploring the future of homeland security; it also considers the lessons learned from the reorganization of FEMA under the Department of Homeland Security.Thus, while there is a \\"generic\\" sense to this book, it covers a great deal of territory and provides a broad-based introduction to the subject of homeland security. As such, a useful volume."},{"Title":"Horace Morris II","review":"this traveling mouse continues to amuse"},{"Title":"Horace Morris II","review":"As unique and educational children's books, the Horace Morris stories take honors.

The silly mouse has substance."},{"Title":"Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer","review":"The emergence of Tumblety as a major suspect in the Ripper murders is a stunning revelation by the authors, Evans and Gainey. Equally amazing is the linkage to Whitechapel via a series of very similar murders that occured in South America and New York. The globetrotting Tumblety appears to have been in the limelight consistently in the 1890s and it is intriguing that the British press virtually ignored his importance in the case, giving some support to the authors theory on cover-up and conspiracy by the Yard. The authors convey the frustration of the case quite well, including the competitive nature of Scotland Yard and the USA authorities. Anyone interested in the Ripper murders should buy this book. It is far more credible than the rubbish published by Daniel Farson or the laughable accounts concerning James Maybrick."},{"Title":"Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer","review":"I have read most of the well-known books on Jack the Ripper and I think this is probably my favorite. I found this in my school's library (I teach high school English) and thought the author did a very good job pointing out the problems with the suspects generally believed to have been the Ripper and painting a good case for Dr. T. An excellent read. Also, if you're intested in books about serial killers, check out &quot;Zodiac&quot; by Robert Graysmith. An incredibly interesting case (and still unsolved)."},{"Title":"Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer","review":"I enjoyed this book. Admittedly, it has sat on my shelf for three years, waiting until I was in a suitably dark mood to be tempted by it. The authors present a lot of evidence and show very thorough research. The killer they suggest seems entirely plausible, much more so than in the other Ripper book I read and enjoyed (at the end of which, the author's conclusion was that the man had simply stopped killing. Serial killers don't just stop. So that was implausible). Good book."},{"Title":"Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer","review":"The book is based on a recently discovered (and authenticated) letter from a detective that investigated the case. Convincing evidence is presented concerning the American suspect, Tumbletry, who escaped to America with Scotland Yard on his heels. In fact, they followed him to the States, and the U.S. papers of l888 are full of speculation concerning this suspect and the chase. Perhaps the mystery is solved at last!"},{"Title":"Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer","review":"Don't listen to reviewer #2. The book goes into great detail about Tumblety's connection to England, and furthermore, proves he was in England during the time of the murders. Also, the last reviewer is mistaken. Tumblety was arrested AFTER the murder of Mary Kelly. The only break in the chain that would irrefutably tie Tumblety to the murders is the 'Large Dossier' the Scotland Yard suppposedly had, that has not yet been located. Everything else points to him as THE most likely suspect yet considered."},{"Title":"Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer","review":"Contrary to what Reviewer #2 has to say with his low rating, having read MANY \\"Studies\\" of the Ripper over the years, I find the case brought against \\"Dr.\\" Tumblety to be by FAR the MOST likely; there is just TOO much coincidence for it NOT to be this man. Of particular interest are a SIMILAR rash of murder/mutilations performed AFTER the Whitechapel murders in another locale where Tumblety was proven to have been in at the same time as THAT series occured. PLUS Tumblety's collection of fetuses, etc. HIGHLY recommended, to me one of the MOST compelling books yet written on the topic, with more than enough proof provided to prove Tumblety's guilt."},{"Title":"Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer","review":"This book was an excellent read. The authors bring to light some interesting facts heretofore not related to the public. The American lodger was never thoroughly probed in the press but apparently drew more attention from the Yard than they let on at the time. Discovery of the Littlechild letter helps fill in some long missing and important pieces of the puzzle. Including the information of several identical 'Ripper' killings in Jamaica and South America at a time Dr. T. was unaccounted for, but being eagerly sought by operatives from Scotland Yard. The authors build a very plausible case for Dr. Tumblety as 'Jack the Ripper' given their lead from Inspector Littlechild. I'm convinced."},{"Title":"Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer","review":"This is a good text, but I found myself wanting more. Several reviewers have spoken about how the authors did a good job of providing a new Ripper suspect, but I didn't feel they tied up the loose ends. There is mention of murders in Jamaica and Nicaragua late in the book, but no evident that Dr T. was ever in those countries at the time of the murders. There was a brief mention of an American \`ripper event' in New York City, but no details surrounding this event. The evidence surrounding the Batty Street Lodger was very interesting, but the authors should have flushed that line of reasoning out further.However the largest weakness of the text surrounds Mary Kelly. In the second appendix the authors decide that Mary is not a Ripper victim, apparently because Dr. T. might have been in police custody at the time of her murder. This might in fact be accurate, but this sort of material needs to be a chapter within the body of their text. This is a HUGE point within their theory and it's added in at the end. The authors spent significant time talking about Mary Kelly, only to discount the murder at the very end of the book because it didn't agree with their theory. This is a major flaw in their argument.Additionally, early sections of the book spend a good deal of time talking about the Lincoln Assassination and Dr. T's arrest as a suspect in that affair. Unfortunately, these events are never tied back to the Whitechapel affair. Finally, very little information is provided regarding what happened to Dr. T. after he left London. Perhaps this information is not available, but one of the leading reasons to suspect Dr T. is he left London in 1888 (under suspicion). Additionally, if ripper-like murders happened in other parts of the world, this would be a big indicator that he was the Ripper, but only if you can show he was in those locals at the time of the murders.Having read many Ripper texts, this one is more entertaining than most; however, it left me feeling the authors could have done more with their suspect. They did not convince me they had found Jack, only that Jack the Ripper and the Batty Street Lodger were probably one and the same person."},{"Title":"Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer","review":"This is a very respectable Ripper book centered on a certain Mr. Tumblety, a recently discovered contender for the identity of Jack the Ripper. The two British authors can really write and reading their work shows us, among other things, how superior the Brit school systems still are. They have done meticulous research and have restrained themselves from frivolous yarn spinning. Whether you think Tumblety did it or not this is a very worthwhile book if you like this subject."},{"Title":"Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer","review":"\\"JACK THE RIPPER; First American Serial Killer\\" by Stewart Evans and Paul Gainey is perhaps, the most perversely fascinating book I have ever read. Although, I have read at least two other books on \\"Jack the Ripper\\", including \\"Portrait of a Killer-Case Closed\\" by Patricia Cornwell (which I thought, was extremely well researched and written). This work however, seems to now leave Ms. Cornwell's suspect, \\"Walter Sikert\\" in 2nd place position.Stewart Evans and Paul Gainey have illuminated an American \\"doctor\\" as the most plausible and realistic suspect to date. Their research seems to put the red laser dot directly on one, Francis Tumblety.Here is the story and investigation of a psychotic sociopath so deranged that even by today's standards, his \\"handy work\\" maintains a front row seat in the halls of criminality and perversity. His crime spree makes the \\"Black Dahlia\\" murder look like kids-play.This is an extremely graphic account of the incidents that will keep the reader glued to the investigation and... a nauseated sense of sadness and anger after finally closing the book.It's a shame the art of \\"psychological profiling\\" and fingerprint classification was either non-existent or, in it's infancy during this time for had it been in use; then surely, \\"Jack-The Ripper\\" or...\\"Rippers\\" might have been found and incarcerated just long enough for a one-way trip to the gallows.The authors exhaustive on-going study and investigation of Francis Tumblety left no leads undone except, perhaps for two.1. There appears to have been a very similar \\"Ripper\\" modus-operandi conducted in Nicaragua and Jamaica in January of 1889 when Tumblety had once again, lost his police surveillance in New York at the same time period. Tumblety himself stated he had traveled to numerous places including...Central America and the Caribbean. The authors submit one news article from; \\"The New York Sun\\" referring to these murders but, there was no follow up from within that area itself.2. Perhaps some additional DNA investigations should be initiated regarding Tumblety and any possible remaining evidence from the victims themselves.This is a worthy book for any historian of crime studies. It is also highly suggested for both the\\" real\\" and, \\"arm-chair\\" detectives who can't help the urge to... \\"Keep on hunting."},{"Title":"Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer","review":"I have read many books on JTR. For me the definitive book is the Complete History of Jack the Ripper by Phillip Sugden...BUT I would place this book at 2nd best! It was a fabulous read with many new insights added from personal records of those involved. I was quite skeptical abt this suspect. But after reading the police accounts,etc, I would have no problem beleiving he could be the Ripper. In fact, I have moved him to #1 on my list as probable. I had always felt it was the Royal Doctor.

He had plucked medals off the dead solider's chests and boasted an impressive military service,all Munchhausen quitoxic fabrications. Like a social peacock, trying to impress the local fauna.Yet,it was faux plummage.Tumblity's wife was unfaithful and left him a embittered misogynist.The Tumblity quack sold peppered cure-alls,and performed abortions ,in the backroom,of his foot-to-the-ground office.When Tumblity passed on ,at a St.Louis catholic hospital,on South Euclid ,he donated all the jewlery he had to the unknowing sisters.The rings were from prostitutes and poor women that had no ready-cash for Tumblity's questionable abortion services. No worthy doctor sullied their hands in this dark business of \\"Angel-making\\".But,Tumblity did.This Tumblity deemed himself a \\"respectable gentelman\\".He had to be frustrated by being restricted to the nether-world of Victorian society.I believe Tumblity met Monty Druitt at a college pub.Tumblity lavished on young artsy college boys,such as Patricia Cornwall's suspect.The chaulked \\"Juwes\\" comment ,was atributed to Monty Druitt ,yet probably written by the old fox Tumblity.Tumblity had a falling out with Druitt,dumping his body in the still-water.The corpse was found some weeks later and Tumblity was long gone,having taken a steamer,back to Rochester,New York.Jack is slang for a \\"puerile boy\\" and a \\"ripper\\" rips things open.The young Tumblity was an saucy erotica porn reader and aware of the street-whores of the lower eastside.The elder Tumblity was an avid theatre goer,watching the performances of the Booth family.(Yet,i do not know if Tumblity having been ejected by the Lincoln beef-eaters,then help hatch the assassination plot with John Wilkes Booth.) Tumblity was also a fan of Gilbert&Sullivan.Tumblity; visited his sister(1875) ,from Vallejo,CA and watched the \\"Mikado\\" ,in near-by Frisco.

First, why would an American doctor travel so far to kill a few prostitutes? And according to their own words Tumblety was in police custody in London on the morning of Nov. 9 the day Mary Kelly (the final Ripper victim) was murdered! Moreover, to much attention is paid to Tumblety's life in America and only a couple of chapters are devoted to his time in London. Finally, other than the Littlechild letter few other strong evidence is offered to conect Tumblety to the horrific crimes. Where the authors do excel is in their careful dismissal of Druitt, Kosminski, and Ostrog as being Saucy Jack. Still, Tumblety doesn't appear to fit the bill when it comes to Jack the Ripper"},{"Title":"Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer","review":"The Littlechild letter was an exciting find, but I remained unconvinced Tumblety was a viable JTR suspect. Unlike other JTR books though, I feel the authors present their story in an honest and well researched manner and I didn't get the feeling facts were fudged or glossed over altogether.While Tumblety probably didn't commit the crimes (he didn't fit the description very well and I cannot believe JTR was that organized and competent to amass a small fortune), I wouldn't rule out he murdered others and I would still recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the Whitechapel murders."},{"Title":"Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer","review":"This book provides a good historical background of the Ripper crimes in late Victorian England. The author works his way through the top suspects, after giving us a basic outline of the case. Dr. Francis Tumblety, an American quack physician, appears to be a good fit for &#34;the most likely to be Jack the Ripper&#34; at this time. The &#34;Littlechild Letter&#34; is the basis for Evans' argument that Dr. Tumblety was Jack the Ripper. A really fun read."},{"Title":"Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer","review":"Interesting, but ultimately unsatisfactory. Although Ripper-suspect theories are generally fraught with subjectivity, this one in particular was built upon what proved a particularly weak foundation, unable to support the authors' hypothesis any farther than a few printings. The subsequent discontinuation speaks volumes. An interesting character study per the suspect in question, but otherwise... the search continues."},{"Title":"Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer","review":"This book was an interesting, easy read that presented some new information on victims and suspects, but the authors never prooved to my satisfaction that Dr. Francis Tumblety was Jack the Ripper. Their research documenting the life of Tumblety was impressive. He was quite a flamboyant and crooked character in his own right. Tumblety was indeed suspected of the Ripper killings, but I don't believe he was Saucy Jacky."},{"Title":"Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer","review":"There is not a single referenced footnote that would allow checking these so-called \\"facts\\" in the book.A non-fiction--a work of history--without detailed, referenced footnotes is not worth the paper it occupies.If you choose to throw your money away, this is a dandy way to do it.Had I know they had no footnotes, no way would I have wasted a dime of this so-called \\"non-fiction\\" work.There are many excellent books on the Ripper that reference details to source informmation.

There are also many that are reminiscent of first drafts from a night-school creative writing class. When he's good, Keret is a fantastic new talent, full of humor and existential angst, but when he's not - he's trite, cliche, and boring - one more young guy writing about getting stoned and laid.The titular story \\"The Nimrod Flipout\\", is one of the best in the entire collection. Three young men are possessed, in turn, by the spirit of their friend, Nimrod, who killed himself after his girlfriend broke up with him. [Variety is also not Keret's strong suit. There are at least two other stories where someone kills themselves because they've been dumped.] After the narrator, the last to succumb to the spirit of his deceased friend, the possession repeats itself starting over again with Miron, the first to be possessed. It's a touching story about the frivolity of youth, and deeply tragic, as well; its also one of the funniest stories in the collection.\\"Fatso\\", the opening story, I also loved. It is about a guy whose girlfriend turns into a fat, drunk, soccer-loving man after the sun goes down, and how, after spending many nights going out and watching soccer at the bar with this character, he begins to love his girlfriend, too.This collection has its shining moments, and is highly recommended to fans of short fiction. However, don't be surprised if some of the stories dissapoint."},{"Title":"The Nimrod Flipout: Stories","review":"Some of these stories are brilliant, first round knockouts. Others are shtick-yawns. The best are like the wondrous short-short stories of Spencer Holst. The worst are whines from the slacker you'd never listen to for five minutes if you bumped into them at a bar. Buy the book for the wonderful, but expect a very mixed bag."},{"Title":"The Nimrod Flipout: Stories","review":"Who knew the Magical Realist mantle would end up in Tel Aviv? (There's no better place for it!) This is a somewhat uneven collection of short stories, thus the missing star. However, it's extremely rare to find a short story collection where that isn't the case.Maybe he gets half a star back, and rounded up to the nearest star, because most of these tiny fables are incredibly good. Several are snort-wine-out-your-nose funny, some are perfectly sly, and others are sweet or poignant without sentimentality. A few lumber along unfulfilled, but just a few. (And they're really short.)He's very a fine writer even in translation, with clear eyes and no fear."},{"Title":"The Nimrod Flipout: Stories","review":"This book is a bit of a grab bag. It's a jumble of great and not-so-great stories, and you take what you get.Some of the stories are absolutely fantastic, creative, evocative, and perfectly told. Often, these excellent stories elicited strong reactions from me, or made me smile at their strange, wonderful, and twisted genius. The first story of the book, \\"Fatso,\\" is such a gem of a story (in structure, in its strangeness, in style, in images, in character, in a surprising dose of magical realism) that, in addition to reading it four or five times, I'm also going to photocopy it, and send it to two friends. I think they'll find it excellent as well.Other stories are not nearly as good.But, after reading several of the other Amazon reviews of this book, I wonder: perhaps all of the stories are incredible, and some just appeal to different kinds of people from others. Several reviewers and readers seem to agree that this book has some excellent and some not-so-excellent stories, but do they all agree about which are which? I saw that at least one reviewer really appreciated the book's title story \\"The Nimrod Flipout.\\" But this was one of the stories with which I was thoroughly UN-impressed. It didn't move or excite me, and the writing didn't seem all that compelling. On the other hand, I absolutely loved \\"Halibut\\" - it is one of my favorite stories of all time. Each of the occurrences it describes is brilliantly timed, and the whole thing fits together in a brilliantly peculiar way. But, I wonder, did everyone else think that this story was excellent? I don't know.So maybe all of the stories are excellent, and some appeal to people like me, and others appeal to different people. It seems possible. I'd be curious to know what other people think."},{"Title":"The Nimrod Flipout: Stories","review":"This collection of short stories by Israeli author Etgar Keret is brimming with diverse and sundry topics. There are 30 stories in this slim 167 page volume. Most of the stories are only a couple of pages long, some as brief as 1 page. In such a medium, Keret excels. Many stories are absurdist, painting impossible imagery, such as giving birth to a horse, shrinking parents, thoughts turning into physical reality. Nevertheless, it is his mastery of capturing a mood, a conflict, a situation and turning it on its head that pulls the reader in again and again. In the eponymous story in this volume, 3 friends take turns flipping out, seemingly caused dybbuklike by a 4th friend who had committed suicide during their army service. A number of stories involve relationships forming and deforming. Perhaps the most intriguing involves someone who could be generously described as a loser. He discovers the meaning of life in 'For Only 9.99 (Inc. Tax and Shipping)', and changes the course of the world, yet the content of his discovery remains unknown and in some ways irrelevant to the reader, as the O. Henryesque twist at the end takes over.To enter Keret's cosmology is to journey to a very weird place. However, you return with a different view of your own world."},{"Title":"The Nimrod Flipout: Stories","review":"\\"The Nimrod Flipout\\" is a collection of extremely short stories. There are thirty that span only 160 pages. For this reason, it's easy to forgive the hit-and-miss nature of TNF, and of microfiction in general. There's very little time or energy to be invested, so if the story doesn't pan out, it's no big loss, and there are plenty of other options in the book.As I read through Flipout, I made notes on the stories I was particularly fond of, at the end, I ended up with a list of 10. \\"Fatso,\\" \\"Your Man,\\" \\"Surprise Egg,\\" \\"Glittery Eyes,\\" \\"A Thought in the Shape of a Story,\\" \\"Gur's Theory of Boredom,\\" \\"Bwoken,\\" \\"Ironclad Rules,\\" \\"A Good Looking Couple,\\" and \\"Angle.\\" They range from insightful, to funny, to emotionally moving.

Nothing important omitted, nothing needless retained. A worthwhile read, definitely."},{"Title":"The Nimrod Flipout: Stories","review":"The word \\"edgy\\" came to mind as I quickly read these 30 very short short stories by this young Israeli writer. He has a unique point of view and speaks in a voice all his own. All of these stories are surreal and weird. Some are funny, some are sad and all of them are infused with a particularly Israeli adolescent male's point of view. Themes such as suicide, mental illness, death, infidelity and loyalty of dogs and out-of-control relationships all come together in this eclectic mixture of short stories.This author certainly has a twisted mind and I was always surprised at his creativity. The stories made me uncomfortable even though I was aware that the writer had complete control of his craft and was trying to say something. Because I was reading this book as an assignment for a book discussion group I forced myself to finish it. I found it also refreshing to see how this author's mind worked.I definitely recommend this book for those readers like me who look for something unique and different. It is a skewed view of the world that is not always pleasant. But, honestly, I hated every minute of it."},{"Title":"The Nimrod Flipout: Stories","review":"Etgar Keret is nothing more (or less) than the Etgar Keret of Israeli literature. His style in many ways is unique and should be read with no one else in mind. Like many Israelis, he lives life with a cynical approach that is very much like 'gallows' humor. This derives from the birth pangs of Israel, the elegiac weight of the Shoah (Holocaust) and the knowledge of being surrounded by 160 million people who want you gone and dead.Spend any time in Israel or with Israelis and you will understand a little more the eccentricities of Keret's stories. Especially touching and revealing is his discussions of being part of the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). Most of his comments about life in the IDF are sidebars to the actual story he is telling, but they are not 'throw-away' comments.His stories wander all around the spectrum, though many are 'train of thought' or just 'I was thinking about...'. His take on what makes a relationship would bring one to think that he hasn't been very successful and doesn't think he ever will be.My favorite was \\"$9.99 plus tax and shipping\\". The story itself could be too 'cutsie' but the ending is pure Keret.Zeb Kantrowitz (and I approved this review)"},{"Title":"The Nimrod Flipout: Stories","review":"Short stories that run from page- to chapter- length offer giggles, snickers, thought-provocation, a skewered lens on young adult humanity's strangenesses, as written from the point of view of a sort of anthropologically objective, but rather warped, insider.I've asked my local library to purchase ALL of Etgar Keret's published works, and plan to do the same for my personal collection. These stories are often laugh-out-loud and read-aloud weird and wonderful - like wasabi peanuts, they have zing and crunch - and leave me wanting more!"},{"Title":"The Nimrod Flipout: Stories","review":"Keret commands a powerful cast of completely three dimensional individuals who manage to navigate with varying degrees of success the ridiculous, hilarious, and heart-breaking events that come flying at them. These stories in many ways feel like fractured fairy tales like the story of the boy with the shrinking parents, the were-wolf-esque girlfriend, and the titular flipout episode. In just a dozen or so pages, fewer in some cases, Keret drops us into the lives of characters who through their speech and actions feel real and familiar, and then just as quickly we are jettisoned from their story whether it was resolved or not, giving a \\"win some, lose some\\" attitude that bespeaks of reality. A thankful nod to the translators Miriam Shlesinger and Sondra Silverston who lend their talents and mastery of English dialects and idioms to bring us English speakers a powerful, strange, amazing set of modern-day tales.Worth your time."},{"Title":"The Nimrod Flipout: Stories","review":"I am at a loss for how to describe Etgar Keret's work to those who've yet to have the pleasure. To comment merely on his stories brevity - the longest I believe comes in at perhaps eight pages and thirty fill this slim volume - would make him seem too much the trickster, a writer with a gag instead of the extraordinary story teller one will meet in \\"The Nimrod Flipout.\\" Perhaps instead I might offer examples of a few of his topics - a man falls into an existential crisis when he wakes to find his beloved dog licking his morning erecting; a character is obsessed with a kiss his girl friend had long ago; the most average of men finds extraordinary success in the most average of ways begging the reader to ask why haven't they - but no, simply going through the stories one by one seems almost voyeuristic.Not to sound too Forest Gump-esque, but Keret's collection resembles nothing so much as a box of varied chocolate truffles, each bit sized, each unique, each extraordinary in its own right, even if it doesn't meet your particular taste. Life may not be like a collection of Etgar Keret short stories, but the world be better off if more reading experiences were.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Nimrod Flipout: Stories","review":"Any reader tickled by the early stories of Woody Allen - the one about the moose at a costume party comes to mind - will delight in these stories. They are witty and poignant in unexpected ways, rambling sometimes like a conversation with an underachieving friend you knew in middle school who with the sensibilities of a 14-year-old has had adulthood thrust upon him.Making meaning of it all, when life was supposed to be simple, is a task that leads his narrators in a hundred circuitous ways to incomprehension - and who wouldn't be puzzled by some of these developments, e.g. a beautiful woman who turns into a hairy man at night, parents who shrink until they fit into a shirt pocket, and so on. Meanwhile, as readers, we look on like witnesses to complications that have all the oddball requirements for an appearance before Judge Judy. Someone expecting \\"Anna Karenina\\" will no doubt be disappointed by these quirky, magical, sometimes disturbing, and often heart-rending stories. But if philosophical delight at life's absurdities is something of a tonic for you, you won't be disappointed in Keret's imaginative world."},{"Title":"The Nimrod Flipout: Stories","review":"After having read an interview with Keret, I was enticed to read some of his stories, betting that they would be pretty good - I was amazed to find out that my high expectations were met and far exceeded.

The translation of this book was stellar, and considering the butcher job that plenty of publishers do on books of this sort, with translations that lumber across a page like a rhinoceros instead of floating like a gazelle, I've got to stand up on my swivel chair (hopefully not falling off) to tell you how truly impressed I was with this sophomore effort.Ideally, it's not easy standing and typing at the same time, let me tell you, but if Virgina Woolf could write longhand while standing at the same time--which they say it abundantly more difficult than typing and standing, whomever 'they' actually are in this case, but you can decide since it's not the most important part of what I'd wanted to say--then, well, I'd have to say that there are worse tortures to be had than standing and writing. For a writer that is. For other people, there are different tortures. For a writer, however, there is only one torture.Believe it. An entire book can be written employing this sort of singalong, streaming, wavelike, approach? I didn't think it were possible until I blew through all of Keret's pages. It's not nearly as disappointing as some of the reviewers below make it out to be, and frankly, I think their less-than-stellar reviews are totally not in keeping with the cleverness of the renown Keret story mechanics. If you burrow between the lines deep enough, you'll eventually \\"strike it rich\\" with the discovery of the essential Keret of wisdom the sage Israeli author tries to dish up here for you, folks.You think it's easy? Well then, try it yourself.My writerly instincts are whispering to me that Keret did plenty of preparation in getting these stories good and ready. The man appears to have lived quite a lot, and these various narratives aren't the conjecture of some silly pre-pubescent kid who has never had certain kinds of, um, \\"relations.\\" They're the musings of a man who's been around the global block, seen things, and done some more. I cite the examples of Australia, India, and New York City as locales which feature prominently throughout the pages of these tales.I'd actually heard about Keret's book on something known as Nextbook (dot org)'s podcast, in which he talks about some of the challenges of getting these puppies published Stateside. Some US-based publishers weren't too gung-ho on his spartan comedic style, and while I do agree that they're a little on the skinny side, they're unique and tasteful in their own special sort of way, like when tasting a new flavour of ice cream at Ben & Jerry's for the first time when you're invited for a scoop by this hot girl with a wicked body that goes on forever and ever and the green eyes to match. But then I'd be digressing. Look, all I wanted to say was that this is a stellar collection of happenstance stories, which if you're an Etgar Keret fan, is right up his alley. Totally in keeping with what we expect from a man who is short on words, but long on snappy humour with an intellectual twist.Throughout these pages, you'll learn a heck of a lot about the local Israeli culture, though I can't for the life of me fathom why Keret is always choosing German businessmen as the ones to do up the business deals with the Israeli high-tech types. Perhaps because Germans prefer Tel Aviv exclusively, where they can feast their eyes on the culture their forebears attempted to obliterate into dust? Maybe it's got plenty to do with their guilty consciences...Ask Mr. Keret directly, and I'd be willing to bet dollars to dreidels that he won't admit it to your face. No matter. I'm merely theorizing. In a world of infinite possibilities, anything's possible.I don't know what people are complaining about, either. Sure, the critics exist, but then you're not putting this book in its proper light. Keret's collection is like a digestive. You don't read it for its non-fictional musings, its meticulously-research suppositions, and novel hypotheses. No! You read it because you'd like a light, but classy, meander through the sorts of topics you'd typically engage your friends in had you been sitting with them instead of chatting with me, dig?Still, who is this Nimrod dude? I know who he is Biblically, but then who is he inside the pages of this little collection?

While the dialogue and characters are fictional the recounting of the game is actual. This is a story of a relationship between brothers but it's also a dichotomy of conversations that you might hear at a baseball game between people that have never met before but at joined by the mutual love of baseball and how it effected their youth and memories.I found the interaction between the characters interesting and engaging as well as tidbits from the game and players mixed in. The dialogue between the brothers is fairly juevinile as you would expect it to be. The interaction between the adults at the game is mostly about baseball and a sort of one-ups-man-ship for baseball memories. I found the interactions believable.This is a quick and enjoyable read for anyone who is a Giants fan and remembers going to games in Candlestick park. I thought that Carrozzi mixed fiction and non fiction well. This certainly brought back memories of baseball games at the stick for me."},{"Title":"City 'Scapes","review":"The San Francisco Giants had the best record in Major League Baseball in the 1960s--but they failed to win a World Series and won only one National League Pennant after a hectic three game playoff with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1962. Yet, despite the failures, this was aruguably one of the most exciting teams of that or any era and packed in the fans all over the National League. Hall of Fame stars such as Willie Mays, Willie McCovery, and Orlando Cepeda slammed baseballs off and over fences all over the league. Great pitchers such as Juan Marichal and Gaylord Perry made their mark, Marichal with one of the most unusual pitching motions in baseball history and Gaylord Perry with his infamous spitball.Yet, \\"City 'Scapes\\" isn't your usual baseball book, filled with wooden facts and relying on the oft-times predjudiced and spin-oriented pronouncements of former major league players and executives. It is a story--faction if you will--that recreates the excitement of an actual game and era, Giants vs. Cincinnati Reds in 1961, as told through the eyes of a diverse group of fans with loyalties in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Cincinnati, and who battle by virtue of their opinions as hard as the players on the field while the game is in progress. The fans are as much participants as the players, and in the 1960s they aren't distracted by the wall-to-wall entertainment bombardment of electronic scoreboards,racing cable cars, bloated-belly mascots, and other such carnival tricks. It is all about The Game. And that was more than enough.When the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers moved to the West Coast, there were tears and lamentations in the East, but on the West Coast there was almost an hysterical joy. Something that would be hard to imagine in our more jaded time where baseball is no longer king. The author has done a good job of recapturing this feeling. Roger Angel, the great sportswriter for New Yorker Magazine who grew up a Giants' fan in New York, said after watching his first game in San Francisco and with a tinge of bitterness, \\"The Giants and San Francisco are a match made in heaven.\\" The reason why is all in \\"City 'Scapes.\\""},{"Title":"City 'Scapes","review":"City 'Scapes brought me back to my youth and my childhood memories attending Candlestick.

He goes beyond the simple facts of the crime and seeks to truly understand the minds and motivations of the criminals themselves. As a parent I found it excruciatingly difficult to read and actually stopped half way though and picked it back up several months later. As a law student and future prosecutor, I found the analysis of the event interesting and compelling. My impression is that Capote's intention is that the story should transcend the factual elements of the murder of this family and expose the very nature of murder itself. Despite the humanization of the murderers it becomes very clear in my mind that society must protect itself from such persons. The question Capote lays before the reader is-how can we best do this?"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"sorry, your gonna have to read it yourself!! believe me...it's worth the 10 dollars or so."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The circumstances that compelled me to pick up a dusty copy of this book from a library shelf, weren't of my own free will (i.e.: a twisted turn of fate, English teachers and research assignments). But I am extraordinarily glad that I looked beyond the tattered cover and read what I would have to say is the best true crime book that I've ever read. The MOTHER of all true crime books! Truman spoke in a narrative of elegance, and elaborate detail that painted a picture that made me feel for the victims, feel for the perpetrators, and just feel for the injustice done unto both by society and 12 gauge shotguns. Unlike a lot of the other true crime books that I've read, this one did not solely rely on shocking depiction's and sensationalism...the crimes in here on our modern scale of macabre can't compete with the horrors of all the gilded punks of the Dahmer &amp; Bundy breed...but they still frightened me and left me asking the perpetual question: &quot;Why?!

Now the woman is making me write a five to six page report on Truman Capote's writting. Back to the book. I found his style of writting to be somewhat boring in a sense. His writing style just doesn't float my boat. I gave it a five star rating for one fact and one fact only, the plot. One can get lost or bored to certain plots and stories ( &quot;The Ax&quot; Donald E. Westlake) but this book has a great plot.

I had seen documentaries and read news accounts of the Clutter murders before, but had never read this, the definitive account of the slayings. Capote is able to bring the victims, their friends, and those who brought their killers to justice alive through his in-depth analysis and eloquent style. At times the psychiatric analysis of Hickock and Smith is a little dry, but these are necessary passages if we are to understand the motive behind this terrible event. Depsite the fact that the outcome of the story is, if not common knowledge, then at least easily predictable, Capote is able to find twists and turns in the story that constantly keep the reader guessing as to what will happen next."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book was written in my mind like a editorial out of a paper.

Even at a young age (15) I know a true winner when I see it. The book was absolutly fantastic and I couldn't put it down.

The way he studied this actual crime and gathered so much information about the murderers and victims is astounding. The only other work of this genre that comes close is Vincent Bugliosi's &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"When I first read this book, I loved it. I thought it was a perfect psychological thriller, with the added interest that it is a true story. Now, I think it is certainly well written and well researched. Capote has high skills at using words to convey situations, environments and emotions. His insight into the minds of the criminals is revealing and appealing.Where, then, did Capote go wrong? In taking sides. The story of a murder in cold blood should have been written in cold blood, too. I wonder what Balzac or Stendhal would have done with this material, being the masters at approaching their subjects in cold blood. But Capote, whom I think I would very much dislike if I had a chance to meet him, decides to go against the death penalty imposed on the two despicable murderers. Note: I am against death penalty for reasons not pertaining to this review, but if someone somewhere deserved the penalty, it was these two rascals. Oh yes, Capote tells us their story and how they became outlaws. Understandable, but not justifiable. Many other people suffer abuse and misery and nonetheless become productive members of society. Murderers deserve a punishment, if not for &quot;social revenge&quot;, at least for &quot;social health&quot;.Still, the book is well written and the story is chilling. Pity that Capote made it a political argument's case."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"After watching the movie I decided to read the book. It was excellent."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Does In Cold Blood hold up after 40 years? Not especially. The shock value of getting inside a criminal's head, of a writer actually empathizing with his subject has diminished, and Capote's version of the American class struggle (more or less a farmer and the cowman dispute) has lost some relevance: a book like Friday Night Lights, a second-generation work in the genre Capote created, does a much better job of teasing out the subtleties of American class conflict. Capote writes with less pizzazz and imagination than the gonzo journalists who followed his lead. In Cold Blood contains curious omissions: there's no full disclosure description of the Clutter family murder and of course Capote himself is missing from the narrative, although this is understandable given the stylistic constraints of 1963. It is hard not be impressed with Capote's patience and perseverence, but In Cold Blood, with its monotonous pace and at times excruciating attention to detail (more like a police dossier than a true crime novel), feels like a historical document or an evolutionist's find, a key fossil linking the staid journalistic techniques of the 1950s with the much more interesting writing that was to follow."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"After years of hearing about the book, seeing the movie twice and seeing the fairly decent made-for-TV movie, I finally got around to reading the book this summer. This is an excellent book and it gives the reader a sense of intimacy with all of the main characters and a fairly good relationship with many of the minor characters. That, for many of us, is a strange feeling. It is strange because we are at least given the opportunity to get to know two men responsible for a brutal, unnecessary quadruple murder. I cannot give the correct literary history of this book. However, I believe it may have broken new ground with this intimate portrayal of the two men. I am sure many a reader has found themselves sympathizing with Richard Hickok and Perry Smith-especially Perry Smith. There is plenty of background on each and, in the case of Smith, lots that could lead a liberal-minded person to see him as a victim. Many, I'm sure, have applauded this sympathetic insight. Many others, I'm equally sure, have condemned the equal billing of guilty murders and innocent victim. Either way the author derserves credit for having taken this approach. It rests ultimately with the reader to sort out where his or her emotions should properly settle.The structure of the book is generally helpful to the author's purpose. We meet and get to know the victims, we get a brief introduction to the murderers, the murderers enter the household, the murderers leave the household, the murderers get away. We are in the dark about what actually happened. We spend a lot of time following the murderers and reading about their youth and early adulthood. Eventually a major break in the case occurs and the murderers are caught. Only after they are interogated does the missing piece of the story get revealed. This is a good literary move because it brings us back to the brutality of the murders and reminds us of the dark side of Smith and Hickok. From there we go through the trial, conviction and death sentence. It is at this point that the reader is reminded that this book was originally a series of magazine articles for, I believe, The New Yorker. The remainder seems to have been added on because it doesn't quite fit the flow of the book up to that point. We are briefed on the endless delays, appeals, a retrial, further delays, etc. During this time we actually have a couple of new characters introduced into the story. They are the co-inhabitants of the Kansas State Prison death row. I was never sure if these additional characters added to or detracted from the storyline.This book with make you examine your own feeling about good and evil, the death penalty, and society in general. It did not change my points of view but it gave me cause to reaffirm them."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Because I practice criminal law, I walk around in a world with stories like this one everyday. So I didn't really see the big deal until I finished reading Capote's In Cold Blood. Capote makes a nonfiction account read like fiction. That may not sound like much, but it impressed the hell out of me. Usually nonfiction has a dull feel to it. It just doesn't pop like fiction does. But Capote is able to cut right through that and make this story every bit as compelling as fiction without giving it a corny, Court-TV \\"true-crime\\" feel."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Like many people who have recently picked up this book, I was fascinated to read the novel that inspired the recently critically acclaimed move 'Capote.' As entertaining as I found this real-life account of the savage and grotesque murder of the Clutter Family, I found it disappointing that the novel did not delve into the relationship that grew between Capote and Perry, one of the murderers and the person who actually pulled the trigger in each of the deaths. Capote's prose is remarkable and the way he weaves together the perspectives of everyone involved in the tragedy, including those of Nancy Clutter and her family leading up to the murders is masterfully done. From the opening sentences where Capote situates the isolation of the town of Holcomb (and therefore the unlikelihood of such a crime), readers are guided through the events leading up to and eventually causing the arrests and execuation of Perry and Dick, the two guilty of the crime. Since the aim of the novel was to give a better understanding of the psychology behind the actions of the two guilty parties, the novel is a resounding success. I could not put the book down. For anyone who wishes to see a master weave a narrative, this novel is for you. I highly recommend both this book and the movie adapted from these lines."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood is in the spotlight again, in the wake of the success of the film Capote. But the renewed attention on the book does nothing to change this important book's ever-growing limitations.Most fans of In Cold Blood point to the belief that author Truman Capote more or less created the genre of the true crime novel with this effort -- a questionable point I won't quarrel with, for argument's sake. But as with any iconic work, it is emulated and improved upon until the very aspects that made it seem great and new are diminished. In the case of In Cold Blood, what is left is a vain, dated, and two-dimensional effort whose main virtue comes from its historical importance.Of course, in the book's defense, In Cold Blood's historical importance is enormous.The story is based on the murders of Kansas' Clutter family in 1959. Mr. Capote was a tireless interviewer, and he even attended the executions of the convicted murders Richard Hickock and Perry Smith. The writing still seems crisp and clean. And the story itself inspired a generation or writers who followed Mr. Capote's lead with varying degrees of success.But a book is a living thing, and if we separate In Cold Blood from its place in the literary canon of the late 20th century, then Mr. Capote's struggles to remain objective, his simplistic and cinematic portrayals of the leading characters, his sometimes heavy-handed foreshadowing and use of symbolism -- at best they now seem quaint, and at worst they can appear almost amateurish.The ripple effect from a book like this is enough to garner four stars in my estimation, but you won't catch me awarding five to something with this many shortcomings."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Doesn't it say something about this book first published nearly 40 years ago, and yet had nearly 200 reviews here as recent as the month this is being written? (March,'04). I had been meaning to read ICB for years and am I glad that I did. Capote was a prominent figure in gossip columns for years, but his fame was well earned: the man could write.In a nutshell, two punks murder a family of four when they attempt to loot a non-existent safe. (Ironically, Mr Clutter, the father, was notorious for always writing checks - he never kept cash around.) Like when the inner city sniper's bullet hits a good kid, that's what happened here. The Clutter family were just good people, not without their problems. Mrs Clutter had emotional problems, yet her daughter, Nancy was Miss Popular. The girl even taught a neighbor how to bake a cherry pie on an already busy Sat. In fact, whenever I read the parts with Nancy's friend Sue Kidwell after the murder, I was always moved to tears.Capote never knew the Clutters, but he paints a vivid portrait of these four people (there was also a son murdered that night) that makes you feel as if you know them. They are not just a statistic. You also have to remember that this happened in 1959 when such a thing was more of a rarity then it is today. The reader mourns for the Clutters, yet also for Perry Smith, the slime bag who did the killings along with his partner Richard Hicock.Perry is disadvantaged almost from the start. You see that he never had a chance. Yet, I never felt that he did not get his just desserts (hanging). His story acts a treatise on the effects of a childhood spent without the support of a strong, loving family."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote's gripping account of the savage murder of four members of the farming Clutter family on November 15, 1959, by Dick Hickock and Perry Smith was rightly hailed as a masterpiece of American literature. It was a departure for Capote who was an established and internationally successful writer when he began what was termed a 'non-fiction novel', or documentary essay, which he so vividly developed and recounted of the events leading up to the eventual tragedy, first by introducing us to the Clutter family from Holcomb on the wheat plains of western Kansas, with some detail and intimacy, then a glimpse of Perry Smith waiting for his friend, Dick, whom he had met in gaol. He is described as a short, powerful, dark haired 32 year old, with Indian ancestry on his mother's side. It becomes apparent that some nefarious plan has been hatched between the two men. They drive away when Dick arrives, with Perry's beloved guitar on the back seat of the 1949 black Chevrolet sedan. Both are misfits from broken homes, and Perry suffers from headaches and continually overdoses himself on anelgesics. He also has a violent temper.Capote became intimately involved in the drama after the arrest and trial of Smith and Hickock, their sentence of death, and the long drawn out appeal process. He visited Holcomb, became friendly with the participnants, and in particular the local sheriff. He also became intimately involved with Dick and Perry, particularly the latter, for whom he developed an emotional attachment, and was traumatically affected by their eventual execution.In Cold Blood was a complete departure for the writer of such sophisticated pieces as 'Breakfast at Tiffany's', and 'Other Voices, Other Rooms' - and for someone who loved the company of beautiful society women, and was a compulsive gossip. The structure and masterly development of 'In Cold Blood' is a fascinating and extraordinary achievement by a superb writer, and remains a modern day classic.The Learning Process: Some Creative Impressions"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote's chilling account of the awful events in Holcomb, Kansas in November 1959 are retold here with a wonderful narration by actor Scott Brick who adds to his reputation as one of the best readers of fiction and non-fiction works. It is said that Capote never took notes during his research of this book which is all the more remarkable because of the many people he interviewed while writing the story. Brick's reading details the planning and travel to Holcomb, the murder of the Clutter family, the flight of Richard Hickock and Perry Smith to Mexico, their petty thievery and squabbles, to their arrest and confessions of their crime. The trial, prison life and final hours close out the dark, somber story. During the pursuit of the two men, readers also get to know Kansas FBI agent Alvin Dewey and his three men who never despair in their pursuit of Hickock and Perry. Capote's book remains a classic work of American non-fiction, and listners are fortunate to have reader Scott Brick deliver a great performance that recalls a family's horror that November night of more than fifty years ago."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"If you read the first paragraph of Truman Capote's \\"In Cold Blood\\" it may seem at first to just be a descriptive opening for the book until you read it again. Those opening lines can almost be scanned as poetry because Capote has breathed his life, his unique talent into them and as you read on, you'll see all the words of this true crime story transcend ordinary writing. It is the difference between a great writer and a mediocre one, that special life-breath, that rare life- force that is the hallmark of only a few. Writing sublimely is a gift that cannot be acquired, it is incorporated in the genes. It's there, from the moment of birth. And Truman Capote had it."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I purchased this book In Cold Book by Truman Capote.

I'm not a fan of a reader trying to imitate multiple characters (particularly of the opposite sex) but I'd heard raves about Scott Brick. This audiobook was available at my local library so I gave it a go. First of all, Brick's voice is mesmerizing. He paces his words, gives them a rhythm and allows you time to weave a picture in your head as he's reading. I made it thru 75% of the CDs but the only thing I didn't enjoy was the length of time it was taking to finish since I knew I could read faster. I finally got impatient and picked up the hardcopy of the book and to my amazement, recognized whole passages, word-for-word, of Brick's rendition. Actually, his oral presentation was better than the written word but I finished anyway. As for the book itself, I wrote a longer review elsewhere on the site but suffice it to say, Capote is quite wordy and devotes most of the book as a memorial of Perry Smith, not the Clutters. If you've seen either of the Capote films (\\"Infamous\\" and \\"Capote\\"), the book's nuances are more intriguing. If I ever decide to try another audiobook, I'll make sure it's read by Brick.

Upon completing this true-crime novel, I find that I'm seeking out Capote's other famous literary works (in particular \\"Other Voices, Other Rooms\\").There's so much care taken in the elegant detail of Capote's descriptions throughout the novel.

Capote took a case of disturbing crime and turned it into a novel length story worth telling.

He is a classic that will live on and so will this book!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood by Truman Capote/Non-Fiction, Random House, 2007:The true account of a brutal murder of an innocent farm family can only lead to one thing: motive.This intuition is illustrated through the 1966 nonfiction masterpiece, In Cold Blood by Truman Capote. On November 14, 1959, the Clutters, a family of four who live a prosperous life on a farm in Holcomb, Kansas are brutally slaughtered. Herbert Clutter is a prominent man in the town of Holcomb, and the owner of River Valley Farm. Mr. Clutter is actively involved in the town of Holcomb being chairman of the Finney Country 4-H club. He has an impeccable reputation as paying his farm workers a high salary. Mr. Clutter is honest, friendly, and respects others. Mrs. Bonnie Clutter is shy and nervous who suffers from depression. She tries to be social with others and be a good mother and wife for her family, but this does not come naturally for her. Mr. and Mrs. Clutter have four children Evanna, Beverly, Nancy, and Kenyon. Evanna and Beverly are grown up and have their own lives outside of Kansas.Nancy Clutter is seventeen years old and a model student. She is a member of the 4-H club, her high school's class president, and a member of the Young Methodist's League. She is popular and attractive but very modest. She plays the violin and gives lessons to younger children. She spent her last day alive teaching her neighbor, a young girl, how to bake a cherry pie. In addition, Nancy sews clothing and has a horse that she takes care of. Nancy spends her free time with her boyfriend Bobby Rupp, the star of the high school basketball team. Nancy is in love with Bobby, but Mr. Clutter does not like Bobby because he is Catholic and the Clutters are Methodist and tells Nancy to break off her relationship with Bobby due to their different religions.Nancy's brother Kenyon is fifteen who devotes his time in the Clutter's basement building carpentry and mechanical projects. He is uninterested in girls and enjoys driving the Clutter's pickup truck with his best friend, Bob Jones.This is a one-of-a-kind crime story because although the murderers are revealed at the beginning of the book; it still remains a mystery of the motives of Dick Hickock and Perry Smith, the two murderers from Kansas State Penitentiary. The two killers get the idea to murder the Clutters from Willie-Jay, their friend from the penitentiary, as he said that he used to work on Mr. Clutter's farm. Dick Hickock initiates the plan to kill the Clutters and at the beginning of the mystery appears to be confident, slick, and masculine. As In Cold Blood progresses, Dick's insecurities show through his masculinity.Dick's partner in crime is Perry Smith. Perry physically murders the family, even though Dick was just as involved by encouraging him to do so. Perry had a rough childhood, as his mother left him and his father when he was young. Perry is sensitive, thoughtful, smart, and creative. He conserves his money, while Dick spends all of his quickly.Truman Capote's writing style in In Cold Blood is descriptive, articulate, and striking. The author does not hold back any gruesome details. \\"(Dick) was holding the knife. I asked him for it, and he gave it to me, and I said, \`All right, Dick. Here goes.' But I didn't mean it. I meant to call his bluff, make him argue me out of it, make him admit he was a phony and a coward. See, it was something between me and Dick. I knelt down beside Mr. Clutter, and the pain of kneeling--I thought of that goddam dollar. Silver dollar. The shame. Disgust. And they'd told me never to come back to Kansas. But I didn't realize what I'd done till I heard the sound. Like somebody drowning. Screaming under water.\\" (244).I highly praise In Cold Blood by Truman Capote to a reader who is interested in a captivating non-fiction mystery novel with negligent writing that is gruesome and suspenseful throughout.--Stephanie Browne, Greenwich, Connecticut."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood, written by Truman Capote published in 1966, is a compelling mystery modification account that truly begs for the reader's attention on every page. The novel starts with the chilling murders of a wealthy farmer Herbert Clutter, his wife, and two of his four children in the town of Holcomb, Kansas in the Fall of 1959. However what is most interesting about this tome apart from other murder mysteries is throughout the book the reader knows who's really responsible for the killing.As word of the murders spread, soon the entire town of Holcomb turns into turmoil. Time passes, while the murderers flee south to Mexico in search of riches and treasure. The investigation continues under control of FBI agent Alvin Dewey but promises nothing but dead end leads. Then when a man in the state prison, Floyd Wells, hears talk about the Clutter murders he is sure he knows who did them. Floyd decides to bring his accusations to the police. However getting to the accused is a harder task than said.\\"The village of Holcomb stands on the high wheat plains of western Kansas, a lonesome area that other Kansans call \`out there.' . . .The land is flat, the views are awesomely extensive; horses, herds of cattle, a white cluster of grain elevators rising as gracefully as Greek temples are visible long before a traveler reaches them\\" (3). Although the town seems calm and quiet, it is about to undergo a terrible tragedy. What is interesting about this quote is how the author, Capote, is able to capture the essence of tranquility and contrast it with disaster. Both the beginning and ending of the book have description- not of the people- but of the actual town.\\"This hitherto peaceful congregation of neighbors and old friends had suddenly to endure the unique experience of distrusting each other; understandably, they believed that the murderer was among themselves\\" (88). As the murders were still young, and new in the media those who lived in Holcomb not only went through a disaster but a period of distrust and false blaming among each other.I definitely recommend this book to any murder/mystery fans, the way Truman uses in depth detail in his writing is both captivating and disturbing all at once. The author does an outstanding job of putting the reader in the perspective of the murderers, while every page the reader keeps wondering how it will all end. Capote also uses suspense quite frequently, and although other mysteries might have a climax then resolution, what is very refreshing within this story is actually the rising action and build up throughout the book. Overall, an incredible read that engages its audience and maintains its status as a \\"stand out\\" among other mysteries. In Cold Blood will definitely shock, and haunt you however it seems impossible to put it down."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Book ReviewIn Cold Blood, is a chilling story and just as enticing as it sounds. It really captures the setting, and the time in which it takes place. Truman Capote is a very true writer. In this book, he writes the truth, and nothing but the truth.This story is about the Clutters, a well respected, and perhaps the most successful family in the town of Holcomb. As a reader, you are very vulnerable to whatever the author has to throw to you, and Capote takes advantage on the affect he has on the audience. He will throw you an idea that could be possible, or a clue that seems irrelevant, that really plays a big role later in the book.In Cold Blood, is a fascinating story that is well told through the eyes and ears of Truman Capote. Sometimes, I do find the story hard to believe, its dark, dark but true. And that's what makes the book so much harder to put down. When I read this story, I found that Capote used such tools in writing that caused the reader to want to know what happens next, but he would extend it. Not drag it out, but really just have more of a flow of words. What I noticed to be unique, was Capote would interchangeably tell the stories of the Clutter family and of two \\"partners in crime\\" Dick & Perry. In the process of the In Cold Blood, unraveling you notice he relates the stories more and more. Until the end, where he doesn't have to go back and forth anymore, they have become one.In a way, Capote never flat out tells you what happened. His writing is deciphered and it's up to the reader to connect the dots or visually picture it in their head. In Cold Blood, has a variety of writing tools portrayed to help make the story better. In some parts, it goes into full detail; others can leave you with questions.I found that Capote also wants the reader to use their own judgment, but not quite all the time. When you first read about Dick and Perry you have a very different impression in the beginning then you do in the end. Actually same idea goes for the book In Cold Blood, in some ways.Capote illustrates suspense in his writing along with imagery. I definitely enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone who likes a true \\"suspense\\" story.\\"A masterpiece...a spellbinding work.\\" -Life"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book was riveting from start to finish, and I could hardly find enough time to be in the car & listen to it. Capote is a gifted writer, and has superbly cobbled together the story of the grisly, horrifying murder of the Clutter family from the monumental amount of files, notes, interviews, and evidence that he had at his disposal. I was (and am) blown away by Capote's ability to make even the most unsavory of characters somewhat sympathetic. He was able to (initially) approach the story from a sort of journalistic aspect, and as such he seemed able to write from a relatively objective view about what was obviously a sickeningly violent incident, and an incident seemingly without motive or reason.What became interesting as I got toward the end of the book was the fact that Capote became more sympathetic toward Perry Smith. He seemed to see Perry as a sort of pawn in the hands of Dick Hickock. Perhaps Dick thought so as well at times, but I got the sense from the book (despite how Capote described him) that Perry Smith was much more brutal and cold than Dick Hickock ever dreamed of being. I find it strange that I would come to that (obvious) assumption, considering that by the end of the book, Capote was personally acquainted with both men. However, I wondered if Capote was a little captivated by Smith, and as such (by the end) could not see him in as objective a fashion as he did at first. It was a gut reaction, of course, and I am only speculating.Regardless of how personally involved in their lives Capote became - and my understanding was that the prison system allowed him generous access to both Smith & Hickock - I think he did what seemed almost impossible to do, and that was to give as accurate an account of the crime as possible. Not only did he do so, but he created what is widely regarded as the book that introduced the genre of true crime & the non-fiction novel. In Cold Blood is in a class by itself, having set the bar of excellence in its genre so high that it has yet (in my opinion) to be equalled or surpassed."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I am not going to retell the story of the Clutter family & how their killers (completely unknown to them) horrendously murdered them. This true story also tells how eventually the 2 cold blooded killers were found & arrested. What meaning (if any, besides a murder story) that I got from the book is that evil exists around us & can suddenly & without warning destroy innocent people either on a personal level or through state sanctioned atrocities. At times the book was a bit overly long but that was the nature of the story....all details told. Evil exists in sociopaths & pychopaths & you see this when the 2 killers are about to murder new victims who offer them a ride. Only chance saves these people from being victims along with the Clutters.Be vigilant & lock your doors no matter how \\"safe\\" a neighborhood you think you live in...dont pick up hitchhikers & always listen to your instincts when dealing with strangers. Be wary!I agree that Capote shows some \\"empathy\\" to Perry but I think this was only because he wanted to gain his confidence so Perry would talk to him about his life.The Clutters were murdered in a planned killing by people they didn't even know! Even locking their doors (which they didn't) & windows still might have not saved them.Can anything be more terrifying? Do people think this is a novel? It is all true. Perhaps thinking it is a novel makes it less frightening."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Recently I have decided to finally purchase this book. I've been postponing it for quite a few years now, and didn't want to watch the movie until reading it.Few writer are able to get under your skin so well, and allow to imagine that you were a bystander the entire time you're reading the book.I had very much enjoyed this book and recommend it to everyone.Enjoy."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I got this book as a recommendation and I am glad I did. It does not count among my top genres but I enjoyed the story. The story has a fascinating premise and a good opening prologue. Well observed characters and a smooth flow of the story come with good dialogue and prose. The descriptions are vivid and colorful. Overall, a story that will strike a chord with its target readership. In Cold Blood and Triple Agent, Double Cross are my recent surprise reads. I am glad I picked it up."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I read In Cold Blood after watching the movie Capote. I was very aware of the book for years but for some reason never quite got around to it. I'm glad I finally broke down and read it. I was not surprised to find that Capote had no role in the book, even as an unnamed shadow. The movie led me to believe Capote was a player in Perry Smith's life after he was captured. Nevertheless, the book was very well done.As mentioned in the movie, Capote has created a new writing style here. Previously, these subjects were covered much as extended reporting from journalists. However, this reads like a novel...a very well developed and plotted novel. The only thing that prevents me from giving this 5-stars is the fact that at times Capote tediously develops some side story that adds very little to the story, other than pages. But, mostly, the material moves well.To say the story is chilling is an understatement. It in fact is quite disturbing. The fact that our world is shared with people with the capacity to do what was done to the Clutter family is foundational to why this book disturbs me. And although, I fully understand the argument to abolish the death penalty, I somehow stand convinced that it must exist, if only to place the appropriate weight to the scale of justice. Sometimes you must do what needs to be done simply because it is the right thing to do. These men deserved to be hanged. Their death does nothing to bring back the beautiful lives of their victims, however, they deserved what the got."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I had heard nothing but good things about this book. Even though I never read true crime I figured I'd give it a shot. I'm glad I did. The book definitely deserves all the good hype. Well researched, well written, and the perfect flow of information. It's easy to follow despite the numerous details. You almost feel like you know the characters involved since they are presented so descriptively. The events are very well documented from beginning to end and it reads more like your watching it than reading it. This book opened a whole new area of non-fiction(which is all I read) for me to explore. I have since read a few other true crime books but most, even though they're good, can't compare. This is probably the top of it's class. If you like to read true crime this would be your diamond. If you don't like true crime(like I didn't), this book will probably change your mind. Excellent book, excellent job by the author, a must for any true readers collection."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Good book. I had seen the movie many years ago, and of course the movie Capote, who himself was an odd man. Took me a little time to get use to his way of writing so it started somewhat slow for me. I just can't grasp a human being (yet alone two) doing this to anyone and having no remorse. These guys were nuts!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I enjoyed reading this book greatly. Capote's writing is so interesting and full of suspense. The way he traces the lives of the murderers and interviews so many people, leads to such an interesting narrative. Capote twists your emotions and causes you to feel pity for even the most brutal of killers. The language however flip flops your view and is so vivid and crude that it makes you cringe with disgust for these two men. The physical descriptions of the two men are so chilling and the writing is so dramatic. This book got a little slow towards the end, but picks right back up. I love the last sentence in the story; I think it makes the perfect ending and gives a little bit of closure to the distressed reader."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The Clutters are a hardworking and well respected family in Holcomb, Kansas. Each is admirable in their own right. However, when they are brutally murdered one night in their own home the town is turned upside down and its many residents are fearful for their safety.Perry Smith and Dick Hickock are recent parolees from the Kansas correctional system and former cellmates. In prison they hatched a plot to rob and kill the Clutter family based on incorrect information about a safe that Dick had received from another prisoner. When they were both released they travel to Holcomb and carry out their murderous plan. Over the course of the novel, we learn about the driving motivation behind the robbery and murders as well as get a glimpse inside the criminal mind.Truman Capote's groundbreaking novel In Cold Blood is great for fiction and nonfiction lovers alike. He did a masterful job of taking a real life true crime event and turning into a brilliant and entertaining novel. He writes as though he had access to intimate knowledge that only the real characters could possibly have had. This novel provides a unique perspective that entertains as well as relates a true and horrific tale."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Controversial and compelling, In Cold Blood reconstructs the murder in 1959 of a Kansas farmer, his wife and both their children. Truman Capote's comprehensive study of the killings and subsequent investigation explores the circumstances surrounding this terrible crime and the effect it had on those involved. At the centre of his study are the amoral young killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickcock, who, vividly drawn by Capote, are shown to be reprehensible yet entirely and frighteningly human.The book is a stark contrast to Victor Hugos ' The last day of a condemned man'."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This is a classic novel in what it achieved in terms of form. It is a horror novel in regards to its content.I picked this book up in preparation of seeing the recent \\"Capote\\" movie. I never read anything by him nor had I seen \\"Breakfast at Tiffany.\\" I also did not know much about Truman Capote itself, except that he has been hailed as one of the major 20th century American writers. In summary, \\"In Cold Blood\\" is a fabulous book. It draws you in, moves you along and never allows you to take your attention away from it. It is also an extremely well written book that offers much to someone who is interested in the theory of journalistic writing as well as to someone who is interesting in reading a true story.Capote is astute in his observations and extremely gifted in putting these on paper. From the opening page, the reader is brought into a turbulent story that depicts the whirlwind of emotions and actions that happened in a small mid-western town. Drawing upon newspaper articles, countless in person interviews and on-site visits to the places where both the victims and the killers lived, Capote offers his readers an all-encompassing account of a true crime drama. The story moves swiftly between the night of the crime, the hunt for the killers and the trial. Descriptions of landscapes, houses, prison cells, people and weapons create a curiously melancholic mood that can only leave the reader wondering who would commit such an atrocious crime and why.The fact that it is a true story still makes the blood in my veins run cold. Capote does not spare its readers the gruesomeness of the event that took place, nor does he offer any excuses as to why they took place. In plain English, the reader is given an account of the timeline of the crime followed by a lengthy description of the characters of the killers. I found myself terrified and appalled, and I don't believe that I will forget the image of Nancy Clutter, the youngest victim, baking pies with her friend just hours before her death."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Although, \\"In Cold Blood\\" was written many years ago, it still holds up very strongly today. We are bombarded with murder stories on an every day basis anymore, especially from the media. When the murders of the Clutter family took place, there were not 10 cable news channels with constant 24/7 coverage. Sure, you had the local newspapers and the headlines spread outwards to capture some attention. How wonderful the story captured the attention of Truman Capote because he tells the story is such a compelling, nonfiction novel. You are drawn in by the stories of both the victims and the killers. I wish Truman Capote were alive to write the same kind of book about the murders if Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman ~~ I'm sure we would have seen it in a whole different perspective and OJ may not be running around a free man. I loved the writing! I'm now reading Gerald Clarke's \\"Capote\\" after seeing the movie. After reading \\"In Cold Blood\\" and seeing \\"Capote\\" (the movie), I've found myself fascinated to learn more about this man and how \\"In Cold Blood effected his life.

In poignant detail, it describes the lives of this family as well as those of the two killers.

The book penetrated the minds of the two killers, reallly helping you to understand the cruelty of this act. There are twists and turns that you might have expected, but weren't prepared for. This is the only book I have read from Capote, but it left me with a great impression. He didn't just tell the story, he went inside of it. I definitly recommend this book to those who enjoy suspense, and, of course, true crime."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote travels to the village of Holcomb to write an article on two ex-convicts who have murdered an innocent family in their own home. He realizes an article doesn't do this story justice and instead completes the book, In Cold Blood. It is said that Capote felt such compassion for one of the perpetrators, Perry Smith, that he had to find out what drove this man to choose the life of a criminal. Years later Capote would claim that he felt his childhood had resembled the life of Smith in such similar ways he couldn't imagine why, in the end, they were such different people. In fact, Capote is quoted as saying, how is it that two people can grow up in the same house and one can come out the front door while the other escapes out the back? Capote spent the majority of this book explaining just that. What led these men to choose the path they followed? What led them to the Clutter residence and why would they choose to commit the acts they did. His research is first-rate as he spends an exceptional amount of time interviewing both criminals after they have been tracked down.Capote does an amazing job of diving into the minds of both killers. Finding out what really makes them tick and what drove them to such inhumane acts. This is one of those classics where you feel like your missing something if you don't read it."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"No one needs me to tell them that his book is written very well, deals with a fascinating and tragic true story and that it was groundbreaking in true crime literature.

Great job Capote."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I bought the Kindle version of \\"In Cold Blood\\" almost three years ago. I started reading and was about half way through, but was sidetracked. Hey, moving will do that to you. But I'm glad that I finally decided to finish it today.But I didn't just finish it; I started again from the beginning. I knew the basic storyline, as I had seen the movie with the same name -- a film that I highly recommend, but watch \\"Capote\\" which is better and \\"Infamous\\" which is surprisingly better still -- but I had forgotten many of the main characters in the novel. Oh, well. At least I reread text from more than just an everyday writer.Backtracking, when I was a kid, I used to watch \\"The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. And Mr. Carson often invited Truman Capote to be a guest. I found Mr. Capote to be quite odd -- as most people probably did -- but I didn't really understand his background story since I was very young. After reading his book and watching several related movies, while I'm surely not an expert, I feel that I understand Mr. Capote pretty well today. And to tell you the truth, I don't know if that's a good or bad thing. Perhaps it's better to know very little about him before reading his book?Mr. Capote surely was an excellent writer, minus the minor fact that he completely overused semi-colons. But a bigger issue still: I believe, and I feel that the writer and director of \\"Infamous\\" would agree with me, that Mr. Capote decided what he was going to write and how he was going to write it before this book was even started. It's hard to ignore the fact that Mr. Capote wasn't exactly objective here, as he at least had an innappropriate relationship with one of the killers. As further evidence: to this day, most of the people in Holcomb -- the small town where the murders occurred -- strongly dislike the writer of this \\"non-fiction novel.\\" I'm paraphrasing a bit, but most of them say something like the following: \\"He liked to give his own version of the truth without considering the consequences of that 'truth' to the victims.\\" (Mr. Captote liked to paraphrase people so I believe that it is fair for me to do the same here.)I could write an entire essay on this book, the movies, and Mr. Capote's life. I'm sure it's already been done ad nauseum. But suffice it to say, this book is certainly important as it possibly started the modern-day crime novel. Writers such as Ann Rule surely owe him more than a nod. And I think that his book deserves \\"more than a nod\\" as well, as I found it quite a gripping read.

What must have been shocking to 60s readers pales a bit in a modern context where far worse crimes have been exposed for public consumption which dates the book- unfortunately. Capote handles the characters well and tells the story competently enough but the book's sensationalistic aspect having deserted it leaves the reader to pick up too many of the flaws in the writing.A good read and a classic for fans of old crime writing but no longer has the shock value that it had in 1965."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"i feel like the people who gave it one star totally misunderstood what the book was supposed to do. its kind of hard to explain what capote's intention was with the book- as it is with a lot of his writings and that is what makes his storytelling so addictive to me- the details that go unnoticed by everyone else matter or make a difference to him. i picked this book up one day while i was sitting bored at my mom's kitchen table looking through the sunday ads at around noon when i looked over at her book case and there this book was. i ended up staying at the table reading the book until the sun went down! page after page!! i don't know where other 1 star reviewers got that he \\"humanized\\" the murderers- whatever that means..criminals- even barbaric ones are still human- and one person actually said the characters weren't interesting enough. i feel like they missed it completely- nancy embodied simplicity. there was no complexity to her. complexity of characters does not always equal a good book. she was a small town girl- with an honest hard working family- this book made me feel like i knew the clutter family personally-i felt like i had heard mr clutter talk before- and at the end of the book- i had several tears in my eyes- and im not an emotional bookreader- i actually said a prayer for the family-what they went through was brutal and capote painted the scenes for me with words in a way, i feel, no other author could... read the book."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"When does the boy struggling to become a man have his first encounter with true EVIL? For me it came on a summer night in 1967 when I saw the film In Cold Blood with a large group of friends at our Small Town, Wisconsin theater. It was a Friday night and none of us knew anything about the film or the book on which it was based. We were just a bunch of high school kids going to the show, mainly for the air conditioning and a few laughs after a hot, humid day. While my friends did whatever they did, I was rapidly sucked into the plan to murder the Cutters. It was to be the scariest movie I have ever seen-- sending me into a virtual frozen panic attack as the black and white images shown before me: the horror of the crime itself, Perry and Dick's capture and trial, followed by their shadowy, graphic fate at the end of the film. For weeks afterward, whenever I heard a car door slam outside in the night,I'd run to look out my bedroom window, just in case. While this may be a bit of an exaggeration, it's safe to say that the film really shook me up. Later, when I read the book for a lit class in college, I went through it again--reading it in a dim, barely furnished apartment I shared with some other guys. As I read the book, and it all unfolded again ( this time in Capote's calculated, poetic prose), the nature of real evil began to take shape. In fact, In Cold Blood is really the only book I've ever read that actually terrified me; I experienced evil from the printed word (Now, that's some writing!). The fact that the Cutters, who knew nothing about what was to befall them as they went to bed that night in Kansas, only to be awoken by strangers Smith and Hickock who savagely murdered by them, helped make evil an almost tangible force that crowded around me as I read. Today when thrill killing and mass murder have become staples of broadcast news, (\\"true crime\\" even has its own section at the local Barnes & Noble), its easy to forget that this wasn't always the case. Unfortunately, Dick and Perry have since been joined in their own special section of Hell by Richard Speck, Andrew Conanan, Ted Bundy, John W. Gacey, and a long list of others. But Capote wrote about it first: In fact, once you read his chilling book, that creaking floorboard you hear in the night takes on an eerie extra significance."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This is truly a captivating story that prompted me to do a lot of side work and research. Capote tells the story of the Clutter family tragedy and the killers that wiped out this family in a familiar, but unsentimental style. He combines a narrative approach with a factual account that is unparalleled in terms of skill. However, you leave the book with the sensation that the story has been told to you quietly, maybe by a favorite uncle or close friend...hard to explain, but it's a soft landing.It's as fresh today a read - and as chilling a story - as my first read in 1968, at the age of 15.Go get it."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Never reading Truman Capote I'm glad this was my first choice.They call it a masterpiece. I can only wholeheartedly concur.This is a beautifully written book about horrible,senseless murder occuring in the late 1950's Kansas outback.The isolation and darkness of the crime pervades one's sense that what we may view as bucolic,hometown pleasantness could be turned instantly into a bloody nightmare on a cold November night.Capote uses the language in a way that is pure genius as he transmits the events,the psychology and the nuts and bolts of crime solving as well as the ultimate penalty to the reader.While digging through articles and books about antisocial/psychopathic behaviors,one book seemed to appear repeatedly in most of the bibliographies.That book was In Cold Blood.I had seen the original movie with Robert Blake et al.An excellent flick which should be viewed at least once.Naturally, I became intrigued and again started to dig for more information about the crime.I found the Clutters,a fascinating almost perfect midwest American dream type family practically out of a book,all slaughtered for nothing by two young psychopaths.Their tales are well told both from the murdering end as well as the formative life experiences that molded them into what they were to become,selfish,confused,egotistical and paranoid men with the \\"I hate the world\\" mentality.Traits we commonly see in the antisocial personality.This book should be required reading for all in the field of mental health who may occasionally cross paths with this type.I'm only sorry I waited so long to read it.It's one of those rare books you can't put down and hate to finish.So lock your doors,leave a light on and be prepared for In Cold Blood.Remember,there is a Hickock and Smith in everyone's neighborhood.If you should hear a window or a back door slowly slide open while your in bed,say your prayers fast.Death may have just entered your domain and just like that,BANG your dead.All you have is the change in your pocket? BANG,BANG,BANG,now your families dead.Read it, you won't be sorry but you might get a little shook up.Enjoy a work of literary art."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Capote presents a well-balanced and chilling account of the Clutter murders that occurred in 1959. Unlike some true crime books, Capote never forgets the victims. In fact, the reader is constantly aware of Mr. and Mrs. Clutter and their two children, Nancy and Kenyon Clutter, how each died and how each lived.On the flip side, while Capote goes into the background of the killers and explains their mental makeup, the reader is never given the impression that sympathy is to be given for these two. Capote spells out the facts of the case in a very engaging manner, while never for once letting the reader forget that these two men are not little lost stray puppies.His balance and sensitivity are what makes this book such an interesting read. It is not merely a treatise on the drama of what happened in the courtroom. Nor is it necessarily what type of forensic evidence was determined to find these two guilty. It is more a study of how the murders were committed, the aftermath of what happened, how the killers were caught, and a exploration of trying to find out what makes a person do what these two did.Capote captured what a true crime story should be - and in fact did create the genre. While others have come close in their intensity and horror, In Cold Blood, goes deeper in exploring that all illusive entity: the criminal mind"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote's In Cold Blood is a milestone in American non-fiction literature. As a part of a class project at UCLA, my history studies class was divided into three groups tasked to develop a trifocal analysis. We focused on Capote's book, the recent movie In Cold Blood, and the 1967 film of the same with Robert Blake. The book is something much more than a contemporary true crime tale; it's a vivid and disturbing case study of a viciously murderous crime that brings the events and subsequent murder trial back to life decades later. It comes as no surprise to me that this book turned Truman into a literary icon.Truman's book originally published in 1965 was a derivative of several articles that originally appeared in the New Yorker. The book is a true account of the vicious and cold blooded murders of the Clutter family who resided on a farm in Holcomb, Kansas. Capote reconstructed the events in chilling detail, the investigation leading to the arrests, the trial and final executions of the men who committed the murders. His violent literary documentary was reined by the New York Times as the most important book ever written on a singular event of American violence. The book was said to have been such an emotionally exhaustive experience that it became his last published work until he died in 1984. The book is an absolute must read for anyone reading American crime subjects.I also recommend as a supplement to this account watching the original epic film with Robert Blake now on DVD. The entire movie was filmed on location in both the farm house and the court room where the men were tried for murder and then sentenced to death by hanging. If you spend a week immersed in these three media works, you will forever be affected by the terrible murders, and also moved by the stories of those they affected. Another thing I found chilling was the idea that Blake would be tried for murder in real life decades later. We spend a week looking through Capote's spyglass and interpreting the actions of all involved.You can't experience the coldness of these crimes without reading the book by Capote in his own words. I highly recommend not only the book, but also the companion films. Please also see my other reviews on other great books."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Other reviewers have rightly noted that Mr. Capote's writing is superb. For me, truly great writing does not make of itself a character in the story but rather has the ability to relate the story in a way that is not distracting. Mr. Capote's writing, though beautiful and rhythmically enchanting, fits so neatly into the grooves of your mind that it sounds more like thoughts the reader is thinking than written words on a page. (I know, that's rather high falutin' for a piece of crime journalism.) In this way, it is not at all distracting and therefore can be read very quickly.When you reread a portion of the book, you really begin to appreciate the beauty of Capote's writing--its simplicity, its connectedness. Then you understand why you were able to read 100 pages in a couple hours.Finally, the subject matter is handled with balance. The Clutter family is treated sympathetically as you would expect, but the murderers themselves are not treated entirely unsympathetically. In this way, we understand that human nature is complex; we are not unidimensionally good or evil. Even the worst criminals retain a remnant of compassion and humanity."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood is nothing short of extraordinary. Capote had an incredible eye for detail and a talent for lyrical, whimsical simile and metaphor, coupled with the ability to draw out conversation. His prose glitters!So it's a great shame that the sensationalism of this creative non-fiction piece went on to spawn a million tawdry wannabes. While there may be some worthy successors, the True Crime genre in general is littered with sensationalist, voyeuristic and cliched garbage. But even when the author is as good at their craft as Capote, none will ever have the access to criminals in the same way. After the example of how these two ended up, no murderer would be naive enough to become as close to a journalist as Perry Smith and Bill Hickock did, and for such an extended time. Helen Garner's Joe Cinque's Consolation, while in haunting prose so spare that it echoes, is curiously and frustratingly half-empty as the murderer in question would not be interviewed.Capote creates rich images and characterizations. The countryside, Holcomb and it's residents and the Clutter family are described with real warm and affection. The empathy the author felt for the murderers obviously has biased his account, but it's worth getting into this author's marvelous mind to see what he saw."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote's In Cold Blood is a brilliantly written journey into the Clutter family murders. Capote uses nuance and detail to expertly piece together the scene of the deaths, the town of Holcombe and the Clutter family but also delves into the history and motivations of the two killers, Perry Smith and Dick Hickock. What makes this book so singulary stunning is the deft hand that guides the reader through the story of the crime, the investigation, the arrests, trial and eventual punishment of the accused. Written like a piece of fiction, Capote weaves the story between evidence and emotion, from the killers fragile minds and motivations, to their sinister physical crimes. A true classic book, in the sense that it's power has not diminshed in the nearly 50 years since it was written. Some scenes still haunt me today, in the best sense though. Amazing."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This True Crime type of novel is a departure from the type of book that I usually prefer, but it had been sitting in my wish list for ages---I decided to order it up to my Kindle and take a break from vampires and werewolves.Having grown up in New York City, surrounded by tales or murder and mayhem on our nightly news, I'd thought myself too jaded to be moved by the account of a murder committed 50 years ago. I was wrong.As I read through Capote's re-enactment of the crime and subsequent investigation (think \`America's Most Wanted' where conversations and events are projected from the facts, so that you are placed into the middle of the events and motivations of all involved) I found myself horrified by the grisly murders, petty motives and the sad loss of life.I also felt a small glimmer of pity for the killers...they seemed doomed from the start to become what they were by difficult childhoods and freak accidents. A very, very small glimmer, though.At any rate, it took me about a week to get through this book. The subject matter is so heavy, that I felt the need to occasionally flip to something lighter just to break it up.I would recommend In Cold Blood to someone looking for a masterfully-written, thought-provoking read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Simply put, Capote is a master of the written language. This is the first of his books I've experienced, and I am now looking forward to discovering more of his works. I've read thousands of books, and none have touched me as this one has. When I'd first picked it up, I figured it would be a bit tedious as some non-fiction tends to be, in my opinion. Mr. Capote definitely proved me wrong. I simply could not put this book down, not even when I was a few hours past my normal bedtime and my eyes were drooping from sheer exhaustion. I wish I had discovered this book long ago."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"It started with a few sentences in the back of The New York Times about a seemingly senseless murder in Kansas. Truman Capote read this brief article and decided to invent a completely new genre of writing, the non-fiction novel. This book is the result of Capote's research with Harper Lee and moved the murders of the Clutter family from the back of The NY Times to the front of the bestseller lists.The book starts by introducing us to Herb Clutter and his family. Capote builds a description of a decent, kind, generous, respected, and hardworking family. Although Capote built a reputation as a flamboyant character, he shows enormous respect for the Clutters. Inter-weaved with his description of the Clutters is his description of the two men, Dick Hickock and Perry Smith, who are about to destroy this family. The suspense builds as the killers get closer and closer. Capote then skips ahead to the discovery of the bodies and we are left knowing what happened but not how or why.The next section of the book inter-weaves the movements of the killers with the story of the investigators trying to discover their identity. Slowly we learn more and more about the nature and background of these two sociopaths. Meanwhile, the investigation struggles forward until a lucky break leads to the capture. At this point, we finally learn what happened the night of the killings in the words of the killers themselves. The final section details the trial and ultimate punishment of Hickock and Smith.The book is brilliantly written. Although there have been questions about the complete accuracy of the story (Capote never took notes during interviews and the book has no footnotes) it is still a compelling and frightening book. The combination of creative writing with journalism created a new genre of writing and makes every other \\"true crime\\" book read like a high school project. Capote pulls his readers into the story creating empathy for the victims (the dead as well as the living) while letting us see into the minds of the killers as well as Hickock and Smith were ever able to see into themselves. This is a book that is a classic, a literary masterpiece even if it isn't an example of perfect accuracy. It is a must read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I became interested in reading In Cold Blood after watching the film Capote (which was excellent), and subsequently ordered a copy of the novel. In Cold Blood was my first Truman Capote novel, and I'd recommend it as a good starting point to Capote's writings (if I can even say that without having read any of his other work).It's a very good story, and it's well written. Capote definately succeeds in bringing the reader inside the \\"mind of the killer,\\" as cliche as that sounds. It is a little slow at times (I wouldn't call it a 'page turner') - but that's not a complaint, as it was necessary (and also interesting) to explore the background of both the victims and the killers.I'm not entirely sure I'd consider it the masterpiece that the film (as well as other Amazon reviews) built it up to be. That said, however, I'm sitting here having just finished reading it in 2007 - taking into account when it was written and the impact it had on the genre, it certainly is an impressive landmark work. But I just don't think it has the impact on a reader today it would have had on a reader in the 1960s.In short - it was excellent, it was definately worth the read, although I didn't come away thinking it was the mind blowing work it was built up to be. But I would definately recommend it to anyone remotely interested in the crime (and particularly in the true crime) genre."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The reason for wanting to read this book came from seeing the film \\"Capote\\". It is completely riveting and a must have for any home library."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Capote founded the genre of the full length book accounting of real life crimes with his detailed researching and excellent writing recounting this tragic, horrific crime in the heartland."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"If you like writing at it's finest, coupled with history and crime...this is the book for you! Of course my parents read it when it was first published, but as the critics then hailed, this is perfection in print!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Rummaging around back shelves in my house, I found a 1965 paperback edition left by my step daughter. I came to the book \\"cold\\", i.e. without reading any reviews. I knew only that it was a famous book.I was particularly interested in how the book was constructed, thinking it might help me in my own writing, but it was easy to forget about that and simply get lost in the story.It is evident that a great deal of effort went into recreating this real life story. Getting into the heads of the characters and describing their feelings was a big challenge. So was presenting a lot of information.The book is divided into four sections corresponding to phases of the events. Within those sections are untitled segments from less than a page in length to many pages. That seemed unusual to me. Perhaps it reflects on the author's writing method - a segment at a time.The action begins shortly before the murders. As it proceeds, there are lengthy side descriptions and flashbacks. The action glues everything together. Facts are released in a way that keeps the reader interested and anticipating.Paragraphs tend to be very long. I thought that perhaps they might have been shorter to make digesting so much information a little easier.The book needs to be read carefully. I wouldn't recommend someone picking it up every now and then. There are descriptions of people that need to be remembered. Sometimes I became confused over which characteristics went with which killer, but that may have been more my own shortcoming.It is interesting how Capote initially refers to the killers' by their first names but later their last names. Perhaps it is intentional, changing the reader's viewpoint from being intimate with the killers to being more remote, from the viewpoint of those in law enforcement and the news media."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"It certainly is a classic. It shows the family and times of that era and sadly enough it tells in detail of the brutal horrific murder of this family. This Book is written so perfectly there are no unread pages to turn. You read every word as if your watching this happening. A great read from start to end. A must Buy!!!!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote's style of writting in this book was very unique. He really captured the esscence of the criminals and brought them alive on the page. He did an excellent job of evoking emotions in the reader and the detail work was wonderful. The story line in itself was interesting and the fact that it is a true story only made the book more intriguing, I would reccomend this book to anyone interested in murder mysteries or criminal behavior. This is not the type of book where you do not know who the criminals are...you know from the start, the interesting part is seeing how they track them down and how the criminals act after being caught."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Whenever I think back on my first reading of this book, my memory seems to splinter. As a crime reporter, I remember it as an exquisitely written account of a nasty killing. As a writer and reader, I recall the story line as though I'd watched it on a movie screen. That's the power of Capote's visual style and smooth narrative voice. Like tens of thousands of others, I try to mimic his precisioned style when writing in-depth stories about true crime. Like tens of thousands of others, I can't quite match it. Capote stands alone as the genius of this genre."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"For various reasons this is a book that is hard to review.If you are looking for a book that will take you into the minds of killers, then this is the book for you.A great classic that will have you sleeping w/the lights on and looking at criminals and questioning why. You will question your personal view on the death sentance as well.To say much more about this book may sway you or give you to much information.Capote take you to where no other book can. A sensless murder and semi biography of the killers and a journey you will NEVER forget."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"What a dazzling spectacle, what a saddening account, what a grand writing. Ironically, this book was gifted to me by a penpal in New York but it kept biting dust somewhere amidst other books for 5 years before I finally picked it up and read it to give it 5 star rating! It was to be one of my all time favourites!This is not only an amazing, chilling, journalistic account of a true life crime but also a study in criminology, dark/ corrupt human mind, small-town society in chaos, human fortitude in profound tragedy. Moreover, it even goes into the issues of forgiveness, repentence, capital punishment.This book truly shook me, churned my mind, made me gasp for breath and think DEEP. I was very angry and sad. My personal verdict: I hardly feel any pity or compassion for the criminals.But maybe I am a bit sorry for Perry Smith because of his horrible past, totally dysfunctional family, physical handicap, fragile and over sentimental disposition. Or do I feel so because Capote painted a sorry picture of Perry Smith, kind of humanized him as a pitiable, short, sentimental, shy man of mixed racial origins (Caucasian father, Native Indian mother) who often suffers great physical and mental pain because of his handicap and inferiority complex ?Capote seems to suggest (based on his interviews with the criminals) that Perry was almost the passive and circumstantial partaker in the crime while his accomplice was the mastermind. I think not. I believe both were equally responsible and evil.There also runs in the book Capote's subtle Democratic/ Liberal political undertone, especially in the last parts of the book, regarding the issue of capital punishment. But it's Capote's grand show and he is allowed to narrate it from his heart. I don't think Capote can be accused of anything other than blowing our minds by giving us a masterpiece, a classic, a superbly written account of a real life tragedy."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"When this book was first published it was a sensation, it makes the furor over the Da Vinci look mild in comparison and it made Capote a superstar. What makes this book unique, besides the fantastic writing, was the fact that Capote completely emersed himself in this project, he turned over every stone and completely manipulated everyone involved, to learn every angle of the story. This book is a complete tour de force, this is a book you will never forget, not just because of the crime, so vividly recreated, but also due to Capote's haunting prose. Highly recommended, lives up to all the hype. It's just a shame it ruined Capote, as nakedly ambitious as he was, he was also a true talent."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote saturates his work with details and employs a cinematic approach with two-dimensional characterizations in order to artistically recreate the infamous crime and punishment of two cold blooded killers. Capote uses in depth details when describing persons of the Clutter family to create a strong contrast emphasizing the horrifying murders. Due to Capote's details the reader is taken on an excursion through the criminal's minds and comes upon many realizations of how a heartless criminal thinks and feels. Capote's structure is also very important because it gives a cinematic feel. The whole first part switches back and forth from the Clutter family and the killers to set up suspense until finally the two stories collide in a twisted way. Capote presents a story that everyone in that time period probably already knew most of the details but he invents a new way of looking at it that no journalism article could do. Throughout his book Capote makes some of his opinions apparent such as his opposition to the death penalty and he produces many themes. One theme encompassed in his novel is that of the American dream. Herb Clutter has made a perfect life that all Americans desire and like the majority, the dream gets shattered by two ridiculous criminals. This shows exactly how fragile the American Dream is. Overall this book meets all of my personal requirements. It has great suspense, which made it a book I didn't want to put down because I wanted to see what was going to happen."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"A great read. I checked negative reviews just because I was unsure how negative reviews could be written about this book. The complaint seems to be that the killers were 'humanized'. I don't understand that argument - the killers were human. It makes me uncomfortable too, but it's not Truman's fault. At no point does he excuse them of their crime, and did not in my judgement paint them sympathetically. If anything, the book highlighted just how inexcusable such a crime was. It is also strange to reflect how such a good thing can be produced out of such a horrible crime - if not for the crime, the book wouldn't exist. That also makes me uncomfortable - but judging the work on its own terms, it's a masterpiece. Superbly written."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"If he had never written another book, this would have been all he ever needed to produce. It is, in the most literal sense of the word, stunning. You can SEE the places he describes; you can FEEL the terror of the Clutter family on that dreadful night; you can LIVE the events as they happen and share the elation of the detectives when they finally catch their men. Somehow the women affected me most deeply; Mrs Clutter and Nancy; Mrs Clutter because she was such a dependent, tortured soul and Nancy because she was so young and innocent; she had not even begun to live.Of course, Kenyon too; the details of his murder are terribly sad, as are the details of the entire family. I cannot imagine what they were thinking; I feel they truly had no idea what was to be their fate...The description of the murders and the reactions of the victims, added to the commentary of Dick and Perry all lend an air of unreality; could this have actually happened?Why these people? How could this horror have happened to such a quiet, productive family? Or anyone? How can there be any people who could conceive and carry out such an atrocity? The descriptions of the condition and treatment of the bodies afterwards in the funeral home made my hair stand on end...and the dreafully sad mental image of the farm itself; the family gone and the house deserted.Dick and Perry are such consummate sociopaths it is difficult to feel anything about their ultimate fate, which they richly deserved, but I felt that Mr Capote was somewhat sympathetic toward them.His descriptions of Holcomb itself are amazing; they provide details of this terribly bleak landscape and it's inhabitants, (the postmistress, Myrt, I found to be extremely irritating in her smug comments in the days following the murders) which make the story all the more haunting. I am no stranger to homicides, having been an avid true crime reader for years, but this one really stands out, due mostly to the incredible writing skills of Mr Capote.[...]"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The NYC movie theater was sold out today for every performance of 'CAPOTE' and not surprisingly so. The age of the audience was 50's, 60's, 70's. Also not surprising. Truman Capote was an important literary light in our lives. I read 'In Cold Blood' when it came out in Atlanta and it scared me to death. After that book, I followed his life until it ended sadly in Palm Springs 20 years ago. Philip Seymour Hoffman's 'Capote' is astonishing. He is the Brando of his generation. When the film ended and the house lights came up, I shed tears of sadness that this incredibly gifted man self-destructed after this book came out. What potential he had to write many more books and live to a ripe old age. Did 'In Cold Blood' so envelop his soul that he couldn't rid himself of the ghosts? It's obvious from the film that he was more concerned that this book was taking years to finish than he was the fate of the two men whom he was writing about. Tipsy on a barstool at Harper Lee's party after the premier of the film based on her book 'To Kill A Mockingbird' he says: They're just tormenting me! Translation: The two men in prison have been given more time to live. He could not finish his book until their deaths. Riviting scene. Incredible film. An incredible book that will endure through the decades. It's was a frightening book to read back in the 60s because we had not had a true crime book like this before. He paved the way for the genre we take for granted today. 48 HOURS and CITY CONFIDENTIAL among other TV shows, would not be around today were it not for 'In Cold Blood' and Truman Capote. I miss him SO much!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This \\"nonfiction novel\\" by Capote is truly a masterpiece. I remember trying to read it as a teenager and finding it too harsh, which is certainly an argument for returning to reread books in adulthood!In painstaking detail, Truman Capote describes the lives of the Clutter family of Kansas so clearly, and with such precision, that we feel that we know them and we are shattered when four out of six family members are brutally murdered.He employs equally descriptive characterizations for Dick Hickock and Perry Smith, two troubled ex-cons who set off on a cross-country car trip, hoping to rob the well-to-do Clutters and destroy all eyewitnesses.I read a quote by Capote today in one of his other books where he said that one of the hardest things about writing In Cold Blood was trying to keep himself out of it. He succeeded beautifully. Although it was he who interviewed the Clutters' neighbors, townsfolk and family of the murderers, the book is written in such a way that the interviewer himself is invisible.So is his bias, if he had one. The gruesome acts of cruelty committed against the Clutters made me -- a staunch opponent of the death penalty -- rethink my position. Then later on, when I read about the sad childhoods of the killers, particularly that of Perry Smith, I was ambivalent about whether or not they should have been sentenced to death. I believe that Capote wanted us to have both of these emotions -- empathy and revulsion.He would certainly roll over in his grave today if he knew how long it took for a typical death penalty case to be tried or how much money was involved in all of the appeals.My only complaint about In Cold Blood is that very little was said about the two remaining Clutter family members. Perhaps this was deliberate. Capote may not have wanted to further intrude on their privacy and grief, but that omission left me wondering how they could have possibly coped with the demolition of the rest of their family.Fantastic book. Highly recommended.Sigrid Macdonald"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Author Truman Capote wanted to write a book by applying \\"techniques of fiction to a fact-based story\\" and the result is arguably Truman Capote's most famous work, In Cold Blood. The book is the fascinating account of an actual murder of an innocent family in southwestern Kansas.Four members of the unsuspecting Clutter family were methodically and viciously murdered on their farm in mid November back in 1959. The crime was a mystery as no one had seen the murderers nor could a motive be discovered. Eventually two men are found to most likely be involved. The story is not a who-dun-it but rather an analysis of a crime and the mystery as to why two men would drive over 400 miles to kill four people who they did not know. It is this last point that provides the greater context of the story. Capote was attempting to explore the criminal mind and find some psychological motivation for criminal behavior.In Cold Blood is considered an American classic and it rightfully deserves that accolade. It was one of the first books of its kind - a novel of a true incident - and it is still one of the best books of any genre. Capote's style is leisurely, straightforward and informative and yet somehow provides the reader with enormous tension at all the right places. Furthermore, while reading the book I just couldn't help but keep thinking that this is a true story, which makes the book more horrifying."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The nonfiction book In Cold Blood, written by Truman Capote, is a psychological thriller of sorts based on the quadruple homicide of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas, 1959. The story follows the events of both the Clutters and the murderers before the murders, and continues to follow the murderers, as well as the investigators of the case, through the rest of the novel.I thought it was very smart the way Capote divided the main structure of the book into 4 separate sections: The Last to See Them Alive, Persons Unknown, Answer, and The Corner. This separation helped more in following the different events and stages of what happened: [before] the murder, the investigation, the answers, and the conviction.Another aspect of the structure that I enjoyed was how Capote wrote the novel presenting perspectives and point-of-views of both the Clutters/investigators/townspeople and the murders \`simultaneously'. This helped to create a timeline for things also occurring simultaneously, for example, while Nancy Clutter was baking cherry pies, the murderers were trying to buy pantyhose to wear over their heads.I admire the research behind this novel. Capote took initiative to get to know the murderers' story, as well as that of the Clutter/investigators and bystanders of the story. Usually, non-fiction novels are written in support of the victim to show and bring justice and light to how gruesome a slaying it was; this book did this, but also \`gave' something to the murderers by letting us (the readers) get insight into their lives and giving us one-on-one time with their stories (family background may have caused adult deviance).Even though I enjoyed most of the book, and how it presented opposing perspectives, it sometimes became confusing and/or annoying. Capote would write in perspectives/dialogue from characters that didn't provide anything to the story, other than the fact that they \`didn't know the Clutters, but heard of how nice a family they were'."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote's brilliant Cold Blood has recently reemerged into the popular consciousness in the wake of the movie that dramatized the production of this singular work. That is all to the good. Capote stood as an unusual figure in the post WW II Period, the ultimate elite intellectual who became a fixture in the popular American mind.Reviewers can praise in Cold Blood from dozens of vantage points, and I would point to the works tight lyrical prose. Having not read the book in more than a decade, I was struck by Capote's unique style. A close reader will note that the author uses almost no adverbs, indeed so few that their absence is notable. Using tremendous care, Capote produces a work that is at once intimate and distant, presenting an almost claustrophobic view of both victim and criminal.Capote's work in its time provoked a generation of imitators. Doubtless its rediscovery will bring a second wave of such young authors, and give readers a chance to rediscover an American original."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Having just seen the movie \\"Capote\\" I decided to reread IN COLD BLOOD and found it every bit as good as I remembered. It certainly reads like a novel without being one, or you can call it a nonfiction novel, a new hybrid form that Mr. Capote said he invented. As practically everybdy in the world now knows, the author researched and wrote a stunning account of the murders of the Clutter family in Kansas in 1959, conducting countless interviews with everyone involved and attending the executions of the murderers Perry Smith and Richard Hickock. There is a myriad of details about both the four members of the Clutter family and Smith and Hickock as well as the law enforcement officials involved in solving the crime. Mr. Capote manages to pull together a lot of otherwise extraneous material and by his genius makes it relevant-- all the information about the other men on death row a/k/a \\"The Corner,\\" for example. The author is famous for his clear, transparent prose very much in evidence here. That is not to say that he is not a master of metaphor as well. Hickock's father is described by Capote as having \\"faded, defeated eyes\\" And his mother \\"throughout the trial. . . had sat quietly beside her husband, her hands worrying a rumpled handkerchief.\\" And Capote's description of spring on the day of the Clutter auction: \\"Actually, it was a beautiful day. Spring. Though mud abounded underfoot, the sun, so long shrouded by snow and cloud, seemed an object freshly made, and the trees-- Mr. Clutter's orchard of pear and apple trees, the elms shading the lane-- were lightly veiled in a haze of virginal green.\\" A multitude of such sentences abounds throughout this book.In his introduction to the Modern Library edition of IN COLD BLOOD Bob Colacello credits Capote with influencing Tom Wolf, Gay Talese, Bruce Chatwin, Ryszard Kapuscinski, James Ellroy and John Berendt. Such a statement may indeed by true; on the other hand no writer following Capote has done this sort of writing better. I can imagine his comments about, say, Bob Woodward's quoting in his books the thoughts of people verbatim whom he had never interviewed or Berendt's projecting himself into a scene in MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL and witnessing a shooting when in reality he was not present. To paraphrase what Capote supposedly said about Norman Mailer, these writers will never beat him at his own game."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I knew nothing of Capote until the buzz of the recent bio movie. A friend asked had I read him and I decided that it was time I should. It took a minute to get use to the writing because no one writes this masterfully any more. Don't get me wrong, there are good writer among us, but this is a whole other level.You can't help but think of what could have been for the Clutter family. Kind, trusting people who never locked their doors killed by men for forty dollars! True there were times when Perry Smith's syntax didn't quite match the man Capote portrayed, but all in all-it doesn't take a way from the story. Some reviewers stated that this book was Capote's attempt to showcase his opposition to the death penalty and I find that hard to believe. For a man with so many hundred dollar words in his arsenal, he didn't use too many of them to state his case.I'm for the death penalty--but not by hanging. Twenty minutes for Hickcock to be pronounced dead.Anyway, no matter your position-In Cold Blood will entangle you in its pages and have you rushing to read more works by this great author."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"When my Sophomore English teacher explained what this book was about, I was very upset. I hated books about murders, they've always upset me. But this book is fantastic! It makes you think about how people work, what makes people tick. I've become more interested in this genre of \\"true crime\\" because of how interesting this book is. The way Capote took this newspaper story and made it into a book, like it came from his imagination. You want to feel sorry for Perry, while you want to hate Dick. It's heartbreaking about this family and the book lets you see what's in a killer's mind.Excellent read. Well worth it."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Whether you consider this to be a journalistic enterprise or a fictionalized rendering of real events, &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; is brilliantly written. The pacing is taught and compelling. Yet it is the glimpses of humanity, both in the killers and their victims, that makes Capote's work so unforgettable. &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; is one of the few books I have ever read that I simply hated to put down, even when I was deeply disturbed by what I read. To this day, I can't hear the word &quot;clutter&quot; without referencing this book in my mind. Truly haunting.(On a personal note: I read this book and &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; one summer while living alone -- I don't recommend it. It made for many a sleepless night.)"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"What surprised me the most about this book was how shocking it remains after 40 years and countless similar acts of violence. Capote's writing was excellent. I was drawn in much stronger and faster than I expected to be. Had a hard time putting it down. He does a wonderful job of setting the time, place and people. You feel the deep loss and dispair along with the community. His exploration of the murderers as people is very interesting.I honestly don't remeber what inspired me to read this, but I'm awfully glad I did. Good, good stuff."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood, written by Truman Capote, depicts a thrilling murder mystery with the utilization of reoccurring motifs and extensive characterization. With the constant use of various motifs throughout the story, Capote gives the novel a gothic touch and horrific mood. One such motif found in the novel is knives. Knives constantly appear in the novel, linking them to the Clutter family murder in which a knife is used to kill one of the victims. By repeating this motif over and over, the importance of the object as a tool in the murder becomes evident. Dreams also represent a motif present in the book. After the murder takes place, Perry, one of the killers, has dreams concerning one of his victims. Perry is described throughout the story as being a daydreamer. By giving a major character this certain characteristic, a mysterious atmosphere is created. Family discord among the two killers signifies the abnormal behavior of the men. Both Perry and Richard are portrayed as having rough family situations. Richard has been married twice and his accomplice Perry had an abusive childhood. Capote's use of characterization further enhances his purpose of establishing a chilling tone. Unhealthy childhood memories surface as the novel progresses about one of the killers. This enables the reader to understand the sanity expressed by the murderer. It also serves as a means to further intensify character development. He describes the Clutter family in great detail at the beginning of the novel. The reader becomes familiar with each one of the family members, resulting in a sympathetic attitude from the reader. This emotional response from the reader allows a personal connection to be made with the story. By utilizing each one of these rhetorical strategies effectively, Capote gives his novel the essential qualities of a murder mystery. The book is very captivating and the thrilling plot keeps the reader interested and involved."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"&quot;In Cold Blood&quot; by Truman Capote is in fact a good book, but it was also way too long for the content that it contained. Capote seemed to explore each character to their core, not letting you miss a beat of their life. This either made me want to fall asleep or throw the book out the window because it was so boring at parts. Exposing the character's life is a necessity to a book, but Capote took the description way too far. On a positive note, the book was very interesting at times. You got to know the characters well and you began to feel sorry or hateful toward them. The book covered the Clutter case very well and it was very detailed. I gave this book 3 stars because even though it was a good book, the length and too developed characters made it a boring read at times."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"aside from being an incredibly entertaining book(impossible to put down!)I found he really put a great spin on how the genre is written.This was my first capote novel(but not my first true crime novel)and I was pleasently surprised at the change and how much it drew you into this town almost feeling like a native yourself like you grew up with the family and what a terribly tragic loss this was,how meaningless the crime."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote was considered a great writer and &#34;In True Blood&#34; was his masterpiece.

I had just watched the movie about Truman Capote and decided to finally read the book. It is fascinating and horrifying as well.

I have recently fallen in love with T.C. thanks to a very close friend. The book in an enthralling account of a quadruple murder and the unlikely circumstances that led up to such an event.

The way in which Capote presents the story really makes you feel remorse for everyone involved, even the two killers. This is definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I got this book as a recommendation and I am glad I did. It does not count among my top genres but I enjoyed the story. The story has a fascinating premise and a good opening prologue. Well observed characters and a smooth flow of the story come with good dialogue and prose. The descriptions are vivid and colorful. Overall, a story that will strike a chord with its target readership. In Cold Blood and Triple Agent, Double Cross are my recent surprise reads. I am glad I picked it up."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote captures the wanton criminal mind in this study of two unlikely killers. Based on the true story of the Clutter family massacre, each chapter mounts in tension as the killers approach their victims, then their eventual downfall. Though no one truly may reason the senseless act committed by this pair of recidivist vermin, the resulting public outcry for the death penalty, and subsequent laws mandating hefty sentences for repeat felons were byproducts stemming from their murderous rampage. The book, and the movie, are both unsettling forays into the netherworld of the violent sociopaths."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"A great and influential book. It's influence was shown when Gore Vidal and Norman Mailer both criticized Capote for writing a nonfiction novel, instead of a fiction novel, when he was writing it. But once this was out and they read it, Mailer and Vidal bother turned around and wrote nonfiction novels themselves."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"How is it possible to be thrilled by the description of landscape in western Kansas?

Truman Capote's IN COLD BLOOD is a thoroughly nourishing book."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This was carefully reseached and filled with facts. Maybe too many facts. Sometimes the plot was bogged down with factual information and we lost interest in the Clutter's or the Killers.

Capote used this opportunity to show you the other side of these famed killers and give you some insight into their minds. Also, I happen to know that Perry Smith and Capote became very close during the interview process which adds some interesting points to the book. You can see a human- interest story in Capote's writing as well.

This book was awesome and if you want to talk about it or debate it sometime, then let's do it, Andyrew. P.S.

It is a real shame that his excesses drove him to the point were he was physically unable to even sign an autograph in his declining years which is well documented by his various Biographers.

So how does karma reason in when, what you call the perfect family, gets brutally murdered? In the small town of Holcomb in Kansas all of the town were asking just this question. So why were they murdered? It seems the criminals escaped with no apparent motive and only a few clues to whom they may be. A scattered footprint, a certain type of knot and a stolen radio was all they could muster for evidence. So who could they blame? Was it Nancy's boyfriend? Could it have been mass murder and a suicide from the troubled mother? Or was it the neighbors who didn't hear anything? As the police search for the murderers, the life of two men is being explained as both stories entangle the book moves fast and you have to keep turning the pages to find out just what happens next.When you begin the book it starts out fairly slow, telling the story of the family. It explains what each member of the family is known for and how each family members mind works. Background of the town and how well it is known and what is the going's on in it. Who does what job and who eventually could be the ones who murders the family. It also incorporates two men Perry and Dick, whose lives play a large part in the book and introduces them and how they work also. At first I didn't enjoy the book so much because it started so slow. But as time continued it seemed like I just couldn't put the book down. I wanted to know what happened and why. I wanted to know who could have hurt the perfect family and for what reason? How were the police going to figure it out? How were they going to catch the killers in the end? But mostly WHO DID IT?I think the best audience for the book would be mature teen and up. You have to have more patience to read this book because it does start off so slow. Not only do you have to have patience but a large imagination and a way of thinking so you don't get frustrated because maybe the results were not what you were wanted. A mature teen can also deal with some of the content because there are some graphic moments where they describe how the victims looked and the murder seen after the murder happened. You have to have sympathy for the family and whoever was affected by the murder, because a lot of people were. In Cold Blood also gets you thinking about small town life and how certain people can be changed by it and what really happens with it. Really bad things can happen to really good people. Really bad things can also happenI really enjoyed this book, it was interesting and fun to read a nice change from the ordinary books that I read and I hope to read more books like this. I think that if you have some of the qualities I have described above and you enjoy mysteries in general then you will really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"... The book I read was long, drawn out, boring to the point of tears. I literally had to put it down for a couple of weeks at a time, or I'd have never finished it. There was too much detail... way too much detail. If I had read one more instance about a pie being baked the day of the murder I would have screamed.Capote is more than sympathetic toward Perry thus the book is not written objectively. He comes to the point of almost saying that the Clutter family was responsible for their own deaths. But even HE can't cross that line. Perhaps this would have been a better read had Capote not gotten the hots for Perry Smith. He tried so hard to make Perry look misunderstood, pitiful, and less culpable than Hickcock.For all the hype ..., I was sadly disappointed in this so-called Classic."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"After seeing Capote the movie, I was anxious to read the story behind the case.

I am not even curious to read on."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I like a good murder story, but I was ready to chuck this book across the room several times.So much of this book is useless and has nothing at all to do with the murder. I don't know how many times I read that one of the killers had issues with his kidneys and wet the bed as a child. How is that relevant to the story? I was honestly going to scream when at one point one killer's sister sends him a letter and starts telling him how tall each of her children is and how much they weigh.By the time you actually get to hear about the gory details regarding how the crime was committed, you don't care anymore, you've had to go through so much useless filler to get to that point.In short: bored me to tears."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"What happens when an agent runs a suspect's DNA through a database in connection with one crime and nails him on another unrelated crime? A modern Cold Hit. It is a flawed system, most cops refuse to give DNA into the system and random testing has not proved a success. \`Cold Hits' is what it is all about. Next to the state hiring a famous alcohol prohibitionist - Elliot Ness, to hunt down a vicious serial killer in Cleveland 1930s , see the book \\"Torso by Steven Nickel\\" (great book though), \\"In Cold Blood\\" is the granddaddy of clown policing (more better crime books below).\\"In Cold Blood\\" often considered mandatory crime literature reading for its investigative reporting, now some odd thirty years later, still stands the test of a book's power to encapsulate the minds of all of those who read it, as there is no doubt that here is a highly motivated and laborious hand behind what comes across as a full \`bloodied' work of art with an exceptional grasp of the English language and an ability to communicate almost telepathically every second of its journey, sadly, but not unexpectedly, can be disapproved in modern times - and rightly so. In synopses, \\"In Cold Blood\\" is a drama about a very real event involving farming family of four, the Clutters, who are tortured and shotgun downed in their home by two drifters, Hickock and Smith - Kansas Bureau of Investigation Agent Dewey assigned the case, sees if he can connect the \`perfect crime' (the killers skipped states), there is no Mystery at all.\\"In Cold Blood\\" reads more like John Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men\\", as fiction more than crime non-fiction, parts real - probably most not, there it is good but not great because it is very long. Seasoned crime non-fiction readers will find a problem early on in that too much is revealed by Capote in the first few pages, out of its over \`paid-per-word' feel, would have served itself a lot better if the actual \`crime' reporting element had not been biased, and flawed, it is apparent that its legal ramifications are many, the investigation reported on was horribly inept from the start, no critic offered by Capote as to where was the detecting? The exposure of the killers by sheer luck of an external witness who knew about it all, before the crime even happened, this is a cream and cherry dramatisation of a real world crime event that tastes quite bitter. It is okay to question why Truman Capote tries to make us identify with killers at that start, could it have been to turn the tables in conventional crime reporting, within the \`mind' of the killers, treated as common as prison sod with deep sad histories but buckets of sympathy stupidity? The breakdown of the criminals as they confess, their reasons found in childlike \`dare' games and unfounded \`anger bursts' that are never evident anywhere in the book's \`story' everyone offering conjecture, Capote's concept of dedicated precision reporting, never starts, this is all absolutely tabloid newsworthy stuff that should not survive for more than a few seconds shelved in the \`legal' section, this is \\"Capote's In Cold Blood\\" much more so than \\"The Murder of the Cutter Family\\".The aspersions of the writer to tell the crime story with nearly all characters fleshed fully by the first fifty pages changes structure and orientation to the point of the reader correctly suspecting it to be \`too good'. Important KBI Agents that uncover evidence are given less page time than the other main player KBI agents who sat around doing nothing, visiting the crime scene over and over probably for donuts and coffee, pat themselves on the back after breaking the suspects and nodding in agreement about a possible \`sympathetic' killer involvement, \\"and here he is!\\", circumstantial written all over it, I suspect Capote maybe a little naive, writing new invention on top of hindsight, so let us add more!, the admission is on the printed page, a cat out of the bag, the culprits caught themselves by stupidity in an era when Western policing was still very \`Western', would we be offering conjecture like Capote does often when we say that the confessions where beaten from the suspects? I think probably not considering all things being under the microscope, Capote-style, fleshed out there is no whole picture, time and places are probably very good, but what really went on in the Clutter house or even \`who' all characters really \`are', that is certainly uncertain.Investigators even missed a footprint that was found at the scene of the crime, later in a photograph, a blow-up photograph, that was matched with a suspect's boot - this along with Capote even telling us that there where two other family murders almost exactly like the Holcolm Clutter Massacre, treated as \`copycat' killings by the investigators and author, it is obvious to the reader that they where all probably related, but again here \`all' would have to be connected to the killers and their \`reasons' for killing, \`their' story and this \`story', things change, and they do often throughout the book's three hundred pages, the question is if the size is worthy of its Cold Hit fun, again in a world where Kansas officers slap backs when a stooge falls over onto his face, if Smith and Hickock did it (and they likely did) then it is not the two people described here and this is not the kind of thing you want you tax money spent on nowadays, try \\"Wicked Beyond Belief by Michael Bilton\\" (certainly a better investigative murder crime book) instead, see you next for \\"Killing for Company by Brain Masters\\" that could be better than this."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote may have been a dwarfish freak-show with a ridiculous voice...but the guy knew how to write. This is an excellent book. Not what I'd call a \\"masterpiece\\" along the lines of Lolita, but certainly right up there with Tom Wolfe's best.It's a book which you should read, and which you'll have no trouble finishing. It may not be 100% factually accurate, but the level of the prose is top-flight, and the pages seemingly turn of their own accord. You can tell Capote spent six years working on it, getting it \\"just right.\\"There really isn't much more to say...except that its omission from the MLA 100--a list including such dreck as On the Road--is outrageous."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote, with major help from Nell Harper Lee, produced groundbreaking work with 1965's In Cold Blood. These days there are probably few readers or film fans not already acquainted with the basic details of the crime upon which Capote based the book: Herb Clutter, his wife and two youngest children, both teenagers, were shot to death in November 1959 in their isolated Holcomb, Kansas, farmhouse. Two petty criminals who had recently been paroled by the Kansas prison system were arrested, convicted of the murders and, almost six years after the killings, finally faced the hangman.By today's standards, sadly enough, this crime does not seem to have been an extremely brutal or sensational one. But 1959 America was not yet numb to this kind of thing and the crime was reported in detail across the country, even grabbing the attention of novelist and short story writer, Truman Capote in New York City. Capote recognized the potential to turn this crime into a book and, with childhood friend Harper Lee in tow, went to Kansas to do his research. But this time, instead of a novel, Capote may have invented something new: a true crime account that reads more like a novel than it does as nonfiction.In Cold Blood does a masterful job of describing the murders but, as in any good novel, Capote allows the suspense to build for a long time before he reveals the details of those four horrible deaths. In the meantime he has turned the four victims into real people by providing the details of their everyday lives, their hopes and dreams and what each of them meant to the community in which they lived. When Capote's story finally reaches the final minutes of their lives, the reader is left with a sense of the huge waste that happened at the hands of the two rather shallow sociopaths who destroyed them.Capote performs the same feat with the two killers, turning them into real people, hard as it is to feel any sympathy for either of them. Perry Smith and Dick Hickock were losers in every sense of the word, two callous sociopaths who felt absolutely no sympathy for anyone they criminally victimized, even the four people they murdered. Although it is never mentioned by Capote in his book, he developed a strong relationship with the two from almost the moment they were returned to Kansas to face their accusers. He was especially taken with Perry Smith, the American Indian runt of the pair, and took advantage of that relationship to gain access to many of Smith's personal photos, journals, letters and drawings. He quotes entire letters and passages from the writings of both Smith and Hickock throughout the book, in fact, but only described the photos and drawings that he obtained from Smith.Capote's In Cold Blood style has been much copied but has seldom been matched. His melding of a fiction style with a true crime account is so complete that it is very easy to forget the book is not, in fact, a novel. This is the book for which Truman Capote will be forever remembered and, considering that nothing quite like it had ever really been accomplished before, it is truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood is incredibly well written. Unlike many of his short stories, the prose is clean and not overly adorned. Without moralizing, he simply tells the story of one of the most random and nonsensical murders of his time. In my opinion, Capote wrote one great book, and this is it."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"And certainly every writer who is interested in writing narrative nonfiction should start right here, then compare everything else to this one."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I saw the newer movie and part of the older one.

Every character -- even the minor ones -- comes alive in this book. Even the ones you would love to hate come across as thinking, feeling human beings. The descriptions of events are so well-written and intertwined that I felt I was watching them rather than reading about them. Capote was certainly a master of his craft. I have already ordered \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" and his collection of stories."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I'm so glad this book has been re-discovered over the past year. Capote is such a magnificent storyteller."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Intrigued, I wondered how Capote could manage to write a book about a crime that, while gruesome, at first glance doesn't appear to be the sort to sustain a book. Upon starting it I was hooked, he not only found the story but manages to tell it from many different perspectives while keeping the raw emotion intact, putting you right there throughout. At the same time he comes across as unbiased in his telling. Not only does he create a genre with this book, he defines what it is at it's best. As an aside, to watch the movie Capote after reading this book makes clear the methods he used, unprecedented access to the criminals, etc. in order to create this masterpeice."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I had first read In Cold Blood over 30 years ago & then saw the movie with Robert Blake & then the much later (& cheesier) one with Eric Roberts, so I was totally familiar with the story. Then I recently saw \\"Capote\\", about the period of Truman Capote's life when he wrote this book, and enough time had elapsed since my first reading to tackle it again. Was I surprised! I had totally forgotten (& the movies of the same title did not convey) all the tiny details brought to life in the book. Having read so much about Truman Capote over the years had overshadowed my first reading of the book. I had in my mind that he was kind of an effete, light-weight writer. Boy, was I wrong! In Cold Blood totally brings to life not only Perry Smith (a classically sociopathic but also truly tragic person) and Richard Hickock, the perpetrators of this truly senseless mass murder, but also the Clutter family, with all their small-town charm and foibles. The movies tended to focus on the killers (and kind of understandably so - they were certainly fascinating characters), but the Clutters were truly a family cut down in their prime. The fates of Perry and Dick are well-known, but if you think about it, had they lived, their lives would probably have progressed much the same way they were going - petty crime and living on the fringe - leaving trails of heartbreak for their families and victims in their wake. But what about the Clutters? Would Mrs. Clutter's problems really have been solved with muscle treatments, or would she have continued her basically reclusive existence? Would Nancy have continued seeing Bobby Rupp, somewhat against her father's wishes? Would she have married Bobby Rupp, and how would her life have turned out? So far, it had been a life of service to others, while still having fun herself. And what would Kenyon have become - I saw somewhat a road of conflict between him and his dad & it would have been interesting to see what happened there. Sadly, nothing further about the Clutters will ever be known past that November night in 1959. The worst thing is that this crime did not need to happen. For some unexplained reason (but partly due to his braggart nature), Hickock had decided ahead of time there would be \\"hair all over the walls\\", although he was not a killer at heart. Perry, who very likely was a killer at heart, wanted to bring along black stockings to wear over their heads so they wouldn't have to kill anyone, even though he's the one who precipitiously decided to start the killing spree. It turned into a situation that no one, killers or victims, seemed to have any control over at the crucial moment. Dick was a type often seen, even today - gregarious, personable, greedy, envious of others who had more, shallow and vain. Perry was a much more complex person, which is probably why Capote formed such a close, personal relationship with him during the writing of the book. You can't help but feel sorry for him & see in the man the stunted, rejected, terrified and terrorized little boy he was, and in some ways remained. Superstitious, somewhat straight-laced in sexual matters and given to magical thinking, it's impossible to figure out his motive in these killings. The author captures every nuance of every personality involved, not just the family and the killers, but also the lawmen involved and some of the townspeople. He delves deeply into the lives, politics, religious beliefs and social structure of that particular part of Kansas. Although I had forgotten much of this book from the first time I read it, it was the book that started me on a decades-long fascination with non-fiction crime books. This is a fascinating, extremely skillfully written book, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a book they absolutely can't put down. And when you can't put down a book that you totally know the ending of, that's a pretty high compliment!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The book was great. It was a little tough to get into at first because of all the detail but once I got used to that, I loved it."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"\\"In Cold Blood\\" is my fifth book by Truman Capote, and my second favorite (after \\"The Grass Harp\\"). The beginning is very riveting and engrossing, but it begins to lag by the 210th page, when the criminals are caught. By then, Capote is just buying time and the reader is just waiting for the inevitable. Before that, the reader is curious as to the specifics of the crime, and much is delivered. One does often wonder how Capote found out such specific detail and word-for-word details of conversations. I recommend."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In reading this book, you will not get blood spilled on your lap nor will you get your hands tarnished with it. It is, however, a chilling, unbelievable, tragic, sad and anger provoking story. The author accomplishes a means to an end of a horrifying senseless murder in an artistic manner akin to a Shakespearean tragedy.It is the authors' artistic style of writing that makes the contents of the story discerning, but palpable and tragic at the same time. It is through the author's artistic penmanship that makes the reader come face to face with the feelings of sadness, anger, resentment and disbelief, but with peace of mind at the end.In spite of its contents, the reader will not want to close the book until justice is done. The author accomplishes that end in a subtle, but heart-wrenching way and without spilling bad blood on the reader."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"One of the first true crime novels to be written in a narrative style, this book is touching at times and foreboding at others. The subhead of the book is \\"A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences,\\" but the book delves deeper than that. On November 15, 1959, a family of four, the Clutters, is brutally murdered \\"In Cold Blood\\" by two would-be thieves looking for something that doesn't exist. Capote's words make me feel sympathetic toward one of the murderers, Perry Smith, while--perhaps unintentionally--detesting the other, Dick Hickock. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the book in the same way that I did Helter Skelter and To Die For, the latter being a fictional crime novel. However, I would recommend reading it before seeing Capote, because the film influenced my opinions of the book more than I thought it would."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Arguably Capote's best work, certainly a truly compelling masterpiece of literature. I read it in high school, again some years ago, and having just seen the phenomenal film Capote, it was even better, even more compelling."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"My interest in this book stemmed from the Hoffman film. It turns out to be a fantastic read. Investigation into the book prior to reading talked about how violent and disturbing it was, but it struck me as being more sad than anything. What happened to the family was horrible, yet the sympathy that I think Capote was trying to evoke for the murderer, which I didn't want to associate with. Didn't really appreciate the seemingly contrived end meeting, but probably had more to do with finishing Frey's fairytale. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood is another masterpiece by Truman Capote. Capote uses his excellent style of writing to capture the reader's attention from the first page. He uses such language to set the plot that the novel seems to be of a fictional account, but is based off of the true events of the November 12, 1959 murders of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas. Capote's incredible use of imagery allows one to see the places he is describing vividly. With the painstaking detail that he uses, one follows the story from the two perspectives, switching back and forth between the Clutter family, and the murderers Perry Smith and Richard Hickock, almost move by move. With such great detail and a compelling story, In Cold Blood is one of the best true crime novels written, and a reminder of Capote's creative brilliance."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book not only told an excellent account of a true event, but told it in a remarkable way. The Holcomb town murder of the Clutter's could have been exaggerated and made into a gruesome and unrealistic story, but In Cold Blood seems to take the factual events and portray them in a reader friendly way. Instead of exploiting the Criminals, family members, and the real events, the detailed descriptions plotting through the minds of various people help you to personally understand what an impact the murders made in Holcomb, as well as across the nation. This story is well written, and is done so by a talented author. The only thing I did not enjoy was the the last chapter which seemed to reiterate alot of information from the preceding chapters, but I also realize this may be beneficial for some readers who read this book over a long period of time."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I initially became aware of this book during reading Bill Bryson 'The Lost Continent:Journeys in small town America', where he visited Holcomb and discussed the Clutter murders. I felt compelled to read 'In Cold Blood' and was not dissappointed. Mr Capote manages to write a fantastic book that gives a fascinating insight into the mentality of the killers. It also demonstates to an extent the damaging consequences of the polarisation of society, between the 'haves' and the 'havenots'. This is a real page-turner that will send shivers down your spine!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"It is impossible for anyone who claims to understand literature to give this book anything but top marks - it is the classic in the genre of true crime writing - mimicked by so many since. If you give this less than top marks - then you should examine yourself - and your ability to differentiate between classic writing and good writing. Here is a good test - go into the crime section of any bookstore and look on the back cover of the books. I guarantee you will find many that state ' best book since Capote's 'In Cold Blood'. Publishers know it, authors know it - this book deserves a full 5 stars"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"&quot;In Cold Blood&quot; has been filmed twice, but the book presents the murder of a Kansas family with a cold truth which is far more unsettling than either film version. The book goes into the minds of the killers, especially the unhinged character of Perry Smith, but manages to present the killers as a product of the failure of society ; it is hard not to feel a measure of sympathy for the killers, and how their murderous ways were a result of their upbringing. Towards the end, the pace lags a bit ; some of the psychoanalysis passages particularly, but this is essential in understanding the killers motivations. Some of the images in the book remain long after the book is finished. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Through his descriptions of the people who live in Holcomb, Capote evoked the picture of a stereotypical 1950's middle-American town. The townsfolk were shown to be caring and neighborly, and the peaceful environment appeared so wholesome and pure. This picture of an ideal environment was best characterized by what we were shown to be an ideal family - the Clutters. However, in chronicling the mystery behind the four deaths, Capote revealed the fragility of Holcomb, its inhabitants, and the idea behind small-town 1950's America. The murders themselves, combined with the prolonged search for the killers, tore apart the seemingly strong fabric of the tightly-knit community and shook the very foundation of the small town. The sweet innocence of Holcomb was quickly and irreversibly corrupted by this first brush with crime, and was immediately replaced with an undercurrent of paranoia and fear in which even the most trusted of friends became wary of one another. In this sense, the deaths of the pure, wholesome, and innocent Clutter family was symbolic of the &quot;death&quot; of Holcomb's way of life which was to follow. Through the chronicle of Holcomb's change in collective attitude, we are at first quick to believe that their change in heart was due solely to the crime itself. However, by displaying the town's distrust even after the killers were captured, Capote reveals that these individuals were no different than anyone else living in any other town or city. The people we once saw to be entirely good-natured were shown to be as untrusting and contemptuous as anyone else might be. Capote shows us that the people of Garden City (or in any other 1950's small town) were of no better character than city dwellers, but because they did not have to face the trials and hardships that people in larger, more crime-ridden cities did, they could afford to be more trusting and neighborly towards one another. But after the murder of the Clutters - the first real crime in Holcomb in numerous years, their change of heart proved the fallacy of small-town America."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"'Fellow humans that come after us, harden not your hearts against us'. These words, inscribed in French at the begining of Capote's 'In Cold Blood' sum it all up. Capote has taken a brutal multiple murder, viewed the incident from all angles, and has produced a work that is gruesome, yet fascinating. What at first seems to be a book about murder soon becomes something more sinister, it becomes a book about society. It becomes a comment on capital punishment and a reminder that even the guilty are human. While not playing down the terrible crimes commited by the books two central characters, Capote shows that even through the dark haze of murder, these two men are still humans, and by showing us a grim image of death row he makes us question the morality of comitting murder to punish murder. By far Capote's best work, 'In Cold Blood' is a masterpiece of factual storytelling that grips the reader from begining to end. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I read this book when it first came out in 1966, and it was the book that hooked me forever on the study of true crime.

Since then I have reread it several times and am never disappointed with the writing, or any less shaken by the crime itself.Mr. Capote's fine telling of the cold and brutal slaying of this &quot;every man's family&quot; leaves the reader with the haunting message that it can happen to anyone, anywhere"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"After seeing the movie with Philip Seymour Hoffman, I've read the biography of Truman Capote.I was interested to read \\"In Cold blood\\" in English, but it was hard to find in Quebec City.I've finally found it and read it during 2011 summer holiday.It's never too late to read a great story, well written and made.Do not hesitate."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"A \\"non-fiction novel\\" about four murders in rural 1959 Kansas.This is probably one of those books where you had to \\"be there\\" for it to have the impact that has propelled this to \\"classic\\" status. Fifty years later, all I could do was shrug.This is not a \\"bad\\" book, but neither is it a masterpiece of any sort. Capote's prose is serviceable, but nothing spectacular. I found his attempts to recreate dialogue between the killers to be one of the most unrealistic (and weakest) aspects of the whole thing. He also has a penchant for going off on tangents, and it felt to me like he was padding the pages. Although I read it cover to cover, I found my mind wandering off A LOT, and the urge to skim or even skip whole paragraphs was a powerful one.I didn't love it, I didn't hate it.

The family is a well liked family from a small town in Kansas, and after the murder the people of the town are terrified, wondering who would kill such nice people. Capote helps you to relate to the victims before their brutal murder and eventually helps you to have sympathy for the two men who savagely murdered them. Capote is able to help you look deep into the minds of two men who are like many other murders in the world today, and help you to understand the question raised in enveryone's mind, why? I found the book extremly interesting. Most murder stories are about the murder case and finding out who did it. I found it interesting to look more into the minds who did it, not just the crime itself. I highly recommend In Cold Blood to those who are interested by murder stories and in depth looks into the live and emotions of the killers."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Not only is Capote's mastery of the English language never more evident than in this book, but he turns a subject matter which at the time was astounding and horrific into a sympathetic tale that helps us understand today's serial killers.

Truman tries to get you to feel sorry for Perry, recounting his abysmal childhood,etc. But really and truly, the man massacred innocent, defenseless people.

It was not quite what I expected, and at times I felt myself thinking that Capote is not quite as talented a writer as people have made him out to be.

Not only was the crime heinous and horrifying, the psycological reasons behind could have filled a book twice the length of this one. Thankfully, Mr. Capote knew exactly what the right blend of physical evidence, (plot), and psycho-history would draw the reader in, yet not confuse the average Joe's mind. And the depth and description of the actual slayings is horrific, yet fascinating. I give this book a 9 only because of the extensive background of every single other inmate on Death Row with the two. It really detracted from the story. It was kind of like saying after 20 pages: &quot;Oh yeah, back to the main charachters.&quot; All in all, however, a great book."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Never before have I been captured so much.I couldn't stop reading and ran into people as I was not able to put down the book on my way to work"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"...nothing will ever be as good as this Capote classic!

For John Gunther it was the courage and affability shown by his son during the boy's struggle with brain cancer. For Pat Frank it was being asked, \\"What do you think would happen if the Russians hit us when we weren't looking?\\" For Truman Capote it was massacre of the Herbert W. Clutter family.Mr. Capote did not actually know Mr. Clutter or any member of his family personally. He read about their puzzling murders in a small New York Times article. The hipster novelist and short story scribe, always looking for a new muse, caught the next train for the Clutter's hometown of Holcomb, Kansas, notebook in hand, to see what kind of work the case might inspire. Throughout the six years Mr. Capote spent researching and writing his \\"non-fiction novel,\\" he carefully observed the community of Holcomb; witnessed the search for, capture and eventual execution of the Clutters' murderers (Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, two excons who were given misinformation about a safe Herbert Clutter supposedly kept in his office. Mr. Capote interviewed both extensively) and found literary gold.In Cold Blood is an American masterpiece. From the warm, vivid caricature of Holcomb to the extensive biographies of Dick and Perry to the stark portrayal of death row, the novel displays our country at its best (The Clutters' wholesomeness; Perry's childish sense of adventure; the intimacy of Holcomb) and at its worst (The decadence and abuse of Perry's childhood; Dick's utter callousness; the vengeful execution of the duo). The imagery that makes up In Cold Blood is bound to become deeply insaturated into the psyche of any reader both because of its poignancy and because it is so masterfully verbally painted. The story is told from the golden pen of an author who has obviously, carefully measured every scene, paragraph and sentence for its impact.Be it the significant weight of the subject matter (Localism, stability, adventure, greed, murder, capital punishment and the links that connect all are all explored), the personal connection Mr. Capote felt by being in Kansas and knowing the \\"characters\\" or some other inspiration, the author exhumed magnificent, spell-binding skill and style, that was evident, yet not fully emerged, on his previous works. For In Cold Blood, the chemistry flowed, the stars aligned, the doors opened and a master was truly born. The novel is truly a monumental classic."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Capote writes this book like a huge newspaper article. The novel lacks something that I can't quite put my finger on. Either his writing style is bland and personality free or the story is so cliched and typical that it's just tedious too stay focused on it. I agree with many reviewers who complained about the book's details being uninteresting and unnecessary too the plot. I did like the humanizing of the criminals however which I think many novels lack. I gave the book three stars because in hidesight (I read it 5 months ago) I think I learned something from this trite and overly detailed true crime story. (This is a very MIXED review, I know. Well, read the book just because it's a classic, although I'm not quite sure why this stands out in history above others.)"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I bought this book because of the publicity surrounding the film Capote. The film did not surpass my expectations, the book did."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This is not exactly a detective story, as the case is very well-known, and the author gave the identities of the two killers upfront. What is left to find out are (1) how the two were discovered, (2) psyche of the two [one were left wondering how these 2 would do such monstrous cruel acts to innocent everyday people]Very well written -- in very vivid graphical descriptive details, so much so that one could easily visualize the goriness, and at times i would like to throw up owing to the nauseous facts.Capote turned a non-fiction piece into spell-binding fiction, interspersed with dialogs, and what must have been for the unfortunate family.I would put in on par with Christie, as Capote examined the thinkings of the killers, rather like Miss Marple using psychology to figure-out \\"who-dun-it\\".But unlike Christie, don't read this on a full stomach!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote emerged as a prominent author during the post-war period. Capote was known for his open homosexuality and other controversial opinions. His most popular literary works include Breakfast at Tiffany's and In Cold Blood. Capote was inspired to write In Cold Blood after reading an article on the recent Clutter family murder. For five years Capote researched and interviewed the murderers and the citizens of Holcomb, Kansas, and neighboring Garden City, Kansas. The book is hard to categorize and could be called a work of non-fiction or a work of journalism. No matter what genre you label the book as, it tells the same story. Amazon.com summarizes the book as a new breed of literature that narrates the story of the shocking and brutal murder of the ideal family and what happens to the murderers. The tragic story is one the readers won't soon forget. The book was made into a 1967 movie that was nominated for four Oscars.The book takes place first in Holcomb, Kansas, on the Clutter family farm. The reader gets a taste of the Clutter family's picture-perfect lives. Herb worked hard to make his beautiful estate what it was at the time of the family's deaths and support his family. Herb's wife, Bonnie, suffers from mental illness. She tries hard to keep up with the family and town, and Herb still loves and cares for her very much. He pleads with his murderers not to harm Bonnie because she's \\"an invalid\\" and she's been accomplishing so much in terms of getting back to normal that it would be unfortunate for something traumatic (like what Herb thought was just a robbery) to set her back in her recovery to a normal mental state. Nancy is a busy and popular high school girl with a boyfriend, Bobby Rupp, whom she loves. (For lack of any other obvious suspects, Bobby is the first accused of the Clutter family murder. This suspicion was based on a diary entry and apparent conflict between Nancy and Herb on the topic of Bobby. Herb had asked his daughter, Nancy, many a time to stop the relationship with Bobby. Herb didn't dislike Bobby's personality; he just preferred that Nancy see someone of her same religion. Religion was very important to Herb and his family.) Nancy holds leadership positions in many organizations in town and in high school. Kenyon is the younger brother who loves adventure and building things. These four individuals are important, respected, and admired persons in the small, tightly knit community they reside in. Though the reader only receives a miniscule glimpse into the lives of the Clutters, their ideal family image is memorable and makes the characters believable and their deaths more distressing.The book also follows the story two men (the main characters), Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, on their journey to rob (and murder) the Clutters and then on their expedition to Mexico and other exotic lands in search of a paradise they will never arrive at. Smith is short and stocky in contrast to Hickock's taller, leaner build. Hickock is Smith's partner in crime. Smith was in a motorcycle accident as a young adult (which accounts for his disproportionate legs and his aspirin addiction). Toward the end of the book, the physician reviewing Smith considers possible brain damage due to the motorcycle collision. No tests had been done up until the time of the trial or would be done afterward to prove or disprove this theory. Capote doesn't bring us too closely to the murderer's minds until they are finally in police custody and grilled until the officers obtain confessions. A doctor is brought in during the court case to analyze the mental states of Smith and Hickock, and though the court doesn't allow the doctors to supply more than a yes or no answer to the question of the murderers' sanity, Capote includes the censored opinions and evaluations. Capote does this because he believes there is more that should be considered and evaluated by the jury on the terms of the defendant's mental stability than a simple yes or no. Not only is the consideration of mental disruption brought up in an analysis of Hickock and Smith's backgrounds, but it is also brought up as a general disorder that causes any normal person to kill. The court doesn't take these pleas into consideration when evaluating the court case and deciding on a verdict.Capote tells this story in an unusual way. The reader is present during the murder of the Clutters, so (contrary to most murder-mysteries,) the mystery isn't a who-done-it. Instead, the reader is kept in suspense waiting to find out what happens to the murderers. Do they get away clean like they had planned or do they leave behind one fatal clue that links them to the crime? I was also in suspense for any real motive to be revealed (if Smith and Hickock even had one) for the murder of the family. Capote offers different characters' perspectives on the situation and keeps the reader in suspense by vaguely connecting the accounts without telling the full story straight out. Capote saw the book as a challenge to interestingly tell a story everyone had been familiar with due to the enormous amount of press it had received. In Cold Blood was published just one year after the deaths of Smith and Hickock. The book was definitely a different kind of murder-mystery.\\"The big yellow bird\\" appears repeatedly throughout the story in Smith's dreams. This golden bird represents an escape to paradise for Smith. He has had a life of trial and tribulation, but hoping for some kind of angel to rescue him from his troubles does no good. It is possible for Smith to clean up his life and obtain success on his own merit. In the end, Smith's savior and utopia are nothing more than just a dream. Smith's fictional escape shows a lot about his character.Another symbol later in the book and less repeated is the pair or shabby stray cats that regularly patrol Holcomb looking for scraps of bird carcass in the grills of traveling vehicles. Perry had curiously watched the cats' odd habits from his jail cell, but once Mrs. Meier explained the cats' motives, Perry could watch no more. He painfully admitted to his life being too similar to that of the dirty, feline scavengers who moved from car to car living on minimal meals the road kill found in the cars could provide and their friendship.The theme of the book involves the upsetting murder of the Clutter family. The Clutter family is a symbol of the All American Dream, and the murderers represent any given disaster that could completely destroy something so fragile as dreams. All the work Herb Clutter did to work himself from the bottom to the top was not in vain, but it was brought to a rapid halt with the robbery-gone-wrong of Smith and Hickock. The lives of a family came to an unfortunate end, but while they were alive they lived their lives well and didn't waste a day. This book also carries a smaller message to live your life to the fullest, for you never know when your time is up. This example is demonstrated in the fulfilling lives of Nancy and Herb Clutter and when the detectives decide that due to the unusual circumstances of the almost coincidental murder, the family might as well have suffered in a natural disaster (ex: struck by lightening). It's upsetting to the detective that there was no motive for such an unfortunate murder, but maybe it could be at the same time sort of calming to know that the Clutters did indeed leave this earth with not an enemy, not even the men who viciously murdered them. The information presented in the last section reflects Capote's opinions on murder cases and the death penalty. Capote chose to include information about the mental analysis of the murderers that the court refused to hear because Capote believed this was important information in determining the guilt or innocence of the criminals. He also brings up an article from \\"The American Journal of Psychiatry\\" which discusses the validity of \\"'sane'\\" and \\"'insane'\\" murderer classifications.I would recommend this book to anyone who appreciates good writing. The details of the murders may be a little bit too gruesome for some readers, but it's easy to skip over those parts (there aren't too many recollections of the murder scene). Even if one is familiar with the story of the Clutter family, this book still holds suspense and surprises with the way it was written. Capote spent a very long time with the murderers in order to fully absorb their character. Capote's opinions on the sanity of murder and the validity of the death penalty come through in the book and make the reader start questioning his or her own beliefs. It's a very eye-opening book written in a new style of non-fiction without being too biased either way."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Having never read anything by Truman Capote and after seeing the Oscar-nominated \\"Capote,\\" I was inspired to pick up (finally) IN COLD BLOOD. I was a bit annoyed by Capote's personality in the movie and realized that I could have never stood to be in the same room with him because his self-love would have drive me crazy. I didn't let that stop me from purchasing the book, though, as I had heard good things about his writing and his \\"masterpiece.\\"I've often been disappointed by books, but finished them to completion for the sake of not jumping to conclusions. Unfortunately, this is one book that I had to stop halfway through because, again, Capote's personality seemed to be shining through and I was getting annoyed. I know I'm going against the grain of many critics, educators, and readers alike, but I was not enjoying one bit of my reading experience.I found his writing to be the rambling of a man who couldn't keep one consistent thought going (perhaps it was the alcohol?). It was like reading a stream of consciousness that wasn't going anywhere. His thoughts jumped from past to present and back again without any cohesiveness. Halfway through the book, I was still unfamiliar with the \\"characters\\" and much of their personalities. If it gets better in the second half of the book, I'll never know.Go ahead...give me a poor rating for my review.

I mean, the book starts with the slaying of the most interesting characters in the entire book. It is tough to recover into an 'interesting' story from that plot line.I will read other Capote books, but stick to his Fiction in the future.2 stars deducted for high &quot;boring factor&quot;."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"i thought this book was very thought provoking, but at times pretty dull.

The only turn off to this book that I have is that it is a VERY slow read. It goes into so much unneeded detail that some of the pages are not even relevant to the story. I think that this book would of been better if there would of not been as many unneeded details dealing with characters that do not even need to be in the story. Truman Capote obviously knew a lot about this story and its murders and family. This bood is very moving and sad in knowing that these two men took the lives of a whole innocent family and did not feel any remorse at all. I am glad that in the end they got the punishment they deserved."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Though this book is well written, I just didn't have the stomach for it. If you love to look at the morbid side of life, however, this is your book. It forces you to look at ugly brutality, and even to empathize with nearly every character in the story including the killers. Truman Capote can write so well that you nearly feel you are them. But who wants to do that? Anyway, the book gave me nightmares, and I'm glad to be done with it, and now I will retreat into my nice happy place.

Questions such as who and why made me wonder who could it have been. There were so many characters and possible suspects that it was also fun to try to guess who did it before the book revealed it.

I read a handful of reviews, however, that said that what the killers did was so inhumane (or inhuman) that they themselves were not human. This view is denial of simple compassion. If we cannot feel unconditional compassion for one another sometimes, how human are we? And the silly, impish idea that &quot;what they did was bad - they can't be human!&quot; is a denial of human failure. If you can't handle grey areas - which this book embraces and details so masterfully: don't read it. And feel pity for Perry, if nothing else because he was one of us."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Being part of the generation that was a child in the mid-60's when In Cold Blood came out, it had become a part of my consciousness of the literature that was \\"out there\\" that one should read. \\"Ground-breaking\\"; \\"a new form of writing\\"; and all that. And the story itself, about the brutal murders in Kansas, became absorbed into our cultural psyche, especially after the release of the movie. But somehow, I had never gotten around to actually reading the book itself. Now, am I glad I finally have! Capote's style moves you quickly through the story, beginning by establishing the context to care about the people - he gets you to know the Clutters, the family who was killed. He gets you to know the killers. He gets you know the cops and the KBI agents and the townsfolk and all those connected to the event. But HOW he does it - I've read no more breathtakingly well-done characterizations in all of literature. With brevity, and impact, and memorability, Capote delivers sketches of these folks that has the reader \\"into\\" them quickly and deeply, and caring about what happens to them. And isn't that, after all, the point? Even if you've seen the film; even if you think you know what the book will be like - do yourself a favor and read the real thing, and you will understand why this caused such a stir on its release, and why we should all mourn the early self-destruction of this wonderful writer."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"when In Cold Blood was released, the title was flashed in Times Square...to date, I believe no true crime book has ever achieved such a reaction from the reading public, and such honor. I read In Cold Blood more than once over the years, there is a depth and richness added to the telling of a horrible crime story, that goes well beyond reciting cold facts. Capote lends a special psychological insight to the reader, as one reads about not just the crime, the act, but the people that were involved. Capote makes it possible to reconstruct the lives of the dead innocents simply from the life residue they left behind and he allows us to venture safely into the dangerous animalistic minds of the killers. In Cold Blood impacts you not only intellectually, but emotionally---and that is what the great craft of writing is all about."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"A spectacularly written true account of the 1959 murders of the Klutter family. Taking the reader to the lives of the killers and victims before the murder, the subsequent events, arrest, and executions, Capote allows the readers to empathize with everyone involved in the senseless act of violence. Gripping and an excellent example of non-fiction writing. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This is a non-fiction account of a murder that reads like a novel. Capote writes this and develops the characters and plots as if he is creating the whole story. He writes a comprehensive journalistic account of all aspects of this murder. It is a very revealing book about the criminal mind and about community. It is a worthy book to read and was innovative for its time. Instead of reaching for the latest best-selling thriller, read this one first."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In the story \\"In Cold Blood\\" by Truman Capote, I found out that this man performed very extensive research to create this book. He was very particular when he described the characters and the surroundings of the city. When he would identify areas of the city, Truman would describe it well enough that anyone who visited there could find a street, a building, or anyplace else in Holcomb. He told how the character looked, what they did, and even what some of them were wearing. His eye for detail made this book very exceptional because it made me want to read even more. I felt like I knew each and every character and what their hopes and dreams were for themselves and their families. Truman had a unique way of writing each and every paragraph of the story. He would start off one of the paragraphs talking about the Clutters, and the next paragraph would be about Perry Smith and Dick Hickock. Sometimes it was confusing because I would be reading a paragraph about the men planning the murder and the next paragraph would be about Nancy helping a little girl learn to bake a pie. I realized that this was the way Truman would help his readers to identify what was going on in the story by letting you get to know each of his characters. He told how the investigation went on for months and how the detectives were able to crack the case. I will not go into any detail about the case because this is such a masterpiece of nonfiction. Everyone who has a chance should read this book because I think it was one of the best books that I have ever read and I hope to read more of his books in the future."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Maybe it's because I was only 16 when I read this book, but I was scared to death for over a month after I read it. Truman Capote is an excellent storyteller who captivates the reader from the beginning by using the true accounting facts in which he personally investigated himself. Capote shows true empathy for the two men who were responsible for all the chaos that took place back in 1959. By doing so, he shows the truth behind the lives of the convicts themselves and the truth as to what happened the night of the murders. I recommend this book to everyone, especially to those who love TRUE CRIME books!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book is one of the most complete and best murder stories of all time. The writing is very easy to follow, and there are plenty of ways to make a project out of it (as I did for my Junior Project). The order, however, is somewhat iffy. It is told from the perspectives of the criminals and of the townsfolk in Holcomb, Kansas. While the townsfolk are searching for answers, you already know the answers, so I suppose it cannot really be called a murder mystery. And the fact that the book skips over the time period when the murder actually occurred left me slightly frustrated. Overall, nevertheless, this is a good book."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"From funny little Truman Capote came this classic and extraordinary novel detailing a horrific true-crime case. Consistently gripping and a chilling anthorpological study. If only he'd have written more like this....but the author's own personal obsession with one of the killer's must surely have contributed to its uniquely studied and strangely objective take."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I've read this book by a suggestion of an American boy(I'm Turkish). What influenced me most about this book was that you may guess who the murderer is easily or you may find the outcoming events very expectable but you can't stop reading. That's most probably because of your arousing feelings for the players of the novel and the tremendous desire to become a player in the story to change somethings. I think that the book consists psychologic inside rather than detectiveness or homicide."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Never has a book so completely enveloped an era, a culture and the effect of a horrific tragedy upon it.Few people do not know about the murder, the conviction and the result. Some might know about the investigation, the names, or the places. However, these factual nuggets are but trivia now half a century later and do not begin to describe the depth and soul of Capote's account.The murders would undoubtedly be horrific even today, although without the sharp sting of novelty they must have had then. However, while central to the story, are woven into the tapestry of the book with such subtlety, such remarkably constructed restraint and objectivity that the trap of sensationalizing the event is avoided. Yes, this is the story of four cold-blooded murders, but more than that, it is the depiction of an era, the reasoning behind what makes good men bad, the impact of tragedy upon normality and the deconstruction of black and white, or open and shut. It is a remarkable achievement that Capote manages to wrestle a measure of sympathy from his readers for all involved, from the Clutters, to Dewey and his men, and yes, even the killers.Capote bled this book out of his system for five years and it was not without it's price. For his pains, he created one of the best books of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book set the precedent for nonfiction thrillers. It's a classic. Capote entwines himself in the lives of the victims and the killers, and it's easy to become engaged in it. It's a guilty pleasure - one feels terrible knowing these terrible crimes were committed, but the book is tough to put down!The element that set Capote's book apart from former nonfiction is the attachment he creates to the characters involved. He does this by artfully weaving details into the story, such as what the father ate for breakfast (always just an apple). The emotions touched by this book are heartbreaking, but very human and necessary. Not for the faint-of-heart."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I don't like classics but I liked this due to it being a true crime story. This was the book that suposily started the genre. It is very well written although I think Capote fictionalizes some aspects of the criminal characters to flesh them out more in the book. Some of the language used is old fashioned, but this was written in the 1950s so what can you expect."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Published in 1965, this story about a senseless murder in 1959 in America that is so very relevant today. Truman Capote's accomplishment must have been a 'labor of love' as this very difficult story was so thoroughly researched and artfully composed into narrative. The reader is directly exposed and steeped in the details of this murder - I think - in order to evoke empathy toward the victims and to a certain although much lesser degree the killers too.What is the point of this book besides scaring you silly? Simply stated I think ultimately this is a debate on whether capital punishment is ethical and whether the defense of insanity is applied in court in a fair manner. The issue of capital punishment is what makes this a uniquely American crime story. Capote portays two murderers and one murder scene. He goes into a vast amount of detail on the killers lives. The reader feels they know both murderers personally. The book's subtext in my opinion is a series of debatable questions: Are these two killers equally responsible for the murders committed? Is one killer more deserving of capital punishment than the other? Are both equally beyond redemption? Is the killer that pulls the trigger more responsible than the one that plans the murder? Are both sane?These questions are left for the reader to decide. By exposing us to the intimate details of the victims lives and deaths, the reader sits in the jury box. By providing the reader with additional information on the killers backgrounds, childhoods etc., we are made privy to information that would never be allowed in court of law.Whether or not you care to delve into any of these ethical questions on capital punishment and whether insanity is a defense, the book is a fascinating read and a pioneer in literature."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"If you are interested in 20th century literature, then this book is essential. It sheds light on the loss of innocence after the Industrial Revolution in America and how we changed from a largely peaceful populice to the somewhat violent and apathetic society today.

Very interesting - this is the original true crime novel!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood by Truman Capote4 is a book about a family that was murdered. Truman Capote explained how the families grow up, and the background of those around them. THe story takes place in Holcomb, Kansas, in 1959. The author also goes in deep of the killer's background. I could never image how much these people put into planning a murder.The Clutter family members killed in 1959 was father Herbert William, mother Bonnie, daugher Nacy, and son Kenyon. This was a good well known family. The book talks about how they grow up and there relationshiips with others. This family was a good well known church going family as well.

Truman Capote's IN COLD BLOOD clearly endures this test. In this famous &quot;nonfiction novel&quot;, Capote tells the tale of the cold-blooded murder of a Kansas family. The images Capote presents still remain fresh. The consequences of the murderers' crimes are also given vivid play. All in all, IN COLD BLOOD remains a powerful book decades after it was written."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The greatest authors don't write formula fiction or non-fiction, they create the template themselves. Truman Capote did this with In Cold Blood, the chilling dissection of a brutal and mysteriously nonsensical American crime. The True Crime category he founded has been used and enjoyed many times since.Capote does so many things right in this book that his writing gift becomes immediately obvious. Following the footsteps of the two criminals and analyzing their flawed motivations is both instructive and entertaining. He recreates each moment of the developing disaster, building suspense with clarity and understatement, allowing the facts and reality to carry the impact, rather than fancy sensationalized verbiage. But he drills beyond the details of the crime into the psyche of the two killers, divining answers to the what seems unanswerable to rational persons: why kill these people? The result is an interesting literary platform from which both opponents and proponents of capital punishment and childhood intervention can preach.I find corollary with Wambaugh's The Onion Field. Can't go wrong with this one. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote does a great job of portraying the family and the killers.

He fills in what he obviously can't know, such as the thoughts of the soon-to-be-murdered victims.Since this book's publication, many imitations have followed, but &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; still stands out.What Capote does best is the cultivate an interest in, and even sympathy for, all involved, not just the murdered Clutter family and their grieving friends, but also their two murderers, especially the sensitive soul, Perry Smith.Capote is a master of his form. As any writer does, he manipulates the slippery truth, pinning down one version of reality that will remain in the minds of readers."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This is the best thriller I've ever read, bar none. Capote's acclaimed &quot;non-fiction novel&quot; is just that: a true-crime masterpiece that turns &quot;immaculate facts&quot; into remarkable prose. It reads like a movie-in-prose with its numberless chapters and ominous intercutting between the lives of two pathetic drifters with those of their poignant victims. It's perhaps the best account of American violence ever written."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I've always known about this book, and I knew it was considered a classic, but somehow I ignored it. Don't ignore this book! It is a flawlessly written true account of the brutal cold-blooded murder of a family of four in 1959. There are certain chapters of this book that are absolutely mesmerizing. Perry's confession may be one of the most harrowing accounts I have ever read, fiction or non-fiction. And what makes it more compelling is that it's true. In retrospect, I can see the influence this book has had on the mystery and crime genre. It adds credibility to all of the fictional criminals that you read about in your favorite mystery novels. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I read it six years ago and haven't read it since, although I would like to again. The most I remember about the book was its first few chapters, on the murder of the Clutter family. How Nancy's friend ran out screaming, &quot;Nancy's dead!&quot; About Nancy's stuffed bear. How the teacher who entered the Clutter house and recognized Kenyon even though he had been shot in the face. All of these were hauntingly descriptive. The second half was about the trials, but I was more hooked on the first half. Even though it happened more than 40 years ago, I know the Clutter family are at peace and so are the people who knew the family when they were young. The Cold War ended, Vietnam came and went, techonological revolution took place, but the story of the Holcomb murders will never be altered."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In this expos&eacute; of a murderer's mind, Truman Capote paints a vivid montage composed of juxtapositional stories. As the actors in Capote's Drama, the residents of Holcomb are portrayed alongside the facinorous killers, creating a collage of thoughts and emotions, which clash together but ultimately concoct a novel exploring the depths of the human metaphysic. Capote used his words to convey the despair of the town, the adulation of the Clutters, the desperation of the investigators and so forth. Capote, while not placing himself within the novel, gives the reader the same sense of ambivalence he must have felt as his acquaintances walked up to the noose. We are given a sense of realism which was previously unmatched. This radically new and groundbreaking style, which was unique to Capote at the time, introduced a new genre: the nonfiction novel. This book is not for those who are in search of an action-packed afternoon read. This a meticulously crafted portrait of the corruption of America and the American Dream, and is thought provoking to say the least. I enjoyed it greatly, largely due to the previously unseen style in which this novel was written. It has a very, very slow pace, but is an ultimately rewarding read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I read this book at 13 at the recommendation of my brother, and it was as magnificent a literary achievement as I have ever read.

Like the waters of the river, like the motorists on the highway, and like the yellow trains streaking down the Santa Fe tracks, drama, in the shape of exceptional happenings, had never stopped there.\\" These few lines don't let you know how enthralling \\"In cold blood\\" is going to be, but at least they give you an idea of how easily you will be drawn into the rural world that Capote described, and into the story he recounts.Yes, a horrible crime destroyed in November of 1959 the peace the little town of Holcomb was so proud of. Four members of the Clutter family were killed, by unknown killers, by unknown motives. The Holcomb massacre became a mystery that interested the whole nation, but one that nobody could solve.Of course, if you read this book you will know who killed the Clutter family, and why, because you will be privy to the thoughts of the killers, and witness their actions. What were they thinking and how does a cold blooded killer turn into one are merely some of the answers you will find in Capote's book.Needless to say, you will also be thoroughly entertained by an extremely good book, written by an author that takes an event that really happened and turns it into a masterpiece, a classic that has already secured its place in literature, and that should also have a place in your library. It certainly has one in mine. Highly recommended!Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This is Capote at his best. I'm going to state what I think is its flaw first and then discuss the strengths-- the only problem I have is that the writing seems forced and pretentious at times. Now, with that out of the way, I must say this is a brilliant book. The character sketches are among the best. You get a strong sense of who each character really is-- even down to the parents of the killers. You know how each character developed of failed to develop as a human being-- at times haunting and at times beautiful, this is a masterpiece, the book that started the genre. {...}"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood ranks right at the top of my list. I've read it at least eleven times in 5 years, and that will most likely continue. It is engaging in the way it reads entirely like a novel, yet you must remind yourself that it is not simply a novel, but a detailing of one of the most brutal crimes in history."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I first read 'In Cold Blood' in the late 1960s as a young teenager, didn't think much of it, and subsequently forgot all about it. However I when I discovered a copy at a secondhand bookstore I decided to give it a try - after all, I am a fan of true crime books (especially those from Ann Rule). I'm very happy I made the purchase.'In Cold Blood' reads entirely like a novel, which is good since Capote writes beautiful prose but it's also bad because the reader has no idea what is fact and what is conjecture on the part of the author. While the crime involved, the brutal slaying of a rural Kansas family circa 1960, is horrific it is not the main focus of the book. The author concentrates on the wasted lives of the murderers, a stark contrast to the picture-perfect lives of the victims. So 'In Cold Blood' is more of a character study rather than an exercise in police investigative techniques, courtroom drama, or forensic science which seem to be prevalent in modern true crime stories.Bottom line: rural Americana of years gone by like we never knew or simply chose to forget.

De los millones y millones cometidos a lo largo de la historia de la humanidad much&iacute;smos de ellos han sido incorporados a la literatura universal porque a ciertos autores les han parecido encantadores y dignos de perpetuarse en la memoria colectiva.Recordemos el inicial, que es la muerte de Abel y ha quedado registrado en el G&eacute;nesis. En &Eacute;xodo el nombre de Mois&eacute;s se escribe despu&eacute;s de un homicidio cometido por el propio Mois&eacute;s en la persona de un egipcio. En el Nuevo Testamento se narra una muerte Redentora que es el asesinato colectivo cometido contra Jes&uacute;s el Cristo. El escritor ing&eacute;s Thomas de Quincey se enamor&oacute; tanto de ciertos cr&iacute;menes que lleg&oacute; a escribir un libro muy famoso titulado El Asesinato considerado como una de las Bellas Artes de recomendable lectura. Francisco Villa se lanz&oacute; a la Historia despu&eacute;s de asesinar y su biograf&iacute;a de bandolero sentimental fue agon&iacute;a y &eacute;xtasis de los revolucionarios hasta antes del dos de julio de 2000. El licenciado Donaldo Colosio fue un bur&oacute;crata mediano y al momento de su muerte se encontraba sin trabajo, pero su violento homicidio en marzo de 1994, lo lanz&oacute; a la Historia (con may&uacute;sculas).Con el asesinato (1892) de los estadounidenses esposos Borden cometidos por su hija (Lizzie Borden took an ax ...), seg&uacute;n ciertos crimin&oacute;logos, nos encontramos al m&aacute;s encantador, dig&aacute;moslo con elegancia, de los cometidos \\"entre particulares\\", por distinguirlos de los abundantes asesinatos cometidos contra hombres p&uacute;blicos (contra C&eacute;sar, contra Lincoln, contra Obreg&oacute;n, contra un regidor suplente en mi pueblo que es Las Choapas).El adulterio, adem&aacute;s del asesinato o el suicidio, ha hecho surgir novelas memorables: Ana Karenina de Tolstoi, Rojo y Negro de Stendhal, El Amante de Lady Chatterley de Lawrence, Servidumbre Humana de Somerset Maugham (es patol&oacute;gico el deseo de Philip de ser humillado por Mildred. En cierto momento, ambos aspiran al suicidio o al homicidio), Romeo y Julieta de Shakespeare (obra bonita porque los muchachos se matan. Los une el amor y la muerte dicen los cursis). Fausto de Goethe es, digamos, una muerte en vida (frase de mi abuela, qepd), por la inquietante relaci&oacute;n de Fausto con Mefist&oacute;feles. En Los Tres Mosqueteros de Dum&aacute;s las novias de los mosqueteros son mujeres casadas lo que quiere decir que yo me quedo con el adulterio y la muerte como leit motiv y dejo a otros lectores la aventura de los diamantes que Artagnan rescatar&aacute; en Inglaterra. Matar a la mujer a la que uno ama desesperadamente es el tema central de la violenta noveleta El T&uacute;nel de Ernesto S&aacute;bato.Nunca un crimen ha sido, dig&aacute;moslo sin elegancia, nunca ha sido tan comercial, como el que dio origen a la novela A Sangre Fr&iacute;a del escritor homosexual norteamericano Truman Capote. Capote hab&iacute;a escrito obras regulares, pero un buen d&iacute;a tropez&oacute; con crimen cualquiera en el que dos hombres cualesquiera asesinan a cuatro cualesquiera miembros de una familia de tantas. Capote se enamora de este crimen, de un crimen m&aacute;s de los tantos que abundan, cometido en noviembre de 1959 contra los Clutter (los padres, un hija y un hijo adolescentes). Capote hace una obre de arte de estos hechos triviales (por lo recurrentes) hallados al azar en un peri&oacute;dico."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote is a superb writer. In Cold Blood reminded me ofanother story I just read, A Reason To Live by Dale Hudson andBilly Hills. Both of these books are compelling page turners withstrong characters and plots which propel the stories forward. Ihad read somewhere that Capote was so involved in the charactersof his story that he never used notes, thus inserting some of hisown self into the story. I think he carried his passion for thecriminals a little too far, as it was unnecessary for him toget sexually involved with the murders. Another good book I recommend is Dead Man Walking. It has the same flavor as In ColdBlood."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"After reading In Cold Blood, I have many emotions running through my head. It is hard for most people to understand why people commit violent crimes. This book doesn't give any answers to that, but it does allow you to see into the lives of criminals before and after they commit a crime. I enjoyed the way the book was written. Capote tells the story from both sides. He tells all about the Clutter family as well as the murderers, Perry and Dick. Capote tells what actually happened in great detail and also what happened to the small town afterwards. I think this is a great book for people of all ages to own and read because the story has such meaning by the end of the book. There are so many &quot;What ifs&quot; that come up that really make one think about the things they do every day. I think it is a book that can mean a great deal if read for leisure, when one has more time to really think about it. It is a great work of literature coming from such a tragic event."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"As Truman Capote takes an in depth look into a brutal murder in a small Kansas town, the audience learns more then they may want to know.

It made me think of murder and intrigue and dank prison walls.In Cold Blood.At first, there was no blood anywhere. The book starts off slow, painfully rehashing each detail of the Clutter families lives in little Holcomb, Kansas and heavily foreshadowing that the happy, average family would die. Right on the cover the book, Capote told the reader. \\"The true story of a multiple murder and its consequences,\\" it said.The explosive end of the Clutter family's day was predictable, but still satisfactorily shocking. Each Clutter died with a shotgun against their head, and the story began.Capote wove a well researched tale of the two criminals, Dick Hickock and Perry Smith, and their mad trip across the country, into Mexico, and then into the clutches of the law enforcement. He wrote of the detectives story, the estate sale, the combined grief of Holcomb, everything from individual prison cells to the audience at the trial. From 8,000 pages of notes, Capote draws 343 pages of focused information. He is carefully aware of the possible dryness of his nonfiction, punctuating his story with eyewitness accounts and playful or quirky scenes.But above all the miscellany and details, one character becomes the story. Perry Smith, the abused, disturbed murderer, is the subject of at least 30 pages of character development. Perry is the opposite of cold. From a childhood of neglect and bitterness, he becomes strange contradiction. From different perspectives, he is scary, polite, pretentious, and, as described in a 3 page long report, psychologically fractured. Capote tells his life story, starting all the way back from when his parents messy separation left him with no money or education.As Perry sits in a cell being character developed, the book also follows the storyline of the trial and eventual conviction. There is no suspense, not even a vague wondering about the outcome, but the beauty of Capote's storyline is in the telling. He has that quality common in classics, where each sentence is not crafted to propel you to the next one, but to be a beauty in itself, to provide insight and new feeling into a tale that is going to be read for years and years to come.And it has been years and years. The Clutter family was murdered 1959, over 50 years ago, but the theme of criminal psychology is still very relevant. Perry Smith could be the man you heard about in Ohio a few months ago, or the newest criminal on Texas's death row. Capote doesn't truly write about the murder, he writes about the murderer.When the trap door falls and Perry breaks his neck, no one can help feeling something. Even murderers feel, and these murderers were ones we grew to know, love, and hate in almost equal quantities. Even murderers don't deserve to die in cold blood."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood has to be one of the most vivid books I have ever read. You can literally picture the whole book like a movie because of the details and amount of information given. It is a gripping story, made that much more so because it is factual. I found the more I learned about the Clutter case from research, along with watching Capote, I liked this book more. It is amazing how much fact Capote was able to use to make a book that reads like a novel. In Cold Blood felt very epic to me. I have never read anything like it. I was taken over by the story. I knew how it ended and basically many things about the case; that didn't change or effect anything about how great this book was. It is not a book written for shocks or for gore. It lays out facts and gives stories and accounts of what happened.This is not the type of book where you relate to the characters, so if you're looking for something relatable I would not recommend this. Or if you hate gore you probably should avoid this, as it lays out the bloody facts of multiple murders. The beginning and very end are a little slow, but they are worth it because they give In Cold Blood a strong start and finish. If you find the first few pages boring definitely keep reading."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Seeing the film 'Capote' on a plane triggered the book's purchase. I had never before read anything by him.There are over 450 reviews of 'In Cold Blood' on Amazon, the great majority of which are positive.However those who dislike it have a number of complaints. Either it's no more than a liberal's campaigning tract against the death penalty or is deformed by Capote's affection for / identification with one the of the killers, Perry Smith. (The film makes much of Capote's connection to Smith but the book doesn't support this interpretation). Others find its narrative descriptions far too meticulous and detailed to the point of dullness.None of these criticisms sticks.It's a fine book which reports a tragedy in plain, almost astringent, English.Capote describes each of the principal characters - victims, killers, investigators, even Kansas itself - with great care, thereby allowing us to understand each of them thoroughly. The events are described carefully and without hyperbole. Nothing is glamourised or magnified. Moral judgement is left to the reader.Because he interviewed the killers their voices and stories come through powerfully. This is not bias. We can't know why Herb Clutter did not react aggressively when Hickock and Smith entered his home on the night of the murders. Capote could not ask him. But he could ask Smith why he did it. If there is pathos it is for Smith's miserable life not for his crimes.Capote has written a moving book about a terrible subject, a tragedy. He did so as a reporter, not as a campaigner, with his opinions and emotions in check. The result is a great book."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"While I love literature, I usually avoid books on tape. Most readers irritate me, and I feel impatient because I could get more out of the text by reading it myself. Not so here! Scott Brick's compelling, thoughtful performance enhanced my experience of the book, without ever feeling over-done or melodramatic. The book itself is fascinating too.

I could not put it down and would stay up to early morning reading it. The one thing that bothered me about this book was the representation of the family. Even though this book reads more like a Novel than a True Crime book, it did do something that most True Crime books do. The Killers overshadowed the victims. I wanted to know more about the killers and I felt Capote did an excellent job of giving us insight into the killers. There was very little said about Kenyon though and I felt that Mrs Clutter was unfairly characterized. I think she battled depression as many people do. Perhaps because it was written in 1965 and not as much was known about it, her illness was referred to as \\"spells\\" and it made her seem a tad bit mentally unstable. I think she was probably a very sweet woman and he could have done a better job in listing more attributes rather than faults. Also I know that the family and town was against this book and so Capote was probably limited on information on them because many would not talk to him. I think he wanted money and publicity and should have respected the family's wishes more. All in all, it was a good book. Even though it happened over 50 years ago, it was like you were there."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"What can I add that 450 other reviewers have already written? This book reminded me of the true crime book entitled Judgment Ridge in which two teen-age boys murdered two Dartmouth professors. Each one needed the other in order to carry out the dastardly dark deed. The same is true in the book In Cold Blood. I watched the movie once, then read the book, and watched the movie once more. Usually when you watch a movie and then read the book of the same story significant differences are noticeable. That is not the case here. I found that both the book and movie follow each other very closely. As is the situation with murder cases of this sort there are no winners. Six people are needlessly dead which includes the murderers, when their sure-fire scheme to get rich goes awry. It would be profitable if others who are contemplating foolproof, in their minds, schemes could learn from cases such as this the book will have served its purpose."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood follows the true murder of the Clutters in Holcomb, Kansas, 1959. This non fiction work is told from a couple of perspectives:- The Clutters, on the day of the murder. You follow them throughout their daily routine, an attempt to see the world through their eyes.- Perry Smith & Dick Hickock: the Lansing cell mates, released on parole, and who teamed up and comitted the 4 murders.- Detective Al Dewey as he tries to connect the dots and find who had killed the Clutters and why.I expected the book to be a fast paced one, where clues would be found every couple of pages and so on. But the fact that you know who the murderers are from the beginning made this a more leisurely paced read, and where you only know the full details of what happened towards the end.The writing style, and the change in narrators made it feel like a work of fiction (and as you read, you really wish it were fiction). I didn't want to feel any empathy for Perry and Dick, and although Capote forces you to see that they had problems, you are left to decide whether you feel for them or not.Towards the end of the book, two works of fiction sprang to mind because of something Perry said. \\"He used to say that all crimes were \\"varieties of theft\\". Murder included.\\" That instantly brought The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini to mind; I remember the father was talking to the protagonist and said something similar to that.Also, later when Perry talks about how he's sorry that he's lost his freedom but not sorry for the crime (that he doesn't really feel anything), I couldn't help but remember Mersault from The Outsider by Albert Camus.The only thing I wish had been dealt with more was the 'why' of the murders. Yes, we got to know about Perry's difficult childhood and Dick's injury, but I guess what I wanted was something unrealistic, a clear cut answer of why what happened happened. And these kinds of things seem to never have answers."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Just yesterday, I was reading an article entitled \\"Rap Sheet\\" by Jill Lepore in the latest issue of The New Yorker. In the article, which had gone into the mysteries of Americans propensity to lead the World in per capita murders, I read about the infamous Petit family slayings of Cheshire Connecticut. What startled me most was that these murders of an affluent Doctor's family by two ex-cons mimicked a long ago infamous family murder of the Clutter family on the Kansas plains nearly 50 years before.Alas, I remember, I read the book! \\"In Cold Blood\\" took Truman Capote 5 years to complete. Being an accomplished fictional writer provided no solace for Capote in which he struggled to get the facts and background of the ordeal and to gain the trust of the people of Holcomb Kansas. When Capote was researching and digging into the facts, not only with the town's people but with the convicted murderers themselves, the Author was unsure if he would ever have a book to show for his efforts.In essence his research and discovery were saved in two places that being in his note taking and what he kept in his brain. In fact Perry Smith, the actual trigger man had asked Capote how the book was progressing. Capote at this time hadn't written a word. Needless to say after giving the Author all he needed to know, this discovery by Smith must have been devastating. In truth all the words spilled forth like a true historical narrative in distinct novel form. The book reads easy in every horrific detail. You can sense the autumn evening and the tension associated with the murders. Everything else flows in a natural and unbelievable transparency of events so common in American murder crimes.As stated in Lepore's New Yorker article, murders such as these seem to take on an American genre all by itself. Almost 50 years later, and the beat goes on. One thing different though, in Capote's rendition of what happened both Mr. Perry and Mr. Hickock were put on trial, convicted and hanged in just over 5 and one half years. The two ex-cons charged with the murders of the Petit family have yet to go to trial for murders committed over 2 and one half years ago. Our justice system seems to have changed in that time.Capote's efforts are to be commended and reflect a true American classic narrative of an American murder. This book reflects Capote's genius, and no I don't have enough stars!!!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman is a wonderful wordsmith, he masterfully brings you first person into the story.. a plus to my collection.. Amazon is a great provider."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Why is truth stranger than fiction? It is because fiction has to make sense. Perfect crimes, crack-shot heroes with unbiased minds, characters without flaws; these things simply do not exist in the real world. To a man, people have flaws. The truth is that, in the real world, murders are committed for trivial motives. Motives that are difficult, even impossible to guess at objectively. With \\"In Cold Blood,\\" Capote created a fascinating story of a real murder committed for no obvious reason. He spent six years writing this documentary, and it shows.Capote does something unusual in a documentary; creating tension between the reader and the story. The reader cannot avoid knowing what the story is about. What is not immediately known to the reader are the details, and the aftermath. The story proceeds at an even pace, following both the killers, law enforcement, and the community of Holcombe. Capote does a good job describing the people involved, and the atmosphere of the town. There are no flat characters here; one can even empathize with the criminals. Once the premise of the story is done, there is yet another gruesome crime; justice meted by the state of Kansas. Bravo, Mister Capote."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote is one of the most captivating writers I have ever read. His style and flare is something that many non-fiction novelists can only dream to one day achieve. This book also brings up great controversy because the last chapter of his book is completely fiction. While writing the book, Capote could not wait for the trial to finish and had pressure from his editors to finish the story. Capote had a dilemma, to leave it unfinished or make up an ending that would be most similar to what would actually end up happening. Much of a perfectionist, he decided to create the last chapter, based on his interviews and his own imagination. It's presents a provocative question of journalism ethics. It was also his choice to intentionally leave this fact for the last page of the book, rather than in the front.Despite the last chapter, the story is still written very well and it's the perfect book for anyone interested in a suspenseful novel."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"What really prompted me to read this book was the film \\"Capote\\" and even though the film focused more on Truman Capote's life the reference to the book and the true story behind it captured my attention. \\"In Cold blood\\" is wonderfully written and I found the descriptive wording, Capote's intricate way of injecting his view of things outstanding.

Chilling examination of the psyches darkside. A caveat ... one feels that the mores of the 1960s or perhaps Capotes own prevents the reader from getting a clear understanding of the nature of the sexpower relationship between the characters and their numerous victims. Capotes descriptions leave a little too much unspoken and thus the reader is left guessing about how they viewed each other and others around them. Capotes own categories seem dated and a bit abstract and literary or academic."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote's In Cold Blood recounts the grisly murder of the Clutter family in this literary work of nonfiction, leading the way in the True Crime genre.Liked:- The embedded interview style used as a vehicle for most of the text was effective and allowed the reader to see a multitude of perspectives.- Paced well in regards to the introduction of the family while they were living, their death and the investigation. I had some issues at the end, which I'll get to.- It was simply interesting- I was rarely bored and it read quite quickly.Except-- There is some definite bias here, which is fine, but readers must acknowledge it- At the end there are, what I believe to be some lengthy profiles of other criminals that aren't really relevant."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book told about how a family was murdered in 1959 by two guys named Dick and Perry that met in prison and were told about how rich this family was by another guy in the prison who had once worked on the family's farm. He told them where they lived and their last name was Clutter. This book is told like a fiction story with the Clutter family talking with each other and friends and neighbors and the guy who worked for them, and then after the parents and their two kids are killed all of the people who knew them in the small town of Holcomb Kansas are talking about them and about the murders. You read about Dick and Perry and hear about their plans and things they do and say while they're travelling, and you read about the police investigation and the police talking, the court case, right up to when the killer Perry and his partner Dick get hanged. This whole book is like a detailed story your reading and is not just like a news report about a murder. You get to know the Clutter family and the police investigators and a little about everyone's life in it and even learn about Dick and Perry's parents and their childhood, which at least helps explain a little why one of them is so weird. They are both psycho, and Dick's a child molester, but Perry is absolutely out of his mind nuts. This book is a little long but it's very good."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Riveting...excellent work by Capote. Reveals why there was substantial interest in making the book into a movie. Capote delicately balances compassion for the victims as well as for the perpetrators of this vicious crime. Highly recommended reading!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood was a trend-setting masterpiece and caused a sensation in its day. It's reappraisal due to the popularity of the recent movie is a blessing for literature. Any device that leads people to rediscover reading, and language, and the art of _telling_ a story is a blessing. And Truman Capote truly ranks as one of the masters of modern American prose, with an incredible grasp for language, story, pacing, setting and narrative, e.a., every element that contributes to the process of communication, the art of writing, and story-telling.In Cold Blood was the first-of-its kind pseudo true-crime novel exploring the darker underside of American society and literally created an entire new genre in writing. For this reason alone it rates as a must-read for anyone interested in pursuing writing as an art or avocation. Quite aside from this, In Cold Blood is just an engrossing read and character study and a joy to read. I read it over twenty years ago and when I recently browsed through the book again the writing in the book came back to me as if I had read it yesterday. Memorable and impressive, and highly recommended!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The most impressive thing about this book, aside from the events, which are true of course, is the absence of \\"style\\".Capote realizes that an evident style (as F. Scott Fitzgerald or Hemmingway for example) would detract from the power of the events and add a surface covering of soapoperaness or the point of view of condemnation or justification that makes Malmud's \\"The Fixer\\" less than the work it could have been in the hands of a genius. Capote shows a kind of genius, or at a minimum very keen judgement in his writing. The movie made from the story was good. It lacks the sense of brilliant detachment that makes this book special. The closest modern author in English I know of is Joseph Conrad. I recommend Capote's book."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood is the quintessential true crime novel. It is the record of two murderers, Dick and Perry. The novel starts out with a good part devoted to telling the story of the the family that Dick and Perry would eventually murder. We are presented an honest, hardworking American family: almost something from Mayberry. We grow to nearly love these characters, or at least have an understanding of what they were. At the same time, we are introduced to Dick and Perry, both of whom have been to jail for check fraud. We are also given an understanding of these characters, and they are each likeable. And then the murder happens.Capote was wise enough to not write what actually happened in the murder, he instead gives the details that the police inspectors working on the case slowly found. The story is true, and was the result of six years worth of research by Capote.However, what is most commendable about it is that it doesn't seem to have any of the author's own feelings about the death penalty. Instead, Capote simply presents us with all the details surrounding a story, so that we may judge accordingly. He makes the killers not into monsters, not into victims, but just people.This is a very long book, and not exactly light reading, so avoid it for a summer vacation novel or if you don't like heavy literature. But, if you really want to read one of the best written novels ever, and come to terms with how you really feel about death and capital punishment, then this should be at the top of your list."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Conscious while documenting the details of the murder of a popular Kansas farming family that he was developing a new literary genre - the nonfiction novel - Truman Capote's truly riveting and exhilarating account is worth purchasing not necessarily to see 'whodunit' but rather to immerse yourself in Capote's wonderful prose and suspend your disbelief regarding 'whodunit'. In this fashion he avoids merely potboiler storytelling and instead offers again not only a page turner, but also a pyschological portrayal that compels to reader to consider sympathizing with the criminals, even though ostensibly they deserve nothing but scorn and hatred.Indeed after the book was completed Tom Wolfe coined the term 'New Journalism' to which he ascribed Capote as one of its leading practitioners. Whether or not Capote liked being catagorized as a New Journalist (he wasn't) or lumped together with certainly less gifted writers, this is clearly one of, if not THE best, of nonfiction novels.Simply put, a must read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In my News Reporting and Writing class, my professor recently brought up the topic of using tape recorders in an interview. While they may be good for \\"covering your ass\\" if you forget a certain point your interview subject made, one must also keep in mind that not everyone is comfortable about being recorded---and making your interview subject comfortable is one of the foremost principles in good interviewing.Truman Capote apparently thought that way too about tape recording. According to my professor, one thing Capote was always proud of about his famous book IN COLD BLOOD was that not once did he feel the need to take out either a tape recorder or even a notebook. In one interview, Capote, admitting to a terrific memory, said, \\"I can repeat almost verbatim any conversation up to as long as eight hours. I could never have written IN COLD BLOOD if I had ever produced a pencil, much less a tape recorder.\\"Knowing about Capote's research methods will only enhance your appreciation for IN COLD BLOOD, a brilliant \\"nonfiction novel\\" in which Capote seems to get into the heads of all of the major characters. It's uncanny, reading what is essentially a piece of journalistic reporting that reads just as vividly as a well-written novel. Not only can Capote conjure up a sense of place, as he does with the small town of Holcomb, Kansas (in which the senseless, horrible slaughter of four members of the Clutter family occur); he brings to remarkable life real-life characters such as Dick Hickock and Perry Smith simply from one-on-one interviews (and some research). Throughout the course of this book, you really get to know these people, for well and ill. By the end, as Hickock and Smith are finally hanged for their crimes, you may even feel a little bit of sympathy for them.But only a little bit. Capote is remarkably even-handed throughout IN COLD BLOOD; like a good reporter, he leaves subjectivity at the door and simply tells a compelling, complex story. Hickock and Smith are not made out to be martyrs of any kind, and Capote doesn't manipulate his prose in order to make it seem like they are. He recounts some of the unfortunate backstories of both these men, but Capote only sets these facts down for the record, not as a way to excuse their crimes. Instead, he tells the story and allows the reader to make his/her own judgments.Capote's objectivity extends into the thorny issue of the effectiveness of the death penalty. Capote makes no blanket statements about that either, but, throughout the book's final section (\\"The Corner\\"), it is an issue that is clearly on his mind. You hear nuggets from people who stand on both sides of the issue, at least in regards to Hickock and Smith. Again, the author does not state, or even imply, a preference for one side or the other. What Capote does---and what, I think, makes IN COLD BLOOD a valuable work in furthering a discussion of the issue---is higlighting the human factor that always makes the death penalty such a difficult issue. Dick Hickock and Perry Smith may have deserved their deaths, because their crime was well-nigh inhumane; but Capote, through his journalistic and stylistic brilliance, always reminds us of their underlying humanity. Their crime may have been monstrous, but Capote never paints them as monsters; they have feelings, and they have hopes and dreams like most of us. Whether that makes their deaths any less excusable is a point that Capote, perhaps unsure himself of where he stands, allows the reader to think about after the book has been finished.And IN COLD BLOOD is so remarkable, so compelling, and so extraordinarily written that it will be hard for anyone to put it down until it has been finished. Even after you've finished though, you might be hardpressed to forget it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Many critics agree that a new genre was born when Truman Capote wrote In Cold Blood. Capote takes a true crime report and presents it in the form of a novel. With his background as a reporter and writer for New Yorker Magazine he developed a unique writing style.In order to gain insight and details of the Clutter family, the victims of the murders, Capote lived in their Kansas town and interviewed the Clutter's friends and neighbors. From those interviews he is able to paint a picture of what life was like for folks in the small rural community of Holcomb, KS. We are given a chance to become familiar with the Clutters to the extent that the reader feels sorrow and horror at the brutality of their deaths.Keeping with his writing in the style of a novel, Capote also gives us a portrait of the killers. Through his interviews with the two murderers, their families, and their associates, Capote again portrays in depth the history, the psyche, and the motive of these killers in his page-turner prose.It is Capote's writing style that draws the reader into his story. His writing is smooth and flowing when he tells us of the life of the Clutter family. But when he shows the reader the murder scene his sentences are short, choppy, and almost breathless. The reader feels that he is actually viewing what went on in that farmhouse on that gruesome night.Our book club was intrigued with the true-crime story, but was even more interested in the author's writing style. We gave this book high marks and we are looking forward to reading more by this talented author."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The actual reading of In Cold Blood wasn't as scary as I thought it was going to be, but I find that it becomes more scary as the story stays with you. Capote does an outstanding job of telling ahorrific, true story while writing it to read like a fictional novel. Capote introduces us to the town of Holcomb, Kansas, a place where people don't lock their doors and everybody knows everyone. You will be introduced to each member of the Clutter family & learn how much they were liked and respected in their community. In alternating chapters, you will also meet the two killers, Dick Hickock, and Perry Smith. The murders are disturbing and horrifying, and the heartlessness with whichthey are done is unthinkable.Apparently, Capote traveled to Holcomb, Kansas to do research for writing this book. He has been criticized by some as being biased in his views as he befriended the two killers, and some claim Capote lost his objectivity. The book was written as an anti-capital punishment stance, but it isn't the focus of the story. Instead, it is a look at both sides of a horrible crime, from all angles. The truth is chilling and as they say, in this case, truth is stranger than fiction."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"If you are looking for a book that is exciting and also chillling, In Cold Blood is your perfect match. In Cold Blood reveals the story behind the murder of four members of the Clutter family during the 1950's. Capote is able to recreate the night of the murder so accurately that you also will be able to remember that murder scene, even in your sleep. Capote makes you feel as though you were there the night of the murder and the days following, and you will find yourself utterly distraught while you follow the assailants on their cross-country spending spree. This book is thrilling and gives great insight into the criminal mind. If you are looking for a book that will not cause you to fall asleep, this is the one for you."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood is a sensational book about two young men killing a very well-off family for their money. The book kept me asking the question, &quot;why did they kill this family?&quot; The family had a perfect &quot;Little House on the Prarie&quot; setting, and were very upstanding in the community. Towards the end of the book, the story veered a little off the subject with unnessary information, but over all it kept me reading. The details of settings, charecters, and emotions were great and created a picture in my head as if I had witnessed it myself. The title was the real attention getter. If you enjoy a well written, true story that keeps you awake at night, In Cold Blood is the book. It puts you in the mind of the killers and helps you better understand how they personally justify their actions as human beings. It leaves you in awe at the fact that something this horrendous can happen to you, as it did in this small, close knit community in Kansas."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"My interest in true crime is sporadic, and with some hesitance I decided to read this one, thinking the story is so old that it would not be interesting. As his reputation attests, Truman Capote was a master at crafting cultural portraits of American society.As interesting as the crime story itself is the depiction of the small Kansas town in which the gruesome murders were committed. Through six years of research and writing, Capote captured effectively the nature of small-town Midwestern communities in which major events reveal long-held opinions, wisdom, and even prejudices, and how such events profoundly impact its identity for posterity.Tragic stories are difficult to enjoy unless they are written with artistic skill and tolerable artistic license while retaining the essentials of the historical drama. I've read few authors that accomplished this feat as well as Truman Capote.I rated 4-star because it is an excellent book I will highly recommend. It would have earned my 5-star had it not been for the extended passages in the last quarter of the book which were quoted from long redundant scripts of contemporaneous reports, many of which would have been written better in Capote's own words and would have retained the intensity until the last sentence of the book. Instead, it was tempting to read through the last portions very quickly."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I know, I know...you are probably thinking, who does this girl think she is, giving Truman Capote's masterpiece only four out of five stars? The thing is, I know \\"In Cold Blood\\" is an amazing book. If you are a big fan of crime novels, I am sure you will love it and it will become one of your favorite books of all time. However, I am not big on crime novels myself, and although I recognize that this is a brilliantly composed book, I didn't particularly enjoy it. That's partially because murder stories in general give me the willies, but also because this particular book kind of drags. I realize that what I deem as a dragging sensation actually parallels a stalled criminal investigation that goes nowhere until the detectives finally stumble upon their first big lead, but still...IT DRAGS. Which doesn't make it fun to read. And the descriptions in this book, while wonderful and thorough and all that jazz, are kind of overkill, which enhances that whole dragging problem. Bottom line: great book...for true crime fans. If you are not a fan of the genre, you may appreciate this book as I do, but it will not become a favorite."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"\`In Cold Blood' is probably Capote's best known novel and from the word go it makes for engrossing and fascinating reading. This is basically a novel of true events in the fifties and sixties and follows the murder of a Kansas farmer and his family and the subsequent trial of the murderers. It is written with vivid and evocative language and the descriptions quickly bring you deeper into the story and help conjure the images within. You could quite easily forget that this is based on true events as the story telling is so rich and this really does read like a fictional account of the same events. The film \`Capote' is based around his writing of this book and if you like one it is worth you checking out the other. Apparently there was much controversy surrounding this book when it was published, but coming to it years later and expecting a book of beautiful writing, you are left with none of the former controversy and plenty of the latter beauty. This makes for an engrossing read and although slightly uncomfortable in places you can't help but turn the pages until you read the formidable conclusion. Well worth a try if you a fan of strong American literature.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I've wanted to read this book for years, and I finally did. Extraordinarily written, I enjoyed every moment of it. It only took me a few days to finish it. The part I hated was the fact it was true. It was awful reading what happened to the Clutter family, it brought me to tears. It's too bad that the experience pretty much brought Capote down; it's a phenomenally written story."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In this novel, by Truman Capote, the 1959 murders of the Clutter residence and the aftermath was broken down and recorded with great detail by Capote. On November 14 of 1959 Perry Smith and Dick Hickock murdered Herbert Clutter and all of his family in a botched robbery. On a whim from an old jail buddy, the two broke into the Clutter home on that dreary night in 1959 and fired 4 shots that would end up killing 6 people.This book is unlike any other crime novel I have read, because it is more than 200 pages about a crime that took place many years ago. It is an examination on the ripple effect on the community. How the murders effected everyone in the small town of Holcomb. Capote interviewed the whole town and captured the spirit of the town after these events. He also examined Dick and Perry with great deal and gave great insight into the trail, sentencing and execution of these two men. It was a wonderful book that really depicted the effect of a murder in a small town like this."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I can understand why this book made such a punch in the literary world at the time it was written. Mr. Capote did an outstanding job on his characters, maybe even to the point of too much. You could feel the disbelief of not only the Clutter family but the entire community over the horror of murder.Mr. Capote wrote of a terrible tragedy and did so without blood curdling details as are written in so many books both then and now. You could allow your own imagination to picture the horror and disbelief of the actual murders. This is something that takes great skill but allows the reader to form their own head pictures.The book did drag, especially toward the end when one was finally relieved to picture two murderers hang from the gallows."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I read the print version of this book when it first appeared back in the 60s (I believe that is the right time frame), and was hypnotized by it. I hadn't read anything quite like it before. Now, many years later, I have re-read it, and while it is still a compelling read, I don't believe it would hold up nearly as well if released today, although I'm sure it would still be a fairly decent seller. I actually prefer Capote's collection of short stories (something about Chameleons), and feel that writing was superior to that in In Cold Blood. But, it's still a darn good story - especially considering that it's true. Still worth a read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I ordered the book on a Monday night and received it on Wednesday of the same week (I live in AZ). The description made the book sound worse than it really was. Excellent delivery speed and slightly worn used book, perfect for the price I paid."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book is spectacular. When a friend loaned it to me, I made a commitment not to watchCapoteor do online research to determine accuracy and context, so I approached the book with a blissful ignorance. Capote does a masterful job in this groundbreaking (I believe) work, skillfully weaving together quotes and facts from a variety of sources while remaining mostly outside of the action (there are a couple of moments in the last twenty pages in which Capote mentions that he is physically interviewing the two prisoners).This is, at a basic level, a true crime novel. Two men murder a family of four and disappear almost without a trace. Capote details the subsequent investigations, court proceedings, and aftermath, and his writing is solid and mostly objective throughout. In the early pages, when Capote pieces together scenes of daily life in the small Kansas town before the murders, he drifts into unchecked poetry or unbecoming condescension, but after the bodies are discovered, Capote's writing takes on a much more professional tone.For a reader in 2010, this is also a surprising history book about small-town Kansas in 1959. Women play inescapably minor roles, and discussions about the death penalty take for granted that all local Christians would be opposed to capital punishment. In fact, the defense attorneys basically assume that all of the jurors are Christians and use that as their basis for pleas for mercy, while the prosecutor stuns the courtroom by pulling out a Bible and using other passages to justify his stance. Lawyers will also be interested in the severe restrictions imposed on any attempt at an insanity defense, and I expect that psychologists and psychiatrists will be amused at some of Capote's observations on the exciting advancements in forensic psychology.This is a terrific book, both as a history and as a gripping and satisfying narrative. It examines violence without being needlessly graphic, and Capote ties everything into the larger web of the local farm community to give everything the appropriate context. I highly recommend In Cold Blood."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Capote has painted a vivid picture of a brutal murdering of innocent and wholesome family. It is creepy to read at parts. The book jumps around to different characters showing their perspective. Including the murderers. Some reviewers have said Capote is very sympathetic to the killers but I did not read that into the text. Yes, he does show up who they were and that necessarily humanizes them but does not show admiration for them and their dirty deeds. If anything, Capote shows an admiration for the people of Holcomb - for their decency and lack of desired vengeance.Capote is a masterful storyteller with great descriptions of the people, places, and times in which these heinous acts were committed. I think he does slightly overstep his bounds near the end where he seems to be making a case against the death penalty but for at least one of the perpetrators this can be very well argued. Also at some parts Capote goes into length on the background of the killers and that got a little dull. Overall a great work."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I have spent much of my life planning to read the great novels but as of yet just have never found the time. Recently I discovered a wonderful alternative is listening to audio books. As of today I have now heard a number of great works but Capote's novel is in a class by itself. The writing is amazing. He owns the English language. Never does he settle for a second best way to describe a thing but writes with the precision of a master craftsman. Describing the deceased mother, whose eyes remained open, Capote refers to them as \\"death dulled eyes\\". Speaking of the shrubs he speaks of their \\"camel-like indifference to drought\\". Every sentence, every phrase, from cover to cover, is both poetic and gripping. Unlike many authors who begin strong and then begin to dull as the chapters progress, Capote keeps the freshness of his prose up throughout the work.Simply put, this novel is on level beyond what most of us have ever read. And I must note that the reader on the audio version is intimately involved in the text. The reading in no way detracts from the power of the novel, but actualy enhances it - if that is possible.This is one of the top 3 books I have ever heard or read - a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"For a while I used to read true crime pulp books. Whatever perverted itch was being scratched has long ago disappeared, and so it was only (of course) the film Capote --actually, the beautiful reading he does in the movie--that caused me to buy this. What a masterpiece. So often I read books, including by so-called acclaimed authors (try McEwan's Saturday, as the most recent example), and there are just so many false steps, so many places where the reader just feels the author struggling, working, trying to deserve \\"acclaimed\\", but not quite a master of his game. NONE OF THAT HERE. There is really no false step but the very wonderful (and very rare) experience for a reader of placing oneself entirely in the hands of a master at his craft as he carries us through the book. It is not about that horrible November night, it is about America, aboutpersons from different walks (but for the grace of God, etc.), and as much as anything about the great ironies of life. A truly profound and poetic work."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote's 'In Cold Blood' is enjoying a resurgence of popularity thanks to the Oscar-winning film depicting the author's life and work during the writing of this phenomenal piece. At one point in the film, the character Capote makes the statement that when he thinks about how good this book will be, he can hardly breathe. Perhaps it is because it is part of our history now, I don't consider the book to be that good, but it was a work fairly close to groundbreaking in its impact - it was a new genre, the narrative telling of a non-fiction event as if it were a fictional novel.The narrative centres upon the murder of a Kansas family by two men, Perry Smith and Dick Hicock, who are in many ways far from typical killers, much less cold blooded killers. The family, the Clutters of Holcombe, Kansas, are far from typical victims, nor is this the kind of place such a murder would be expected. Capote does a remarkable job at an even-handed analysis and narrative treatment of all the characters, from the family itself to the townspeople and investigators, as well as the murderers themselves. Perhaps it is because he found an area of identification?This is a psychological thriller of a sort - at least it would be, were it not a true life tale. Getting into the minds of the criminals and the investigators was no easy task for Capote, but what comes forth on the page is very crisp and insightful reporting, without the kinds of embellishments one might expect from a figure such as Capote when dealing with middle-America folk.The question of why for the killing is still never fully resolved, despite Capote's attempt to set out all the story and psychological detail. Perhaps this is as strange as the interest Capote took in the subject in the first place, as well as the effect it had on him, and those around him, ultimately - while Capote himself never again finished a major project after this, that is also true of his assistant, Nell Harper Lee, whose book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' (done about the same time as 'In Cold Blood') was also her last major writing.A worthwhile book in many ways."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I don't read a lot of true crime- it seems like it probably isn't a healthy thing to overdo, but the occassional crime story that is true can be escape, thrill, and glimpse of the dark side of human nature. It is the rare book that accomplishes this in anything like a literary fashion, and that doesn't make the reader feel a little worse for the effort. Capote is different from most, and his sparse style and eye for detail, all the while leaving most analysis to the reader although giving him/her plenty of clues, makes for a good yarn. I'm not exactly sure why it has attained classic level, but it is well told and gripping, and maybe that is enough.The story is well known, although the details come alive in this book. A couple of drifters hear a story through a prison connection about a huge sum of money hidden in farmhouse. The murder that follows, ahead of its time- is \\"In Cold Blood\\". The murder was nearly successful not because of its cleverness, but because of its audacity, and that is the strength of the book. Capote is able to make the audacity of unrestrained evil coming through ordinary if undesirable men palpable.A modern tragedy."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I recently reviewed the DVD of \\"In Cold Blood\\" for Amazon so I decided to reread Truman Capote's classic non-fiction novel (1965) to see if my favorable memories of it would be brought back. I was disappointed by the book, I think because my reader expectations and experiences have changed drastically in the intervening years. I have become used to fast-paced thrillers, movies and TV dramas that stick strictly to a main plot line. When I read a book like Capote's that tries to portray a crime within a larger cultural and sociological framework, digresses and adds all sorts of extraneous details, I become impatient.The book's countless forays into biographies and its detours into psychology and criminology take away the book's narrative velocity. Capote was known for spare stories that stuck to the essentials, but here he strayed too far away from the main plot action.The book is structured like this: 1. Before the crime, the town, the four Clutter victims and the two murderers. 2. After the crime and the criminals on the run. 3. The investigation. 4. The crime itself. 5. The trial, Death Row, and conclusion. Truman Capote never enters the story as a participant. It's interesting to look at two excellent movies retracing Truman Capote's research into the Clutter murder case: \\"Capote\\" with Philip Seymour Hoffman and \\"Infamous\\" with Toby Jones.The book is extremely well-written but too detailed, trying to create a social environment. Dick and Perry, the killers, were very different. Dick was \\"totally masculine\\" while Perry had a strange streak of tenderness, compassion, and sexual ambivalence.Alvin Dewey of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation leads a team of three others, and they are delineated in Part II, The Investigation. The lives of the killers are covered in far too much detail, especially Perry's miserable childhood. Dick's former cellmate Floyd Wells is the one who cracks open the case. After the murders the killers went to Mexico, back to Kansas, California, Florida, and ended up in Las Vegas where they were apprehended. In the questioning Dick Hickcock broke first.The appeal process dragged on until 1965, a comparatively short time by today's standards. Hickock was 33 and Smith 36 when they went to the gallows on April 14, 1965 for the multiple murders they had committed on November 15, 1959, about five and a half years between the crimes and the punishment.At key times the dramatic momentum of the story is broken. Don't expect a tightly focused, unbearably suspenseful, fast-paced narrative but rather a leisurely, loose somewhat rambling, more thoughtful and probing treatment of the sensational crime."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood by Truman Capote is a detailed true account of a multiple family murder and its consequences. It starts out in a small town called Holcomb, Kansas. The towns everyday routines are thrown off kilter when the towns popular Clutter family, a family of four, is murdered in their home by unknown people. No one can understand why such a likeable family was murdered, especially since it appears there was no motive.Capote gives us a detailed look into the two killers, Perry Smith and Dick Hicock, minds and lives. He tells us what led up to the murders and what happened after the murders. He also tells us what is happening in the lives of the investigators that are on the case and how the two stories come together.This was my first time ever reading a Truman Capote book and I must say it grabbed me from the beginning to the end. I love to read true crime books but this one was set apart by the ones that I normally read becuase of its \\"novel style\\". I had to stop myself from reading a couple of times to remind myself that this was indeed a true story.What I liked about In Cold Blood was the fact that even though you know early on what the outcome of book is, it is still pretty unpredictable. The way Capote tells the story is brilliant. The way he explains the two murderers lives from begining to end really helps you understand the killers even though you may not understand why or how someone could do what they did. I will readily admit that there was a time or two that I even felt sorry for the killers. This is a book that I will definatly keep on my bookshelf and read it again. I have a feeling that by reading it a second time I will even get more out of it."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"and even if he had never written another book, this would have been all he ever needed to produce. It is, in the most literal sense of the word, stunning. You can SEE the places he describes; you can FEEL the terror of the Clutter family on that dreadful night; you can LIVE the events as they happen and share the elation of the detectives when they finally catch their men. Somehow the women affected me most deeply; Mrs Clutter and Nancy; Mrs Clutter because she was such a dependent, tortured soul and Nancy because she was so young and innocent; she had not even begun to live.Of course, Kenyon too; the details of his murder are terribly sad, as are the details of the entire family. I cannot imagine what they were thinking; I feel they truly had no idea what was to be their fate...The description of the murders and the reactions of the victims, added to the commentary of Dick and Perry all lend an air of unreality; could this have actually happened?Why these people? How could this horror have happened to such a quiet, productive family? Or anyone? How can there be any people who could conceive and carry out such an atrocity? The descriptions of the condition and treatment of the bodies afterwards in the funeral home made my hair stand on end...and the dreafully sad mental image of the farm itself; the family gone and the house deserted.Dick and Perry are such consummate sociopaths it is difficult to feel anything about their ultimate fate, which they richly deserved, but I felt that Mr Capote was somewhat sympathetic toward them.His descriptions of Holcomb itself are amazing; they provide details of this terribly bleak landscape and it's inhabitants, (the postmistress, Myrt, I found to be extremely irritating in her smug comments in the days following the murders) which make the story all the more haunting. I am no stranger to homicides, having been an avid true crime reader for years, but this one really stands out, due mostly to the incredible writing skills of Mr Capote.You will think about it for days afterwards and remember it for years to come whether you re-read it or not; it stays with you.If you have never read it, you owe it to yourself; if you have read it, I strongly suggest seeing the movie, it is a masterpiece, owing its success to Mr Capote."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The smelly, hairy armpit of every bookstore is its True Crime section, shelved with scores of Ann Rule-styled mass-market paperbacks with black covers and fluorescent-lettered titles intended to shock, promising pages of murder and mayhem illustrated by grainy black-and-white photos, ultimately delivering banality in a glossy package. However, Truman Capote's \\"In Cold Blood,\\" although sharing the purpose of the company it keeps, is a diamond in the rough. With sharp psychological insight and prose that is lithe and sophisticated without assuming an opulence that risks overdressing its grisly subject matter, Capote writes like he sincerely cares about not just the victims and the murderers, but everybody involved in the investigation of the case and then some.The case is fairly simple: On a November night in 1959 in the tiny western Kansas prairie town of Holcomb, two ex-convicts, Dick Hickock and Perry Smith, entered a farm house belonging to the Clutters, one of the richest and most respected families in the county, tied up Herb Clutter, his wife Bonnie, his son Kenyon, and his daughter Nancy with cords and killed them with a shotgun. The motive is not difficult to deduce from the outset; by introducing the killers early, Capote fashions the book not as a mystery but as a study of criminal behavior.In leading up to the crime, the narration alternates between the domestic tranquility of the Clutter family, a picture so innocent and wholesomely American it belongs on a Christmas card, and the sinister machinations and bizarre delusions of the killers as they travel hundreds of miles to Holcomb to do their deed. After the murders have been committed, leaving the town horrified and puzzled, the book follows Dick and Perry's cross-country trips in search of the next big score while special agents from the Kansas Bureau of Investigation probe the crime scene for evidence (the killers cleverly leave almost none) and interrogate the few witnesses who have anything to say. Capote manages to relate something valuable about every person the investigation encounters, from a gas station attendant to the woman who runs Holcomb's post office, so the book reads like a novel of rich characterization.An inevitable breakthrough in the case leads to the arrest of Dick and Perry, who have not covered their tracks well. From here, Capote examines the relevant details of their trial, in which they are convicted, and their appeals while they await execution on Death Row. Even to the very end we are continually informed that the book's devotion is to its killers' life stories, given clinical treatment during the trial in which we hear (off the record) professional psychoanalyses that attempt to explain how a man might become a monster. Although \\"In Cold Blood\\" could be criticized for apparently sympathizing with the killers, it manages to acknowledge their humanity without apologizing for or attempting to justify their violent actions."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I believe that the unlived lives' of Nancy and the rest of the Clutters will haunt me everytime I hear the phrase &quot;It could never happen to me . . .&quot; forever. The reader cannot help but to acknowledge the reality that this kind of vagabond psychosis is as much a part of an all-american landscape as Mom, baseball, and apple pie. In the hands of a lesser wordsmith, this account could be yet another violent antecdote serving to desensitize the populous-- but from the pen of Truman Capote it causes us confront the unheard of fears and demons that live within us all.The profiles' of Perry and Dick's neighbors on Death Row chill the bone as much as the vision of Nancy's pleas before the point-blank 12-gauge. I don't think I will soon forget this book. As much as it disturbs and provokes one to check the locks on their doors one extra time before turning in, I can't reccomend it highly enough.Overall, a riveting cross-section of the American psychotic impulse. I was horrified, ashamed and strengthened by this story."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Good books, to me, are like ghosts that float into your life, scare you, change you, make you view the world as bigger and more full of possibilities than you ever imagined, and sometimes, posess you.And if books are like ghosts, this book is one of the most sinister, malevolent, yet strangely beautiful of them all. Its images will float across its pages, into your mind, and refuse to leave your life.It's a book so amazing that even though it's the story of two crazed killers murdering an entire family, and even though no detail or fear or violence is spared in the telling of it all, the things that stand out most are the beautiful, hopeful, healing moments: a murdered woman's collection of porcelain \\"tiny things,\\" or a murdered schoolgirl's friend--happy and growing--visiting a gravesite on a sunny day.The book tells the TRUE story of a Kansas family who are all senselessly murdered in their homes. It tells the story of their murderers, it tells the story of the law that pursues the killers, and of the community that reels from the crime.This is by far Truman Capote's best book. It's full of hope and sadness, good and evil, and it never fails to scrutinize and explore the spaces between both those pairs. It is amazing. Buy it, read it, remember the victims, and feel grateful Truman Capote was around to tell their story...because no one else could tell it like he could. Read it, and let it haunt you."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This is a great book. Even though you kind of know exactly what is going to happen (its no secret) I was still surprised at some of the authors disclosures. You really develop a feel for the town, I could almost imagine living there being apart of the community fabric. I don't know how others interpret this book but I felt the author was straight up with the characters and took no sides. In the end I see it as it is, a tragedy. As you read this you have to wonder what else could have possibly been running through these two men (the murders) minds. By the author providing such wonderful descriptions of the (murdered) family you can't help but wonder why, what could have been done? Why do these things happen in life?"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"A book that has stood the test of time. First released in 1965, it hasn't dated at all. A true account of the brutal slaying of four members of a rural Kansas family and the subsequent apprehension of the murderous duo. A fascinating, highly-engaging, harrowing, and moving tale of evil that lurks within the hearts of men.The book proved to be highly controversial upon its release since it seemed to make a genuine effort not only to understand the social factors that help shape the making of a psychopath, but also to understand the points-of-view, however horrifying and disgusting as they maybe, of the perpetrators of the crime.Though, this novel does not overtly give away the fact, but Truman Capote got deeply involved with the killers who had slain the Kansas family. In particular, he felt very strongly for Perry Smith, whom he thought had a very similar childhood as his own. Capote used to say that Perry and him lived in the same house as children, and the only reason their lives took different directions was the fact that Capote chose to exit that house from the front, while Perry chose the back door."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Strange to think how, in this post-Manson, post-9/11 world, Capote's account of murder in rural Kansas can still have such emotional resonance and power.Where to begin with praise for this work. The writing is sublime. Capote's style is economical yet profoundly evocative. He manages to convey so much of the people, the places, the events and the emotions without an excess of prose.Having learned some of the back story thanks to biographies and recent films, I am amazed at Capote's light touch - how he allowed the characters and events to bring out the story. True, an author always leads the reader's eyes to particular events and impressions. But Capote's deft compositional choices deepen the narrative and bring forth greater complexity and emotional facets. In some instances, he seems to share only portions of what he knows or suspects leaving the rest to the reader's intelligence and imagination. Given today's seemingly insatiable desire to be shown every lurid outrageous detail, I doubt that a contemporary \\"true crime\\" author would have written this story with the same level of restraint.Of course, the most fascinating, and the most controversial, aspect of In Cold Blood is the characterization of the murderers: Perry Smith and Richard Hickock . Were they brutal killers? Without question. Were they complex human beings as well? Yes. And that is the most disturbing aspect of this book for many readers - being shown the faces of evil and feeling empathy as well as horror.I've read criticisms that take Capote to task for being sympathetic towards the murderers or for having an anti-capital punishment bias. There may be some truth in that, but I believe that readers are given ample opportunity to make up their own minds. Smith and Hickock's human sides are often brought forth, but they are even more frightening and monstrous for that. With the executions, Capote notes some of the troubling and ambiguous aspects that are inevitably part of the process when the state puts an individual to death.Of course, hanging over the tragedy of the story is the tragedy of it's writing. In the opening chapter, Capote notes \\"four shotgun blasts that, all told, ended six human lives\\". He couldn't have known that he would also become a victim as his obsession with the project and more specifically with Perry Smith would precipitate an early end to his literary career and a downward spiral into self destruction."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Somehow, I just found myself greatly amazed by the way that this book really discusses ethics (e.g. the death penalty) and the viewpoints/biases of the different characters. I had feared this book was going to be a disturbing psychodrama, with descriptions of pain and suffering en masse; however, it is a philosophical writing that doesn't use shock tactics to frighten the reader.The book tells the true story of the wealthy Clutter family, murdered one night by two men, Perry Smith and Dick Hickok. Truman Capote flawlessly moves between the stories of the killers and the townspeople, showing how everything from complex upbringings to social interactions created the psychological tragedy that was the brutal Clutter murder, as well as the turmoil and fear that followed in the tiny Kansas village. Through primary-source recollections by several people involved in the incident, one learns of the conflict and the mysteries it beheld, from its initial conception in the mind of Dick Hickok to the execution of the murderers. All in all, this makes for a compelling read that will really make the reader consider their opinions and beliefs about life's hardships, obligations, and the power of justice."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I had heard of Trumane Capote but never knew much about him. I had developed an image of a social gadfly who was famous simply for being famous. After seeing the movie \\"Capote\\", I thought I'd read his book, \\"In Cold Blood\\". It is terrific! The pointless murder of a midwestern farm family in the 1950's is not a subject I would otherwise be drawn to, but the quality of Capote's writing transcends the subject. It is a book you read just for the pleasure of reading rich, thoughtful and insightful prose."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"One small article in the New York Times brought Truman Capote to Holcomb, Kansas, a small city that became world famous after 'In cold blood' was released. Capote spent six years of his life with researching and interviewing relatives and friends of both the Clutter family and the killers Smith and Hickock. And what a result !The book is incredibly detailled and you can imagine what it must have been like when the bodies were discovered and the fear it brought to the people of the small town.A must-read!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"A very disturbing, yet exciting book . The descriptions are monumental and so is the writing style. Sometimes it strays away from the main subject matter (but in an interesting way). The writer might have overanalyzed characters and situations too. Other drawbacks :you know what is going to happen , you know (through films) about the writer's relationship with the murderers and other information related to the writing process of the book. It is still a wonderfully written book and a must-read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This is as near perfect as a book can get.

Remarkable."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The slayings of four family members during the quiet hours of November 15, 1959 left a puzzling hole in the town of Holcomb, Kansas. The Clutter family was prosperous and well-liked, esteemed in the eyes of their neighbors, the husband generous to a fault. The townspeople and investigators were baffled by the brutal, apparently motiveless crime. The case gripped the hearts of the investigators and of the author Truman Capote, who devoted years of his life to gaining the true story behind that fatal night.\\"In Cold Blood\\" is a piercing examination of the two convicted killers, Perry Smith and Dick Hickock. At the time of its writing, the story was that of a nonfiction novel, with Capote virtually inventing the category of true crime. His chronicling of the Clutter murders is simple and straightforward, but crafted by his eye for detail and his gifted ability to bring the most unlikely characters and situations to life. Capote covers all the bases, blending reminiscence with eyewitness accounts, threading the past details of Smith's and Hickock's lives with the investigators' hunt for the persons responsible.\\"In Cold Blood\\" stands as a watershed in the true crime genre. The title, while common, is perfectly suited to the crimes described; for the killing of the four family members was seemingly spontaneous, the killers' bungled burglary attempt a paltry payoff. The narrative is spellbinding, an odd blend of unease and empathy, suspenseful even when the outcome is known."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Considering that this is touted as the break-through work for this genre, I have to say I was surprised at how well-written it was. Additional research that I did has indicated that either much or some (depending upon the source) of what Capote wrote is slanted and flawed. Let's be honest, though; can't that be said about any book in this genre? If one says \\"black\\" there will always be those who will claim or try to prove \\"white.\\"I feel the author handled his presentation of the key personalities in this story quite well and the reader can get a sense of each person as well as that of the community.

Instead of just painting the killers as evil villains, Capote truly tries to understand why they did what they did."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I once read that \\"cold blood\\" referred to Capote's eyeview of the situation he wrote about, more so than the style of the crime described here. An interesting conception, but after my read, I don't yet see it. Capote first fills a landscape with a loved and admirable family, gradually inching in descriptions of the characters who will threaten them, without divesting the perpetrators (particularly Perry Smith) of their humanity. Even though one would have to live on the dark side of the moon for the last fifty years not to know how the plot thickens, the prose still keeps one on the edge of the seat. A solid time capsule of midwest mores, culture, the justice system, and even race relations in the late fifties. The restraint Capote shows would be welcome in today's sensational treatment of the day-to-day stories about runaway brides, kidnap victims, or some of the tragic murders in which shock and awe seems to outweigh the journalistic quest for fact or justice for those affected."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"What a great book! \\"In Cold Blood\\" was meticulously researched, beautifully crafted, and reads like a novel. The book does start to drag a bit before the killers are caught and before they are executed, but that is the only problem I have with it. The novel is a fairly symapthetic portait of two murderers, but doesn't lose its focus, and doesn't really mourn the killers when they are finally executed. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote manages to weave a tapestry of factual information, notes from interviews with the assailants and those of its many victims into a gripping story of human emotion at every level. The killers emerge as people who commit murder with hardly more emotional investment than a trip to the dentist. Yet their story is just a small part of the effect that the murders had on all who knew the victims.This is a gripping book, written in a prose style that is rarely equaled by the popular authors of today."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"My family read \\"In Cold Blood\\" for a Christmas book club. I think our combined review -- six people's reaction combined - would give it four stars. The book is a chilling and very well documented crime story. The set up to the murders -- alternating chapters about the killers and the people they will eventually murder -- is effectively creepy. It is impossible to not be horrified about the senseless nature of the crime. I read the book after seeing \\"Capote\\" and it made an interesting companion piece to that viewing. I can't say I loved the book -- it slows down to a crawl towards the end and the subject matter itself is a little hard to take.

As far as I know, it is the first true murder mystery told as novel. Considering how many thousands have been written since then, that's quite an accomplishment. It is also incredibly well conceived and written. At times Capote writes sentences that are slightly pretentious or awkward, but over all, the book stands up. Everyone should read at least once. {...}"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood by Truman Capote is a celebrated meld of fact and inference. In it Capote pioneered the genre of the nonfiction novel. Using the real-life murder of the Clutter family in 1959 Holcomb Kansas, Capote spins a story that impresses and engages everyone who reads it. The original way Capote uses scenes creates a specific and lasting impression. His take on the Clutter murders is all-encompassing. It's informative, accurate and saturated with details. Capote transforms a news article into a creative work and makes history doing it.I thoroughly enjoyed In Cold Blood. Even though the Clutter family was murdered 50 years ago, when I read it the story it felt immediate and pertinent. The psychological insights Capote made in the book, especially when looking at the killers, were phenomenal and ahead of his time. In Cold Blood read like a romance novel with the added intensity of knowing that the content was real; that it actually happened. The connection Capote makes to the Perry is so deep that it left me feeling that Perry was almost the good guy, and although it was inevitable, he wouldn't end up being executed. I suppose that is the real difference between fiction and nonfiction: in nonfiction that author can't twist the plot to create a happy ending."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"After reading the book I have to say that it was a good book. It was full of action, suspense, and some gory scenes. The first half of the book excited me more than the second half, I found that after the murdering was over the book slightly lost appeal, though the plot thickening and suspense kept me reading. The fact that there really was a killing involving the Clutters made the book almost awkward to read, I felt like I shouldn't have been reading it because it was based on the murdering of the Clutters. The plot was very well thought through and I believe the book is written in a way that keeps the reader from putting it down.I recommend this book to almost everyone excluding the younger people out there, the scenes were slightly graphic. For the most part, this book was a great read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The brutal murders of the Clutters brought an end to the picture-perfect innocence illusions that America had about its backwoods small towns. Truman Capote brought senseless violence into the lives of everybody, making people realize that bad things do happen to good people. When this novel was first published, this would have created quite a stir among the readers, wheras today, we are well aware of the problems with violence.The true horror of this novel is the kindness of the Clutter family. They were generally nice people, pillars of the community, before their lives were shattered by the brutality of two criminals. Capote follows the case all the way through the trial, when the guilty characters attempt to redeem themselves.The style Capote writes with has been very influencial, using a combination of reporting and fiction styles melded together to create something that had not really been seen before in the world of literature. All of these things make &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; a landmark book, and arguably the best work that Capote ever produced."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of Multiple Murder and its consequences. Is Truman Capote's riveting true story about a family of four whose lives were savagely taken on the night of November 15,1959. This book takes a look at not only the investigation but of the killers Dick and Perry before and after the crime they committed. The book gives the reader a brief overview of each of the members of the Clutter family. Herbert Clutter was a Kansas State Graduate majoring in agriculture and was a member of the Federal Farm Credit Board during the Eisenhower administration. Bonnie Clutter suffered from \\"spells\\". Their children Nancy and Kenyon Clutter were both honor roll and straight-A students. The writing style of Truman Capote is coherent, convincing and very detailed \\"The Cider-tart odor of spoiling apples. Apple trees and pear trees, peach and cheery trees he had planted.\\" He made such a tragedy into a great piece of work. I thought the book was very well written about such a tragedy. The way that he went from the killers to the investigation was amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood, by Truman Capote, tells the epic yet historically nonfiction tragic murder occurring on November 15, 1959. Four members of the Clutter family were brutally killed by shotguns that were considerably shot at close range in a small town in Holcomb County, a few miles from Kansas City. The novel commences on a few days before Thanksgiving. When Herbert Clutter, the head of the Clutter family, inspects his ranch while on the other side of Kansas, the two culprits of the crime, Richard (Dick) Hickock and Perry Smith. All members of the Clutter family proceed doing their everyday activities such as running errands or teaching the neighbor's youngest daughter how to bake a pie. And as the Clutter family retires to their home and sees the sun setting in the west on November 14, 1959, nobody knew it would have been their last picturesque view. At dawn that morning, strange noises woke up the whole town. Nobody knew what it was until one of Herbert's daughter's friend saw the four bodies lying on the kitchen floor motionless. The investigation begins led by Alvin Dewwey, the primary agents for the KBI (Kansas Bureau of Investigation). After a few short hours, the whole nation finds out about this. It turns out that Dick Hickock and Perry Smith were both put in jail for previous crimes. It was brought to the attention of one of the criminals cellmate that it was obvious that either one of those two had committed the crime. Hickock and Smith know that they're being chased and flee to Mexico. While attempting to steal a car, they are caught by the police and through numerous lines of questioning both of them finally confessed and are charged with 1st degree murder. Many people who have read this book find it a fictional work of art. In reality this tragic murder did occur and it grasped the attention of Truman Capote. Capote's style of writing has somewhat of a journalistic gist to it, and like a good journalist he never mentions his name in the entire novel. The title of the novel says it all. It'll keep you clued to wherever you may be reading this book. An interesting quote that truly explains what the novel is all about says,\\"Perry was gonna go out and rob the place, and they was gonna kill all witnesses - the Clutters, and anybody else that happened to be around\\" (page 162)Though obviously this wasn't Capote speaking as the narrator yet it is very noticeable to see how he was able to capture what was going on in the mind of the old cellmate that told the KBI who killed the Clutters. - Paulo Farqui, Greenwich, Connecticut"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This a powerfully written book that transcends it's horrifying topic with a very well organized, beautifully written true-life tale. Mr. Capote evokes great sympathy for the victims and even manages to humanize the killers, presenting a very objective look at sociopaths. I left the book with deep concern for the family and friends of the Clutter family. I felt great sorrow for the loss of these wonderful people who were making a positive difference in our society. I also had a better understanding of the killer mentality and felt some sorrow for the killers as well -- the killers threw their lives and talents away. It was very suspenseful. It provided a brilliant juxtaposition of the lives of a good family and two murderers with the inevitable collision of their two worlds. What made them commit these horrendous crimes? Truman Capote gives us some answers."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Published forty years ago, Truman Capote's \\"In Cold Blood\\" is still a book that matters and very modern. The writer/journalist captured a time and an event with such compromise that his words can be hardly dismissed. They are probably very close to the truth, as a matter of fact. The whole truth will never be known. After all, most of the most important \`characters' of the book were dead -- actually their bloody killing was the starter for Capote's book.As it is largely known, \\"In Cold Blood\\" tells the story of two merciless young killers and the four members of a family they killed. While the narrative is attained to facts, Capote sometimes let his imagination to fill in the gaps. But not that often -- what boils down to in the narrative is not fiction. An strange as it may read, the writer interviewed people who were involved with the family (the Clutter's), the murders, the killers themselves, police and made his own investigation.The result is a book that would seem to be far-fetched were it fiction -- but it is not. Scary as the event may seem, they were real. And with \\"In Cold Blood\\" Capote explores another face of human dark side. Reading this book is like watching a documentary -- with a reconstitution of the event. There are interviews, people telling what happened to them, how the Clutter's were, all sort of things, and there is also a dramatization.The narrative begins very slowly as the environment is described. The city, the Clutter's place, the people until cuts to two young men, Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, who are preparing to do something awful. We don't really know what it is but we can imagine, if we know what the book is about. Capote keeps alternating between the two men and the reconstruction of that day in the Clutter's lives. A day in the live.The writer keeps this device until the tragedy happens. But he is smart enough to keep us jumping in our seats --since he doesn't describe the killing in the moment they happen. Only later will we learn through a flashback. An he has a point in doing it, after all, only two people could tell exactly how they happened.In the last part, Capote dives into another issue: capital punishment. Without taking sides, he describes a couple of people who were condemned to die and their lives in the death row, besides Smith and Hickock. At this point, we are forced to ask about our own morals. Is it worthy killing someone who has committed murder? There isn't an easy answer. And, probably, almost all of us have already a shaped opinion. Capote knows that and he doesn't try to change it. As a photographer he exploits some snapshots of a hard reality -- actually, of both sides of this hard reality.\\"In Cold Blood\\" is a great book. Nobody can say it is a great entertainment once it is based on a real tragedy. After all it is not a book to entertain -- this is a piece of work to propose discussions. And it has done so for all these forty years."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I liked this book, I'm just not sure I really loved it. Capote does get you into the story, the event of the murder of the Clutter family and he does it very well. His work on this novel defined a new genre of \\"real-life fiction\\" and we hear the common refrain before many of today's tv shows, \\"based on real life events\\" and we can thank Capote for much of this. However, I can't help but wonder if this story is not as timeless as Capote had initially imagined. In a day and age where horrific murder is reported daily or at least weekly on multiple news channels, Capote's book lacks the timeless essence his other work is known for and as a result, lacks that dramatic punch that it must have had in the 60s and 70s. I also found that once I read \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" and several of his other short stories, (for which he was much heralded), I had a different take on the book. In retrospect, I noticed a much more liberal slant to Perry and Dick, the two murderers in the novel than I did when I first read their story. Capote is very forgiving of his character's faults in his stories and this becomes much more apparent in \\"In Cold Blood\\" if you are already familiar with his work. Capote is a one of the most well respected authors of the last century, but if you want a feel for his work, read some of his short stories before getting into his most well-known novel."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"\\"In Cold Blood\\" is the rare kind of book in which you get to experience a true story of horrible acts, but at the same time, you receive an interesting look into the workings of American justice. Whether you are a supporter of capital punishment or not, or a student of criminology or just a curious reader, this book is for you. It will take you through all the emotions of terror for the slain Clutter family and both hatred and empathy for their killers. Capote proves to be an well-researched author and not a sensationalist for at times, when it was expectant of him to paint a bloody picture of the victims or the hangings of their murderers, he does not give you that. Without completely describing the crime scene, he is still able to portray the feelings of the residents of Holcomb and Garden City, where the murders took place. I expected to hate Hickcock and Smith at the end of the book but I pitied them. I also felt sorry for a small town in Kansas that whose existance completely altered by these murders. While this was an engaging book, I could not help but wish it had never been written, that the Herb, Bonnie, Nancy, and Kenyon Clutter had never been harmed. It is evident that \\"In Cold Blood\\" will take you through every emotion possible and back again by the time you have closed the book. I would highly suggest this book for all people, but especially those with an interest in American justice in it's various forms. You will learn a great deal about how far we have come in our history and a brief glimpse as well in where we are headed."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In my English Honors class this semester, we were assigned to read a book of our choice. At first, I told myself I would pick out the shortest book acceptable and read it the last night before it was due. I asked my mom for advice on a good book that would keep my attention. She handed me her copy of In Cold Blood that she read in high school. I decided to give it a try as it caught my attention because it took place in my home state of Kansas. The first night after starting the novel, I couldn't put it down. It kept my attention through most of the first section, but it failed to hold my interest towards the end. I felt that it wasn't necessary for Truman Capote to dig so deeply into Dick and Perry's past. I found myself skimming the unncesseary parts in which Capote gives us their background. I think Capote could have explained more of the events that took place the night of the murder, and everything leading up to it. I did like that way Capote added his own input to make it a semi-fictional novel. In the novel, I can see Capote trying to stick up for the murderers, especially Perry smith. There is actual evidence in which it is said that while Perry Smith was on death row, he became friends with Capote. An unusual and very interesting book, Capote's In Cold Blood proved to be a compelling novel. Capote's insight into the minds of the characters demonstrated writing excellence. Even though the events in question took place over forty years ago, the novel still creates a remarkable story line that is able to keep anyone's attention."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote, a controversial author at the time, writes an incredible story in the novel, In Cold Blood. Capote creates a chilling, exciting and astonishing true account novel of the murders of the Clutter family in 1959. He uses deep tone, language and real accounts from witnesses of the family to create these gruesome details. Deep tone, language and real account passages create a disturbing mood throughout the novel. These strategies are used frequently in the story. Truman's language throughout the novel leaves a haunting and lasting impression in one's mind. Capote's use of strong tone, &quot;There's too much blood. There's blood on the walls.&quot;, is one example of the unsettling attributes of his writings. &quot;He'd been shot, all right, the same as Kenyon-with the gun held right in front of his face.&quot;; this passage paints an appalling picture in the mind, which is another example of the gruesomeness of his writings. Real account passages and first person interviews give the book a more personal aspect. Capote once told that the killers asked him, to be present at the time when the hangings were done. This method of being a live witness helped create the authentic tone and mood set for the book. Capote uses conversations that took place during the investigation as another example of real accounts. One example is the conversation between Mrs. Hickock, a mother of one of the killers, and a private investigator. &quot;That's his gun. Dick's. Him and David go out once in a while. After rabbits mostly. It was a .12-gauge Savage shotgun, Model 300; a delicately etched scene of pheasants in flight ornamented the handle.&quot; This example is a good one because it first points out the murder weapon and the one break that the police needed to catch the killers. These strategies are extremely useful because they give the book it's true mood and tone. Capote's use of deep tone, ghastly language and real accounts from witnesses of the family help create these gruesome details. In Cold Blood is one of the greatest and one of the first true account novels ever written."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood by Truman Capote is a true story about the sudden murders of a family. You get a detailed account of every aspect of the murders and even get to know the killers intimately. The novel starts with the family alive and doing their day to day activities and by the end you know exactly what happened to them and what happened to the two murderers. I would recommend this book to people who are interested in knowing EVERYTHING about the tragedy. Capote really doesn't leave any detail out when telling this story. In some parts of the novel it is very slow and there are many parts that could have been left out. You really do get a sense of the characters personalities and it feels like you know them personally after finishing this book. Overall, In Cold Blood was an interesting story but definitely not a suspenseful page turner."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in my entire life. My only regret is that I did not read it sooner. This is a true crime masterpiece. Truman Capote painted a masterstroke with every page. He was able to capture this terrible and violent story in such a way that I do not believe that any other author could have done in a million lifetimes. The way he captured the image of that sleepy town, the family who was killed, and everyone involed in the crime from the killers to the investigators was nothing short of extrordinary. Mr. Capote remains un biased from beginning to end. This is a book I plan or reading many more times to remind me what great writing is all about. It was too bad Mr. capote never wrote another true crime piece again because I believe it was his true calling."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This is my first Capote book and I wasn't disappointed. He has a style best called a page turner. Without confusion he lets the reader progress forward as real events unfold, adds history of an event, and then brings you back in real time. Some writers try this montage effect and only create confusion. Capote weaves the two together and allows the reader to process the sequence of events. Very clever, very readable and a very satisfying read. Would recommend this to any first time Capote reader and you don't have to be an intellectual to enjoy it."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Just finished this book and had to write a review for it. It's been years since I've read a book that is so difficult to put down! This was my first book by Capote and I just ordered 2 more by him. It's amazing that this is a true story and Capote is brilliant with his presentation of this gruesome crime story."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"A bit disappointed. I am 55 yrs old and have a memory of all the press and hype about this book. I always wanted to read something written by Capote. The writing wasn't as interesting as I had hoped and the sensationalism of the horrible crime just didn't meet my expectation. I believe because we see so much through social media now we have become somewhat de-sensitized to the horrible things people do."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"not a typical book we had for lit. class and was pleasantly surprised good insight on one messed up mind"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Seemed a bit long in the tooth; plenty of extraneous info.

I was worried the violence would be unpleasantly graphic, but it isn't. The violence is minimally and tastefully included (perhaps because it was done decades ago), which I appreciated. It's an intriguing look at human behavior. All the more chilling because it's true."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I had somehow missed reading this book. The movie was spectacular, but the quality of the writing in \\"In Cold Blood\\" was outstanding. I had read Breakfast at Tiffiny's and other short stories of Truman Capote's, but the charecter development in this book was remarkable. I believe this book opened my mind to the real talent of the man. Sometimes it is very good to read a classic. Thanks Kindle Fire. I would not have read this book without you."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"It is a testament to Truman Capote's ability that he was able to take a small yet disturbing blurb in the New York Times and not only write a compelling book about it, but create a new literary form, the nonfiction novel, and also turn the story into an American classic. IN COLD BLOOD fully deserves the accolades that have been heaped upon it since its publication.That newspaper blurb, of course, was about the mysterious murders of the Clutter family (father Herbert, mother Bonnie, and teenagers Nancy and Kenyon) in the small, isolated town of Holcomb, Kansas. At first, it was unclear why the family had been slaughtered and it was thought to be the work of a psychopathic killer. That such psychopathy flared up in America's heartland made the story all the more disturbing. After all, everyone knows all the weirdos and lunatics were supposed to live in New York or San Francisco. To think that they were right in our midst...Capote's detailed (and controversial!) studies of the murders take us so deep into the story it is like we were really there. Using the techniques of fiction and applying them to a non-fiction story, Capote brings the real life tragedy to life a second time around. This is particularly disturbing with respect to the two men who committed the crime, Dick Hickock and Perry Smith. IN COLD BLOOD probably is the first book of its kind to give the readers such an accurate portrait into the minds and personalities of such brutal killers.What strikes the reader hard is that, of the two criminals, it is the actual trigger man, Perry Smith, who is the more tender and emotionally vulnerable. That Dick Hickock seems, by every measure imaginable, to be a harsher person than his compatriot is juxtaposed powerfully with Hickock's own complaints that he is the only person on death row who did not actually kill anyone. We now know, of course, that Capote developed some type of emotional relationship with Perry Smith while researching the book and so it is up to the reader to determine how much this might have clouded Capote's judgment and writings on him.Despite the bleakness of the story, IN COLD BLOOD is written in a very feminine and flowery style. If Capote's homosexuality were not widely known, one could almost assume as much by this. Again, this creates a jarring juxtaposition for the reader, as he is confronted with the darkest corners of depravity.Anyone who visits the true crime section of a bookstore is confronted with books basically reeking of schlock. A good writer, however, can turn the average, or even below average, subject and elevate it to new heights. This is what Truman Capote did. IN COLD BLOOD is very cold, indeed."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I had never heard of Truman Capote or the Clutter family murders before this book. If you want a book that reads like the inside of the killers mind, this one is what you want. The attention to detail and the description was amazing! The only thing I didn't like was even after seeing how brutal and horrific these murders were, it was like the author was fighting for the killers in the end. Almost as if he was defending them by saying they were insane. Other than that this was a good way to learn about the Clutter family murders in Holcomb Kansas."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I had no idea what this book was about when I bought it. It was years ago now, and I was given a list of \\"Good Books\\" to read as a present: A deck of cards, each card representing a great work in American Literature that everyone should read. This was one of the books. I liked it a lot. At the time, I had no idea who Capote was (I still don't) and it wasn't until recently when movie after movie keeps coming out about this \\"Capote\\" character that I realized he was the author of this book. It's a good book, and a well-told story, but I don't see why Capote has recently been thrown up on a pedestal and worshiped by Hollywood. Regardless, this book is worth your time."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Well crafted prose. Crisply written. Engaging and fluid.Reads like a novel. Lulls you into a non-fiction trance. When you regain your senses and realize that the truth of the story far outweighs the author's literary license, a paralyzing chill overtakes you.When you're finished, you get the uncomfortable feeling you've been in the company of murderers. Watched them behave. Listened to their conversations. Witnessed their evil-doings.I almost felt guilt for being so close to these devils and remaining on the sidelines, doing nothing.Exhilerating and scary all at once."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. I like the genre of true crime, but this was far better than the average true tale of murder. The depth of this book was incredible. Capote writes so descriptively that I had to put the book down periodically because it was so real and so intense.The amount of research Capote did for this was staggering. He left no stone unturned. I loved reading about the time period, which came to life with the recounting. I rented the 1968 movie with (ironically) Robert Blake doing a superb job as Perry Smith, and John Forsythe as Detective Dewey. I wonder what ever happened to all the survivors in this tale. How did they live their lives out?"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"By today's standards the murder that Capote writes about in this book isn't really all that bad. In Cold Blood pales in comparrison to books and movies like Hannibal, etc. But that's the wonderful thing about this book, you don't read it for the gory details.Never before have I read a true-crime book that drew me into the sotry like this book did. I enjoyed the book so much that I looked up the actual court cases at the local courthouses. It interested me that much.The characters in this book are so interesting that they seem to be made up, but they're not.Buy this book, read it, put it on your shelf and read it again in a couple of months. Its that good."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The murders that are graphically depicted in Truman Capote's In Cold Blood -which is now universally recognized more for its writing than anything else- are nauseating, grisly and malicious; these words do not aptly describe the frightful overtone, essence and nub of the book - that violence is not purely restricted to inner cities and to metropolises. The murders that occurred on 15 November 1959 in Holcomb, Kansas is the exclamation point to that alarming fact. Violent murders can happen in places like Holcomb where, &quot;The village (of Holcomb) stands on the high wheat plains of western Kansas, a lonesome area that other Kansans call 'out there.' Some seventy miles east of the Colorado border, the countryside, with its hard blue skys and desert-clear air, has an atmosphere that is rather more Far West than Middle West. The local accent is barbed with a prairie twang, a ranch-hand nasalness, and the men, many of them, wear narrow frontier trousers, Stetsons, and high-heeled boots with pointed toes. The land is flat, and the views are awesomely extensive; horses, herds of cattle, a white cluster of grain elevators rising as gracefully as Greek temple are visible long before a traveler reaches them.&quot; [Page three] That image of oridinary middle America with traditional homspun values that predated the golden age of Camelot dose not seem like the appropriate setting for a bloody quadruple homicide. But that in fact is cold, hard reality that can not be altered, irrelevant of society's wish for the prevention of outside ills to seep into the homogeneous and community-oriented sub-societies like Holcomb. The murders, which are a strong facet in this book, goes beyond senseless evil; it is outside human intellectual and logical reach, because during the latter part of fifties and early sixties, the study of criminology, sociology and the psychological sciences was nowhere near as honed and accurate as it is today. It was just four gruesome unsolved murders. The cure: get the person or persons responsible and punish them to the full extent of the law. Case closed. In Cold Blood is writtien in that same straight-forward, stick-to-the-facts fashion. Capote stuck to the actualities at hand; he did not interlace the act of murder with scientific/psychological reasoning as to why it happened. He knew that it was not for simple financial gain; there was something deeper and more profound involved. I think Capote was curious about that aspect of it, but it raised questions regarding his standard of objectivity when writing about the wondering and soulless lives of Perry Smith and Richard Hickock. In Cold Blood is representative of a true American tragedy on all counts, for you have the horrid slaughter of the Clutter family, and in another way, you have the death of two men who could have become something more than what they ended up if their circumstances early in their life had been just a little bit different. Ultimately, the punishment for the crime was well deserved, if not a tragedy in its own right. All told, there are no words that can appropriately express the emotions that are evoked when the book is entirely read through. For me, I did not know what depleted my emotions more: the fantastic breadth of writing adroitness or the vividly detailed vicious massacre of the Clutter family and the muddled lives of its two very sad criminals. I now realize that it is a definate hybrid of the two - a true but grim American classic where the act of murder and its consequences is stunningly written and astonishingly articulated."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"There were parts that were quite chilling and gruesome. Capote uses good detail and description. However, there were some areas of the book that ran rather slow, and could have used a 'little pick me up'. All in all though, a very good read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"While the point of view was interesting and different, i thought that the story was way too top-heavy. The endless flood of details at first added to the book, but eventually seemed to drag it down. The way he describes his characters, though is really well done, making us feel sorry for Perry and being able to understand him. But otherwise, it seemed to be a rather dry book."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"As much as this book has been trumpeted, I found it rather tedious. Capote's stab at ambience journalism, while not irresponsible, rather leaves me cold. I suppose that Capote's tangential characters were well fleshed-out, but so unnecessary to the continuance of the story, I wondered if they weren't a bit overdeveloped. I should point out that, unlike the other reviewers, I did not use this novel as a springboard to develop opinions on the death penalty, so perhaps the major charm of the novel was wasted on me. I enjoyed &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's&quot; a tremendous deal more."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Wow, this book really delves into parts of the mind that I wouldn't want to venture into myself.

There is no fiction in this book. Truman Capote created a new genre that we now take for granted - the nonfiction novel. To quote from a Yahoo search and dictionary definition of nonfiction novel - \\"a factual or historical narrative written in the form of a novel.\\" That means a true story is written in the \\"style\\" a made-up story would be written. Capote took the facts of the case and the people involved and told us their story. Its that simple. Its hard to believe now that these type of books did not always exist, but they didn't.Capote tells the tale of a God-fearing Kansas family who were all murdered in cold blood one night for a safe full of money that never existed, and the lives and inside the minds of the men who did it.If you like true crime, and want to read the granddaddy of all these true crime books on the book shelves today, this book is for you."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"There is a reason this book is such a modern classic! 2 seemingly dull and normal men ( I believe they were ex-cons-I read the book long ago) invade a prarie home hearing there is some loot stashed away.

This book was often read in an advanced English class, a class I registered for in part because I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. The teacher often came under criticism for assigning the book. I did not touch the book or open the cover until 20 years later--the good teacher decided to skip the assignment during my year. And in hindsight I can only conclude, \\"What a waste of my junior year.\\" This book is brilliantly written and is nothing short of a masterpiece.Not since reading Joseph Mitchell or John Fowles have I been so mesmerized with beautiful prose. This book, while portraying the grizzly facts of a pointless and brutal murder in Kansas, juxtaposes many feelings and impressions. I could not help but feel the tremendous loss to a community when the Clutter family dies. I could easily understand how some community members would come to look at each other suspiciously. I appreciated the few charitable and Christian people who show compasion to the jailed and accused murderers. But maybe most important, I came to see and understand the murderers in this story (Perry being the most important). While I am certainly not a bleeding-heart liberal, this book portrays Perry's story in a compelling way. I could not help but feel outraged by the \\"M'Naughton Rule\\" that yielded what appears to be, through Capote's eyes, a horribly unjust trial (even though he is clearly guilty!). And pulling all of these story lines and juxtaposed feelings into a tight narrative is Capote's masterly prose. This book is brilliant.I wish I had not waited twenty years to buy and read \\"In Cold Blood.\\" The book certainly deserved a spot on my book shelf long before now."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Still chills.

I agree, but the Natalie Wood story, read immediately after In Cold Blood came in a close second if not even matching or surpassing at intervals.In Cold Blood gave me chills, all these years later. What that innocent, terrorized farm family, living in a remote area suffered is beyond comprehension. That is what these two books have in common. Terror beyond comprehension.

The \\"backstory\\" -- Capote's life, Harper Lee's profound contributions to this work, as well as Capote's complete failure to acknowledge her contribution -- is fascinating on its own. The novel itself lives up to its reputation, and has an ageless, universal quality. It is incredibly thought-provoking, and Capote plumbs the depths of the subject matter like a true master. He apparently was a rather despicable person, but with this work he has made a significant contribution to the race of humans he lived among so uncomfortably."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I bought this book when i bought Breakfast at Tiffany's. And I am so glad I did. I had never heard of it before but now that I have read it I don't know how I could never have heard of it. I am a big true crime fiend, and I also love fiction. This combined the two so nicely. It was brilliantly and beautifully written from the beginning to the end I can't think of any of it that did not engross me. I couldn't put it down once I started."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"'In Cold Blood' is one of the best books of all time. It should be required reading in all beginning college lit courses, if not in high school. I first read 'In Cold Blood' as a junior in high school (in the 80s), and I read it in one sitting- straight through the night- just because I couldn't put it down. I have recently purchased this newer edition, because this book is worth reading again.To begin with, Truman Capote, for all his notoriety, was an incredible writer, and this book is one of his finest. The gritty and depressing existence of Dick and Perry that leads up to one horrific night in Kansas is so vividly represented, you feel all the more frightened as you are reading it, because it seems you have become witness to the absolute terror and brutality perpetrated on an innocent family by these two men. Truman Capote not only presents in graphic detail the horrors of this night, but he also reveals the personalities of Dick and Perry in such a way that, even though they are despicable human beings, you may feel a twinge of sorrow for them. The birth of each man's anger, and the inability of either one of them to integrate into society, was formed in childhoods of abuse. It truly is amazing how Capote got inside the heads of these pathetic men, capturing the pervasive sadness and despair, bizarrely coupled with hope for a \\"normal\\" future. The relationship of Dick and Perry is almost a symbiotic one. Separately, they may not have done what they did, but together, they are lethal. The gullibility of a person, who never felt like he belonged, combined with another person who thinks he needs to exact revenge on society- it's a sick combination of pack mentality and ignorance. Eventually, all of this culminates into a night of terror in Kansas wrought by these two men. The portrayal is so graphic in nature; no one could read it without being rendered silently stunned by the horror of it all. The sadness felt for this totally unsuspecting and wholly innocent family is overwhelming. Certainly there have been similar crimes, but the representation of it by Capote, and the intrinsic knowledge of these two men, makes you feel you had a front row view of the whole thing.\`In Cold Blood' is less about the particulars of that awful crime one horrific night in Kansas; it is more about the insidiousness of what childhood abuse and feeling disenfranchised can do to a person. It would be easy to focus on the horror and sadness of this massacre, but the brilliance of Capote is that the focus is placed on the murderers and trying to engender compassion from the reader for them. With Capote's vision in writing, he almost gets us there. After the capture and imprisonment of these two men, you can physically feel the fear in their hearts for their own condemnation. Perry's fear of execution is especially haunting. This book is a must read for anyone who likes to read and makes no difference that it was written 40 years ago. It transcends all genres, because even though the story is horrific, the writing is phenomenal, and you will NEVER forget it."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"People will pick this book up for a lot of reasons: the famous title (and movie); the treatment in the recent movie about Truman Capote; curiosity about this classic work; fascination with 'true crime,' and other reasons. I read it for the first reason, but with a little skepticism for the fawning over Capote and his own historic fascination with the killers Dick Hickock and Perry Smith. What I found was, simply, a very well written book. That the subject matter is a brutal and outragous mass murder is almost an unsavory distraction from the fact that the story is so well told. To my surprise, Capote was never unduly sympathetic to the killers in his writings (as I had been led to believe that he had been). For that matter, the family of victims were themselves portrayed without sentiment. Capote simply built the story very well and painted a complete picture that makes the reader (even nearly 50 years after the incidents occurred) feel the he/she knows all of the players intimately. The crime itself (like other lesser crimes committed by these morons) was disgusting, but, from a literary perspective, I was pleased to be made to literally squirm as Capote lays the story out (again, this is 50 years later). Capote was writing in a more censored society - thus we are mercifully spared many of the gory details. Yet I wonder whether any writer could have communicated the brutality any 'better' - just as old movies use clever techniques to communicate the sex scene (the ol' train going into the tunnel), Capote makes the crime quite clear without having to paint the scene. Masterful.Two more quick comments. One of the delights of this book is seeing the world of America in 1959. As the reader follows the two aforementioned morons around the USA (and Mexico) on their post-massacre weeks long search for money, work, and happiness, we are treated to a travelogue filled with diners, stolen '56 Chevys, hitchhikers, and Route 66. We also see the challenges of police work before DNA tests, computerized tools, and high-speed communications - and we're amazed that they identified their killers and found them 2,000 miles away. Also, Capote's sense of timing was marvelous. For example, the reader is taken deep into the book (and long past the occurrence of the murders) before Capote reveals the play-by-play of what went on in that house - and when the story is told, it comes from the lips of the shooter himself. Chilling.I knew about Capote and read a little of his other stuff, but didn't appreciate his gift until I read his masterpiece on the bizarre subject of crime and punishment: In Cold Blood. A must for your canon."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"True story of the murder of a family in Kansas.

It was also a great experience."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"There is no disputing that Capote is one of the greats. Much of Truman's work is excellent, but this book takes the cake. A page turner that will have you questioning the security of your own home. Warning: If you live in a rural community and decide to read this book you may find it difficult to sleep!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book was so well written, so full of suspense, and so interesting. I loved it!! It wasn't a book that was all about the murders and finding the killers, it was about these characters that were just so real, it put you right there. I would recommend this book to anyone. Fantastic!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Its easy to say that Truman Capote created a new genre of novel with this account of a true crime. The problem is he let himself get too involved which shows through in his opinnions presented in the book. This review will not try and argue Capote's abilities as a word smith, because he does great things in this book. The problem is thus...Capote falls in love with Perry, one of the the Clutter family killers.At first when I read this book I noticed several things. The first of which some people disagree with, but between the lines Capote blames the Clutter family for their own murders. He does this by saying how they lived a wonderful life, in a wonderful house, in a perfect little community. Besides this, he makes Dick out to be a horrible man while lending Perry all the sympathy he can. In reality, they're both horrible people.I read this book as an assignment for school after which we watched the A&amp;E biography of Truman Capote in regards to In Cold Blood. The truth is this. Truman Capote was a homosexual, and in the course of researching the book, and his meetings with the men, he falls in love with Perry. In class discussions, I was of the opinnion that Truman Capote did not seem objective, though very few people agreed. After watching the biography, I wonder how Capote could have written an objective novel about a man he had feelings for. I was of the opinnion that regardless of the two men's backgrounds, whether good or bad, commiting the crime made them the same. The book implies that Perry is the lesser of the two evils."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I think that we all have the capacity to love and relate to Perry Smith. He is the driving source behind the greatness of this novel- his inward struggles, the haziness he has with reality and what is a mere dream, a fantasy- all make this book the best ever. The book is rich in the details of the murder of the Clutter family, from Holcomb, Kansas, in the lives of the victims and the two murderers, Dick Hickock (the less likeable) and Perry Smith. I really, really love this book. I have like five different copies of it, like Mel Gibson in Conspiracy Theory (haha). But that's only because this is an utterly absorbing and beautiful; it is like an eggshell china set covered in fancy scrawls and designs but with a crack forming in it. The crack is not to say anything negative, I just have to speak in metaphors. The crack is the human flaws, those so well noticed by Capote. READ THIS BOOK PLEASE!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book was interesting in a very creepy way. I felt very certain emotions being played out through the entire piece. These emotions were impossible not to feel. Capote makes a true story seem like a work of fiction. Let's just all admit that most true-life accounts are all the same and the spectacle of the fiction books keeps us more enthralled. But I was amazed at how well the story kept me interested and allowed for the emotions in the book to make an impact on me.The story was linear which made it seem less interesting, but going back and forth from Perry and Dick to the Clutters, and back to the Sherriff made the story pick up pace a little bit.The only thing I did not enjoy about this book was that it made me feel sorry for the killers. After what they did I did not want to feel sorry for them. And at the end, I was surprised to find myself rooting for Perry and Dick. (Well, mostly Perry) But they did something horrible and that's what they deserve.I would recommend this book to someone interested in true-life accounts because I am sure it will be the best they will ever read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book is pretty good, Its considered a Nonfiction book since its based on the killings of the Clutters, but Truman did make up some of this stuff too. I watched a video about In Cold Blood, lemme tell ya, this Truman guy has the weirdest voice ever, and he has the 2 male killers in the book constantly calling each other 'Honey' and stuff... Its a pretty good attention getter for about the first half, but the last half gets kind of boring when Dick and Perry are being questioned and all that jazz."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In cold Blood it was a terrible mishap to the Clutter family. The family was brutually murdered in their Kansas home by two outsiders for no apparent reason. Truman Capote brings the facts of this tradedy that happenend in 1959 to today's society. It was a thrilling novel with non-stop action In the end Perry and Dick finally get what they deserve and victory is unto the Clutter family.I highly recommend this novel. If you like thrilling action this definity is book for you."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In this story the Clutters are killed by Perry Smith and Dick Hickock. Dick had recently been in jail where he shared a cell with Floyd Wells who gave him the idea of robbing the Clutters for their fortune. Dick and Perry meet up and drive to Kansas to get their hands on the cash. After Perry shoots everyone in the house they find that the Clutters only had forty dollars and no safe. Dick goes back home and claims that he was at Fort Sumter but the next day him and Perry flee to Mexico. Floyd wells hears the news of the murder and rats Dick out to the authorities. Eventually Dick and Perry are caught and after five years sentenced to death. I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to anyone.It was interesting to watch the characters develop throughout the story. In the beginning they were obsessed with money and didn't see a problem with killing people like when they tried to kill a person with a rock to get his car. Towards the end they were more peaceful and went to their deaths with little struggling. They apologize for their crime and seemed to have some remorse.I liked how Perry and Dick when they where first imprisoned Dick tried everything to get out. First Dick tried to make a knife out of a tooth brush. Later he claimed that he didn't have a fair trial and that the death penalty was inhumane.This story had a lot of irony in it. For instance when Dick and Perry executed the plan that Dick had been working on for years they only got forty dollars. Any good story should have a bit of irony in it.This book had very interesting and unique characters. I enjoyed the irony in this story very much. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has some free time or has to do a book report."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The writing is excellent, the content is thrilling--but this account of a violent murder is forever tainted by the immoral approach of the author, who manipulated confessions for the sake of his book--and then gave a black and white party from the blood money.

It details the actions of a pair of brutal killers with the implicit view that these killers were not that bad, and that they should not be viewed as the inhuman, mindless brutes that they are. The two murderers are &quot;humanized&quot; to the point of inducing a violent nausea in a despicable attempt to elicit pity from the reader.I read this book in my English class, and I could not believe how successful Capote's attempt at pity was. When I was not trying to remind the rest of the class that these two monsters brutally murdered an innocent family, I was sitting with my mouth agape listening to their petty, incoherent, erroneous rationalizations. Please do not be fooled by Capote... these two killers do not deserve your pity -- they do not even deserve to be called &quot;human.&quot;For a book that glorifies man, I suggest the masterpiece by Ayn Rand: Atlas Shrugged. Miss Rand presents man as heroic being who is capable of dealing with reality. Although one may cringe when one looks at Atlas Shrugged (it is almost 1100 pages), one will be wishing for more by the end."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Why is this book rated in the Top Ten most popular \\"Espionage Non-Fiction\\" books when there is absolutely not one word involving espionage anywhere in this book?"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I was late to the party on this book.

IN COLD BLOOD simply demonstrates the repression of male-to-male love in American society. Truman Capote's simple point, if the two \\"killers had simply hopped in the sack together\\" their lives would have been more fulfilled, and the slaughter of this farm family would have been avoided entirely. This PILL is too big for most Americans to swallow; therefore, that's why we learn nothing about why COLUMBINE & DC SNIPERS find fertile ground in our oppressive way of life. If you aren't humanistic or intellectual who's well on his way to becoming self-actualized, you have no moral right to read that which was never intended as literary entertainment, but rather as critical societal commentary. It never ceases to amaze me how repressed Americans accept oppression without second thought; yet are very defensive about the truth. And the truth, after all, is why we are born. Less than 10% of nonfiction literature is ever interpreted as the author intended it to be. We should learn to read critically; as though we were seeking to learn from the experience, as opposed to being self-righteously entertained as passive consumers and learners. Make Truman Capote proud, read with an open mind -- one cannot be opnionated about something he knows nothing about. Enjoy life, and, walk away learning an invaluable lesson."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book is a bore!

There was nothing at all interesting about this book. The people involved were not interesting, the random act of violence itself was not interesting, and the setting was enough to drive anyone bonkers. One more description of a flowing wheat (or was it corn?) field and I'd have permanent twitches.The only interesting thing in this entire book was a little poem quoted in it by one of the killers. That's IT. I couldn't have been more thoroughly disappointed with a classic of literature but I did learn one thing... If I were a teenage girl living in 1950's Kansas I would have surely either died of boredom or killed myself for something to do.

Controversial on its publication, Capote writes in the style of \\"New Journalism\\", a genre championed by writer Tom Wolfe, that tries to remain impartial by framing the narrative in carefully chosen fact and sequence.What is captivating about this book is that even though questions about the \\"who\\" and \\"what\\" are already part of public knowledge in this widely publicised case, Capote gets under the skin of the purveyors and victims through interviews with the townspeople, detectives, and the killers themselves, as well as records, diaries and psychiatrist reports (which have been undisclosed in court) to deconstruct the \\"why\\" behind the crime.The narrative, however, is strangely written \\"as it is\\", without comment but with statements of fact and observation, perhaps also in the style of modernist writing. The central murder is delayed and completely ellipted in the first part of the novel, even as the killers draw closer and closer to the doomed family, in the alternating paragraphs that turn the reader's attention to the family and the killers in turn to create much suspense and foreboding.It is almost impossible to leave this book without being chilled by the randomness of violence in 1960s America (what more in present day), or being disturbed by the justice of the death penalty."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood by Truman Capote/ Non Fiction; Random House; 1966:Family plays an extremely important role in one's life.This idea is clearly shown in Truman Capote's captivating, In Cold Blood, first published in 1966. As the non-fiction account begins, the Clutter family is living everyday life in Kansas on November 14, 1959. Herbert and Bonnie Clutter and their teenage children, Nancy and Kenyon, live a happy life on their ranch in the small town of Holcomb. Herbert Clutter is a well-respected man in the town and is known to be a generous employer. In another part of Kansas, former convicts Dick Hickock and Perry Smith are both on parole. They are planning to \\"score\\", with a shotgun, rubber gloves, rope and black stockings. They start making their way towards Holcomb while making various stops along the way.The next morning, all four members of the Clutter family are found dead in their household. There is barely any evidence found, besides two boot prints and the material used to tie the family down and kill them. KBI agent Alvin Dewey leads an investigation to find the cold-blooded killers. Dick and Perry are in Kansas City questioning the probability that they will be caught. They then make their way to Mexico while making cash by passing some hot checks.Perry dreams of magnificent adventures and being saved from his difficulties by beautiful parrots. His dreams are a way of reimbursing for the suffering of his childhood. He is insecure, thoughtful, and deep-thinking. While packing to return to the U.S., Perry goes through his belongings and remembers his childhood. He finds a letter in which his Father describes him as \\"normal\\" and \\"good-hearted\\" if treated properly. Perry was passed from home to home as a child. His parents divorced and two of his three siblings have killed themselves. Many years later, Perry went to prison for robbing an office supply store and met Dick.The investigation led by Dewey is slow, but there is a breakthrough when one of Dick's old prison mate's, Floyd Wells, hears of the case. He is sure that Dick is accountable for the crime, and he begins to think of confessing. Meanwhile, Dick and Perry are hitchhiking in the American desert because they have run out of money. They try to steal a car, but fail. Floyd has decided to confess, and Dewey and his team are beginning a manhunt.In Cold Blood feels more like a fiction novel than a non-fiction journalism. Because it is a true story, many knew the outcome of In Cold Blood, when it was first published, but Capote was still able to make the story interesting. The book thoroughly shows how important family can be through the loving Clutter family and Perry's family background. The Clutter family was unified and happy, while Perry could have become a normal and content person if it weren't for his unsupportive family.Capote created a unique structure for the book. He demonstrates this in the first section of the book \\"The Last To See Them Alive\\", when he says, \\"Jolene urged that they sample the pie at once-no nonsense about leaving it to cool... The tattooed face of a cat, blue, and grinning, covered his right hand; on one shoulder a blue rose blossomed\\"( 24-30). Reading about Nancy Clutter baking a pie and then reading about the killers' tattoos created a montage. It contrasted consequent images to create a specific impression. This was a very diverse and creative structure, which proved very effective. Capote ended the novel by saying: \\"The graves of the Clutter family, four graves gathered under a sing stone, lie in a far corner of the cemetery-beyond the trees, out in the sun, almost at the wheat field's bright edge\\" (342).I greatly enjoyed reading In Cold Blood, the true story of murder was very captivating. I highly recommend this book to those who enjoy a fascinating and suspenseful story.-Thomas Ng-Yow"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The book is a gripping non-fiction book which surrounds the murder of the Clutter family and the subsequent trials of Perry and Dick.

Read this book"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I owned this book for years, but donated it to my library. After seeing the brilliant movie \\"Capote\\", however, I bought it again and read it. First of all,I'm puzzled why people call this \\"non-fiction\\" or journalistic reporting. Don't expect to get \\"just the facts\\" here since in many parts - to put it politely - CAPOTE MAKES CRAP UP!! Whole conversations, scenes, incidents involving secondary or tertiary characters, where Capote is not present, was not told about it, but is just spinning yarns. If reporters made up as much of their story as Capote did, they'd be fired. When you realize how manipulative Capote was, you realize how massive his ego must have been to do so.Second, Capote is imaginative but I wouldn't consider him a brilliant writer. (I can see why Harper Lee won the Pulitzer and he never did.) This book falls off the narration track in numerous places because Capote engages in an extended flashback or narrative - often about secondary or irrelevant characters who are never mentioned again. If I didn't know better, I'd think he was a 5th grader who'd been told to write a 10,000 page essay and he was bound-and-determined to cram every word in.Finally, it is clear in his writing that he is fascinated with Perry Smith. He spends 50% of the book relaying Perry's background, thoughts, motivations, etc almost to the point where the Clutter murders seem an afterthought.I'll keep the book just to say I read it but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you are interested in the author himself. In that case, I'd suggest you read up on him or watch \\"Capote\\" (and \\"Infamous\\") first and then read the book. Read and analyzed in that light, Capote's motives in choosing his words are fascinating and in reality, HE'S the story. Ultimately, that's what makes it interesting."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In the 1920s, the \\"Lost Generation\\", a collection of American writers and thinkers, found within their blase ennui a yearning to create \\"The Great American Novel\\", the one book that would represent the apex of American writing artform and be so intricately linked to the idea of Americanness as a whole as to be indisputably an American work, removed from all of the styles and conceits of previous forms of literature.In a way, I, PolarisDiB, feel that I can argue that this, Truman Capote's \\"In Cold Blood,\\" is that aspired novel.The main feature of this work is it's exploration of The American Dream. I'm sure you've heard that term before, given to many a work. Well here it is again. The killers that are analyzed thoroughly and humanly in this book are brought into their crime almost explicitly from their own idea of the American Dream. Smith, the dreamer, wants the highest forms of attention and friendship, to be idolized by the world around him. Hickock wants utter control of his surroundings and his profligate tendencies.Smith and Hickock then go to THE ACTUALIZATION of the classic American Dream, the \\"Good Ol' Days\\" that politicians always like to refer to, the golden-crisp agrarian Eden so beloved of our Founding Fathers: the Clutter's farm, an enticingly open field of aging mares, perfect gardens, huge houses, and a beloved family. When the two parts of American Dream clash, that of the obsessively unconcious and that of the comfortably asleep, tragedy ensues, and the focus of how that tragedy affects everyone nearly related is the rest of this exploration into American lives.Because, afterall, Americans tend to be obsessed with crime, and always surrounding the idea that America is a quiet, comfortable place where people grow fat and rich without worries of the outer world is also the marketing of fear that surrounds our discourse, tempting us to lock doors and distrust our neighbors. Even the most comfortable, quiet, and trusting community is willing to point the finger at neighbors and say in a distrustful voice, \\"You are a stranger.\\" The usual simplicity in religiousness and law is broken down with fear and vengeance, vengeance that is confused because it asks we do whatever we can to stop a crime from happening again, but we're never quite sure what to do about it. Is it our place to take a man's life because he took a man's life?Written in a combination journalistic and Romantic approach, with a distinctive style and an amazingly open and objective commentary, Capote provides us everything we thirst after and avoid, the ideals of what we all want and the nature of how those wants can evaporate into tragedy. While sold as the first True Crime genre novel, and marketed as a realistic approach, the symbolism and overbearing narrative quality is impossible to ignore. Capote not only gives us the accounts, but factors in our psychological needs... rain falling during the execution, bright sunlight bearing omininous tidings, yellow parrots as Savior mechanisms.So put down your Fitzgerald, your Hemingway, your Eliot for a moment, and take a look at In Cold Blood. Beyond affecting you in profound ways, you might just discover what they were all working for.--PolarisDiB"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"For those who think true crime is a low-class genre, they would do well to read Capote's phenomenal study of murder in rural Kansas. A moving examination of the 1959 shotgun killings of a farmer and three members of his family, \\"In Cold Blood\\" is not just an epic account of a heinous crime, it's a marvel of writing.The book has aged little since its original publication date in 1965. Capote's gift of description, his ability to plunge the depths of human nature and the work's emotional power still resonate sharply. He exercises a clear empathy not only for the victims of the crime, but the perpetrators as well -- one of whom, Perry Smith, could have offered much more to the world if his brutal upbringing hadn't set him on such a destructive path.\\"In Cold Blood\\" is more than simply a book about murder. It's an in-depth and passionate look of lives changed forever and one of the best examples of an author at the height of his powers."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book chills me as an adult as it did and early teen. WOW, powerful writing!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"How in the world did that little gnome with the helium voice and a penchant for the bizarre in his personal life manage to write such a gripping, tour de force true account of a grisley murder in Holcomb, Kansas?I do not know. But it is so tightly written that it has to be by sheer genius.Capote was arguably one of the weirdest celebrities of his day. Hobnobbing with the rich and famous after publication of his &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's&quot;, he then turned around and did some serious journalistic work on what would become: In Cold Blood.This book was required reading for my high school law class.The tone and perspective used in this book has been copied by countless authors to a much less effective level. It has been further copied by screenwriters and directors - also less effectively.The black and white film version with Robert Blake is a fair rendition of the book, but could not truly capture the agony of the victims and the pitifulness and degredation of the killers.Really a page turner, so if you haven't: read this book!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I read this book about two years ago when I was 15 and I loved it. Its a reality check for the reader because it is a true story and so well written I honestly couldn't put it down. It at the same time made me disgusted at the whole event described and I was pulled into the lives of the family murdered, proving that the author thoroughly did their job in writing this book."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I loved reading this non-fiction &quot;novel&quot; just as much as I loved reading &quot;The Executioner's Song&quot; by Norman Mailer. Both books were moving and thoroughly got into the heads of the criminal, yet they further confirmed my belief that the death penalty is necessary and an important feature of American justice.&quot;In Cold Blood&quot; is beautifully written with as many lovely images and lines as in &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's&quot; or the Christmas short-story. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because Truman seemed to speed up toward the end of the novel and, in my opinion, didn't really spend to much time with Dick or Perry during their final days. For instance, after learning about Perry's horrible family life, the bird dream he repeatedly has, and many other fine tidbits in his life, Truman never really discussed how Perry felt about his upcoming execution. I felt a cheated out. (Also, Truman tried to hide his own character in the novel by referring to himself as &quot;a journalist&quot; -- a bit tacky.)Finally, I just want to remind readers that this is a true story about real people. In many ways, regarding the characters involved, it is much more fascinating, in-depth, and &quot;human&quot; than any fiction novel could be."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Today, there are so many written works that purport to get into the mind of mass murderers that such works almost seem trite. Truman Capote's &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; was the first (and best) of the genre. Capote's account tracks the mass killing of a Kansas family through the arrest and trial of their killers to the execution of the two men responsible. Along the way, he provides an unforgettable account of a truly henious crime and its aftermath. The surprise twist towards the end would have seemed contrived had it been part of a novel and shows the fallacy of assuming we know what motivates a killer. This book is a must read for anyone with interest in criminology."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Probably like most viewers, a viewing of the excellent film \\"Capote\\" motivated me to read this book. I rather expected the effete intellectual Capote to do a bit of a hatchet job on rural Kansans, but was suprised to find a rather even-handed and sympathetic treatment instead.I'm no reader of the crime genre, fiction or non-fiction, but at times I wondered how much In Cold Blood might have in common with it. At times, homely touches seem a bit over-wrought. The daughter gives up a favored activity to teach a small girl to bake a pie, that kind of thing. Even though this may have really happened, it's the imagined dialog and inner thoughts that give this and other scenes a pulpish feel.Still, we are made to care about the family, the community, and the murderers themselves, especially Perry Smith, who had an artistic sensibility despite a hellish upbringing. Jaklak sez check it - and the movie - out."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"As so many i read all the rave reviews, and being in a \\"true crime\\" phase right now i picked this up in high hopes, after reading a bunch of other, highly thrilling pieces.To be honest, i am about 25% in now and will likely stop reading tonight because the book is not doing it for me. The murder already happened, and i am NOT excited looking forward at any more lengthy, boring in-depth portrayal of the murders or their motives.I am also not sure if that (at its time) \\"new\\" genre of \\"non fiction novel\\" really does it for me. There is no question that Capote might be a good writer, but the writing style appears old-fashioned to me and in some way out of place on the background of the events. It (his style) just makes it more \\"flowery\\" and \\"dragging\\", but doesn't really add to what i personally would expect from a true crime story. I don't think i can endure the rest of this book. I am just not motivated enough. It's not a book where (unlike with other books) i can't wait to continue reading. In other words: 25% in and already bored and looking to read something else.It's like the \\"waterworld\\" of literature. You know it's not really \\"bad\\"...but then its not really thrilling either.I just read some other comment where someone states \\"the true brilliance of Capote lies in his style, not its subject matter\\"..Sorry, no, no and another no. This is exactly what i am criticizing...what some might call \\"brilliance\\" due to \\"his style\\"...i call flowery and out-of-place, if not boring. A book which reads as if someone cites bible-verses using out-dated language does NOT make the book better. Maybe he should have written a poem like \\"Shotguns Beneath the Sky of West Kansas\\". Style and \\"poetic language\\" is simply not something i look for in a crime book. If i were to look for such i would read something entirely different."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"If you have been a victim of a family murder, or of a friend's murder, please do not read this book.For the facts are that although Truman Capote made a clear indication of what happens in this true story, there are very touchy parts where he details information about the two killers of the lovely Clutter family from Holocombe in the Sunflower state of Kansas.In this quiet area of Kansas, where the only sounds one hears are those of the not so silent winds from the hills above them, this true story is told of a God-fearing family of husband and wife; sister and brother killed in cold blood while awakened out of their sleep one November night.....for what??? Forty dollars.The part of this true piece of non-fiction that really caused me alarm was the fact that the killers were never repentant or remorseful of their crime. They laughed about it, they slept after they had committed their crime and ate their bellies full. They had no care for anyone but themselves, and then again I'm a bit doubtful of that myself.The book is well written and actually there is far more detail about the hunted than the dead. I would have appreciated being told much more about the Clutters who fell victims because of two uneducated....unreasonable men who thought the world owed them so much more. May God have mercy on them!!!Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE)"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"\\"Holcomb, Kan., Nov. 15 [1959] (UPI) -- A wealthy wheat farmer, his wife and their two young children were found shot to death today in their home. They had been killed by shotgun blasts at close range after being bound and gagged ... There were no signs of a struggle, and nothing had been stolen. The telephone lines had been cut.--The New York Times\\"I'm hesitant to review Truman Capote's seminal true-crime novel In Cold Blood. How does one begin to review non-fiction, let alone true stories? I see the vanity of my opinion on the situation and want to run screaming the other way. But that curious part of me, that part buried in a metal box in the middle of my heart, twitches and pines for things it ought not. As I've mused time and again, I am inexplicably drawn to these things.In Cold Blood is the account of the Clutter murders. The book is broken up into four sections and told through numerous Points-of-View. We watch Herb Clutter, kindly and genteel, make his way around Holcomb, conducting business for his family farm. We see sixteen-year-old Nancy Clutter's budding relationship with her high school boyfriend. We struggle with Mrs. Clutter and her bouts of depression, and son Kenyon (15) and his aspirations. We're told about the small town of Holcomb and its caring citizens, where Church is society, the diner is always busy, and idle talk spreads fast.Beyond this, and the more intriguing parts of the book, we travel with Dick Hickock and Perry Smith, two parolees who ultimately murder four innocent people for the hope of a chance that Mr. Clutter kept a safe in his house, filled with at least ten thousand dollars. We learn of each man's upbringing, of their choices that landed them in jail, of their plans and goals, of their bitterness, and of their deaths. It's easy to pity them, to wish things better for them, but from the onset we're aware of their deed and their execution.Capote is brilliant in building dread and suspense. Scenes change quickly, and since this is a journalistic approach, we see various sides of people/events. There is much to be said about the crime, the victims, the criminals, and the aftermath, and Capote adroitly handles it all.Strikingly, the brutality of the crime (as well as the executions of Hickock, Smith, and some other men on Death Row) is done in a matter-of-fact way. Capote presents the scene with little fanfare, and this minimalism is chilling. The Reader is left as dazed and confused as the townsfolk of Holcomb were, and one can't help but press on to discover the true motive. Why? continually comes to mind. Emotion is poured into the book, though often it is reserved and professional, and this dichotomy makes for an oddly disturbing read.In Cold Blood has been on my TBR shelf for a very long time, and I'm glad it's finally gone. I wanted to read it for RIP this year because this stuff is what truly defines horror to me. It's real and 100% possible, not like some phantom killer or haunted house. I tend to think that we've created ghost stories as an escape, preferring the supernatural to the perfectly natural. Because there are killers out there. People that torture, kidnap, rape, murder, assault, harass, antagonize. And who knows when someone could simply snap and massacre a shopping center or bookstore? It's scary enough to make me want to take my family and live in a bomb shelter, buried and out of sight, safe and secure. And when my mind starts roaming these uncomfortable corridors, I have to ask myself one question: what if you're the one to snap?And it stops me. Cold. Because I'm human, just like Dick Hickock, Perry Smith, Herb Clutter, and everybody else. I'm no killer, but I could be. We all could be. We all have the potential. What keeps us held back is our self-control, or maybe our fear of prison and death. What keeps me back is my love for people, my love of life, made possible by the gospel of Jesus Christ. Without Him, I think I'd be some kind of messed up person, but I trust Him and His word that He'll never leave me or forsake me. But really, when you think about it, if you stand two people side-by-side, one a killer, the other not, and put them in identical clothes and ask someone to pick out the killer, there's no difference. Both are just simply people, and that's the most terrifying thing out there. We don't really know anyone...[Note: After re-reading this, I realize how disturbing this post is, and I've considered simply deleting and starting over. But, as a purist, I find that path treacherous. Instead, I'll echo my previous line. I am enslaved to God and committed until I die, therefore I do not keep myself restrained from going out and murdering somebody. Instead, I deal with the more insidious sins, things like when Jesus said that being angry with your brother was basically wanting to kill him, and inward lust was the same thing as adultery, and pride--oh how I loathe thee!--that snakes its way into every aspect of my life. Yes, friends, I am perfectly sane (to my knowledge). Just trying to make my way in the world the same as the rest of ya.]"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"It's an American classic and I'm glad I finally read it. I'm not sure if the younger generations will appreciate it as much."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"After seeing both film versions of the writing of this book, I decided it was high time to read this classic. And it is a genuine classic, no question about that. If I had read it when it first came out, I'm sure I would have been stunned along with the rest of the country. Reading it now, after the genre has been taken to new heights by the likes of Tom Wolfe (The Right Stuff) and others, it didn't pack quite the punch I expected. But it still packs a punch, no question about it. It still has the power to make you sick to your stomach as he takes you through the last hours of the Clutter family. There are moments of wonderful writing, as wonderful as writing can be about such disturbing events."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I absolutely loved this novel. Chilling and suspenseful. I disagree with one of the above comments, Capote was right in choosing sides. His rhetorical purpose was to empahasize the savagery and cruelty of capital punishment itself. Maybe Perry (and certainly not) Dick do not deserve our sympathy, but their fate certainly deserves a second glance. I fully recommend this novel and plan to read it many more times."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Like countless others I was inspired to read \\"In Cold Blood\\" after watching the Oscar-nominated film, \\"Capote.\\" For some this was a return to a book previously enjoyed perhaps over 30 years ago. For others such as myself this was a \\"why hadn't I gotten around to reading this before?\\" experience. Why indeed.What a truly powerful story wonderfully told by Truman Capote who, sadly, never duplicated the efforts that produced this book.\\"In Cold Blood\\" is ostensibly the story the story of the brutal slaying of four members of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas in November 1959 and the two men who killed them. But it is infinitely more than that. This is the story of how people react to circumstances (the powerful winds of chance), those many arbitrary events that may impact a life for a second or day or forever and the types of people they become. It is about reactions and perceptions. It is about people in the great, vast Middle America, some the proverbial salt of the earth and others who poison that same earth.Capote studied the victims. Painting intricate and, in my mind, lovingly detailed portraits of fine ordinary folks whose lives were cut short in violent fashion. Capote studied the people of the small community in which the Clutters lived. Neighbors, friends, acquaintances and investigators of the crime. We see how they were and how they responded to the tragic event.Captor studied (he had incredible access to them) the perpetrators. Perry Smith and Dick Hickcock. How do young boys grow up to be criminals, particularly bright lads like these, and how do they progress to murder.It is a sober topic but in the hands of a masterful writer such as Capote it is somehow not a depressing one. Instead it reveals layer upon layer about people. No one is a stereotype in Capote's able hands. Everyone has a back story.Capote's genius as a journalist is that he has not perceptible point of view. He allows the circumstances and the participants speak for themselves. In fact he quotes the leading figures extensively, often using entire letters written by or two one. His choices are wise ones as the quotations never cause the narrative to slow. \\"In Cold Blood\\" is a well-paced book that holds the readers interest throughout.The tragic murder of the Cutter family and the men who committed the crime are at the center of the book by mostly as access to a far wider and more important story about human beings.Do not hesitate to read this book if you never had. If you've not seen \\"Capote\\" so so. And see the film version of this book, released shortly after Capote's work."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The murders themselves are so incomprehensible, so vicious, so capricious, that we recoil in horror. I averted my eyes when this book was published forty years ago and only recently found the strength to read it. Truman Capote brings the events surrounding those murders on a farm in western Kansas in 1959 back to life with a combination of factual synopsis, interpretive analysis, and heartlander dialog. But, above all else, what Capote gives us with this book is masterful writing. \\"When Mrs. Johnson bolted the door, she had in mind the dead as well as the living.\\" \\"He and Dick were running a race without a finish line.\\" Capote also uses some very creative techniques to capture thematic and character perspective without explicit narrative or dialog. For instance there is the \\"Solemn Moment,\\" the quiet reflection on mortality as a person contemplates a life insurance policy or a will. This technique is employed, in the early pages, as a retrospective on the victim's life, as he himself sees it. In the closing pages, one of the murderers sees a little of himself in the stray cats clawing dead birds off the grilles of cars. I do wonder, however, how Capote could have done such extensive research without knowing that \\"12 gauge shotgun\\" doesn't have a decimal point in front of the \\"12,\\" a mistake he makes consistently throughout the book. This is a remarkable non-fiction crime thriller, and it has a justified wide appeal, even among the squeamish.If you prefer to maintain the suspense to the end of the story, do not read the back cover of the Vintage paperback. The publisher unconscionably gives the ending away."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote reputedly invented the idea of the non-fiction novel with this book. It reads like a novel, yet every event it describes actually occurred as the author portrays it. Certainly, Capote exercised a degree of literary license regarding certain details, for example the exact wording used in various conversations that were recalled from the memories of the various characters, but the book is still widely regarded as non-fiction.The story itself was interesting enough to keep my interest. But, the story itself was not so exceptional that it alone makes this a great book. After all, similar (and often more) interesting criminal events happen all the time. What makes this book such a time-tested masterpiece is Capote's exceptional journalistic and literary talents. His ability to put the reader at the crime scene and in the shoes of the criminals and those trying to solve the crime is unparalleled.The excellent writing found in this book combined with its factualness make this one of the most memorable books I have ever read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"As a teenager, I read a lot of Stephen King novels that, at the time, I considered quite scary.Capote's telling of this event in criminal history makes all of King's books seem like \\"My Little Princess\\". Really.This book is so well-written that it draws you into the story of these mass murderers and their victims. Here's a list of words to describe this \\"novel\\": disturbing, frightening, strangely appealing, and maddening.Capote does not rant and rave about the death penalty here. One of the reasons that I had avoided this book for so long was due to the many critics who hijack the book to fit their own views on capital punishment. Instead, Capote presents a relatively objective view on it.You will lock your doors at night after reading this book."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Like many people, I went back to re-read In Cold Blood after seeing the movie Capote. Those who are unfamiliar with the book may be in for a bit of a shock; although it virtually invented the \\"true crime\\" genre, Capote is not lurid or sensationalistic in his storytelling. The subtitle of this book is \\"A TRUE ACCOUNT OF MULTIPLE MURDER AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.\\" It is the consequences that Capote is most interested in - for the good guys and the bad guys.The book opens with the last day in the life of the Clutter family. These scenes are interspersed with scenes of two seemingly unrelated characters: Perry Smith and Dick Hickock. The next day, the Clutters are discovered dead, and the small village of Holcolmb has to try to deal with the shock that these things do happen.Capote calls this the \\"first non-fiction novel.\\" By that he means that there is a full-blown story with a complete cast of characters. The one false thing about the book is that Capote completely removes himself from the action, even though we now know that he was a key player. When we are privileged to the thoughts of the characters, we know that these are from interviews with Capote. In actuality, Capote does make a personal appearance in the book; towards the end, Hickock is described as speaking to \\"a journalist,\\" but this is obviously the author himself.The book does show the killers in the most sympathetic light possible - especially Perry Smith, whom Capote loved. Perry had an awful childhood. Yet, even though they deserve our sympathy, it is difficult to feel overly sorry for them. Like most bad people, Smith, Hickock, and the other murderers in the book don't feel the least bit sorry for what they've done; they do however, feel very sorry that they are being punished for it - to them, that is not fair."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Written as an experiment in blending fiction, non-fiction, and journalism, Truman Capote succeeds in creating a new genre, known now as creative non-fiction, with In Cold Blood. His narrative horrifies, yet compels the reader to experience the 1959 real-life, savage murder of four members of the Clutter family by Perry Smith and Dick Hickock in the rural Kansas community of Holcomb. The reader comes to know the Clutter family and the murderers - particularly Perry Smith - until he or she \\"know[s] [them] better than they ever knew themselves.\\" Capote masterfully transports the reader to the scene of the crime and the murderers through a literary structure not unlike toggling between computer programs via Windows in cyberspace today.However, In Cold Blood is Capote's perspective of the tragedy visited upon the picture-perfect American family; through Capote, the American Dream seems not quite so idyllic, not quite so safe, not quite so innocent as it did before being shattered by the arrival of Smith and Hickock. While each death is described in gruesome enough detail, Capote doesn't dwell on the Clutter family murders; instead, the narrative refocuses on the murderers. Who were these guys? How could they have so viciously slaughtered almost an entire family for a few bucks and a grey plastic radio?Through Capote, the reader comes to know what makes the murderers tick-tick-tick and then go off like a time bomb. The reader MIGHT come to empathize with them - especially with Smith, who was irreversibly damaged from years and years of physical and psychological abuse as a child. The reader MIGHT even come to question imposition of the death penalty, which is what Capote implicitly intends all along.What makes this true crime narrative different than most - better than most - is the artist behind its creation. It is masterfully constructed of two parallel but incompatible worlds: one the American Dream and the other the American Nightmare."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"My wife is often exasperated by my habit of reading a book over and over again. Why do it, she asks, you know how it's going to turn out. Well, that's true in a way; especially with something like \\"In Cold Blood\\". Since it's based on a true story, you know the Clutters will die, you know the murderers will be captured and executed. What's the big deal?But it's not that simple for me. I know every note of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", yet it still gives me goose bumps. I know that fried chicken is crispy outside and juicy inside, but I order that more than anything else. I love picking up my Jack London stories in mid-winter. There's nothing like reading that stuff while some norther whoops and screams outside.Hence, my affection for \\"In Cold Blood\\". I read it the first time when I was around 23 and took up reading as a pastime again as my flaming youth started to cool. I'm 44 and I think I've read that book maybe 15 times now. And just writing about it is making me want to read it again. In fact, I will probably have to buy a fresh copy because the binding on my paperback edition is starting to fail and pages are becoming loose.Most true crime stories these days are drenched in such lurid detail the viscera and entrails practically dangle off the page. Torture, dismemberment, infanticide; make the story as horrific as possible to sell the books. These are the bastard children of Capote's novel, with as much emotion as an autopsy report. They are more akin to the \\"B\\" slasher feature at the drive-in.But the murder here, while a central part of the story (without it, there would BE no story), is not the whole story. This is a very human drama, more in common with Steinbeck than Ed Gein. The killers are ruthless, to be sure - there's no doubt who's wearing the white hats and the black hats. But Capote drew all the characters as real people and not faceless archetypes. We've all known a family like the Clutters. Maybe we've passed under the malevolent eye of someone who shares something in common with Perry or Dick. And if something evil came our way, we all would want someone like Alvin Dewey to tirelessly pursue justice in our name.And, like a great song or a good meal, Capote's prose paints a vivid picture that can be read again and again over time. The perspective of time in itself has given the novel a different insight. A crime that moved a jaded New York writer into immersing himself into a spartan, midwestern existence now seems almost quaint and old fashioned compared to the horrors that greet us each morning on the news."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood is one of the finest examples of a book that is serving to strengthen and legitimatize the expanding genre known as True Crime Narrative. In this book,Capote not only incorporates the research and accuracy that those who read True Crime Narratives tend to seek, but he also brilliantly weaves into his writing the literary techniques of a great fiction writer. I am currently in a class that is studying this genre. Most of my fellow classmates also enjoyed Capote's work and writing technique, but the one thing that many of them criticized is that Capote does not seem to write from an objective viewpoint throughout his book. They complained that Capote blatanly favored and took pity on Dick and Perry, forgetting about the tragic death of the Clutter family. To be honest, this aspect of the book actually served to make me like the book even more. First of all, the reader is clearly presented with the brutality of the tragedy to the victims and the hurt that was done to the town. However, it is a fact that Capote saved the gorier details of the murder until later in the book when the reader has had a chance to know the killers as humans and victims themselves. It could be argued here that Capote is manipulating his facts in order to influence the reader's judgment of the crime they would see and the men who perpetrated it. Capote is not trying to favor Dick and Perry, per se, but he is making an effort to simply show them as human beings. Capote forces us to show compassion for the victim as well as the criminals."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote broke literary ground with this &quot;true fiction&quot; about an actual murder of a Kansas family. Despite the fact that one knows the family is going to be murdered, and that the killers will eventually be caught, one is still wrapped in suspense due to Capote's skillful construction of the story - using certain techniques, he generates suspense and a certain mood, thus making the book read like a first rate crime novel.In this book, Capote explores the other side of the American dream. The Clutters, who seem to embody the American dream; their lives come to a murderous end in the hands of Dick and Perry, for reasons that seemed to come on the wings of chance - the Clutters could have been any other ideal American family.Through his skill, Capote shows the veneer that is the life of the Clutters, who seemed to be living the dream. The compelling notion that is revealed, though, is that both Dick and Perry are trying to live the American dream. But their version of it takes them on a much different, darker course.Capote artfully crafts a suspenseful novel, which is in of itself a real page-turner, but manages to slip in some insightful observations on the psychology of criminals, and a dark reflection of how the American dream can have a twisted, dark aspect to it.This is one of the few books I've read in recent times that kept me wanting to get back to it everytime I set it down. Read it, be entertained, be enlightened."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I read this book expecting it to be dry and scientific. Nothing could be further from the truth. It was exciting, engrossing, and engaging.The great mystery of this book is not WHO killed the Clutter family, but WHY were they killed? Capote weaves an intricate mystery that begs to be solved. Rather than waiting to reveal the killers, they are half of the narrative- we actually get to experience their flight as it is taking place rather than having it recounted in transcript form at the end of the book.Yet another great irony in the book is Capote's ability to create empathy for the killers. In the early stages the reader demands justice for the innocent victims. By the end of the book, I found myself actually wishing the best for the killers.How is it that I have this depth of emotion for two cold-blooded killers? It's all in the presentation and Capote did a fantastic job. This master writer has the ability to manipulate his readers in whichever direction he wishes to take them. It's a rare gift. Capote shows how truly gifted he was.I can't recommend this book highly enough- It should be required reading for everyone."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"On November 15, 1959, in Holcomb, Kansas, the four members of the Clutter family were dragged from their beds in the early hours of the morning and tied up. All four were shot in the head with a shotgun at close range. None survived. The killers left few clues, and there was no apparent motive for the slayings.On assignment from the New Yorker, author Truman Capote, along with his assistant Nell Harper Lee, traveled to Holcomb in late 1959 to investigate the killings for an article. The article was completed, but still Capote remained in Holcomb. He conducted interviews with every person in town; he poured over police records and statements. Once the killers, drifters Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, were caught and sentenced, he even interviewed them on Death Row. The Clutter killings became an obsession for him; and that obsession turned into a book that would become a literary milestone, that would singlehandedly introduce a new genre to the literary world: the nonfiction novel. He called his piece of creative nonfiction IN COLD BLOOD, and it so consumed him that it would be the last thing he'd ever write.I didn't expect this book to move me so deeply. In most true crime books that are written today (at least in my experience), the evidence is presented straightforwardly, unemotionally; the facts are dry and textbook-like. Such is not the case with IN COLD BLOOD. Capote's prose is mesmerizing. His descriptions of Holcomb and its inhabitants are vivid and lively. His research is impeccable, presented flawlessly, lushly, sweeping the reader away on waves of vibrant language.And his imagery is heartbreaking: Nancy Clutter teaching a neighbor to make a cherry pie, Dick Hickock deliberately hitting a dog on the highway, the Clutters' old mare standing alone in an overgrown pasture. With startling empathy, Capote transports his readers to the Holcomb, Kansas, of late 1959: We feel the tension and sorrow clouding the town; we watch as the police nearly crumble under the weight of their investigation; we're with Dick and Perry as they flee across the United States to Mexico, leaving a trail of bounced checks in their wake, and we're with them in their cells on Death Row. We're right there the whole time, from the day before the Clutters are killed to the day after their murderers are executed. And Capote is unflinching; he keeps us there, even when the honesty of his prose makes us uncomfortable, even when we can't imagine reading on but somehow can't seem to stop.And this is the genius of IN COLD BLOOD: It is a violent, unflinching account, sorrowful beyond belief (and made even more so because it's true); but, in the hands of a master like Capote, it's really hard to stop reading about this unfortunate family and their motiveless, pathetic murderers. This book made me sad, it made me shiver; but I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The magnificence of &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; doesn't lie in the subject matter but in its treatment. There are--unfortunately--more depraved criminals and more elaborate police investigations detailed in a great many &quot;true crime&quot; accounts. But I doubt that any of them is as well written as &quot;In Cold Blood.&quot;I haul my copy out every 2-3 years just to remind myself how wonderful the rhythms and nuances of the American language can be at the hands of a master. I am totally drawn into the lives of the prosperous and completely unsuspecting Clutter family of western Kansas and the two drifters, Perry and Dick, who by themselves didn't amount to much but together proved lethal that fall night in 1959.A trivia note: Capote's research assistant on this book was Nell Harper) Lee, who shortly after would become famous as the author of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird.&quot;I'd recommend Gerald Clarke's excellent biography &quot;Capote&quot; to learn about this one-of-a-kind book, its creation, reception, and how it affected the author's life."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I received Truman Capote's In Cold Blood as a gift, and this book is a true gem in the true crime genre.Herb Clutter was a wealthy rancher and prominent citizen of Holcomb, Kansas. In 1959, Clutter, his wife, and his two teenaged children were brutally murdered in their home. The killers are two paroled criminals, Dick Hickock and Perry Smith, and they think that they have executed the perfect crime. Their involvement is no surprise as Capote introduces them at the beginning of the book. Capote chronicles the search for the killers by the Kansas Bureau of Investigation (the KBI).Capote writes In Cold Blood in a folksy, easy going style. He goes from one character to another, seamlessly switching from the third person to the first, and then back again. His down-home descriptions mirror Kansas in a simpler time. Capote writes about the jury \\"Not everyone was attentive; one juror, as though poisoned by the numerous spring-fever yawns weighing in the air, sat with drugged eyes and jaws so utterly ajar bees could have buzzed in and out.\\" Capote also shows surprising empathy for the murderers, and Hickock and Smith accumulate a few fans.Although In Cold Blood is 41 years old, reading it now couldn't be more timely. First, the film, Capote, was recently released. In Cold Blood became his most successful book. Also, Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee by Charles J. Shields was just published. Lee and Capote were neighbors, friends and collaborators. Lee did much of the research for In Cold Blood, and Capote rewarded her by dedicating this book to her (along with Jack Dunphy). I'm sorry it took so long for me to read this classic and I now have to follow up In Cold Blood with these two works."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I have meant to read this book for some time. I'm a little embarrassed to admit that seeing the Capote film is what finally induced me to read it, but I suppose that must be true. I had seen the film the previous weekend, bought this book during the following week, and just this past weekend, devoured it in all of two days.Capote's masterpiece tells the story of the senseless, brutal killing of a rural Kansas family in 1959. It is beautifully written from start to finish -- in an understated way. If you come into this experience, as I did, conscious of the narcissism of the author, you might be surprised at the writing style. It is very humble, no Joycean or Nabokovian literary showing off. The story is paramount; the author does an amazing job of staying invisible, and respecting that story.Respect is the feeling that is conveyed throughout the book. The telling is very respectful of the Clutter family; you learn of what remarkable people they were, even as they met their ends. The author is also fundamentally respectful of the people of the town, and of the local law enforcement. The book is not without its implied questioning of the judicial process, but again, I greatly appreciated the empathy and respect that pervaded the book.This fundamental respect for human dignity even, in a more disturbing way, pervades even the discussion of the lives of the killers. The author candidly relates the biographies of these two men. On one level, this conveys an understanding of how they came to be what they were, but on a deeper level, it's all still a mystery. Left unanswered, still, is what really causes a man to be a killer. There is a great sense of tragedy throughout the relating of their formative lives -- perhaps not a respect for who they eventually were, but a respect for who they *could* have been.Extremely unsettling is the sheer randomness of it all. The chain of events that causes the Clutter family to be killed is so random, so out-of-the-blue. Capote conveys how thin is the line between everything all seeming well and orderly in the world, and disaster striking out of nowhere.Also coming through very clearly in this book is a cultural moment in time. You read it, feeling that this rural Kansas society is a vanished world. It's a stoic, God-fearing community, but the urban Capote betrays little condescension toward it. Quite the opposite; he seems duly impressed that the only reaction from the crowd to the killers' transference back to the town is one of silence -- no attempted violence, no shouted insults. The restraint and dignity of the townspeople amid this tragedy seems foreign to modern eyes. I found myself liking these people very much, despite my own preference for urban living.But nothing undoes the basic feeling of tragedy that pervades the book. The author sifts through an incredible amount of detail about the crime; information that could only have been gleaned with a tremendous amount of cooperation from the killers themselves. There are details here that we could never have known about unless both killers had related them in their own separate interviews: details both of the crime itself, and of their activities, and further crimes and near-crimes, when on the lam.The final portrait is of two worlds colliding -- a dysfunctional, violent world amid the undercurrents of society, rising up to strike the normal, orderly world of the Clutter family. It leaves the reader feeling as though nothing can be truly safe in our world, as long as the mysteries behind this story remain unresolved."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"A resurgence of interest in the life and work of an author occurs rather frequently. It happened with F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. Such is the case today with Truman Capote, probably due in large part to the acclaimed film \\"Capote\\" with an award-winning performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman.There is another fine performance in store for us with the audio edition of what many consider to be Capote's masterpiece, In Cold Blood, read by Scott Brick. A winner of AudioFile's coveted Golden Voice Award as well as several Earphone Awards, Brick is a veteran of film, television and radio work who seems to read with an intuitive sense of the author's intention. It has been said of him that \\"He lets the author's words do the work.\\" Wisely so, especially in the case of this novel which, upon publication in 1966, Life Magazine called \\"A masterpiece.....a spellbinding work.\\"As many know, this is the book in which Capote detailed the 1959 murders of a wealthy farm family in Holcomb, Kansas. It was, as Capote described it a \\"non-fiction novel\\" because the events were true yet he described them in literary form. It was a crime that shocked the nation, the slaying of Herb Clutter, his wife, and teenage son and daughter. There was no apparent reason for the carnage that took place in their home.When Capote read of the murders in the New York Times, he and his friend Harper Lee (To Kill A Mockingbird) went to Kansas where they interviewed the citizens of Holcomb and investigators. He would later have access to the two men apprehended for the killings. Capote spent years writing his novel, which is by turns a fascinating psychological study of two sociopathic murderers and an unforgettable portrait of a crime and its aftermath.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote's 'In Cold Blood' is enjoying a resurgence of popularity thanks to the Oscar-winning film depicting the author's life and work during the writing of this phenomenal piece. At one point in the film, the character Capote makes the statement that when he thinks about how good this book will be, he can hardly breathe. Perhaps it is because it is part of our history now, I don't consider the book to be that good, but it was a work fairly close to groundbreaking in its impact - it was a new genre, the narrative telling of a non-fiction event as if it were a fictional novel.The narrative centres upon the murder of a Kansas family by two men, Perry Smith and Dick Hicock, who are in many ways far from typical killers, much less cold blooded killers. The family, the Clutters of Holcombe, Kansas, are far from typical victims, nor is this the kind of place such a murder would be expected. Capote does a remarkable job at an even-handed analysis and narrative treatment of all the characters, from the family itself to the townspeople and investigators, as well as the murderers themselves. Perhaps it is because he found an area of identification?This is a psychological thriller of a sort - at least it would be, were it not a true life tale. Getting into the minds of the criminals and the investigators was no easy task for Capote, but what comes forth on the page is very crisp and insightful reporting, without the kinds of embellishments one might expect from a figure such as Capote when dealing with middle-America folk.The question of why for the killing is still never fully resolved, despite Capote's attempt to set out all the story and psychological detail. Perhaps this is as strange as the interest Capote took in the subject in the first place, as well as the effect it had on him, and those around him, ultimately - while Capote himself never again finished a major project after this, that is also true of his assistant, Nell Harper Lee, whose book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' (done about the same time as 'In Cold Blood') was also her last major writing.A worthwhile book in many ways."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book hasn't really dated since it was written. With the exception of a few references to the years, it could be set in a present-day world. Capote takes us on a through the lives of the Clutter family before they were brutally murdered one Saturday night. He intertwines the lives of their killers and the men who found them and the result is a gripping, nail-biting tale of a brutal crime and the people involved. From time to time you have to remind yourself of the fact that all this really happened...The audio presentation of \\"In Cold Blood\\" is particularly memorable as the narrator, Scott Brick, is one of the best readers I have ever heard. He brings Capote's book to life, complete with voices and accents. Coupled with excellent writing, Brick keeps us tense and excited throughout the book. I spent many evenings not wanting to get out of my car at home as I didn't want the book to end.If you're new to audio books, this is an excellent one to start with."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Mr. Capote did us a great service in probing every facet of the tragic murder of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas. But for his careful research and lucid prose, the courage of the Clutters, and the savagery of their murder, made all the more tragic by the quality of the family's character, might well have gone unrecognized. Although our era scarcely needs another shocking crime about which to read, In Cold Blood is worth re-visiting. At one level, Capote's book reminds us just how much has changed in a relatively short span of time. It is almost impossible in today's world to imagine reporters waiting anxiously in Holcomb for the return by car of the accused killers; now, even cities of modest size would have dispatched any number of helicopters to hover over the vehicles in transit and the footage would be delivered to our living rooms, and we would find ourselves addicted to the sound of the copters and the chatter of reporters. At another level, the book shows how little has changed. The murder of the Clutters is a modern story, a sad precursor to our own violent times. Capote knew that Holcomb, Kansas was a tale of innocence lost after the passing of the Clutter family. Now we know it was not just Holcomb's loss."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I am almost embarrassed to admit that I couldn't put this book down. Embarrassed because in essence it is a hard core voyeuristic experience. You will in fact end up attending a movie awash in unabashed bathos and violence...and it will be very hard to avert your eyes. While Capote had to be aware of this effect...I dare anyone to get the picture of Nancy Clutter out of their mind... he ends up having bigger fish to fry. The psychological constructs of the killers are remarkably fresh for a book written in the mid-sixties. The issues of the pernicious effects of child abuse (one of the killers, Perry Smith was abused) were not to be thrust into the public's consciousness for another 20 years, yet Capote has a very modern feeling for the features of the abused persona. Equally prescient was Capote's portrait of major depression as suffered by the soon-to-be-murdered Mrs. Clutter. The picture is scarily accurate for a third person account of a disease that was still thought to a purely psychological problem back in those days. It is SO accurate one has to wonder if Capote was in fact recounting symptoms he in fact had felt at one time or another ...anywhichway, still an eye-opener for something written in the sixties. I's also hard to leave this book without having to confront some very basic questions regardng good, evil and the purpose-of-life. If you haven't read this book, do..it is the book least likely to be put down during a long plane trip."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"So many books to read and so little time to do so means that I won't usually read a book for a second time unless I feel the book has something special to offer that draws me back to it. Recently re-read this disturbing factional story of unspeakable horror after some thirty-odd years, revisiting the pain of Holcomb, the scene of the tragic, senseless snuffing out of the Clutters. Controversial on its publication due to its blending of fact and fiction, a hybrid composite that had not been done before, Capote's \\"In Cold Blood\\" grippingly reconstructs, in all their brutal detail, the 1959 grisly, cold-blooded murders of the Clutter family on their farm in the plains of western Kansas when four shotgun blasts changed the town of Holcomb forever. This fictionalising of real events, complete with imagined dialogue between real-life characters, broke new ground and established Capote as the inventor of True Crime \\"non-fiction novels\\".Capote reconstructs the lead-up to the gruesome murders and the aftermath. In the lead-up, Capote cross-cuts intermittently between descriptions of the routine domestic life of the Clutters in their small farming community near Holcomb and the transient lives of the drifters Smith and Hickok - what's chilling is their humaness in the picture Capote draws - as they drift cross-country towards Holcomb. The aftermath comprehensively covers the search for and apprehension of the killers and their subsequent trial and incarceration on death row.Capote's case-study is concerned not just with the who of the crime but the why, probing into every facet of the lives of the killers, the background influences that shaped them, taking us into their minds to give us the opportunity to get to know them, exploring the psyche of the criminal mind to discover the psychological motivation that can turn men into monsters. A forerunner of classic true-crime titles such as \\"Fatal Vision\\" by Joe McGinnes, \\"Daddy's Girl\\" by Clifford Irving and \\"Blood and Money\\" by Thomas Thomson, \\"In Cold Blood\\" is itself, an American classic and one of the best American books of the 20th Century ."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This chilling nonfiction novel about a brutal 1959 killing in Holcomb, Kansas makes powerful reading. Author Truman Capote (1924-1984) writes superbly as he recreates the events of this horrid crime, and lets us peek into the minds of the perpetrators.Dick Hickock and Perry Smith were losers who took it on faith from a fellow inmate that a certain farm family in Western Kansas had a cash-filled safe in their house. There was no such safe, and all these punks got for their terrible deed was $40. The author examines the family background of the two killers, their friendship, and their crime. We also learn about their capture, trial, and life on Kansas' death row. Ever mindful of the victims, Capote also lets us know the four members of the Clutter family who tragically lost their lives.Capote apparently hoped to make a powerful statement against the death penalty, but his subjects are hardly the type to elicit sympathy. Still, this is a superbly moving (and at times disturbing) nonfiction novel."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Capote's book is as impressive a work as I have ever read and the writing is as crisp as any sentences ever composed. In Cold Blood probes deeply into the minds of criminals and provides the reader with an understanding of Kansas in its time, place, economy, culture and society. Everyone should read this book and everyone should use it to wonder about the death penalty and whether it serves as a deterrent for murder.Truman Capote was the inventor of the genre of reporting that is now practiced by Dominick Dunne and other true crime scribes. Dunne is a talented observer and a pompous writer. Capote had twice the talent of observation of Dunne and hundred times the writing ability. Anyone who reads this book will understand why 24 hours news coverage never comes anywhere close to plumbing the deaths of crimes, tragedies and mysteries, because time and incredible attention to detail is lacking in their world. Any writer comparable to Truman Capote is far from the world of true crime, which is a shame, and the only way to fully appreciate this work is read it and reflect on all its meditations on American society in Kansas in a small town."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In the story \\"In Cold Blood\\" by Truman Capote, I found that this man's version of the story was quite interesting to me. He was very descriptive in detail of all the characters of the book by being very meticulous in his writing style. He also performed such extensive research of Holcomb by describing every little detail about the town. This book was unique because of how Truman would talk about Perry Smith and Dick Hickock in one paragraph and then the next paragraph he would switch over to the Clutter family and what they were doing. He had so much information about the Clutters that he even described how the daughter Nancy was helping a little girl learn to bake a pie. By explaining in detail of what happened the day of the murder made this book so interesting that I could not put it down until I read the whole thing. When a writer explains all of the details in this way, someone who reads this book can understand what must have happened and how surprised the town was to have this happen to such a nice family in the community. I was very impressed with how Truman was so particular in his details of the murder itself. Truman identified every piece of the murder and by doing this, I felt like I got to know every character in the book. I know that with forensics today some murders do not take as long to solve, but back in 1959 murders were very rare. This murder case was so intriguing because the police did not have all of the technology of today to help solve this murder. The murder was solved with simple police tactics and this is partially what made the book so interesting for me to read. I would recommend that anyone who likes to read books of this nature, \\"Cold Blood\\" would be of interest to them."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This is the mother of all true crime books. Throw away everything you know about Capote when you pick this book up- it's not like any of the other books and stories he is known for. This is the gut-wrenching true story of mrder in America's heartland, told to us by an almost invisible narrator, who passes no judgement. Capote doesn't hang anyone: he simply reports, and the result is brilliant. Easily one of the greatest books of the 20th century."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"TC's In Cold Blood is probably not a good book if you are a convict, an ex-con or someone with a loved one in the slammer. These types of people probably have heard many similar tales of the criminal mind and what it can achieve.But if are a model citizen with no experience in incarceration, In Cold Blood offers in my opinion an amazing insight into the world of crime and its consequences.Reading the book is almost as good as meeting the real characters, due to TC incredible capacity to bring the story to life. It's as almost as if TC was tagging along with the killers on their murderous rampage. Indeed, one must question the sanity of TC after reading the book - can a writer get into the shoes of such twisted and sick characters without being twisted and sick themselves. Food for thought that in no way whatsoever subtracts from TC's amazing accomplishment in putting this novel together."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I was reading through some of these reviews.One of them shocked me he gave it one star cause he thought that the documentary was about the author trying to make people feel pity for the killers.That is what i don't understand.

One of the set texts was Capote's &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;. I had always been a staunch believer in capital punishment but having read this book my views were somewhat changed. However, that is not to say that Capote's account is biased in any way. Rather, just as the reader is beginning to feel a certain amount of sympathy for the murderers, having learned about their childhoods, in particular, Perry Smith's violent, abusive upbringing, Capote throws in a poignant memory of the murdered family, just to keep one on the level. I felt gutted when I'd finished this book. It is certainly one of the most compelling reads of all time without being gratuitously violent or exaggerated."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote was so disturbed by this book that he was never able to complete another work. This is symptomatic of the intensity of \\"In Cold Blood\\". In completing this \\"nonfiction novel\\", Capote helped create the genre of true crime. He set the standard of the genre so high, it is virtually unattainable.The greatest facet of this book is not the story itself as much as it is the presentation of the story. There are far more enticing stories of crime in American history. However, Capote takes this story of execution style murders in Holcomb, Kansas and tells the tale in the poetic style similar to his works of fiction. While it is slow moving at times, Capote crafts the perfect word in almost every scenario.The relationship that Capote developed with the killers also gives us tremendous insight. Long before \\"Dead Man Walking\\", this book made a veiled swipe at capitol punishment. While America culture abhors violence, it answers violence with more violence.Being a fan of the true crime genre, I regret not reading this book sooner. I suspect the movie \\"Capote\\" will cause others to discover this book, as it did for me. I hold \\"In Cold Blood\\" in very high regard."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"On November 15, 1959 Perry Smith and Dick Hickock broke into a rural Kansas farmhouse where they bound and gagged the four people they found there: Herb and Bonnie Clutter, and their teenage children Kenyon and Nancy. They took about $40, a small radio and a pair of binoculars. When they left, the Clutters were all dead of shotgun blasts to their heads.In Cold Blood tells the story of the events leading up to the murder and those following it in a straightforward chronological manner. The Clutters were highly respected members of the small town of Holcombe and their deaths came as a big shock. The murderer's thought they left no clues and had committed a perfect crime. The book treats murdered and murderers with a similar respect for their basic humanity. Although a terrible crime was committed the author is able to present all sides of the story.Truman Capote truly immersed himself in the community and in the lives of the criminals to provide as much detail as could be found. This is a classic work that is well crafted and thought provoking. Sadly, it also was the last major work of the author."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Controversial and compelling, this is the story of the murders of 1959, of a kansas farmer, his wife and both there children.

Painstakingly researched over a five year period, and poignantly described like a fictional narrative, Capote tells the horrifying true story of the 1959 Clutter Murders; from what each family member did on their last day alive; to a retracing of what the two murderers did and where they went before and after the murder; to the exhaustive investigation undertaken by Detective Alvin Dewey and the KBI in finding the killers; to the big moment when both killers hang for their crime. More importantly, Capote takes us into the thoughts and lives of the two killers;especially Perry Smith. Yes, it is Perry who pulls the trigger, but after reading this novel, you feel great pity for this tragic character; even more so than the Clutters themselves.

The movie Capote, with Phillip Seymour Hoffman (he won an Oscar for the role), is based on Truman Capote's life and his experience writing this book.

Overly long at times, as Capote spared very little detail, In Cold Blood is, nonetheless, the definition of a true-crime novel."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Dateline 1959, Holcomb, Kansas: Herb Clutter, a wealthy, well-respected God-fearing Methodist farmer, his wife and two children are brutally murdered in what modern police parlance would term a home invasion. The Clutters, dispatched without any apparent motive, made particularly poignant victims. Mr Clutter, a hard-working, successful farmer, allowed no drinking on his farm. Generous to a fault and yet prudent with his money to an extreme, he paid for everything by cheque. His attractive daughter, Nancy, a lovely young woman well-behaved, obedient and chaste to an extent that would baffle the modern teenage generation, loved to bake and regularly attended 4-H meetings. The son, Kenyon, also a good homebody who respected his father's word as law, loved to putter in their home workshop. The only cloud on their family horizon was Mrs Bonnie Clutter prone to debilitating fits of anxiety and depression.IN COLD BLOOD, arguably the ground-breaking first book in the true crime genre that might be called \\"novelized\\" non-fiction, tells the story of the family, their murder, the murderers, the investigation that led to their capture, the trial and ultimate execution by hanging. Truman Capote's extensive investigation allowed him to reach into the very minds of the murderers and to re-write a story that allows readers to witness how the events leading up to the murder and the actual murder might have taken place in real time BUT from the point of view of the killers themselves, Richard \\"Dick\\" Hickock and Perry Edward Smith.That the killers were twisted sociopaths is apparent throughout the book. Witness the banal, bleakly noir but paradoxical and utterly shocking statement that Smith made regarding Herb Clutter's murder to Capote during one of their interviews, \\"I didn't want to harm the man. I thought he was a very nice gentleman. Soft spoken. I thought so right up to the moment I cut his throat.\\"IN COLD BLOOD is an extraordinary compelling work, seminal and pioneering in its nature, that plumbs the depths of a motiveless multiple murder and brings the reaction of the community and a shocked nation to life. Small wonder that there is controversy to this day about the effect that writing this novel might have had on Truman Capote himself. There is little doubt that the effort left him a very changed man.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The true story of the truly horrific and pointless murder of the Clutter family by Perry Smith and Dick Hickock at Holcomb Kansas in 1959. Capote explores every aspect and perspective of the crime; the victims, their community, the perpetrators,the investigation,trial and justice as stated under the law.This really is the fabled unput-downable page turner! It is so much more than the telling of a crime;it explores the affect such an act has on a tight knit community;the rumours and fantastic speculations (you begin to see how conspiracy theories develop!)and Capote raises controversial questions; how far is responsibility diminished by mental illness? The damage done by a poor childhood. Is the death penalty actually a deterent or state sponsored murder in the interest of revenge?Capote questions the whole shambles in the legal world that turns the death penalty into a kind of lottery where any sense or justice is sidelined.This outraged many sections of society who just saw the brutality of the murders, but they forget Capote also says a society without laws to civilize it denies what man is. Without laws to pose maximum penalties on the likes of Hickock and Smith.what cruelty cannot be justified?The debate still rages! This is a book that will never stop being in print,read and discussed. A true-in every sense of the over used term-classic."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This is the story of two drifters who murdered a prominent Kansas farmer and his family in 1959.But this story is about much more. It's famous (many others have written about it), and it started the so-called non-fiction true crime drama.So what more can I add?This is one of the books that I have in my permanent collection and that I take out every six months, not for the subject matter necessarily, but to remind me how beautiful the English language can be in the hands of a master.There are sentences you and I couldn't repeat.

Almost random in their occurrence, the murders are perpetrated by an odd pair of ex-cons out to rob what they thought was a rich man living on a vast ranch in the midst of the rolling, lonely wheat fields of Kansas.What distinguishes this account from all other such works is its writing and its plethora of factual information. The author and his assistant, Harper Lee, worked very hard to record minute details of life in the prarie, the strivings and disappointments of the victims, and the winding, twisted lives of the killers. More than that is the fine writing encountered on every page. Soaring descriptions of wheat plains, sunsets, the lonely wind blowing at night, and the sad events of November 14, 1959 sear the reader with unforgettable impressions.This work also opened up an entire new genre, the nonfiction \\"novel,\\" imitated by the likes of Norman Mailer in \\"The Executioner's Song\\" and Erik Larson in \\"The Devil in the White City,\\" among many others, but not equaled. Capote was a trailblazer and one of America's greatest writers. No one can take his tremendous achievements away from him, no matter what they say about his famous personal failings. His wonderful \\"The Grass Harp\\" and \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" are indisputable classics as well. It's simply sad that Capote was devoured by his own fame."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Disturbing and captivating.

Capote writes so descriptively one becomes engrossed immediately."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I first read \\"In Cold Blood\\" as a college student in 1965. The hype preceding its publication was enormous, and my local bookstore had great towers made up of hardbound copies with the distinctive red-and-tan jacket. The book under the jacket was beautifully made, with red bindings and rich-looking paper. The letters \\"TC\\" adorned the cover in gold. I was hooked before I ever opened it, and it has never let me go. It moved me on many different levels, but as one emerging from the teen years, I was most captivated by its exploration of what happens when diametrically-opposite lifestyles crash into each other. Capote turned me into a firm opponent of the death penalty, a position I still hold. Plus, it was beautiful, enthralling prose, pictures painted with words in the same lush way that Monet painted his gardens. It seemed that In Cold Blood would stand as a classic worthy of shelf space with Moby Dick or The House of the Seven Gables.Perhaps it still does, but things are stirring in Capoteland. The inklings have been there since 1965, of course, but they accelerated with the release of the feature film Capote in 2005. I went to see it both because of the book and because of my appreciation for the excellent acting of Philip Seymour Hoffman. Even before Capote kissed Perry in his cell, it was clear that there was something going on between the two of them. I now think that Capote, a flamboyantly gay man, was in love with the more restrained Perry. That love affected decisions he made about the novel's narrative. For instance, Capote writes of Perry with a tenderness not present in passages about Dick Hickock. Capote spends pages and pages on Perry's highly dysfunctional upbringing, while at the same time praising his artistic sensibilities. He's an artist, this murdering sociopath, even as he mounts the scaffold--there's paint on his hands, along with the blood. Perhaps he could have made a difference.....He made a difference, all right, destroying four highly valuable lives and turning others' lives upside down forever. Even as Capote knows Perry must die, and not just as punishment, his ambivalence about the loss of his beloved is apparent.Capote writes the narrative of the murders from the perspective of the killers, especially Perry. Perry is the hero, keeping Dick from raping Nancy. He cuts Mr. Clutter's throat while in the midst of some dissociative event, not as the conscious act of a killer. The late writer JJ Maloney, himself a killer, argued that Perry and Dick had a homosexual relationship in prison. Though the physical aspect had ceased upon release, the emotional bond was still there. Perry's killing of Nancy, in particular, is an act of spite toward his own beloved, a beloved who was prepared to betray him. What if Nancy was killed first, in front of a horrified Dick? What if Dick was telling the truth when he claimed that \\"Perry Smith killed the Clutters. He killed them all,\\" before he collapsed? What if Mr. Clutter, a strong man, was well into slipping his bonds by the time the two returned to the basement, and Perry cut his throat as another act of anger? What if the two murderers told their stories the way they did in order to distance themselves from the homoerotic elements in their actions? It doesn't matter. What does matter is that, I believe, Capote let his feelings for Perry color his narrative in ways that may prove to have been misleading. Maloney calls In Cold Blood \\"dishonest,\\" and that may be going too far. Remember that it was the late fifties and early sixties, when Americans considered homosexuality \\"the love that dare not speak its name.\\" Capote had to sell the book, after all.The recent efforts by Florida detectives to link Hickock and Smith to the killings of the Walker family in their state just a month after the Clutters may result in some new information--or at least some new speculation. Mrs. Walker was clearly raped, probably before she was murdered. Did Dick get it done this time, or was Perry trying something new? The overall message here is probably that we ought to re-read In Cold Blood through glasses that take Capote's sexuality seriously and let it be a major factor in his relationships with the killers and in his telling of the story. If they did commit yet another four brutal murders, Capote's mushiness about Perry is certainly not justified."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I love scary stories and crime tv type stuff, but this one scared the pants off of me. It's written in a fascinating way and after you get through all of the morbid, true details in the book the backstory is equally as interesting. The fact that this is real and the conversations, motives, etc are what make this such a chilling story."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I must admit that I approached this novel with many a bias and preconceived notion. I was curious about the claims that the author, Truman Capote, had created a new type of book-- the nonfiction novel.Let's use a word nerd alert to get down to the marrow of those two words:nonfiction |n&auml;n&#712;fik sh &#601;n|prose writing that is based on facts, real events, and real people, such as biography or history.-and-novel |&#712;n&auml;v&#601;l|a fictitious prose narrative of book length, typically representing character and action with some degree of realism.How can a novel which is by definition a fictitious tale with realistic leanings be nonfiction? Can one possibly glean enough fact, setting, character descriptions, and plot to flesh out an entire novel worth reading? I suspected not.So how do I feel now that I have read the book? I have several thoughts... here a few.The tone of the novel is journalistic in nature with a sympathetic overtone interwoven towards the victims -- and also the killers. I'll admit that this was off putting for me. The title for the book is a duplicitous moniker. \\"In Cold Blood\\" refers to the way the Clutter family was brutally murdered, but it also reflects the opinion of the author regarding the judicial treatment and sentencing of the murderers Perry Smith and Dick Hickok. When reading a book about a horrific mass murder, one does not expect to cultivate tender feelings for the people holding the guns. And yet, Capote tries his darnedest to incite empathy for the tough, neglected, even abusive past of these two individuals.A greasy, charming, sticky fingered ladies man -- Hickok is always at the ready with a dirty joke and a hot check. He is apparently ashamed of his tendency to rape young adolescent girls, but that doesn't seem to impede his impulse to do it... several times. He is classified as knowing right from wrong, but due to a car crash that could possibly have damaged his brain-- he now only lives on his impulses with no thought for the consequences. His parents are present but poor.Perry Smith has a troubled past to be sure. His parents --former rodeo performers turned cross country impoverished gypsies-- separate after his mother turns to alcohol to assuage her anxiety. After a particularly bad fight, the mother sweeps off with the children. The father does very little to reclaim his children over the years. The mother finally drinks herself to death, but not before turning all of her children over to the state. Perry's sisters and older brother are reprimanded to an orphanage. Perry has a horrific experience at a catholic institution where a nun tortures him for wetting the bed. He later begins to act out his aggression and is sent to some sort of detention center where he is again abused. He becomes ill and hospitalized --only then does his father find him and take him in. (But they have a tumultuous relationship that ends in Perry nearly killing his father and abandoning him for the merchant marines.) Perry's character is the oddest combination of an uneducated intelligent poet type with an unchecked thinly veiled murderous rage. His demeanor is disarming, his crippled physicality mollifying, his internal dialogue is haunting. He truly scares me. A shrouded menace that beguiles it's prey into believing itself nurtured and safe...Capote also gives us some psychiatric jargon to back up his feelings that these two praire-billy slaying thieves were simply overly vilified mentally inept victims themselves. However, this doesn't ring true-- with this reader at least. They had hard lives, physical and emotional trauma, and yet I couldn't find it in my heart to leap on the weep wagon for them after reading the descriptions --personal interview descriptions-- of what they meticulously did to the entire Clutter family. I will not go into those details here, but the level of callus premeditated apathy for human life is appalling.The book is well written and does softly tread the line of novel and fact. I believe there to be several embellishments but none that detract from the horror or heart of the story set before you. I was held captive, suffered, and was sentenced along with the characters in the story. To put it lightly, I was enthralled and would read many a more book written in this style.This book was a heavy hitter, and the actual facts made it that much more serious and engaging. I rate this book a 4 because I haven't stopped thinking about it since I put it down.Please follow my other reviews at ladyofliteraryleisure.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Very descriptive account of basically an all American family that met their demise at the hands of two very disturbed individuals.

No one can escape this book without a large emotional wallop that will leave one's mind reverberating for some time. The book additionally invites questions concerning the limits and boundaries of journalistic integrity. When does the journalist step beyond his role as observer and become part of the story? And...Should the journalist do so and thus change outcomes? Disturbingly provocative in many ways."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I highly recommened the book,\\"In Cold Blood\\". At the same time I rented the movie about Truman Capote, starring Seymor Huffman which prompted me to want to research more. I was not disappointed."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"An excellent piece of investigative journalism. Although called the first \\"non-fiction novel\\" I don't consider it a novel. To do so would suppose that journalism is objective, it is not, and anyway by most accounts Capote mostly got it right. It's gripping journalism, extremely well researched, and very American. The juxtaposition of Capote, a liberal New Yorker, among the conservative mid-westerners should not go unnoticed. It strikes a chord with the American paradoxical character of \\"the new\\" versus \\"stability\\"; change versus safety; the search for frontier versus authenticity; the fear of anarchy versus the fear of authority; liberal versus conservative. On the one side the ultimate in safety, security and authority is represented by the Clutter family - and on the opposite side the killers, younger and free, represent change, \\"the new\\" and anarchy. Capote instinctively tapped into this dialectic and became part of it himself as an upstart homosexual New Yorker in the middle of stable, secure and patriarchal Kansas. This sort of \\"meta\\" author mirroring the story is the real aesthetic and creative achievement that has kept it a classic while later \\"new journalism\\" works, characterized by their use of literary techniques applied to non-fiction, have rarely if ever exceeded Capote's initial genesis."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote arguably invented true crime, and still dominates with this spectacular classic. He took years to finish this book, his last book, and it shows in the brilliant prose. This is among my favorite books of all time. I recommend to everyone."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This is a great read, a great novel, and a great edition. Capote's work, his illuminating approach to life, exemplified by the contrasts of the killers, the victims, and the hunters of the killers, is a great work of art.The book reproduces the original 1965 edition and although the paper is not as heavy, it certainly beats the previous smaller Modern Library edition.When will publishers learn that in order to compete with Brittany Spears, life, death, taxes, and childbirth, they need to give readers beautiful editions with real cloth covers and heavy cream paper, something to treasure. Not some cheap cardboard edition such as, say, my collected Ginsberg, which already is turning brown and edging out of the binding. I'd rather pay another dollar for a $50 book and get something that will stay intact."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I was a child when In Cold Blood was first published but remember the adults in my life talking about this controversial novel. After watching the two recent Truman Capote biopics (Capote and Infamous), I thought I should read it. I was surprised how much this 40+ year old book had to say about the anger, polarization and general lack of civility in today's society. A family is senselessly murdered in a small town in Kansas. Everyone in the town of 6,000 knew this family. After the murderers are apprehended, each minister in this community of 21 churches stood at his pulpit and spokeout AGAINST the capital punishment. Relatives of the slain family wrote a letter published in the local newspaper asking that prosecutors not pursue the death penalty. And when the murderers are returned to Kansas and are walked into the jail for booking, the audience who has gathered for this spectacle stands nearly silent. The town's citizens are relieved that it was strangers who commited this attrocity and they no longer have to eye their neighbors suspiciously. There is little talk of revenge or a sense of closure via the death penalty. What a fascinating view of our society on the cusp of the revolution of the 1960's and 1970's. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Now, I know this book is historically significant as one of the first \\"true crime\\" novels - a founder of the non-fiction novel genre - but that wasn't really important to me. I prefer to read things without historical context and judge how they hold up to modern standards. That said, I enjoyed the book a lot. This novel took an interesting twist from the usual crime story fare: the reader knows up front who was murdered and who did it. The only questions are \\"why\\" (and to some extent \\"what exactly happened\\"). Risky, I think, because it is tough to build suspense when the outcome is certain. But it worked well here for the most part.The beginning was by far the slowest section of the book, with Capote taking his time setting up the scene and describing the family. I know he tried very hard to get us attached to the characters quickly - perhaps a little too hard? Things really started to pick up around Part 2 when Capote set into a detailed profile of the killers. This was interesting stuff! The organization was executed well, and I liked the shifts between character perspectives.The third part blew me away. I won't say much about it, except that I would have cried if I hadn't been on a plane at the time. It was that moving. The last section was mostly just intellectually interesting. The book left quite a bit for me to think on. Unfortunately I don't want to share those thoughts here, because I'd be giving away story elements!In the end, I think, Capote wanted to use his book as a commentary on the death penalty and American violence. For me, it didn't exactly succeed in either of those aspects. But what it did do was to provide a sound, well-researched and interesting psychological profile of two very different killers involved in the same crime. Yes, some parts dragged, and (I felt) the writing was at times flat, but all in all a worthy read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The classic true crime book written by the famed Truman Capote earned its place in history as the first book of its nature - an attempt to combine journalism with storytelling for the purpose of creating a compelling tale. In this sense, the book doesn't disappoint at all. It was well chronicled and sometimes even overly inclusive of the facts, testimonies, and articles published from various accounts surrounding the murder that this book covered.I was greatly interested in the pyschological picture painted of the two men who were guilty of the murder and I was also equally interested in the way the book was organized. From the beginning, the reader not only knows exactly who was to be killed, but also who was to do it.On the other hand, the way the story was told was through what seemed to this reader to be long winded paragraphs portraying things such as the architecture, weather, or setting which didn't seem to add to the story in any way for me (though, in his favor, I must say that it also didn't take away from the story either).Also, while I am someone who is 100 percent against the death penalty, it was somewhat off-putting that the last half of the 4th part seemed to be nothing but propaganda against the death penalty. I did feel that this took away from the author's intent which I understand to be to tell the story, as objectively as possible, presented as factual while still making it compelling. Besides the death penalty propaganda, this was achieved.Since his writing of this book, more true crime stories have followed, some in which this reader even prefers. However, one must take into account while reading this book the risk Capote took while undertaking such a risk in writing and appreciate and respect him as an author for making that risk work."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I got interested in reading \\"In cold blood\\" as I have found it listed among the 100 best crime novels ever written. Capote beginning from a non fictional event (a murder of a prestigious farmer and his whole family in rural Kansas back in the fifties) creates a great suspenseful work with very great character development dissecting (every victim, every perpetrator, the cops, the officers), and in addition, greatly picturing the setting with just simple colorful words.The book is centered around action and mystery (murder, perpetrators on the run and the police tracking them).In final chapters, the author takes his time to balance the action with the introduction of debates about the typical elements of crime (Victims as distinguished members of the local community, perpetrators early destitute life, suitability of the death penalty as punishment, US justice system).Capote writing style is neat, polished, almost faultless, it is a pleasure to experience how he creates the magic that enthralls the reader pulling him along the whole story. Great writer above all."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"\`In Cold Blood' is probably Capote's best known novel and from the word go it makes for engrossing and fascinating reading. This is basically a novel of true events in the fifties and sixties and follows the murder of a Kansas farmer and his family and the subsequent trial of the murderers. It is written with vivid and evocative language and the descriptions quickly bring you deeper into the story and help conjure the images within. You could quite easily forget that this is based on true events as the story telling is so rich and this really does read like a fictional account of the same events. The film \`Capote' is based around his writing of this book and if you like one it is worth you checking out the other. Apparently there was much controversy surrounding this book when it was published, but coming to it years later and expecting a book of beautiful writing, you are left with none of the former controversy and plenty of the latter beauty. This makes for an engrossing read and although slightly uncomfortable in places you can't help but turn the pages until you read the formidable conclusion. Well worth a try if you a fan of strong American literature.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The story is well known, as is the story of Truman Capote himself. I was curious after seeing \\"Capote\\", and there are clear distinctions between the two. The movie gives far more emphasis to Perry Smith, whereas the book articulates the dominance of Dick Hickock over Perry in many ways, excluding the actual killings. Even so, Capote clearly presents Perry more sympathetically than Dick, a key point of debate ever since. The audiobook makes an excellent companion for the movie, and it's an easy listen than can be done over time, as there isn't much suspense, given the results are known.Capote's writing was fabulous, and not too dated. A few parts dragged, whereas the passage of time also provided an interesting window into a time and society that is long gone in America. Capote's effectiveness with all these \\"good people\\" so different from him is still quite an accomplishment.Scott Brick's voice is very distinctive, and may not match what some listeners have in mind. At first, I thought he was not the right choice, perhaps because I envisioned him from some other books (he's an excellent match on \\"Blade Runner\\", for example), but then his narration grew on me and I was fully satisfied."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood reviewIn Truman Capote's novel In Cold Blood, he takes us back to 1959 in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas where a family of four called home.

Little did they know that two men stood on the other side of Kansas waiting to be the last people the Clutters would ever meet. Once in Holcomb, the two men Dick Hickock and Perry Smith, made their way to the Clutter residence where they would shoot and kill the entire Clutter family for what they thought would be a fortune. Based on information they got on the inside. The two men are caught for writing faked checks and charged with the murders of the clutter family and sentenced to hanging until dead.I enjoy reading this book because, it had a new style of writing to it I thought a bit confusing at first how Capote goes back and forth between the clutter family and their murders Dick Hickock and Perry Smith. If you enjoy reading then this is a book you should have already read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The book In Cold Blood, a nonfiction novel by Truman Capote, tells the story about the killings of four members of the Clutters family. This novel is a very thrilling, adventurous and overall sad story that took place nearly 51 years ago; in a small village of about three-hundred people called Holcomb, Kansas. Truman Capote started his novel by explaining a little about the victims, Mr. Herb Clutter, his wife Bonnie, and their two teenager children, Nancy and Kenyon. The Clutters family was very wealthy due to Mr. Clutter owned a ranch. Herb Clutter was a well known respected man who was very organized with his business. Bonnie Clutter, was a stay at home person. She suffered from mental disorders, and would spend a lot of her time in bed. This made Dick and Perry (The killers) think they had the perfect catch. But it all went horribly wrong when their plan completely changed once they were in the Clutter's house and realized their was no safe. The outcome, death. Perry and Dick put a shotgun to everyone head and pulled the trigger. Months later, they were caught and sentence to death.The author has a unique way to describe the story almost as if you were watching a movie. Very different from any other non-fiction book. The reason being, Truman followed the case of the murderers up to the point of their execution. He would visit them every chance he could get, and they would often exchange letters throughout a period of five years. Truman Capote wrote a true-crime masterpiece.The book itself is really well written, but the fact that it was about a real true crime made me continue reading it. This book get's straight to the point and you don't have to wait until the last page to find out who the killer is. Right from the start, introduces the victims, then the killers, and where its all taking place. If you are a fan of that, this book should be quite interesting.There are parts when the author gives way too much detail about one thing and sometimes one may feel uninterested in the book. The plot was sometimes confusing as well, because it switched back and fourth a lot. So it's more of a \\"you like it, or you don't\\" book.

This is a great book overall, even if you are not interested in the Clutter case."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote is ranked with John Steinbeck and Jack London as a literary giant. His ability to tell a story is genius. This book is riveting."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I found this book to be absolutely fascinating from beginning to end. Excellent writing. Fascinating description of the killers.I recently saw the Oscar winning movie, \\"Capote\\" about Truman Capote and the writing of \\"In Cold Blood\\" The I watched another of the three movies about Capote and \\"In Cold Blood\\" called \\"Infamous\\" (I found the latter to be the better of the two). I was so taken by the movies that I was inticed to read the book itself. It was even better than I expected."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Saw the movie Capote (I gave it 3 out of 5 stars) with Philip Seymour Hoffman and thought that I would read the book that plays such a prominent role in the film. The book is non-fiction, but it reads like a wonderfully crafted novel. Capote's style is a little dense at times, but he handles a gruesome subject quite well and it becomes a page turner."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"A very personal (though not original) view on this book. This is a breathtaking work: in its accurate research; in it style. Most of all it is one of those creations in which the author reveals some quintessential aspect of humanity. This is visible both in the creation of the characters - Perry Smith mostly. Not just a matter of the book design but also of the relationship of Capote with the murderer (Capote is reported to have fallen in love with P. Smith).Capote is also an example of incredible determination and persistence which I admire immensely, in spite of his rather irritating persona. His social raise and fall are tragic witnesses to his clarividence. All the contradictions of humanity in one book and the story of that book.It also a very good electronic read: the pagination works well on kindle, kindle size and font change really are a convenience."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I had to purchase this book for my high schooler to read as a summer reading assignment. Once school starts back up in the Fall, my child's class will be going over this book. My child said that this book starts off slow,but once you get into the storyline, the book picks up. My child said that it's a good book to read and it is well written. I was impressed with the timely manner that it took for us to receive this book. My order was at my doorstep before the deadline that I was given when I placed my order."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"A perfect family in a perfect place in time, torn and twisted apart, randomly, cruelly, and thoroughly in this based on a true story book. The fame of the writer and book brought me to it, I read it without knowing the story behind the story. I didn't realize it was a true story, towards the end of reading it, I was wondering why the story started taking turns towards the mundane, there were no big twists or gotchas like you'd expect in a classic novel. Before I finished it I googled to find it a true story, and it made it all the more gruesome."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood is a first-of-its-kind true crime book where journalism was written in novel-form. In a small Kansas town in 1959, four members of the Clutter family were brutally slaughtered in their home. The book begins by personifying the members of the Clutter family and laying out the last couple days of their lives. It also brings to life (disturbingly) the two murderers, outlining their histories and motivations. This is a work of genius in real-life characterization. The author clearly had compassion for at least one of the murderers, so much so that he was accused of being \\"obsessed.\\" I don't find this obsession as shocking as some people, I suppose, because I understand that psychopaths are generally EXTREMELY charming and are able to manipulate people into feeling empathetic towards them. I wonder, though, if Capote knew as much about the diagnostic criteria of psychopaths back then as a good journalist-doing-his-job would have today, would he have portrayed the two men the same way? While reading, I kept saying, \\"these men are psychopaths, and yet they are portrayed as having (very tiny!) consciences...\\" If the book were written today, I don't think it would be the same book. Regardless, I think it's a classic that will stay with us forever simply BECAUSE it portrays a world that was perhaps less complex and more innocent than today's."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I heard so much about this book over the years, and finally got around to reading it. It started out very strong, held its own throughout, but petered out in the last 30 pages or so. It seemed as if Capote had grown tired of covering the story, or was feeling depressed and defeated by the executions of the two villains, whom by then he had befriended.About three-quarters of the way through the book, I couldn't wait for the two creeps to be executed--and I'm not a fan of capital punishment. They were just that despicable. I couldn't decide which one I loathed more. I didn't share Capote's, at times, obvious sympathy for Perry Smith, due to his \\"horrible\\" childhood; I didn't think his childhood was horrible, at least by today's standards. I think what made him a killer was a lifetime of societal rejection due to his unfortunate short height, stocky build, Mexican features, lack of education, and a (hinted at) history of sexual abuse by men. And although I felt no sympathy for Dick Hickock, I didn't think he deserved to be executed, since he didn't actually commit the murders. Life without parole would have been a more appropriate sentence for him, in my opinion.The writing style is of very high caliber. Capote's skill in weaving so many perspectives and so many details of a story into a cohesive whole is remarkable. That he painstakingly left himself out of a story, of which he became very much a part, is admirable.What I walked away with mostly was a better understanding of the criminal mind, and about what happens when deviants bond socially. I now understand why the criminal justice system so vehemently enforces a no-contact rule among parolees."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"True crime is the most disturbing kind to read. In Cold Blood is the true-life story of a despicable crime against an innocent and well-respected family committed by contemptible criminals. Truman Capote starts the book by placing the reader in the village where the crime occurred, a lonely area of Kansas that feels even more isolated by Truman's descriptions of the wail of the locomotive whistles and the scuttling tumbleweed; a quiet place where residents don't even lock their doors. Perhaps this is what makes the crime more shocking.The writing is exceptional. A lot of time is spent on detail of the criminals backgrounds, which slows the pace. For me, the suspense lies not in the crime itself, but in the investigation and the capture of the killers. Capote's account of their trial, their time and experience on death row, culminating in their execution, was fascinating to read.The story is told through several points of view, giving the reader a feel for the depth of each individual and the impact of the crimes, or lack of, on each one of them. The writing almost leaves the reader with a sense of empathy for the killers - almost, for the reminders are woven in that this is true crime - and leaves them to question their own opinion on capital punishment. In the words of one of the killers : \\"it's revenge.\\"Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Though no one really needs an explanation as to which book \\"In Cold Blood\\" is, I'd like to say that it is a really successful combination among suspense, detective story, good factual (and yet sensible) journalism with a tiny bit of legal writing. Capote wrote in a very catching way this bloody and chocking episode without exploring the horrible details. Great book."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I was sick with the flu and watched the movie on TV so I had to read the book. It was an excellent book and with my Prime membership I got the book the next day."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I had long wanted to read this book and one night after seeing the film \\"Capote\\" again I decided to buy a copy and see what it was really like. This was also my introduction to the written works of Truman Capote and I found his book truly amazing. It flows so smoothly, its phrases and imagery give you such a complete sense of place and time of the senseless murders of the Clutter family of Holcomb, Kansas in 1959; it is a frightening portrait of two killers and their four innocent victims. This is one of the best books of the 20th century and well deserving of all the awards and accolates it received. Capote called it a \\"non-fiction novel\\" which seems to me to be a very accurate description. He had such complete information from all sides in this case...from the Kansas Bureau of Investigation and long interviews with the killers...that he could compose a moment by moment story of what happened and why. The film \\"Capote\\" shows you what agony Truman went through to write his book, but I find that the book itself shows no signs of that struggle whatsoever. It is seamless and fluid and carries you along to the final moments when the killers are hung. This is a monumental work by an author at the height of his creativity, his masterwork. Undoubtedly his best work, I recommend it highly both for the brilliant writing and for the superb storycraft, letting you understand why the killers did it and what the consequences were to the tiny community in western Kansas called Holcomb. I have never read anything quite like this book."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"You know a book is brilliant when it almost single-handedly establishes a new genre. In this case, the genre established was \\"the nonfiction novel\\": accurate and detailed fact presented in a lyrical and highly readable narrative. I've recently read that many other famous novelists tried to emulate Capote's style and experiment with this new genre after the publication of In Cold Blood - including Hunter S. Thompson, Norman Mailer and Tom Wolfe. While I have never read their efforts, I have a hard time imagining that anyone has ever done it better - or even as well - as Capote.Truman Capote spent four years researching everything about the Clutter murders and the people involved. He exhaustively interviewed everyone - from the townspeople to the investigators to the killers themselves. It has been reported that he took over 20,000 pages of notes. The result was that In Cold Blood is told in the most well-informed and authoritative way imaginable. But what elevates this book from a good presentation of fact to one of the greatest works of the twentieth century is the novelist in Capote... the narrative is glorious and so perfectly and intricately constructed that the book is impossible to put down. This may be the first genuine nonfiction page-turner I've ever encountered.The thing I found truly remarkable about In Cold Blood was that it was never salacious. There is a near absence of gore save for the basic facts of the murders. It presents the facts of Perry Smith's horrendous childhood without ever making a play for the reader's heartstrings. Capote remained true to his ideal that a nonfiction novel should be told impartially and completely in the third person, with no opinion or personal thoughts on the subject matter visible at any point in the telling. The book is utterly objective, but highly descriptive. For example... the average person setting out to tell this story may set the scene with a brief description of Holcomb, Kansas. They may describe its geographic location, perhaps spout a few population statistics, relate some notable fact from town history. Consider then, this small sampling of Capote's description:\\"Holcomb, too, can be seen from great distances. Not that there is much to see - simply an aimless congregation of buildings divided in the center by the mainline tracks of the Santa Fe railroad, a haphazard hamlet bounded on the south by a brown stretch of the Arkansas (pronounced \\"Ar-kan-sas\\") River, on the north by a highway, Route 50, and on the east and west by prairie land and wheat fields. After rain, or when snowfalls thaw, the streets, unnamed, unshaded, unpaved, turn from the thickest dust into the direst mud. At one end of the town stands a stark old stucco structure, the roof of which supports an electric sign - DANCE - but the dancing has ceased and the advertisement has been dark for several years.\\"See what I mean? Lyrical. In Cold Blood deserves its reputation as the crowning achievement of Capote's career and its place in the ranks of best works of the 20th century. It is no wonder that it's considered to be one of the books one simply must read before they die. I'm kicking myself for waiting as long as I did.This discussion originally appeared on my blog. See my profile for details. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood, by Truman Capote is a book that vividly describes the murder of the Clutters, a peaceful, loving family living in an obscure town in Kansas. The gory details are kept out of reach from the reader, and compels them to race through the book in search of each perfectly sculpted detail. But, while the author paints vivid descriptions about the death of the Clutter family, it is not the victims that take center stage in the book. Rather, it is the murderers that are the twisted \\"protagonists\\".The story builds around the villains, casting them under a new light. While the story might involve a murder, the author uses the event as a background of sorts to establish the real story: the lives of two men, who turned into killers.The book is written in a parallel style and draws many parallel throughout. The first section is mainly a parallel between Dick and Perry, the murderers, as they journey to the Clutter house,and the Clutter's life the day before they were brutally shot. The next sections of the book are also written in parallels, but this time, they are between the murderers past life, and their present as they go on the run, as well as the investigators on their trail. The parallels create a sense of suspense because they restrict your view of certain events, and act like puzzle pieces to a large story. That way, you only get to see what happens at the end of each section, when the three points of views finally reach a climax.One thing that the book does is it often brings in nutgrafs that help the characters become three dimensional. For example, the scene where Perry is waiting for Dick to finish up with a girl, he stays outside the bedroom reading through his old letters. The author uses these letters to teleport the readers back into Perry's childhood. This helps the readers realize what an abusive, misguided, and sad childhood Perry led. We as readers start feeling for the killers, understanding that it was desperation that caused the duo to commit such a horrible crime.Another element that is often used is various forms of juxtaposition. The author however seems to fond of ironic juxtaposition, as it pops up in various places in the book. FOr example, in the beginning of the book, the author recreates a scene where Mr. Clutter just signs up for a five hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. He tells his agent that he never uses any cash, and never keeps any cash on his person or in his house. The following scene, however is Dick and Perry as they discuss how much money Mr. Clutter must have stored in a secret safe in his house. The author again uses ironic juxtaposition as he describes the interview the detectives were conducting. First he describes the emotional saga by Dick's family and how they believe that Perry was the one who swayed Dick off to the bad side. The next interview is a neighbor of Dick's family. She goes on to tell the detective that Dick Hitchcock was the worst man in the world. According to her, the reason more people haven't pressed charges against him is because they value his parent's friendship too much. In both of these example, the author uses these juxtapositions to not only show contrast, but to create a sense of dramatic irony as the characters each act in certain ways without knowing all of the story.Overall, the story is very suspenseful, and is artfully crafted to keep readers hanging on. The rich variety of sources create a full story, and even minor characters are fleshed out and relatable. In the end, the story isn't about the murder of the Clutter family at all. Capote takes a new angle on the killing to write a story of two murderers, both of them unlikely to murder, yet willing to do so. This book is a terrific read, and will keep you hanging on until the very last word."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote essentially creates the nonfiction novel here in the harrowing \\"In Cold Blood.\\" He vividly recounts the horrific murders of the Clutter family, the capture of Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, and their subsequent trial.It is known Mr. Capote had extensive contact with pretty much all the key individuals, allowing us into the disturbed and disturbing minds of the killers. It's an unnerving journey, yet one well worth taking. The prose is not flowery, but still elegant. It's an easy read, but better savored when taken slowly. The wealth of detail comes from the enormous amount of research done by the author, who conveys said information most effectively. You'll get goosebumps. More than once. It's not totally pleasant.This stands as one of the most important books of the 20th century, not just for quality, but for influence.

I must say the juxtaposition in the beginning was new and led my first impression of Capote's style to be captivating. From other reviews I have read on this book, it sounds like &quot;The Stranger&quot; by Albert Camus- with the whole learn about the killer before you know their crime.

In addition, feelings on capital punishment can be altered (even if staunch)due to the psychoanalazations of the criminal minds."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"While I was enthralled by the words Capote so eloquently put on paper, I was unable to get beyond the fact that there were no surprises awaiting us in this story.

I couldn't help but notice many subtle similiarities between David Lynchs' fictional &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and Capotes' true story of the Clutter murders.

The horrific subject matter, notwithstanding, the book was a an absolute pleasure to read. It is truly Truman Capote at his literary best.One would think that writing about such a complicated quadruple murder, with the mountain of interviews, multiple players and complex circumstances - spanning the width and breath of the country, following the murderers'zigzagging course through Kansas, Mexico, Las Vegas and Alaska would be difficult enough, but Truman cleverly brought it all together in a ground breaking nonfiction novel that quickly became an international bestseller. You'll never get lost in this book, and you'll never loose sight of the action.Truman Capote's writing style is legendary, and you'll find no better example of it than in the pages of this book. His sentences roll off the pages like warm butter over a stack of pancakes. Smooth. Delicious. His writing is eloquent, yet uncomplicated. Capote writes with the reader in mind, never letting you stray from the topic at hand, always bringing your attention back to the page in a wonderfully, readable style that is his trademark. In my opinion no one does it better. In Cold Blood gets ten thumbs up!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book was received before the cut off date.

I totally forgot that Capote was the interviewer. It read like a novel not and interview."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book was very well written. By not revealing the reasons for the murders, Capote builds up your interest in the story. His descriptions of the suspects and their travels keep that interest, even when reading about killers."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Writer James Frey could have taken a lesson from Truman Capote's self-marketing savvy when he started publicizing his exaggerated, Oprah-cometh-and-Oprah-taketh-away memoir, \\"A Million Little Pieces\\". Early in his research of the Clutter murders, Capote recognized that he was inventing a new genre combining journalism and fiction, the non-fiction novel, a concept which had to be shopped with critics before he could publish his book. In fact, later on, he admitted that he made up some of the scenes he depicted as true. But Capote was not vilified because his work was so groundbreaking, and his now-classic book still reflects the writing talents of a man steeped in his reportage of a vicious incident.The author divides the story into sections - establishing how the Clutter family lived and how they were perceived in the small Kansas community of Holcomb; painting a vivid portrait of the murderers leading to the fateful night; the in-depth investigation of local authorities afterward; and the capture, trial and eventual execution of the killers. While a lesser author would have focused more specifically on the victimization of the family, Capote dares to challenge the reader to sympathize with one of the murderers, Perry Smith - abandoned as a child, brutalized growing up, uneducated due more to the lack of resources. This is where Capote uses his skill as a journalist as he quotes old letters Perry has kept and summarizes dreams and memories Perry recalls. The evidence paints a realistic portrait of a dysfunctional family background, the obvious source of Perry's irrational anger. When fellow murderer Dick Hickock ridicules Perry, it draws us closer to Perry by default given his paltry existence and abject loneliness.This is not to say that Capote holds back on showing Perry's angry side, somehow the only viable response he had to fight his demons. The author's more inherent gifts as a novelist come to the fore in the structure of the narrative with a pervasive use of flashbacks, subjective foreshadowing and rich characterizations to make sense of the story. With a startling transformation by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bennett Miller's recent movie, \\"Capote\\", covers much of the same ground here, but this book is essential in discerning the author's motivations in telling such a tragic story. This is masterful writing, and unfortunately other than his nostalgic short stories, provides the one showcase of Capote's gift of humanization in the guise of beautiful prose."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Coldy Blood by Truman Capote is a very appealing drama that sensationaly depicts the murder of a happy family of four in rural Kansas. Instead of starting at the actual event of the crime Mr. Capote gives background information, both daily activities and personalities, of both the victims and the killers. This helps give the reader a better understanding of both sides of the crime, the killers motive, and the ongoing effect that the crime had on the surrounding community. Mr. Capote also very effectively shifts the setting, plot line, and time line in an interesting technique in telling the story which puts, what to me was the climax, the murder in about the middle of the book. Capote jumps back and forth from the two killers cross-country flight from athorites, to the victims before death, to realitves and friends of both victims and killers, to the tense family life of the head detective on the case, and so on and so on. The only real fault I had with the novel was the sometimes overwhelming use of background informaiton, especialy in the case of Perry Smith's (one of the killers) childhood. It does help the normal person relate to the horrible upbringing that produced such a viloent killer, but it seem to much at time and insignifigant. But overall I did enjoy the book even though I was forced to read it by Mrs. McWain in my junior English Class, I would still recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I was intrigued by In Cold Blood when I first heard that it took place in Kansas. But I have to admit I was a little disappointed by the book. I didn't like Capote's choice of Perry as the main character and was bored by Capote's long tirades about the justice system and his in-depth description of Perry's background.I feel that the real horror of the Clutter family murders was overlooked by Capote and he just used the shock value of the murders as a lure for readers. The real story wasn't about the Clutters, Holcomb, or the investigation, but about Perry, who I personally disliked. I believe that the story could have been written better by another author who didn't exploit the murder of an innocent family to attract readers."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Herbert Clutter was a somewhat wealthy man who built his farm up from nothing. He has a four children, two of which who live with him, and a wife. His wife Bonnie Clutter suffered depressive mental disorders which kept her in her bed for a great deal of time. The two children who still lived with their father were quite different from each other. The boy, Kenyon, was very much into machines while the daughter, Nancy,was \\"the darling\\" of the town, a class president and a honor roll student. On the night of November 14, 1959 the clutter family was murdered in cold blood. The book continues on about the aftermath of the murder and what kinds of affects it has on the townspeople who lived there after.The book was a book for those who like to read for fun. I on the other hand like to read books that keep me intrigued the entire time and not just the first few chapters and then the rest of the book be somewhat dull.

Unfortunately it also destroyed him.The storytelling is compelling and we get to know the characters better than in any book I've ever read (other than biographies). Even though we know how the story ends (it's history plus it tells us on the back of the book), the fun is in getting there. Much of the book has the feeling of a mystery novel. While we know who did it right off the bat, we find ourselves eagerly turning page after page to find out how and why.Once we discover that, it sort of feels like the book should be over. But it continues for quite a bit more, covering the trial and the time the perpetrators spend waiting for their execution. To understand why, I suggest watching the movie \\"Capote\\". The story isn't really complete until you understand how the author was involved.Though Capote was still young when he wrote this, he never finished another book.

But the real emotional power of the book lies in the unspoken distress that emanates from the life account of the murderers all the way up to the horrible act...and beyond. One of them is severely emotionally wounded and arguably mentally ill as a result. The other is more of a puzzle but seems also emotionally disfunctional. Both are intelligent but their intellectual potential goes largely unused and appears, in the case of Perry, disarmingly unfocused. The novel is unapologetic but illustrates the extreme complexity of the psychological events that lead to the brutal murder. Cold Blood is the tale of the nonsensical and violent end of four accomplished and likable individuals. But the story that really sticks is the gripping chronicle of two fatally waisted lives."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The crime described in this book -- a multiple homicide -- could have been presented in the trite and breathless prose that inspires lurid TV cop shows. But it is not. Capote's writing lifts the Clutter tragedy well beyond the commonplace and transforms it into art. The poignant images he chose to include (the sad little dinner Perry serves in prison to his only friend, Dick's parents unknowingly going about their lives with a murder weapon propped up against the wall, Kenyon's radio, Bonnie pleading for Nancy's virtue, Nancy's beloved Babe sold at auction) tug at the heart as surely as the details of the crime appall us. And Capote waited until the end to share those gruesome details, when all the emotion we've invested in both the criminals and Clutters give their horror even greater impact. Beautiful construction, beautiful prose. An American classic."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I find it strange that Capote is best known for Breakfast at Tiffany's when this was far and away his most profound, respectable work. Not only was it the sprout of a whole new genre(what we now know as &quot;journalistic novels&quot; or &quot;creative nonfiction&quot;) but it's well-written and provocative. This novel is a news report; it reads like one of TIME Magazine's better feature pieces, yet it captivates like good fiction. The basis of this book is unique and creative, and journalism at its highest creative point."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I first read In Cold Blood in the 60's. After seeing the movie I reread it and was struck how ground breaking it is. The vivid prose that paint an unblinking view of Kansas and the life of two terrible people. Perry Smith is a character that will stay with me. There was obviously something about him that drew people to him and he obviously had talents,yet he was a cold blooded killer.One of the reviews that I read commented that the book never fully explained why Smith killed the Clutter family. The strength of the book is that as in life there is no complete answer. I read many serial killer books where the killer is some kind of a monster who is very clever. Here the tragedy was that the killers were mundane and like life their motives were not clear.This is a book that must be reread because as one changes and times change no insights are drawn."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I grew up in a small town in Kansas and well remember the Clutter murders. My most vivid memory is not the murders themselves - I was too young to comprehend that - but of my father locking the doors of our house before he went to bed. This was something most folks in the area never did, and in fact, my mother and father engaged in a frantic search even to find our house keys. The murders were, for all small, mid-Western town residents, a loss of innocence and probably the first real threat we had ever felt. Capote's capturing of all we lost was accurate and moving."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood is a chilling and true tale of a family, the Clutters, murdered cold-heartedly in their house. The killers, Perry and Dick, are complex and ever-changing characters. They are incredibly strange, considering that they are heartless and remorseful all in one. Perry is a part Native American who had a very bad childhood and wants to rob the Clutters in order to travel to Mexico. Dick is feigning interest in Mexico in order for Perry to go along with the plan of killing the Clutters. Dick wants to kill the family in order to, \\"Leave no witnesses\\". Dick also seems more wicked than Perry towards the beginning of the book as he not only tells Perry of the plan, but he also likes to rape younger women.Perry was in a motorcycle accident earlier in his life and is now hooked on aspirin. He can't stop taking them and his knees are in constant pain. His knees also become more and more achy when he gets nervous or gets, \\"Bubbles in his blood\\". Perry had enough run ins with the law that he is not even allowed back into Kansas anymore. Dick is a drunk who has been in jail for a while for check fraud. He met a man in jail who told him about the Clutter home and how they have a safe in their house full of money, at least ten thousand dollars worth.When the two finally reach Holcomb, Kansas, the hometown of the Clutters, they creep up to the Clutter's house quietly. When they get in the house and look around for a while, they realize that there is no safe and eventually have to kill the Clutters for the grand total of forty dollars. While on the run from the law, the killers take you from Kansas, Mexico, Las Vegas, and back again as the book takes a climatic turn and we find out the real story of what happened in that house on November the 15th, 1959."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The violent murders of Herbert and Bonnie Clutter and their two youngest children: Nancy and Kenyon in 1959 became a media sensation as these violent crimes are wont to do. Inspired by a 300 word summary of the crime in the New York Times, Capote and long time friend Harper Lee headed west to interview everyone associated with the crime. The result of six year's work was In Cold Blood.Reading the book clarified in my mind just how well I still remember the film and confirmed that I still am not a fan of true-crime (or the nonfiction novel as Capote called his book). The work is well researched and well written but it wasn't a page-turner for me.The book suffers from an information overload and a lack of organization. Capote seems lost under all these witness testimonies, not sure what to keep, what to cut and where to put things. Things stumble along in a more or less chronological order but without the benefit of logical segues between interviews."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I got this book yesterday.

Read it again and remembered it was the most well written book I have ever read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I decided to read this book after discovering that the author was a childhood friend of Harper Lee, author of To Kill A Mockingbird. I had read that Ms. Lee was instrumental in researching this work of nonfiction. Though the book is about a gruesome multiple murder, its focus is on the relationship between the author and the two men who had been arrested for the murders and his search for the truth and motive through establishing a relationship with the alleged killers."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I first encountered this book on an A-Level course at the age of 16 and have been hooked on reading Capote ever since. The wonderful juxtaposition of the Clutters, and Dick and Perry as they move towards the events that all told would kill six people (as we are told at the novel's opening), is truely wonderful.A highly skilled writer Capote has an excellent eye for detail, and the memories of the Clutters, and reactions of the community created a sense of envolvment, empathy, horror and devastation, that I had never encountered before, nor I fear am ever likely to encounter again. For those who may likewise be interested in the author, I can whole-heartedly recommend the Gerald Clarke biography, and indeed a collection of Capote's work published by Penguin, &quot;Capote: a reader&quot;. This item portrays the writers magnificient and diverse expertise, including travel logs, short stories and novellas. One in the latter category is &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's&quot;, a piece which is rarely commonly attributed to Capote, although known by a wide range of people - a great shame in my opinion.&quot;In Cold Blood&quot; was highly controversal at the time, and still creates debates concerning the death penality, the McNaughty rules in the justice system, and among psychologists. A masterpiece that drew heavily upon Capote own's character, a great man who, along with his childhood friend Harper Lee (&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;), manages to retrive the thoughts and feelings of a deeply shocked Kansas community at an horrific time.Although a book of faction, those areas of both fiction and fact are so cleverly interwoven, that although the final scene is obviously 'artistic license', there is no destraction from either the characters, events, or the reader's involvement. You may certainly never forget Perry's dangling legs in court, or Nancy's dress, or the auction.A great read for all ages (from late teens onwards), all over the world, and an author that deserves to be bette! r known."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Capote's &quot;true&quot; account of a multiple murder, the definitive example of a genre that wasn't, (Journalistic Fiction) the author masterfully grasps tone and diction to consistently set a complex scene in &quot;a few perfect details.&quot; Whether describing the 1959 murder scene or a quirky hitchhiker, a vocabulary rivaled by few in addition to a deep empathy for his &quot;characters&quot; (one hesitates to label real people &quot;characters&quot;) pervade the otherwise objective, journalistic style. The six years that Capote spent collecting information by interviewing countless witnesses and friends of the murdered Clutter family (relying only on his photographic memory, never taking notes or making recordings) paid off by unearthing some long-buried secrets. Confessions such as, &quot;not only had he known the murdered family, he knew very well who had murdered them,&quot; fill the text as the mystery, not a whodunit, but a whydunit, is slowly and tantalizingly revealed. Layer by layer, Capote digs toward a motive by fishing red herrings and half-truths from the minds of the accused. His incredible understanding of both killings and killers exemplifies itself throughout the novel, &quot;Perry's expression, his look of unflawed fulfillment, of beatitude, as though at last, and as in one of his dreams, a tall yellow bird had hauled him to heaven.&quot; The technique of the author doubtless turns off fans of Holmes and the Hardys because there is never a standard mystery encompassing the plot of what often seems like a 348 page newspaper article. However, Capote rewards those who stick with the book and wade through his verbose, sing-songy style by presenting an engrossing character study; a better subtitle for the book may be &quot;Glimpses into the lives and minds of cold-blooded killers.&quot; The text also serves the purpose of serving as a seemingly quiet and innocuous examination of the corruption that false hope in the American Dream festers in the hearts of both the haves and the have-nots. This commentary, however subtle, sticks in the mind of the reader and forces one to examine how much faith one puts on archaic promises and expectations. Always critical of traditional values, Capote weaves and intriguing web of prose which will ensnare the reader's imagination and never allow his book to be put down."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The first part of the book really dragged for both me and my husband (and we have pretty different tastes when it comes to books). I almost gave up. I gave it a go anyway and about 1/3 of the way through I couldn't put it down. It reads like fiction which is pretty scary since it's not. Capote was an excellent writer."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote was one of the most talented writers of our time, and \\"In Cold Blood\\" is an absolute masterpiece. I first read it many years ago, yet I still return to it when trying to unlock the secret to excellent writing. Mr. Capote was the first to take a true story and turn it into a novel so true to itself that you could swear you saw all the horrific events and experienced all the excrutiating fright and pain of this beautiful family on a Sunday Morning in middle America. You could swear to it because Mr. Capote took you there.So many other authors have attempted unsuccessfully to capture the secret of Mr. Capote's writing. I think it's simple. Mr. Capote was an honest writer, true to himself and his readers. He did not go in with preconceived ideas around which to write a book. Instead, he went in to gather facts, around which he wrote a masterpiece. Once there is honesty, dialogue falls into place.We are very lucky that Mr. Capote left us with a treasure trove of important works.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I've been hooked on books since I was 5 years old and I don't think I've read anything that affected me more than \\"In Cold Blood.\\" The story is set decades ago but is so ageless that it might have been last month.What makes this book so powerful is that the Clutters, their friends, and the murderers are all conveyed as real people with dreams, faults, virtues, and lives. These are not stereotypes, or shallow charicatures. Somehow, Capote seems to have captured their true natures and distilled them down into words that allow us experience them. As I progressed through the book, I found myself caring more and more what happened to these people until I couldn't bear the thought of the Clutters dying let alone the horrible details.This book is so engrossing and so very real that virtually any reader will find it powerful and compelling. It is a true masterpiece in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood tells the true story of the senseless murder of the midwestern Clutter family in the 1950s. The search for and the story of the two pitiful ex cons who were guilty of the horror is the book's focus. Although the nonfiction novel has evolved substantially over the years, Truman Capote is clearly a pioneer in writing captivating non fiction which reads like fiction. The story is well told and interestingly organized. Capote does a seamlessly delicate job of relaying the cold blooded nature of the crime but at the same time giving the reader an opportunity to glimpse the human side of Dick Hickock and Perry Smith from childhood to death row. Capote leaves just enough space for the reader to wonder and interpret things about the telling of the story to make the tale one dimension richer than it seems."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I must say that I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did. The reason is that I do not generally like the true crime genre. But, this book was so fantastic that I may have to change my mind.I cannot speak about Truman Capote's work as a whole because this is the first book I have read of his. But, I can say, in this novel, that Mr. Capote did a very good job at painting the scene in Holcomb and bringing the reader into the mind of the killers. Every time I hear about a senseless killing, I wonder what would compel someone to do such a heinous thing. Now, I know or at least now I know what might have provoked two men into doing what they did.It is not an easy thing for an author to make sympathtic characters out of two men who are so unlike the majority of the book's readers. But, Capote did it.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book is one of the best I have ever read. My teacher assigned it to my AP English class and it has sparked the most discussion out of any reading we have done. Aside from its unique plot scheme, organization, and literary value to an English class, the overall emotion attached to this book is enough to keep me reading for hours. Capote somehow manages to create suspense even within a story for which the ending is already known. It is truly a one of a kind book.To those who feel it is too slow a read, perhaps yes it is caught up in descriptions of things every now and then; the constant remainder of the impending doom of the family keeps the reader longing for the inevitable to never happen."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"....BR>As brilliant the writing and compelling the drama that Capote pours into the novel, the horrific fact of it is that an innocent mid-western family was senselessly murdered based on a jailhouse rumor.I feel Capote's best work in the book is in the beginning with the suspense he builds to the impending murders (I'm not ruining any plot, the backjacket of the book begins with \\"On Nov. 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces...\\"). The reader knows what's going to happen, one can sense the crescendo of tension through the first 50 pages, and yet I became so compelled for the Clutter's that I found myself hoping they would somehow, someway, find a way to survive the events of that tragic fall evening 40 years ago. And that is what I believe is Capote's best success in the book; he fills the reader with compassion - for both the Clutter's - and ironically, the killers, Dick and Perry.Some reviewers complain the middle of the book drags a bit but Capote is trying to give the reader both sides of the story. To understand Dick and Perry, one must understand their misguided pasts. Their background stories also help setup a terrific ending to the book.Capote also has a gift at capturing a human soul and putting into the pages. The grandpa and young boy hitchhiker story midway through the book is his best but the stories of the prisoners and their everyday nuances is also profoundly ardent.For most readers, this should be a very easy book to follow. Although Capote constantly jumps from the Clutter's to the crime investigators to Dick and Perry's shenanigans, it still follows a pretty consistent timeline. And it's a very fast read. Although it's close to 350 pages, most people I know have finished it within a week.Modern supense novels like \\"Hannibal\\" and \\"The Stand\\" may be more sadistic and have a deeper story, but \\"In Cold Blood\\" was the forerunner to them all and still ranks among the best pieces of non-fiction literature in the last 50 years."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This was my first exposure to Truman Capote, and I must say I loved it. Capote's style, language, and pacing was amongst the best I have ever experienced. If for no other reason than to read exquisite writing, this is an excellent book. As a bonus to readers, however, this book also contains a chilling, though engrossing true-story, of two men who murdered four of Kansas' finest citizens. I love programs such as Law and Order that profile the police work and courtroom drama that follow a crime, so this was right up my alley. Capote recreates the lives and actions of everyone involved in these crimes (sometimes it is obvious that some details were fictionalized as no survivors could have actually testified to them) and makes everyone compelling, including the two murderers. It is a fantastic book and one that I would recommend to anyone interested in fine literature, human psychology, true crime, or just a quick, unforgettable read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote's classic masterpiece 'In Cold Blood' is just as chilling and mesmerizing today as it must have been back in the 1960s when it was first published. It took me far too long to finally read this book.Capote gives an unflinching glimpse into the minds of - forgive me - two cold-blooded killers who senselessly murdered a family of four in a quaint Kansas town. This is the standard to which every modern true crime book must be held. As I understand it, this book basically created the whole genre of the nonfiction novel, particularly with true crime events - if not the very first such book, it certainly is one of the most important.Everything surrounding the gruesome murders on the night in 1959 is presented from every angle. The reader gets an in depth feel for the victimized family, the Clutters, and can never forget that these were real people, quite like anyone else living in the Kansas countryside. They're fleshed out in great detail, as are the killers themselves. The affects left on a small town and its shocked community are palpable. The police investigation is fascinating in itself and offers a behind the scenes look at what it takes to track down a pair of murderers. The story continues with the trial and eventual execution of the killers. By the end, we have an idea of who these men are and how they ended up on such a destructive path, but the ultimate question looming large is why .. can their ever be a satisfactory explanation behind such brutality? The chilling answer is, perhaps, no.'In Cold Blood' is a suspenseful look into a harrowing American crime and holds up well even today. It's easy to see why so many people, me included, consider this a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I don't usually read true crime, but because In Cold Blood is famous, and because I watched the movie Capote, and it made the author look like an uncaring, self-obsessed, egomaniac (or a typical writer, in other words), I thought I'd give this book a go. You know the premise, so I won't provide that here. I will say that the book is very good, bordering on excellent. Slowly, regarding the murder, the reader learns the who, what, when, and how, but Capote teases by holding out on the why. The pacing of the narrative, and how it shifts to different \\"characters\\" and settings is outstanding. The pages, as they say, turn by themselves.And Capote can write, which was what I was looking to verify. His approach is clever; he's literary, even flashy, in the beginning, but because he doesn't want to alienate the \\"average reader,\\" or so I'm assuming (it is a crime story after all), he pulls back and writes plainly for several chapters. Toward the end, he shows off a little, but never too much. Generally, he employs a less-is-more approach and his description is succinct yet compelling.Really, there's so much to like about this book. The psychological profiles and personalities of the criminals, the backgrounds of the victims, the townsfolk of Holcomb, Kansas and their perspectives, the absurdity of the justice system (re appeals and delays); it's all utterly engrossing. Capote did loads of research and thought carefully about how to present his findings. The result is smart entertainment.If you're a book snob, In Cold Blood should pass your test. If you're interested in true crime, I doubt there are many who can scribble about it like Capote can. There's a reason this book still gets shelf space. It's good.I've heard other writers ridicule Truman Capote. Perhaps they were contemptuous of his flamboyant nature. Or perhaps they were just jealous of his writing - and his success.Troy Parfitt is the author of Why China Will Never Rule the World"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I'm a person who will not knowingly go to see a movie that's a thriller.

I have always felt that Truman Capote wanted the reader to have some sympathy for Perry Smith which as far as I was concerned not forthcoming from me. Personally, the case always had an affect on me. Right after I got married we lived for a couple of weeks with my wife's parents. They had a farm and they had a habit of keeping their doors unlocked 24/7. Not like the house I grew up in where the doors were always locked. One night I started thinking about the Clutter case so I went downstairs and locked the doors.

It is a masterpiece of journalism that succeeds in trying to make sense of a senseless crime, the town in which it happened, and the people it happened to. Astonishingly, it also gives a most human portrait of the killers. It is told in a very compassionate voice.

I was blown away by the writing of this master storyteller."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book is considered a classic and I would definitely recommend it. It was an enjoyable read and very well written. I agree with one of the other criticisms, though--that the author spends a little too much time on side stories such as the killers' upbringing. The parts of the book that really creeped me out is the description of the discovering of the bodies and later on the killers' recounting to the police what actually happened inside the Clutter home. Sure brutality. And all of it caused by a lie one prisoner told to another. How ironic--a family of four has to lose their lives because of it. The book is a dense 344 pages so it will take quite a bit of time to read but ultimately worth it. Any fan of true crime will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"My first real interest in reading this book came after I saw the movie \\"Capote\\" with Philip Seymour Hoffman. I had heard of this book as a teenager, and like many people, once familiar with the subject matter, I had no interest in reading something that was going to scare the beejesus out of me and give me nightmares. I had \\"The Exorcist\\" for that,thank you very much. But the film showed the care the author had taken to write this, and his relationship with the perpetrators, and how much writing this had cost. So I got the Kindle Edition and put it on my reading list.The book isn't broken down by chapters, but rather divided into four sections, roughly following the chronology of events they happened, but always with an eerie kind of foreknowledge that Mr. Capote shares with his readers. He gives everyone involved with the murder, including the victims and murderers, families, friend, acquaintances - even local characters in Holcomb, where the crimes occurred, and acquaintances the criminals met in prison, before and after they committed the crime, etc. And Mr. Capote does so in a way that makes you feel like you are present with him. The REALLY neat trick - slight of hand, good use of special effects - whatever, is that he structures this like you are reading fiction. This, make no mistake, is a novel. It starts slowly, but as you get past the first section the suspense builds. The sad thing is the intimacy in the first section. You get to know the victims. He doesn't just describe things. He talks to you as if he knew these people. All of them.As chilling as this story is, it is one of the finest pieces of American Literature I have ever read. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I have lately been reading a number of books that inhabit the no-man's land between fiction and non-fiction, including works that seek to tell about real events with fictional techniques. I decided to go back and re-read one of the pioneers of the region: IN COLD BLOOD.Capote explained that in writing IN COLD BLOOD he \\"wanted to produce a journalistic novel, something on a large scale that would have the credibility of fact, the immediacy of film, the depth and freedom of prose and the precision of poetry.\\" Well, he sure succeeded. So much so that the book is not as startling, new, and different - as novel - as it was 45 years ago, because in its path there have followed a multitude of similar books - arguably, even, an entire genre (true crime). Indeed, a young reader of today might wonder why the book merits inclusion among the other classics of The Modern Library. I myself have some reservations about including IN COLD BLOOD in the same grouping as, say, \\"Moby-Dick\\" or \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\", though it certainly need not take a back seat to any of the four novels by John Irving enshrined in The Modern Library. Though no longer as stunningly fresh as it once was, IN COLD BLOOD still packs a considerable punch and the craftsmanship still shines.The subject event of IN COLD BLOOD is probably familiar to most: Four members of an all-American ranch family in western Kansas were each trussed up and then shot to the head at close range with a .12-gauge shotgun by two young men alienated from mainstream society and psychologically off kilter. The killers, Perry Smith and Dick Hickok, had entered the house under the belief that they would find at least $10,000 in a safe and with the intention of leaving no witnesses. There was no safe, however, and all the killers garnered were $40, a transistor radio, and a nice pair of binoculars. Still, they left no witnesses.Out of that grim and (when you get down to it) tawdry fare Capote creates a gripping \\"nonfiction novel\\". No doubt much of the underlying attraction is voyeuristic in nature. But Capote, in his telling, deftly sublimates that base voyeurism with his clinically nonjudgmental renderings of western Kansas life, his character studies and psychological probings, and his discussions of such issues as capital punishment and the insanity defense. What most distinguishes IN COLD BLOOD - and separates it from almost all of its epigones - are the keenly observed and brilliantly described details. Here is one of my favorites:\\"Among Garden City's animals are two gray tomcats who are always together--thin, dirty strays with strange and clever habits. The chief ceremony of their day is performed at twilight. First they trot the length of Main Street, stopping to scrutinize the engine grilles of parked automobiles, particularly those stationed in front of the two hotels, the Windsor and Warren, for these cars, usually the property of travelers from afar, often yield what the bony, methodical creatures are hunting: slaughtered birds--crows, chickadees, and sparrows foolhardy enough to have flown into the path of oncoming motorists. Using their paws as though they are surgical instruments, the cats extract from the grilles every feathery particle.\\"Likewise, one senses that Capote extracted from the Clutter murder case every literary particle. IN COLD BLOOD may no longer be \\"novel\\", but it still is a helluva read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I read \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\", as well as several of Capote's short stories, before all the recent hooplah over the biography, and the movie, and this book in particular. I was not disappointed. Even though I saw two versions of the book on film first, and then saw \\"Capote\\" the movie, the book was still great... far surpassing anything that has been committed to film.It seems that Capote was one of his own biggest fans, fortunately he was right in his opinion of himself. He was, in fact, a great writer. His depth of research is commendable, but it is his groundbreaking style that gets five gold stars. It reads like a well written novel because that's what it is, yet all the time you are thinking, \\"my gosh, this is all true!\\" The humanness of the two murders comes through so clearly that you may find yourself wanting to have sympathy or compassion for them, but you can't because you can't get the horrible reality of the crime out of your mind. I recently spent the night at the home of a friend. The house was dark and secluded and all too quiet. I found myself thinking much the same thing as many of the peripheral characters in this story thought... \\"are the doors locked?\\" Perhaps that in itself is testimony to how good this book isAfter \\"Breakfast...\\" and \\"In Cold Blood\\" I am now a fan. Do yourself a favor and read Capote. The great thing it's not hard to read everything he wrote because he didn't write all that much... and this is a pity because his work is so damn good."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I had somehow managed to live my first 55 years without reading this book. I'm not sure why, probably because the basic story had been so familiar via word of mouth as I was growing up in the late sixties. The Clutter family brutally murdered, the perpetrators brought to justice. Did I really then need to invest the time and energy to read the 343 pages? A few days ago something made me pick the book off the shelf and start reading. I kept reading until I finished. And I am so glad I did. Capote sets the scenes perfectly. The images he evokes are unforgettable. The issues he has us confront (eg mental illness, capital punishment), are at least as relevant today as they were forty years ago. And he does it all without forcing a personal philosophy or agenda. This book is not your typical crime story. It is infinitely deeper than that. Indeed it is an American tragedy, worthy of comparison to the classic Greek tragedies. It is one of the finest books I have ever read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"One book that lives up to its hype.I am always impressed when a book or movie can keep you interested even when you know the ending. Capote's masterpiece is a gripping page turner that will keep you riveted until you reach the last page.Highest recommendation!P.S. Skip the movie - it was horrible and a waste of PSH's great talent."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I read \\"In Cold Blood\\" a few years ago and was completely riveted and totally disturbed by it. I am such a fan of true crime and non-fiction, and rarely like anything that is not. Capote is a verbal artist who paints a picture - in fact, two pictures, in this case, a picture of a normal Kansas family, so wholesome and well-liked, and a picture of 2 unfortunate individuals who in my mind, want what this family has and they do not - money, acceptance, love. It is an utter contrast. And while I understand that many people close to the Clutter family dislike the portrayls, I believe it is a fascinating and well-researched book that desires much merit and would be hard to put down, much less forget."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Having not read In Cold Blood for at least thirty years, I picked it up once again for warm up to the current Sony Pictures Classics release: Capote. And as before, I was overwhelmingly impressed by the sheer genius of this author and his masterful use of language. What a pleasure to read such a well written book. It truly is \\"a work that transcends its moment, yielding poignant insights into the nature of American violence\\".The telling of the tale of the murder of the Clutter family in Holcomb Kansas in November of 1959 is both extremely disturbing and highly relevant even in 2005. I found myself furious on several levels: Furious at the senseless, depraved, idiotic murders themselves. Furious at the Clutter family for meekly accepting their fate (according to Capote Mr. Clutter encourages his family to permit themselves to be tied up; none of the family runs for help or does anything remotely proactive). Furious at the complacency of the townsfolk who don't want to think about the murders. Furious at the complete lack of adequate defense provided the killers (the trial was a complete sham - and yes, I realize they were guilty, but the frightening breaches of criminal procedure should concern us all).The prism that the passage of a few decades presents enables me now to see the title differently. In my youth I figured the term In Cold Blood referred exclusively to the mind-set of the two men who premeditated the murders. But does it not also refer to the mind-set of the all male jury whose minds were made up before the trial? The resulting \\"judicial homicide\\"? The mind-set of the abusive parents of the killers who arguably tortured their sons into sociopathy? The harsh, pious mid-western mentality of the 1950's? Now, before you bash me about the head and accuse me of bleeding heart liberalism, realize I am not equating the savage senseless murder of a family with stern Bible Belt conservatism. And clearly Capote was advocating against the death penalty by presenting intimate details not only of the victims, but of the killers. However, this book should stimulate some lively conversation in your house about the rights of victims, the rights of criminals, and the validity and purpose of the death penalty today."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"When a book like IN COLD BLOOD reaches the level of being a classic, there has to be a reason. Consider the following two excerpts:\\"The land is flat, and the views are awesomely extensive; horses, herds of cattle, a white cluster of grain elevators rising as gracefully as Greek temples are visible long before a traveler reaches them.\\"\\"Then, starting home, he walked toward the trees, and under them, leaving behind him the big sky, the whisper of wind voices in the wind-bent wheat.\\" The former excerpt is from Capote's opening paragraph; the latter cointains his closing sentence. Both are extraordinary, especially for their time, in capturing the mood and poetry of a place in the middle of a true-life story of a horrific mass murder.As is certainly well known, IN COLD BLOOD is Truman Capote's magazine-article-turned full-length-docu-novel about the murders of four members of the Clutter family in their Holcomb, Kansas, farmhouse in November 1959. The two killers, Dick Hickock and Perry Smith, were ultimately caught, tried, sentenced, and executed, factual matters that are still commonly known today thanks to two recent movies about Capote's life and his efforts to write the book. Even at its publication, IN COLD BLOOD was not a detective story in the traditional sense, since everyone already knew the perpetrators and the case's eventual disposition.In an era when such incidents were reported either factually (newspaper style) or sensationally (crime magazine style), Truman Capote effectively created an entire new genre: journalism as art form. Writing with a level of descriptive detail about places and events that create a strong sense of immediacy in the reader's mind, he begins his story with a re-creation of the Clutter family's last day of life. The effect is profound and eerie, since these pages are read with a foreknowledge of death not shared by the real-life characters on the page. Capote builds his suspense masterfully, alternating between the movements of Hickock and Smith and those of the Clutters (husband and father Herbert, perennially sick wife and mother Bonnie, intelligent, tinkering son Kenyon, and All-American sweetheart daughter and town darling Nancy.As he brings the two parties closer and closer together, Capote continues to fill in background on their respective lives. By the time his orchestrated characters have reached their mutual, bloody crescendo, the reader is intimately acquainted with them as individuals and their respective life stories. Thus, the author gives us individuals with whom we are intimate as characters in a novel, yet they are real people about whom he is reporting in a senseless, horrifying mass murder story. This is Capote's genius and the source of his book's classic status - factual reporting that reads like a novel, displaying the intimacy with its characters that is normally reserved for the so-called \\"omniscient author,\\" the one who can hear, share, and express his or her characters' most private thoughts and motivations.Capote's pacing and remarkable eye for detail never relent as the story moves from crime to investigation, arrest, and trial by jury. He maneuvered himself into a situation where he was privy to every detail of the police investigation; it is equally clear he had extended access to Hickock and Smith throughout their ordeal, up to and including their ultimate disposition. While it was doubtless a level of access no longer available to reporters or writers, Capote took maximum advantage of it in crafting his story. What comes out of it, surprisingly, is a tale of two socially maladjusted young men of above-average intelligence whose trial was of questionable fairness, particularly as regards the mental health of one of them (who was probably more criminally insane than scheming murderer). In one of the book's most telling moments, Capote recounts the reports that the court-appointed psychiatrist would have rendered had the judge (and Kansas state law at the time) allowed them to do so.IN COLD BLOOD is truly a master work by an effete, East Coast reporter who beat the odds (and prejudices, no doubt) and entwined himself in his story and the lives of its actors to an unheard-of degree. The result was, and is, more than just a gripping account of a horrendous crime. It is a study in criminality: its victims, its effect on their families and community, its perpetrators and their families, even on the law enforcement personnel involved in the investigation. One can hardly imagine a more finely drawn study of a single crime and its all-too-human impact, presented in a form that remains to this day a page-turner in the very best sense of that phrase."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"What an incredible book. Touching, horrifying, saddening. It's very little wonder that Capote's life was never the same after writing it. The ceaseless conflict he must have faced resulting from growing so close with Perry Smith while at the same time having to describe on paper the crime Smith had committed, right down to Nancy's pleas for mercy - pleas which were cut short seconds later. What must he have gone through in his heart? No one truly knows.What is clear is that the quality of storytelling did not suffer in the least, regardless of whatever personal turmoil he may have been battling with. The way he masterfully wove the facts of the case in amongst conversations, interviews, small-town folklore and the events he witnessed while researching the case is simply astonishing. One great example of this is the chapter in which he describes the police-escorted arrival of the two accused after their capture. It is perhaps my favorite chapter in the book, the way it flows from the travels of the two stray cats to the throng which has gathered at the jail to the arrival of the criminals and then to the first flakes of snow falling on the dispersing crowd. Any lesser writer could have presented the bare facts but what Capote does is paint a full picture of the happenings that day, and this style is repeated throughout the course of the novel. Simply beautiful.This was a senseless, pointless crime which even 47 years later makes me wonder \\"why?\\". It was all for nothing, the destruction of a wonderful family (and, on a larger scale, the destruction of a once quiet, trusting community) by two sad and misled individuals. Capote's work untangles some of the mess and leaves us with a measure of understanding, though that understanding only leaves the reader more frustrated, wishing something could have been done to alter the course of fate...that of the Clutters, of their killers, and of Truman Capote."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Before I knew there was a movie called \\"Capote\\" I knew that this book existed. I just never took the time to read it. I don't know why. After the movie, after the hype,I thought I should do myself a favor and read a book that was obviously good enough to be so acclaimed. I could not put this book down. Scary, thorough, thought-provoking, questioning....I got upset over the characters and the way they almost LET themselves die. I wanted to jump through the pages and stop the killers and say \\"Wait, you can't kill them until they struggle!\\" The times were so very different than they are today. Too trusting, too open, too honest, too long ago. I would have loved to have lived in those days -- We know too much now. This book is well written, stunning. Captivating doesn't begin to tell you. Immediately after reading the book and seeing the movie I have deepened my personal investigation into Truman Capote, and have read volumes about him - words written by his friends, peers. I am amazed. I know why Gloria Vanderbilt calls him the Tiny Terror. He was good...he was bad. This is one of the very best books I've read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"'In Cold Blood' chronicles the murder of a small Kansas town family. Holcomb is a quiet small town in rural Kansas, which is rocked by the murder of a family. The murder is a shock to the small town and sends the locals into a state of fear. Who did this? The murder could still be in the area! The murder could be a local resident. A small town, used to keeping doors unlocked, is now paniced and paranoid.Capote disects the murder, the murders and the victims. He takes you into the lives of the families involved. From the victims, to the murders, to the investigators. It is a fascinating story and Capote's telling graps and holds the reader. 'In Cold Blood' was also a ground breaking book. Now it is common to find a 'true crime' novel, but this book set the stage for the books that followed."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I have a read some of Capote's other works and this book must be one of his best, if not the best. It is not a novel, it is a story re-told by Capote of real events that took place in Kanasa about 50 years ago: the killing of a family by two convicts on parole. He goes into the story of the victims and the murder itself in great detail while explaining the personalities and motivations of the killers. The setting is on a farm in a small town in western Kansas. Also, we follow the killers to Mexico and trace them back through their chldhoods, one who grew up in Alaska. This is a beautifully written book that could be fiction or real; and amazingly, it is real.Capote gained fame in 1948 with his book \\"Other Voices, Other Rooms\\" plus a series of short stories, magazine pieces, and movie scripts. This particular book was written by Capote near his prime. It took him at least 6 years to conceive of the story, do the research, and follow through with he final manuscript.The time he spent researching the story is easily seen from the read. The combination of exhaustive research plus Capote's exceptional writing skills has produced this wonderful book hat will impress most readers.The local Borders book store must have a stack of a dozen copies and it is easy to understand why: clear and compelling entertainment, told like a world class novel. It is still a wonderful read 40 years later. This is one of the better books that you will ever read - including Flaubert and Austen.5 Stars.Also, I just read and enjoyed his collection of short stories: \\"Music for Chameleons\\" by Truman Capote. That has one short story similar to the present novel."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I really enjoyed this book from the begining to the end, and found it to be one of those reads that grabs you and doesn't let you go. The fact that this novel is based on real life events related to a murder has little to do with the actual lifeline of the novel, the richness of the book lies in the near perfect treatment of the ambiences, the perfectly dissected characters, the way it intertwines seemingly disparate pieces on the lives of the characters back and forth to make perfect sense to the story... those thinking this is in the core a murder novel or detective story would be greatly disappointed as there is not a thrilling or morbid side to this story, and the actual events of the murder are almost tangential. A need-to-read for anybody seriously interested in contemporary American literature."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"\\"In Cold Blood\\" was one of those books that once I picked it up, I found hard to put down. I have never read a crime novel (fiction or otherwise) before this one, so I wasn't sure what to expect.Capote did a wonderful job of introducing a wide cast of characters by jumping perspectives in an orderly way. Then he steadily wove the stories of the characters together, visiting each one until the fateful night of the murders, and then following up with the aftermath. I enjoyed the time he took so that we would get to know each of the characters; he painted a three-dimensional picture which we could view from any angle we wish. Yet he left it up to the reader to choose which angle to view.The characters - the good, the bad - did not leave quietly once I had finished the book."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Reading this book is liking being part of the actual events.Though he wasn't known as a crime writer (Capote is still probably most famous for having written Breakfast at Tiffany's), Truman Copote still managed to spend a tough four years researching this book and getting iside the characters so that he could properly tell their story.Actually, he what he did was to properly tell the story of their nightmare.On the one hand, you had the Clutter family, mother, father and their teenage children all living a normal life until one night two intruders came in and killer them, casually, methodically and of course as Truman put it, in cold blood.The two killers had spent much of their lives in prison. They were Richard Hickock and Perry Smith. They went to the Clutter house seeking money but even when they went there they knew they intended to kill their victims so that there would be no witnesses left behind.Though the book pulls it punches and leaves you waiting until nearly the end to give you the account of that grusome night, when you get there it's described in the same immediate way in which all the other action takes place. So when they commit their crime, you become their witness.A sensitive man, Capote obviously had his qualms about the capital punishment to which Hickock and Smith were eventually sentenced. Indeed the dialogue wherein the title line \\"in cold blood\\" appears near the discussion of their fate. But wisely, Capote leaves the reader to his own conclusions as to the propriety of that fate.Like a good reporter, Capote supplies the facts so that readers can make their own conlcusions.But whatever your conclusions may be, you will no doubt -- as I was -- remain haunted by this story long after putting it down."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This is one of the greatest non-fiction books ever written. Capote captures evil as well as anyone who ever tried a journalistic account of true events."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book was very well done and not for the lighthearted. If you do take this to the beach, put on lots of sunscreen because, you will not want to put this book down!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It was written about a true story, which made it even more interesting. Capote, the author, talked to the investigators of this case and to the citizens of Holcomb, Kansas. He was inspired and then wrote a novel about it. The book showed in great detail the process of capturing the murderers of an innocent family. At the beginning, the reader knows who gruesomely murdered the family, but the motivation for the crime is unknown. The chapters switch back and forth between the murderers, Dick and Perry, and the detectives and citizens of Holcomb. This style makes it easy to keep track of who is where throughout the whole story. It was hard to put this book down because of the constant action and the need to know the whole reason behind the killings. In the end, you finally, after years have passed, discover what happens to the murderers."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book is kind of hard to get into at first. In my opinion, Capote could have been a little less descriptive. I read it a few months ago for a class I was taking (I'm in 9th grade) and I absolutely loved it once I got past the first hundred pages or so. It's a great read for anyone who is interested in true crime."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"On November 15, 1959, four members of the Clutter family were killed--murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. The crime, committed in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, stunned the residents, who were subsequently paralyzed with fear as detectives and FBI agents combed for clues.These apparently \\"motiveless\\" murders seemed like the perfect crime, since few clues or evidence were left behind. Just a cats-paw boot mark that left tracings in blood and some stolen items from the farmhouse.This true-life drama opens by spotlighting the normalcy of the victims' lives, and describes the ordinary moments that marked the last day that they would live.In Cold Bloodis told from the viewpoints of several characters, including the perpetrators, Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, whose lives leading up to those moments were characterized by troublesome childhoods and a series of criminal acts, the most recent of which had led to their incarceration. They had met and formed a bond in prison, and upon their parole, they implemented their plan.This novel, written like a fictionalized tale, leads the reader through the journeys of the perpetrators, the detectives, and then later, to the trail that ended at the moment of arrest.Certain aspects of the story were very intriguing, but I lost interest before I reached the end. Capote's style of prose did not grab me, despite the gruesome details that illuminated the horrific events. I wish I could say that it captivated me and held my attention, but the most I can say is that it was informative. As a result, I can only rate this one with three stars."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I was teetering between 3 and 4 *'s for this book, and was inclined to give it 3, until it was finished. It left me with such an overcast feeling of sadness. Any time a story can impact my feelings - well, that's why I read. That's what I look for. Capote did an excellent job of maintaining a somber tone throughout. He took hold of my attention, in a gentle but firm way, and carried it throughout the book, which had many peaks and valleys - though none too dramatic, lest he stray from the dark monotone of the narrator. Murder, sympathy, adventure and revenge all add up to a story well told and worth reading."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I've wanted to read this book ever since I took the Amtrak cross-country. We were having breakfast in the dining car, flying through western Kansas when our waiter leaned over our booth and pointed at a house as we sped through the outskirts of Holcomb. He said \\"Right there! That house! That's where the murders happened in the Truman Capote novel!\\"This was my first Kindle book purchase. I couldn't put it down. It was one of those books that I read while eating, shaving, during commercials, etc. Capote keeps the reader riveted as you get to know the Clutter family and, simultaneously, the accused killers.

The Clutters were truly good people--the kind of people you would want as neighbors or friends. They (father, mother, daughter age 16, and son age 15) were murdered senselessly.In Cold Blood is one of those special books that will stay with you for a very long time. If you like to read true crime, you must read this book."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"IN COLD BLOOD is the first of its kind in the non-fiction literary genre written in 1965 by Truman Capote. In the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, where everybody knows one another and people rarely lock their doors, four members of the Clutter family were ruthlessly killed on November 15, 1959. The murderers were unknown. With few clues left in the wake of four bound and gagged bodies discovered with point-blank shotgun blasts to their heads, Capote in wild excitement dropped everything he was doing to make his way down to the murder scene in Holcomb.For the next four years, Capote meticulously interviewed people in the town who knew the Clutters. He also befriended the two murderers, Perry Smith and Richard \\"Dick\\" Hickock, and remained in close contact with each up until their execution. After 8,000 pages of notes and the ex-cons responsible for the slayings were hanged, Capote published his novel in 1966.One aspect that makes this novel so great is its deadpan, often agonizing, description of the murder scene. When Susan Kidwell discovers her close friend's dead body, she said \\"Nancy Ewalt says I did--screamed and screamed. I only remember Nancy's Teddy bear staring at me. And Nancy. And running.\\" Capote's descriptive prowess takes the reader in the house. You see the blood, you hear the silence, and you know the Clutters are gone forever.Another thing about the novel that draws the reader in is its eerie analysis of the culprit's psychology. Capote provides a full narrative of what life on the run was like for the two convicts: we learn about the trail of bounced checks across America that led authorities to their whereabouts; we learn about Hickock's pedophiliac tendencies, his ironic obsession to be perceived as \\"a normal,\\" and his envy of other successful men; we also learn about Perry's promiscuous alcoholic mother, his years in a Catholic orphanage where he was beat for wetting the bed, and his addiction to aspirin as a way to manage the incessant pain in his bowed-legs.IN COLD BLOOD brings the reader inside the Clutter family before their fatal demise. There's the successful Herbert Clutter, a proud father, who never takes stimulants and wakes up early every morning to tend to his farm. Then there is his fragile wife, Bonnie Clutter, who over the years of their marriage has become reclusive, a sort of invalid. Kenyon, their son, is the typical well-mannered, all American young man. And finally, but definitely not least, is Nancy Clutter. An amazingly talented young woman who has everything going for her only makes these senseless murders that more tragic.It is a novel that will disturb you, a novel that will have you biting your fingernails, and it is a novel that will have you shaking your head in anguish of how such a monstrous act could have befallen on such a beautiful family."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Very interesting and factual story about the senseless robbery and killing of a fasmily in Kansas.How the police caught up with the killers and the deserved punishment they receiverd."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Hadn't' red this book in decades.

Capote took the true story of a small town murder in Kansas and wrote it in a way that had never been done before. Unlike your typical true crime book, this one included skilled character development and masterful prose. It was as if I was reading a fictional murder mystery but much better. This book is unique in that you can enjoy the writing itself as well as the unfolding of the story. Especially if you like a good mystery, this is well worth a read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I couldn't care less about nonfiction normally - I'd much rather read a good story any day. However, In Cold Blood provides all the structure and characterization that would expect from a work of fiction. I guess it just confirms that you can't write anything as touching as real life. It communicates what happened so effectively that I couldn't bear to read it alone. Depressing, yes, but some awfully good writing.As a final aside, I'd like to comment on two points that aren't the most important: the title and the cover - but both of these fit absolutely perfectly!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This was my third copy - thanks to lending and forgetting to reclaim. Every so often I re-read it, making it my own \\"cult classic\\". What a story - still grim but exciting after all these years. This time around, I also had to re-purchase \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" - lost from the same causes as \\"In Cold Blood\\". I enjoyed a week of reading both books and delving into more research regarding the long relationship between Capote and Lee."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Murder in small town, homosexual overtones, graphic descriptions - must have really shook up the world in 1966. Even today is a captivating read. Capote has a way with words and that makes this story probably more entertaining than it should be. He paints the time very well and as the reader you go back to a much different time."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Capote has taken the factual account of a horrible mass murder and turned it into a fascinating story that reads more like a novel. Beyond just giving us the facts, Capote creates a colorful, vivid world with deep, rich characters. Through the telling of the tale, we get to know these people inside and out, and we even begin to feel some compassion for the monsters who committed this heinous crime.Capote's description of small town Kansas is very accurate and realistic. The emotions and reactions of the populace are presented a format where they are not only a factual interview from the person, but also Capote imparts the emotion which the subject is imparting. We also get a unique perspective of the criminals themselves presented in a very believable manner.With this book, Capote basically created his own genre; taking the true crime story to another level altogether with beautiful prose and excellent story-telling. It is truly a masterpiece and a fine work of modern literature."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Wow. Capote's writing is delectable, the story is horrific, and the forgiving perspective allowed me to bond with characters beyond redemption."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Despite 50 years having passed since the gruesome Clutter murders, Capote's account of the events leading up to the terrible murders and their aftermath leaves this present-day reader haunted and breathless. Capote's narration is addictively readable; his imagining of the tragedy so real one feels as though one is a resident of tiny Holcomb, Kansas, swept up in the fear and paranoia such a terrible crime can unleash on such a small community. You will have a hard time putting this one down."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I came to this book after having recently watched the 1967 film. The film riveted me. I had been wanting to see it for years so I picked up the DVD after Christmas and was very taken with it. Soon after I ordered the book. When I started reading it I just could not stop. The book reads lightning fast. The extraordinary thing I came away with from the book was a feeling of closeness to both the Clutter family and Perry Smith and Dick Hickock. I felt sympathy and sadness for the Clutter family certainly. They seemed by all accounts a wonderful family who befell a horrible last few hours to their tragically short lives. But Capote creates sympathy felt for Perry and Dick even though what they did was horrible and they paid the consequences for their acts. Capote has a fantastic ability to tell the story from many perspectives and in every instance you feel as if you are there. The story has stayed with me and I have gone back and reread sections of the book again. I know this is a book that I will most likely return to for many years to come. After reading the book it stayed with me and I still think upon it. I find myself wishing that Perry and Dick hadn't killed the Clutters, that they end up just leaving without hurting anyone.I highly recommend the book and I also highly recommend the 1967 film of this book. Richard Brooks (the director) did an amazing job at creating a screen version of this book. Having the movie so fresh in my mind when I was reading the book, I was amazed at the amount of detail from the book that made its way into the movie. It seemed just about every page had something on it that found its way into the movie in some way, shape or form. Also Conrad Hall's black and white cinematography is top notch. A five star move of a five star book. I would say the adaptation was similar to the way Roman Polanski did a top notch job at adapting Rosemary's Baby. Even though the books have more detail, when you're watching them you feel as though you are in the book. A very rare thing. Highly recommended. You won't soon forget this story."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This is a good crime thiller as the author has you guessing until the last chapter as to what happen and why."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"To keep it short and sharp: I have read all the classics (Tolstoy, Twain, Austin, Orwell, Fitzgerald ect ect), and I know this isn't technically a novel, but In Cold Blood stands the test of time and still remains as the most enjoyable and well written book I have ever picked up.One other thing: this is still the only example I have found where I would recommend watching the movie BEFORE reading the book."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I am a true crime fanatic and I though - you know- I never read where it all started - In Cold Blood - there are four parts - and part 2 I thought was a bit slow but the book as a whole is a must read for any true crime fan.What happened to the Clutter family was, excuse the phrase, but, a commedy of errors- in short, it should NEVER have happened -it was like they got killed by mistake - Truman Capote takes you through the minds of Dick and Perry and toward the end goes into a bit of other true crimes and it is terrifying to think that just being in the wrong place at the wrong time can cause a tragedy such as this.Everyone already said pretty much all there is to say about this book but suffice it to say - if you like true crime - you almost HAVE to read this book - its the bible of true crimes"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I began this book during a small travel, I had heard about it, one of the American classics so I tried it. I had the chance to began the book traveling trough Castille, in Spain, that somehow resembles the not much populated landscapes of the novel; it was an interesting experience for me and I feel special affection for this book.In the book all begins quick, with much description, not much opinion, fast and intense. All of a sudden, after the murder, everything has happened and you begin to wonder, what else?And is after this mastery introduction with the murder when Capote unravels the exciting story of the murder investigation. He divides the story into two parts: the happy village disturbed with the murder and the two cruel murderers life.At the part of the good people, the disturbed village, he describes wonderfully the murdered family, its neighbors, the whole village in the quite America. He gives an inside into the customs of the village, you get to know them, feel sorry for their fate, feel pity for the distrust that is installed among them when the murder is commited.Capote gives a thoroughly description of the good people, the good citizens that have spend their live for the good of society. Somehow subtly they all feel confused when the best among them are murdered, it is like if they all think \\"what it is life worth for?\\"In contrast to the good people there is the other part of the book. The story of the murderers, more intense, more human than the good people, giving an inside into human nature. Capote gives a raw description of the murderers, no opinion about their cruelty, about their twisted nature, only description.The reader get to know the murderers, their thoughts, their motivation. It is amazing how Capote manages to make you feel both pity and loathe for the murderers. You somehow understand their actions, they were born being nothing, they have nothing to care about. For them what else there is in life than money, why caring about people, for people that have never cared about them.It is interesting the profiles of the two murderers, the \\"good\\" one and the \\"bad\\" one. The life of a renegade and how the normal guy, just a teenage rebel gets attracted, kind of falling in love with the renegade. How both of them are pitiable and how their search for something in life is somehow romantic.The best of the book, the worst about life, is that this a novel that narrates a true story, although turned into a novel by Capote. From time to time, during the reading, you realize that the story is true, it is not fiction. The loathing thoughts and behavior of the murderers were real, that all throughout history people like them have existed, that even now are around us, that even us are like them.All in all, Capote makes of a cruel real story a treatise about human nature. Really recommended lecture!!!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I read this years ago but it has stayed with me. Such senseless tragedy recounted by an amazing author. I still remember the first couple pages and how I read on with dread and sadness in my heart but the story is written so compellingly I could not bring myself to put it down. It was emotionally draining but definitely still worth reading."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Written in response to the senseless, seemingly motiveless murder of a family if 1950s America, Truman Capote engages and thrills the reader; while forcing them to question and consider the views and values that they hold dear.Capote draws on his honed journalistic skills to report from a number of different perspectives. Although we know from the outset who will die, it is still a genuine shock when it occurs. At times you may also be disturbed by feelings of sympathy for the two murderers.Making no excuses for anyone, \\"In Cold Blood\\" challenges the legal system, when it becomes blatantly obvious that no semblence of a fair trial was observed - and when both men are given the death penalty a strong sense of injustice becomes apparent. We are also left to question why the authorities chose to target these two specific men when there were other horrific crimes occuring across the country."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Literature genius.

The way Capote writes will draw you in until the very last page, literally."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood is extraordinary. Capote is a master wordsmith and a wonderful storyteller. The book is not only beautifully written but deeply suspenseful, which is particularly impressive given that you probably already know more or less what is going to happen."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I have read the short stories by Truman Capote and I was thrilled. However \\"In cold blood\\" somehow dissapointed me, probably because I carried too much of his short stories in my mind. As I am not an american nor do I live in the US, I find it hard to relate the awful and horrid happenings the book describes with tales or relations of nowadays. T.C. was undoubtly a great writer and I enjoy his ability to describe situations and events. I am only sorry not to have read his book many years earlier."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book holds up well over time. The book was gripping and one I thoroughly enjoyed it. The first part of the book describes the family before the murders as they go about their day.... which makes it especially chilling as we know how they ended up. The second part was not as enjoyable for me. I felt that the author romanticized the murders a bit too much. All-in-all a great read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Absolutely chilling and super well-written. Read it in school, and couldn't stop reading it. Finished it in like 5 days."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"An exceptional book that is both chilling and touching. Capote is unmatched in the simple grace of his prose, which flows smoothly and seamlessly, even as he darts from one point of view to the next. The story he tells is every bit as important today as it was when first published. Capote grants the reader access to the minds of two troubled young men, to the friends touched by the Clutter family tragedy, and to the detectives seeking relentlessly to bring the killers to justice. Unlike many, I found the book to be admirably unbiased and nonjudgmental. While it is clear that Capote was no fan of the death penalty and while he occasionally and ever so briefly assumes the role of pop-psychologist/apologist for the killers, he never loses sight of the tragedy at hand. (The anti-capital punishment activists today should be so nuanced!) The book is rife with moving scenes and a kind of quiet dignity. And unlike so many other writers, Capote has an uncanny sense of timing: this book is pithy and to-the-point, not one word too long nor too short. The genre &quot;true crime&quot; often calls to mind cheap sensationalism and second-rate writing. With &quot;In Cold Blood,&quot; Capote set a lasting benchmark that other writers should aspire to."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Although I would classify John Douglas' Mindhunter the very best of this genre, In Cold Blood would be a very close second. The lyrical phrases and economy of words Capote used in this book suggests genius. In case some of you have merely read the book, I would also suggest the brilliant movie which adeptly gives a visual adaptation to the book...Yes, it's that faithful."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"After reading this book, I'm convinced Capote was a genius. Knowing it is a true story makes it that much more chilling. Capote's style is refreshingly contemporary without over simplification. The humanity of Perry Smith and inhumanity of his execution (as described by a witnessing &quot;reporter&quot;) epitomize the human psyche. Capote handles this enormously complex subject with tremendous objectivity. Highly recommended American classic."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote has done such a great work on this book. After reading this book, I felt as if I know all the six characters personally (4 victims and 2 killers.) It gave a completely different insight into american voilence and crime. It is truly haunting. Capote's work is an example of top-class journalism in my opinion. Cannot think of a gray area in this book which tries to illustrate all the gray areas of human nature."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"few books can do what this book can do.the cold facts in this book send shivers up and down the spine. as a kansas native, i often hear, &quot;nothing ever happens in kansas&quot; to prove them wrong i tell them to go read the book &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; when we see each other next it is fun to see them go &quot;that happened here?&quot; for a good book that is as chillinag as its true, read &quot;in Cold Blood&quot;"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote delivers a truely amazing (and shocking) look into the minds of killers. Although the content was sometimes hard to swallow, it was well worth it. Capote doesn't fail to leave out any details of any kind, and this is what makes the book so great. Capote creates great suspense and it's easy to read the book in one sitting. The only warning to give is that this book hits you really hard. Some parts are truly horrifying and seem so real that it feels like you're in the book. You befriend the victims...and the killers. But it's a book you'll never forget."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"It's hard to believe that Capote didn't make the whole thing up. He knows every detail about every character (and really they're not &quot;characters&quot; but real people - another testament to his prowess as a writer)- like the fact that one of the killers chews aspirin because he likes the taste, and washes it down with root beer. What kickass reporting! I wish this kind of thing was done more often. The murder is almost a peripheral thing - the people take on much more importance. We care more about them than about what they've done - they are more interesting than any one of their actions, and that's because Capote respects his readers enough to believe that we don't care about crime and suspense so much as what goes on in the human mind itself."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"What strikes me most is that Truman Capote is a beautiful writer. That he can take such a horrible crime and write about it so evocatively just stunned me as I read. I am looking forward to reading more of his work."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"While Capote's work offers a deep and involving plot to any reader in search of a entertaining yet thought-provoking story, it is the lengths to which Capote goes which leave In Cold Blood a few steps ahead of a simple account of crime and its consequences. Other than offering the simple story, the author went beyond my expectations in delivering an amazingly comprehensive psycological analysis of the killers, explaining the possible reasons behind such an appalling crime.I heard that the author spend around six years researching the Clutter case in order to write the account, and it definitely shows. Capote incorportates massive amounts of detail, yet this added information does prove to be too much for the reader. The author skillfuly informs while simultaniously drawing the reader's attention further into the grip of the story. Also to be commended is Capote's inclusion of the trial and punishment of the two men. I would recommend to anyone this book before he or she forms a truly concrete opinion of capital punishment, as the author sheds a detracted, yet sympathetic, but also somewhat vengeful light upon the operation of our capital punishment system. This harrowing account of American crime is definitely a must."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Read it simply for the writing's sake. Enthralling"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood is a great thriller. It keeps you in suspense throughout the whole book about what the verdict will be. While living in prison, they talk about killing and robbing the family once they got out, and then they actually go through with it. There is this very nice family who gets murderered by two individuals that just got out of prison. They try running away, but come back to town and get caught. This book is not only suspenseful, but all of the while it keeps you interested."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I finally got around to reading In Cold Blood and since its nonfiction storyline is well known I'll focus on his theme and style. First, he takes the information and turns it into a page-turning novel. Second, he has a subtle way of juxtaposing America's dream of innocence and the Puritan work ethic with evil. This juxtaposition is an obsession in David Lynch's best films and indeed In Cold Blood is very creepy precisely because Capote masterfully paints a cozy innocent community in Kansas and then he shows the tiger's claw beneath the velvet carpet, so to speak.It's apparent that great modern crime books are indebted to Capote. If you love In Cold Blood, then you'll want to check similarly done nonfiction crime books, Our Guys and Bully."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I read this book last year for the first time, in college, and haven't been able to stop thinking about it. While I'm from the South, southern literature has never really taken \\"hold\\" of me, or southern authors for that matter, but IN COLD BLOOD changed all that. Now, having gone through volumes of Faulkner and Capote, I'm in search of any and everything about southern writers. This led me to a recent discovery, a true gem, titled \\"Inner Voices, Inner Views,\\" by Kingsbury. Now, I'm in search of everything southern. While IN COLD BLOOD doesn't take place in the south, the writer is from there and that's enough for me. The story of two criminals who plan to kill an innocent Kansas family when they get out, IN COLD BLOOD is a chilling tale, told to perfection by one of America's greatest writers. But the truly odd thing is that, after all the carnage and horribly scenes witnessed on TV today, this books still hits a nerve. I can only credit this to Capote's excellent writing style and pacing of the story. If for some reason you've missed this book, make this your first choice on Amazon. Also would recommend \\"The Complete Short Stories of William Faulkner,\\" and \\"Inner Voices, Inner Views,\\" both of which are excellent."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This book is wonderful. My mom remembers my grandma reading this book in the 60's. I never read it till I saw \\"Capote\\".I kept being reminded about Rober Blake when I was reading about Perry Smith. Mr. Blake (aquitted of a murder charge not too long ago) did a better job proytraying Perry I think than the fellow in \\"Capote\\" But this is a book review. Once you start, you can't finish, never a dull moment.This book is a sad slice of American Pie and should be included with \\"the Great Gatsby\\" in terms of greatness and telling an american story even though it is nonfiction."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I first considered reading this book because of the recent release of the Capote film. Having now read the book and seen the movie, that closely parallels the book's events, I have developed a strong appreciation for this gripping and suspensful piece of writing. I never expected to be pulled in to this book when I first cracked the spine but from page one Capote has a way of making you feel intimately included in his investigation of the Clutter murders. He extends every detail to his readers and engrosses them with ease; this is certaintly not a book you will enjoy because of its reputation...it's simply exceptional. I doubt this book would have motivated the same public reaction were it released in present day (why I gave it 4 stars), regardless, it is a better book than most. Capote's invention of the True Crime genre with In Cold Blood should be reason enough for you to spend a weekend in its pages.(If you're on the ropes, read the book before seeing Capote. The movie reveals why Capote wrote the book the way he did and will make you feel like an expert on the subject if you've already read the book.)"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood by Truman Capote is a celebrated meld of fact and inference. In it Capote pioneered the genre of the nonfiction novel. Using the real-life murder of the Clutter family in 1959 Holcomb Kansas, Capote spins a story that impresses and engages everyone who reads it. The original way Capote uses scenes creates a specific and lasting impression. His take on the Clutter murders is all-encompassing. It's informative, accurate and saturated with details. Capote transforms a news article into a creative work and makes history doing it.I thoroughly enjoyed In Cold Blood. Even though the Clutter family was murdered 50 years ago, when I read it the story it felt immediate and pertinent. The psychological insights Capote made in the book, especially when looking at Perry, were phenomenal and ahead of his time. In Cold Blood read like a romance novel with the added intensity of knowing that the content was real; that it actually happened. The connection Capote makes to the Perry is so deep that it left me feeling that Perry was almost the good guy, and although it was inevitable, he wouldn't end up being executed. I suppose that is the real difference between fiction and nonfiction: in nonfiction that author can't twist the plot to create a happy ending."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"To call \\"In Cold Blood\\" a \\"true-crime\\" story is to diminish Truman Capote's enormous talent as a writer. Capote wanted to create a new form of writing which he termed the \\"non-fiction novel\\": a work of historical or contemporary fact writting in the form of a novel. To an extent, he succeeded. Rather than a dry recitation of the story of a multiple murder, \\"In Cold Blood\\" sweeps us up in the narrative much as a good work of fiction does. Except the events in this book are all too real.Capote tells us the story of the Clutter family murders in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas in 1959 from all angles: the Clutters themselves, the lowlife killers Dick Hickock and Perry Smith, and the detectives of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation who brought them to justice. We meet the Clutters first: Herb Clutter, a pillar of the community and his sensitive wife Bonnie, suffering from bouts of depression; and their two children, the popular, outgoing Nancy and the introverted Kenyon. Then there are Smith and Hickock, two small-town, small-time criminals who hit the big time in one horrendous night when they murder the entire Clutter family. And there is the KBI team that followed each slender lead to bring them to justice.Capote's narrative of the trial which lead to the conviction and execution of Hickock and Smith is as fascinating as his telling of the events which lead to their capture. We can attempt to understand what drove Smith to kill, growing up in a chaotic family; Hickock is more of an enigma. Capote presents the senior Hickocks as two caring and conscientious parents whose son rejected the principles they tried to instill in him. Can good parents raise a bad kid? Certainly the Hickocks did. Smith at least had a conscience, something Hickock never bothered about. Did they deserve to die for their crime? Capote seems to have been leaning against the death penalty in general. He emphasizes that the judge chose the strictest possible interpretation of the mental incapacity statues which might have applied to Perry Smith. The conclusion of the trial was almost foregone; the detectives had carefully built an airtight case. Hickock and Smith end up on the gallows.The book's ending is a wistful scene between the leading KBI investigator and Nancy's best friend, Susan, now a young woman entering college; just such a young woman, Capote says, that Nancy might have been had she lived to grow up. In that final scene, we see, as Capote meant us to see, the waste of six lives -- the Clutters, and the killers' own."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote has done a splendid job of making the story of the Clutter family come to life in this book. I had never read this book, but was prompted to purchase and read it after hearing just enough about the story to interest me. This doesn't read like the majority of true crime books. It reads like fiction. It is so easy to forget that what you are reading isn't just a story, but that it happened to real people and the actions of Smith and Hickok destroyed a family and a small Kansas town. All I can say is Read It! It's a bit macabre to say, you'll love it, but you will. Very good book!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Capote does a great job of showing the horror of the real life murders in a small town in Kansas. He takes us through the lives of the Clutter family and the criminals in alternating chapters until they meet. Capote also shows how the murders caused neighbors to be suspicious of each other in this small town. Shows all sides and aspects of the case."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Far from \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\\" Truman Capote's riveting account of the 1959 slaughter of a family of four in Holcomb, Kan. (pop. 270) remains one of the essentials in true-crime publishing history. In masterful story-telling fashion, Capote's powerful writing puts us at the scene of the Clutter house that bloody weekend of Nov. 14, 1959, as Perry Smith and Richard Hickock go from attempted robbery to the merciless slaughter of four people. So compelling is Truman's style that, by the time Mrs. Clutter is the last to be killed, we have a sense of relief that, for her, the horror of knowing she will be the last to die is over. In the wake of the murders, Capote takes us on the trail of the killers from the nation's Bible Belt to Mexico and Las Vegas before, finally, back to the scene of the crime and the gratuitous trial. And at the gallows, where Smith and Hickock meet their final justice, Capote manages to put us there, so powerful the feeling of the pending executions. Capote interviewed both killers for his book and reportedly had a sexual relationship with one. Maybe myth, but Capote did say once he would never have written \\"In Cold Blood\\" had he known its emotional cost to him. Little wonder. In the end, we have four victims of a truly senseless slaughter and two killers who fashioned their own noose, all for a radio and 50 bucks. Still, Capote never topped himself with anything he wrote later."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Holcomb, near the western border of Kansas, among wheat fields and desolate buildings, lays a small community of farmers and ranchers. On the morning of November 14, 1959, the Clutter's family of four were murdered by Perry and Dick. Although not the first writer to use actual events as a basis for a novel, Truman Capote narrates there actual events in a documentary style. The mystery of the novel is not who committed the murders, but to discover the identity and motive of the murderers. Capote gave the reader a view of the Clutters as people before they were killed, mot merely murder victims. He creates suspense by giving the description of the murders until Perry's confession and utilizes delays, such as the introduction of new characters, letters from the killer's family, and psychiatric records at the end of the book. One difficulty that a reader may experience could be the long-winded dialogues and letters from perry's family. sometimes the dialogues carry on for so long that it becomes laborious to keep track of what is going on or who's talking at what time. The plot however is not hard to understand or to follow. Characters in the novel are easy to get close to emotionally and mentally. Characterization is handled well by Capote to execute such knowledge of the Clutters and the killers. Capote gives his attention the the years of Perry's troubled childhood, youth, and adulthood including his difficulties with his father and the motorcycle accident that left him crippled. However, Dick's background and character are given inadequate attention, amounting to little more than his penchant for female children,and his conviction that he is a &quot;normal.&quot; Capote makes us think how, such evil intrudes into the Clutter world, a world of self-discipline, religious faith, and dedication to hard work. The only order the murderers know is disorder."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This is a great book... Capote's writing is very clear and well paced, vividly recreating this chilling true story without sensationalism. It is especially fascinating how he probes the psyches and personality dynamics of the two killers. Definitely a true classic."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Capote's depiction of the Cutter tragidy from the third person piont of view truly shows the horror of crime in our violent society. Many of the ideas including child abuse creating a violent crimmal where devloped before many criminal phsycologists had begun to research them. He has the ability to make the reader feel sympothetic of the stuggles of Perry's life and like him for his love of the arts and dreams of life, yet still creates a hatered for the man who killed four people for no reason. The image of the Nancy and the boy slaughtered is truely chilling after learning of there kindness and aspirations for life. Finally, his ability to show how the crime haunts some many people yet sadly and truthfully becomes forgotten in a society where violence is an all to comman occurance."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Having just finished Capote's In Cold Blood, I can honestly say that it is one of the most facinating novels I have ever read. The way in which he reconstructs the people and events of Holcomb, Kansas give the reader a feeling of witnessing the crime and the subsequent search. Perhaps what I found most compelling about the novel was the authors ability to depict the two Kansas killers in such a way that the reader almost feels sorry for them. After completing the book, I was torn between digust for their deed and pity for their circumstances. A truly worthwhile read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood is a great book with intereting twists to the plot.

It is a great book for anyone to read."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I'm a senior in highschool and our term paper in English class had to be on a famous(or infamous)book. I chose Truman Capote's &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; because it was something I knew a little bit about, but was interested in learning a lot more.I thought the book was fascinating. I know that I'm young and,despite the fact that I am very well read, have much more to learn about literature, so my opinion is probably invalid and reeks of inexperience.However, I thought the book was written in a very unique fashion, and that its themes, particularly that of irony, were compelling. The subject itself was interesting as well. My English teacher keeps pressing that not all books are to be read solely for entertainment purposes. I see her point, but I think that &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; entertains and informs concurrently."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I first read this book in high school and really liked the first 2/3 of it. The last 1/3 is a dull and actually somewhat tedious account of a) the M'Naughten (sorry if I misspelled that) Law and how it does/does not apply to the killers, and b) the requisite psychiatric insights into the minds of Dick and Perry. However, the first 2/3 reads beautifully, almost like a great American tragedy, and the mysterious note on which the Dick/Perry account ends pre-killing (&quot;Presently, the car crept forward.&quot; Next chapter: finding the bodies) has stayed with me 10 years after my first reading of the book. The best Truman Capote I've read, and I'm including Breakfast at Tiffany's when I say that!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The way that Capote tells the tale of these two men is truly masterful and spellbinding. However, this book has paved the way for trashy and poor imitations, which is the price we pay for someone coming up with the brilliant idea to chronicle the murders of a Kansas family. However, this book definitely deserves to be called one of the best."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote writes of a new horror in society. When it was published this was the beginning of senseless violence. Today the book portrays how the senseless violence was predicted in the minds of two. It reaches into the souls of the few who knew the case and the minds of the killers. It is an amazing book that is scary for the many small town folk. A WORK OF GENIUS"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood by Truman Capote was published in 1966, and is based on events that happened almost fifty years ago. The events were real. This is not a work of fiction. The Clutters, an appropriately surnamed Kansas family, have their own complications within their rambling homestead. What family doesn't? Clutter the father is a farmer. Who isn't in these parts? Life is not so productive of late. Whose is? The two younger children, a daughter and a son, still live in. The others have left, happily.And then, in November 1959, the four Clutters are found gagged, apart from the mother, all with their throats cut and their brains blown out by shotgun fire. The community is in turmoil. No-one can explain why anyone might have wanted to kill a whole family in Holcomb, a small, poor, rural community in the mid-West Bible belt.Hickock (Hicock) and Smith are two lads on the move. Their families might be dysfunctional. On the other hand they might not. Their socialisation might have been lacking. On the other hand it might not. For whatever reason, individually and collectively they prey on others, prey in a way that renders them culpable, detectable and ultimately punishable. They know thieving is wrong. So, one of them says, we've stolen lives, so it must be serious. It was the two of them that pulled the trigger, that blew brains out, that slit throats, that did not quite commit rape. There are limits. And all for forty dollars and a transistor radio.I give nothing of this book away when I reveal that the two lads did commit the murders - exactly how no-one ever admitted - and that, after years of litigious wrangling, both were hanged. The strength of In Cold Blood is not what happens, but how it happens.Truman Capote offers us a vast book in just four sustained chapters, each of which is sub-divided as the narrative shifts between aspects of the different protagonists' lives. Throughout, the style is much more complex than mere journalism, but the clarity with which it communicates is at times breathtaking. We hear from those directly involved, both victims and perpetrators, their families, the police, the judiciary, the neighbours, the lawyers, the passers-by, the acquaintances, the cellmates. The detail is forensic.It is essential that the reader is constantly reminded that this is not fiction. Truman Capote offers dialogue where a journalist would report, offers interpretation where an historian would defer, offer opinion where an observer might decline. And so In Cold Blood becomes and absorbing, multi-faceted, mid-twentieth century reworking of Crime And Punishment. The crucial difference that the intervening years have generated is that where the latter concentrated on the individual circumstances and motives of the perpetrator, In Cold Blood explores the social and the contextual alongside the psychological.And this is where the book becomes deeply disturbing, because it seems to suggest that the individuality that contemporary society seems to demand of us might itself promote a degree of self-centredness, of selfishness, perhaps, that might give rise to nothing less than contempt for others. In the forty years since the publication of In Cold Blood, it could be argued that such pressures might have increased. Frightening, indeed."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"because there should be dozens if not hundreds of reviews for IN COLD BLOOD, which was an enormous bestseller when it debuted in 1966 and has enjoyed steady sales ever since as the exemplary -- and probably best -- \\"true crime\\" book.I know I reviewed the book years ago in its trade paperback version and since Amazon appears not to have put such prior reviews here as well, I'd refer you to prior editions for the reviews."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"From beginning to end, I found this book to be one of the most compelling stories I've ever read. Truman Capote reconstructs this true life story in a way only a master storyteller can. He weaves the plot together in sequential order, allowing the reader to experience the crime and its aftermath just as the Kansas community did. Further, his character development is utterly flawless. I found myself haunted by the book long after I closed its cover. This account demonstrates Capote's immense talent as a writer, and it is a must read for those wishing to become familiar with Capote and those who enjoy true crime accounts or engrossing non-fiction."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"After viewing \\"Capote\\", the biographic film of Truman Capote's coverage of the horrendous slaughter of a Kansas family, we wanted to review the book and film of the murder. Even after all these years, the book still holds up as the hallmark for True Crime Novels. Capote certainly succeeded in capturing an audience for this type of novel."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read. Engrossing, compelling, and expertly written, Capote completely engulfs the reader into the world of the two killers, the innocent family they killed, and the town that lived through it. At some points I couldn't put the book down. A definite masterpiece and classic."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"After seeing the movie, \\"Capote\\", I knew I had to read Truman Capote's book \\"In Cold Blood\\", a book I never before had the desire to read. I was struck by the almost unpeakable saddness bordering on rage that I felt over the wanton and utterly senseless murder ot the Clutter family. It is a deeply affecting book, so much so that it interrupted my sleep more than a few nights!Having read the book and viewed the two recent films on the subject, I can certainly understand why \\"In Cold Blood\\" was the last book Capote ever wrote. He burned himself out having become so emotionally involved that the whole thing consumed him."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"The author, Truman Capote, created a new genre of novel with this account of a true crime... The novel is expertly set up with a suspense you might not think could exist. He sets it up artfully by writing that a murder has been committed, and then tracing the backgrounds, and the paths of the killers up to the night of the murder itself, so that the details of the multiple homicide are the climax of the book... Like a Shakespearean drama, there's a \\"fifth act\\" of some resolution regarding the fates of the killers and some of the Clutter family friends. I think that this is the author's best book ever. It's full of hope and sadness, good and evil, and it never fails to scrutinize and explore the spaces between two extremes.

We, as a culture, have an unhealthy fascination with such things. However, this book manages to illuminate the human side of such unspeakable acts without glorifying those who commit them. Capote deftly unfolds the story and allows you to focus not on the horrendous acts themselves but the events surrounding them."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"I could not put this book down once I had picked it up. Though covering a terribly bloody topic, it is lyrically and beautifully written by Capote, describing everything to the last detail, though without the tedium that accompanies many other books that attempt to do so.It is obvious that Capote would have for years looked at all the information he could, studying it in detail, to create such a consistent masterpiece.This book can be appreciated by people of all ages (I am 13) for the genius required to pull it off. It is the book's structure, though, that was astonishing. The book, divided into four sections, each ended in a haunting climax, or deep revelation that leaves you terrified, but wanting more.Buy this book today."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"This docu-novel has been compared to Berendt's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, and with good reason. This book, too, centers on a mysterious murder perpetrated in a kindly community. However, there are several notable differences, the most striking being that while Midnight gets into more of the deep-seated intrigues present in Savannah, In Cold Blood centers on the psyches of the killers themselves, and the tireless investigation to catch them. Little local color is really included, and that which is seems quite out-of-place, dull and sedentary, the book's only downfall. The Clutter Family is clearly, cleanly portrayed, and though the outcome of the work is never in doubt, Capote makes a marvelous showing by giving the reader a solemn roller-coaster as the authorities chase the blindly-running criminals. This is an excellent book, and I would certainly recommend that any reader interested look into both this book and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. Check 'em out and enjoy!"},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"A true account of the November 15th, 1959 murder. The lives of four family members of Holcomb Kansas,-the Clutters-, were brutily taken by two men that had no apperent motive, and little to no clues were left to link them with the killings. The writer is generous with insite of both the investigation and the the lives of the criminals. Suprisingly you will find a measure of sympathy for ALL involved, innocent and guilty. The New York Times said, &quot;In Cold Blood is a work that transcends its moment, yielding poignant insights into the nature of American violence.&quot; I cannot agree with this more. If you had a stereotype for what a murderer is and how one thinks, your in for an interesting education."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Capote does a wonderful job of delving into the killers motives.

I had heard about the Clutter killings all of my life. I did not get to read the book until 1986. After I had read the book I become possessed. It really pulls you in. In 1996, I lived in Holcomb, just one block from the house where the murders took place. Nothing has really changed in the small town. It is a little bigger, I guess. Holcomb has had it's share of bad press in the past but it is really a GREAT small town."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"If you do, find out that after you've read this book you'll have a diferent opinion.

This is an unbelieveable book. I had to force myself to read it slowly to grasp the fantastic writing style of Truman Capote. The subject matter is such that I found myself reading quickly because it is so engrossing. I have never understood what a truly gifted writer could produce until I read this book. I subsequently read a paperback best seller and couldn't believe how horrible I found the writing style. (Clearly I am no writer, but I can certainly appreciate good writing.) I only wish there were many more books by Truman Capote."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote happened upon a brief newspaper story about the Clutter family murders in late 1959 and his life--and American letters--were changed forever. I was first exposed to IN COLD BLOOD in high school and haul it out every 2-3 years to reread it and remind myself that our language can be that good. Nothing fancy, just plain midcentury American English, no vocabulary beyond the reach of an eighth grader. But I don't think I've ever encountered anything else so perfectly written and constructed.Capote gets us into the minds of the killers--and the victim Clutters--and his tale takes on the dimensions of a Greek tragedy. There have been hundreds of more elaborate &quot;true crime&quot; accounts published since 1965, but I know of none more gripping. I was sad when IN COLD BLOOD barely squeaked in at no. 98 in a recent list of the 20th century's best nonfiction books--some purists still had trouble with the fact that Capote had to use conjecture and invention to recreate scenes between the Clutters, etc.A little trivia: Capote's research assistant in writing IN COLD BLOOD was (Nell) Harper Lee of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD fame (this was before she became). Gerald Clarke's biography of Capote devotes a healthy amount of space to the writing of IN COLD BLOOD and its thunderous reception."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"While reading this book one must keep in mind that Truman Capote had two very distinct objects in mind as he worked on this project. First, he wanted to write a Nonfiction Novel and in that area he has succeeded marvelously. Many critics have in fact proclaimed this to be Capote's best work. The author's other intent was to make a statement against the death penalty, an object in which he is less successful.Capote could not have picked a better case to write a novel about but he could hardly have found two condemned men who would illicit less sympathy. My own faith inclines me to oppose the death penalty but I would be hard pressed to stick to my convictions in this case. The crimes perpetrated by these two were of the worst kind and no matter their backgrounds I could muster little sympathy for either of them. Fortunately, Capote spends relatively little time overtly pleading his political case and the novel is not harmed much in this effort.The novel itself is nothing short of a masterpiece and will keep the reader on the edge of their seat for almost it's entire length. Capote begins what is probably the first True Crime Novel by introducing the reader to both the Clutter family (the intended victims) and Perry Smith and Dick Hickock (the killers) along with the small Kansas town where the crime would take place. The reader follows the Clutter clan as they live their normal lives in the days before their murder and also rides along as Smith and Hickock plan their crime. From there, one rides the roller coaster through the crime, it's discovery, the getaway, the investigation, and the capture, trial, and execution of the perpetrators. Capote weaves his story in such a masterful manner that there will be times when the reader gets completely caught up in the story just as if he/she were there. While reading this book you will become very aware of every little noise outside your house so it may be better to read it during daylight hours.I would advise anyone who likes Crime Novels or just good novels to put this book near the top of their to read list. The story is disturbing and a little graphic in places but this is the work of a master wordsmith and he has done his job well. This book deserves to be placed much higher than it is in the pantheon of great works of literature."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"In Cold Blood was a true story about a murder that took place in the mid-1900. It happened in a small town in Kansas where everyone knows each other. The victims were a family of four called the Clutter's whom were liked by everyone in the town and had no enemies. The murderers were two men that wanted money but didn't get what they bargained for.I do not recommend this book to anyone that doesn't have commitment to finish a book. It personally didn't make me want to read on until I was a little over halfway through the book. I would of quit reading if it wasn't for the fact that I needed to do a book report and a book talk on it. In my opinion, the beginning of it is boring. Another thing that I do not like is that the book skips around a lot, little too much for my liking."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Just finished my english composition class and we had to write a literary analysis on this book..I didnt realize until I tried to read the last part of the book that it was missing the last 20 or so pages..

I was quite excited about it, too. Apparently its just me, but I found this to be a boring, painful read. As a booklover I could never understand why she didn't have the same joy in reading as I do. After suffering through this one, now I understand. I couldn't wait to finish it - not to see what was going to happen, just so it would be over. While I can appreciate it for the shocking, ground breaking novel it was back when it was originally published, I am of the opinion that many more interesting and better written true crime stories have been written since then."},{"Title":"In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences","review":"Truman Capote is one of the great storytellers.

I think that what impressed me the most about it was the unbiased way that Capote portrayed the two murderers in the story. Capote develops within the reader a real sense of empathy for the all the characters in the story, and it left me feeling unsure of the merits of capital punishment.

A tale of mystery, suspense, and betrayal are the key points that this book illustrates. In Cold Blood is a novel about a farm family with a good reputation throughout a small town in Kansas. In one moment, more than half of that family is forever silenced by the sounds of a shotgun. In one instant, the Clutter family is lying dead and covered in a pool of their own blood. Who is the murderer? Why did the killer commit this autrocity? These are the two main questions one must ask himself.

Early in the book you know that they all die AND you know who did it. What's up with that? So much for suspense! Truman Capote was very amusing in Murder by Death, though. And did you ever see Rich Little's impersonation of Truman Capote as Tiny Tim in his rendition of A Christmas Carol? It was incredible! He does W.C. Fields as Scrooge. Truly an inspired performance.

I have no complaints."},{"Title":"Anorexia Workbook","review":"It is regrettable that the orthodox medical establishment fails to acknowledge that many modern ailments are caused by deficiency of one or more essential nutrients. This is the case with anorexia which very commonly is due to deficiency of the essential mineral zinc. People who are seriously deficient in zinc tend to lose almost complete interest in food and often find eating to be repulsive. When such people are given adequate daily supplementation with zinc their interest in eating usually returns and their anorexia -- if present -- disappears.It is true that many cases of anorexia start out as a result of deliberate food deprivation -- generally as an attempt to lose weight. But when such food deprivation results in a severe deficiency of zinc, it becomes involuntary and requires zinc supplementation to be overcome. I realize that many -- perhaps most -- people reading this will not believe that anorexia can be successfully treated by supplementation with zinc, but such success has been achieved many times by people willing to try it. Incidentally, zinc is an essential cofactor for more enzymes than any mineral other than magnesium. Deficiency of zinc and/or magnesium is a major cause of many modern ailments which are regarded as difficult to treat when, in fact, they are quite readily treated by appropriate supplementation."},{"Title":"Anorexia Workbook","review":"I skimmed this and decided not to give it to my adolescent daugther who is recovering from A.N.; more approrpiate for an adult who has decided they want to make a recovery and lookwing for a workbook--there are some frightening pages that say, imagine you have died, what would you want your tombstone to say--I regret that i wasted the money"},{"Title":"The Penguin Book of Curious and Interesting Mathematics (Penguin Mathematics)","review":"This is a book of mathematical fragments; that is, short self-contined blurbs involving mathematics or mathematicians. The blurbs include puzzles, limericks, anecdotes about famous mathematicians or mathematics teachers, famous theorems, tiny biographies, and interesting observations. Most are a single paragraph long, and nearly all are less than a page. Some are fascinating and some are not so fascinating. Some are quite amusing, and some are very dry. A few actually have some real mathematical content. The vast majority of them assume some mathematical acumen, such as familiarity with famous theorems or mathematicians, or knowledge of concepts such as a Taylor series. To give you and idea of what you will find in this book, I've picked three very different entries:1) Here is a typical amusing anecdote: &quot;G. H. Hardy was about to return from Denmark to England, by boat, in appalling weather. So he sent a postcard ahead to announce to the world that 'I have proved Riemann's Hypothesis', which was then as now the Holy Grail of professional mathematicians. Hardy reasoned that God (in whom Hardy did not profess to believe) would not allow the boat to sink, thereby leaving open the suspicion that Hardy had achieved this remarkable feat.&quot;2) Here is a limerick by Paul Halmos, a famed contemporary mathematician:&quot;If you think that your paper is vacuous,Use the first-order functional calculus,It then becomes logic,And, as if by magic,The obvious is hailed as miraculous.&quot;3) Here is an example of a puzzle with some actual mathematical content: &quot;A medical researcher does a carefully controlled experiment whose result is that new medicine X is more effective on male patients than a placebo. The experiment is then repeated on female subjects, with the same result... The data from the two experiments are then added together, and they prove that overall the medicine is LESS effective then the placebo. Is this possible? Yes.&quot; [explanation provided in the back of the book]While I like the idea of this book, and found a few entries that were really funny or interesting, over all I thought the collection was mediocre.

The illustrations are well-selected and are of good quality; they help Escobar develop his points. In the book, Escobar proves that the Spaniards were (and are) master city builders on par with their Roman and Greek predecessors. He shows that the Spaniards perfected the art of creating first-class urban spaces and places. An interesting follow-up work might discuss in more detail how the Spaniards applied their skills to cities they built and rebuilt around the world, from San Juan to New Orleans to Manila.

There are thirteen contributors of the edited book and each offers some original responses to the fast growing Internet and the social processes related to it. One of the major themes that concern all the contributors is: How do we study the Internet? While the Internet has changed many aspects of our lives from the way we work, to the way we shop, to the way we socialize, the Internet is still a fairly new subject for social scientists to grapple with. The book offers some explorative strategies for the readers to get some general ideas about how to examining the social aspects of Internet.Both quantitative and qualitative researchers will get some insights from this edited book. The editor, Steve Jones, chose the articles from a wide range of social research approaches. Most contributors are from communication studies, but there are also people from computer science, sociology, and English departments. I think one of the most intriguing chapters is chapter 12 where Barbara Sharf talks about the ethics problems of doing naturalistic discourse research on the Internet. Chapter 13 is also an inspiring piece because it bridges the field of cultural studies with that of Internet communications.Compared to &iexcl;CyberSociety 2.0&iexcl; and &iexcl;Virtual Culture: Identity and Communication in Cyberspace&iexcl; both of which are edited by Steve Jones, this book is more focused on the doing aspect, which is Internet research methodology. I think it is a very practical and thought-provoking book for those who are consider doing or are now doing research on the Internet."},{"Title":"The Real Magnet Book","review":"As a child, I was fascinated by magnets. I once received a cheap magnet as a gift and I played with it for hours, checking everything in the house to see if it would attract the magnet. When she was young, my daughter was also interested in magnets; she played with her toy magnets for hours as well.This book contains some simple descriptions of how magnets behave as well as some simple and very safe experiments that can be performed with magnets. It is written at the level of the second grade reader, so it can be used as a basic text for the study of magnets in the early years of education. It is a great book of elementary science, showing the reader how interesting, fundamental and valuable magnets are."},{"Title":"A Lady's experiences in the wild West in 1883 (Western Americana)","review":"Rose Pender was an English aristocrat who accompanied her husband and his business partner on a trip to the US in 1883 to inspect their large cattle holdings in the West. Landing in New York in March, the party embarked on a four-month \\"grand tour\\" of the country that would take them across to San Francisco and back again. This book, published five years after their return to England, is her account of the trip, and it's a beauty.Her observations are fresh and very personal, filtered through the lens of her aristocratic associations. She refuses to shield her prejudices, which are directed mainly against the Mexicans and Irish, though she is sympathetic toward the Indians. She is appalled by the dirt and \\"wretched quarters\\" she often finds in the \\"bar infested\\" towns they travel through. (Their \\"tour\\" covered a lot of ground within a relatively short period, and many of her observations are mere first impressions and thus rather negative, especially of some of the larger towns visited such as Carson City and Salt Lake City). Yet she can be humorous about some of the shortcomings she experiences, even self-deprecating, as for example the night spent in Cook's Hotel in Yosemite Valley, where \\"the walls are merely lath and paper, and we overheard a funny conversation between a Pennsylvanian bride and bridegroom that was certainly not intended to be public property ... about the 'darned stuck-up Britishers' ... it was very amusing.\\"They also had their fair share of adventures, including climbing Pikes Peak in deep snow and participating on a round-up in eastern Montana. The last leg of the trip from Miles City back to New York is rapidly dealt with in only a few pages, as if she had seen all she intended to see and now it was time to be off for home again. Ms. Pender impresses one as being something of a whirlwind, which is what makes her breezy and spirited account so entertaining. There have been many books written by travelers to the \\"Wild West,\\" and this short little narrative is among the liveliest and engaging of them all."},{"Title":"Pain and the Possibility","review":"This book was given to me by a friend when I was on leave from work and coping with depression. The book had sat on her shelf for many years and suddenly demanded her attention. When I received it , it seemed like a mentor or spiritual advisor had materialized before me. I worked the book day by day, drawing, doodling and webbing. What appeared before me on the page was ubelievable - buried memories, themes of misery but also as I moved through the dark, joyful times shone through too. It was hard work to travel this road but also it was truly a journey of discovery. My life has been changed by this wonderful book. If you are looking at dark times or are coming to know yourself better or just want to know more about your brain and how it works - read this book and work it!"},{"Title":"Pain and the Possibility","review":"I read this book in its French translation and was moved by how the author seemed to come out of the page and speak directly to me. She talks about the many people she met over the years who were coping with being divorced and Catholic. In particular, what she says about the purpose of the annulment process was very meaningful to me. I felt close to each of the people she speaks of in her book. I recognized their questions, their feelings of injustice, of pain, of hope and of longing for reconciliation with their Church. For those wondering what the annulment process can feel like and what motivates some people to go through with it, this book is worth reading."},{"Title":"Variations on the Cooking Theme, SIGNED","review":"Remembered this book from my childhood,... My Mom new the author and several persons mentioned in the book of rather avante garde reciepts for 1957! added to my collection!"},{"Title":"Canoe Rig: The Essence and the Art: Sailpower for Antique and Traditional Canoes","review":"This new book is chock full of clear, colorful computer drawings of details of various sail rigs, written by a guy who obviously knows what he's talking about. For the small boat enthusiast it's a real treat. Bradshaw has chapters on spars, leeboards, sails, mast support, and rigging, with an appendix featuring measured plans for sails and leeboards. It's clear and informative, and very hard to put down!"},{"Title":"Canoe Rig: The Essence and the Art: Sailpower for Antique and Traditional Canoes","review":"Being single, I get to be my own Santa Claus. So this year Santa brought me \\" Canoe Rig, The Essence And The Art\\". Written and Illustrated by Todd E. Bradshaw. Although it looks more like a coffee Table book, the pages are filled with information. The illustrations are computer generated 3-D and are well detailed. There is also a lot of text explaining each type of sail. In the back of the book are scaled graphics to assist in making the sails. All in all an excellent book. I look forward to trying some of these sail configurations on my canoes."},{"Title":"Canoe Rig: The Essence and the Art: Sailpower for Antique and Traditional Canoes","review":"CANOE RIG is three books in one. It is a book for people interested in books, it is a book about communicating information, and, it is a book for people who love canoes.CANOE RIG is the book which any book lover will recognize as a \\"keeper.\\" This book meets all the criteria for a classic: it has the size, the heft, and the shape - you want to share a comfortable chair with this book; it has the pedigree - the publisher, WoodenBoat, and the editor, Peter Spectre, have a reputation for perfection; and it was produced by an author whose devotion to the subject shows through on every page.When I first opened CANOE RIG I turned each page as though the next illustration was going to pop-up from the page like some of those kids books. The pictures make you feel as though you are the first to discover the simple art of a canoe with a sail. You are drawn through this book - just like the way kids used to (perhaps still do) page through magazines and slap each picture and say \\"mine\\" -- you \\"want\\" every canoe you see, and you want to know more and more about those canoes. I found myself not just wanting to own the canoe, to sail the canoe, but I also wanted the canoe on a tee shirt, too!As to the technical coverage of the book, Bradshaw has completely covered the world of canoe sailing. From the basics of wind to the complexities of spars, leeboards, sails, mast support, and rigging, and he included an appendix with measured drawings for sails and leeboards.I contacted Bradshaw to ask him a question: had he ever read any of Edward Tufte's books on the visual display of information. I was disappointed to learn that he hadn't, for CANOE RIG is an excellent example of the principles proscribed by Tufte -- his books are the bibles of the information age. The illustration is truly worth thousands of words, and the words are straight, to the point and from the heart. Todd did relate that his formal schooling was in fine arts, sculpture in fact. Tufte raised the bar on illustration and information to the level of art - CANOE RIG met that mark.As a book for lovers of canoes, CANOE RIG will become a classic. It will pose a dilemma for canoe sailors - should I use this book as a text, make notes in the margins, sketch in my own changes to some rigs - or should I keep it in its original condition, to savor on cold nights in the off season? It will also bring more canoeists into the sailing brotherhood - who can look at these simple, yet elegant, craft and not wish to own and sail one?Simple and elegant are the two words which we strive to use whether we are building our canoeing skills or building our canoes. If it's a simple and elegant display by an accomplished freestyle paddler, we will stare in awe and admiration, because to make the difficult look simple and the precarious look elegant is an art. The sheer of a wood and canvas canoe will catch our eye - for it is simple and it is elegant - but we know that behind the simple is skill and struggle and tedium, and that behind the elegant is design for strength and worth and utility. Behind the simple and elegant CANOE RIG is a sculptor who has produced a work of art."},{"Title":"Canoe Rig: The Essence and the Art: Sailpower for Antique and Traditional Canoes","review":"Excellent.Well written, with wonderfully informative illustrations.Pay close attention to the title because that is exactly what this book is for.Precisely directed at those who are restoring an old canoe or putting a sail on an old canoe, and desire with that sailing apparatus, to maintain the patina and character of the &quot;oldness.&quot;If you are, as I am, seeking simply to put a sail on a modern canoe, I suppose there is still a good deal to learn from this book. I am getting inspiration from the diagrams and may one day, when I get more free time, build something like what is in this book.It would be silly to build something according to the plans in this book and put it on a modern canoe. It would sail, no doubt. But the great sin would be the mixture of old and new.There is enough technical information and close up drawings that I can work from and adapt to using aluminum and modern, manufactured items to create something to get on the water faster than building it all myself from scratch. That is mainly what the thrust of this book is all about, building and sailing it yourself, whilst keeping it's antique patina.Great book. The author knows his subject.Also an attractive coffee table book, even if you never do anything with the knowledge therein."},{"Title":"Canoe Rig: The Essence and the Art: Sailpower for Antique and Traditional Canoes","review":"This book is more than beautiful. Not a canoe building book, although it does offer some ideas. Instead it is a canoe completion book full of all the details forgotten in boat building kits or plans. In fact, Mr. Bradshaw brings to life a forgotten art. A highly detailed and creative review of sails, rigging, hardware as well as the instructions to balance and put it all together. As a boat builder, I am more than impressed and look forward to sewing some sails! Some great ideas for touring sails for sea kayaks as well."},{"Title":"Canoe Rig: The Essence and the Art: Sailpower for Antique and Traditional Canoes","review":"This is one of the prettiest and most informative books I've ever bought...and I read a ton of tech and how-to stuff.If you have any interest in this area this would be one to get and keep."},{"Title":"Canoe Rig: The Essence and the Art: Sailpower for Antique and Traditional Canoes","review":"I am restoring a 1960 Old Town sailing canoe that needed a sail, rudder and lee boards. My source for specifications was on line pictures and I scaled the parts the best I could from pictures. Then I found Todd Bradshaw who made a sail and recommended his book. The book provided scaled plans for the parts I was making and discussed the science and reasoning behind his plans. This book is exactly what I needed. In addition Todd's book offered practical advice. For example based on his advice I contacted the Oregon State Marine Board and learned that I needed to \\"title' and \\"register\\" my sailing canoe. If I had not done this and was cited, the fine would have been stiff."},{"Title":"Canoe Rig: The Essence and the Art: Sailpower for Antique and Traditional Canoes","review":"This book is better than my wildest expectations when I ordered it. The author writes so even a novice could understand his concepts and it is backed up by beautiful, artfully done illustrations (there are no photographs) to help you understand his point. This would make a good coffee table book just because of all of the beautiful drawings of sailing canoes. I understand now why it is titled &#34;the essence and the art&#34;. It also has everything you need to know to rig a canoe for sailing. I think even if you were not into sailing canoes, you would be by the time you finished this book."},{"Title":"Canoe Rig: The Essence and the Art: Sailpower for Antique and Traditional Canoes","review":"Lots of spectacular illustrations.

If you want to know exactly how to set up your canoe to sail this is the book. I don't care if you have a pristine 1927 wooden canoe or your uncles old aluminum monster from the seventies. This is the book. The writing is clear and engaging yet laid out in an intuitive logical order. It is a how to book that doesn't seem like a how to book. It drags you joyfully along with its infectious enthusiasm for the subject at hand. It will open you up to a whole new world. Please give it a try.

Lawyes will find the text narrow in scope, but it can be useful as a guide as to where to begin looking and understanding the legal doctirnes. Clinicians will find the text lacking in detail. The text is only an overview, with not enough specific depth of coverage to act as a refernece for the clinician nor the lawyer. Useful for beginners just starting out in their clinical practices."},{"Title":"Gendermaps: Social Constructionism, Feminism, and Sexosophical History","review":"John MoneyGendermaps:Social Constructionism, Femininism, and Sexosophical History(New York: Continuum, 1995) 165 pages(ISBN: 0-8264-0854-4; hardcover)(Library of Congress call number: HQ23.M588 1995)John Money's suggested new word \\"gendermap\\"includes two separable phenomena:(1) sex-roles--the observable behavior of men and womenassigned by each culture or sub-culture on the basis of sex,(2) gender-personality--the internal personality traitsconsidered either 'masculine' or 'feminine'within a given culture or sub-culture.Both of these human phenomena arise from socializationrather than from 'human nature'or some other claim of genetic transmission.A third phenomenonthat sometimes lies in the background of \\"gendermap\\"is what this reviewer calls male/female self-designation--the usually-unchangeable sense thatI am a boy/man or I am a girl/woman.Once our sex has been settled,sex-roles and gender-personalities can then begin to be constructed.John Money uses the expression \\"gender identity/role\\"for what this reviewer calls \\"male/female self-designation\\".Asking about the sex of an individual (whether male or female)is a better word than gender to use in this contextbecause of the multiple meanings and ambiguities of the word \\"gender\\".It is important to use our words very carefully in this contextbecause of the confusion that arises when \\"gender\\"is just used as a polite substitute for the word \\"sex\\".Our biological sexes are given by our genes.But our sex-roles, our gender-personalities,and even our male/female self-designationsresult from events that happen to us after birth.But Money wisely warns againsttoo neat a separation of the biological and the cultural--of nature and nurture.For example, hormonal abnormalities (which are biological in origin)might have an impact on a child's developing brain.The nature side of the debates swirling around 'gender'is called \\"essentialism\\".The nurture side of the debates is called \\"social constructionism\\".For a time, social constructionism became very popularin anti-establishment academic circles.These young academics attacked the \\"medical model\\" of everything,claiming (in its most extreme form)that words can mean whatever we say they mean.There is no truth, only beliefs.\\"Post-modernism\\" was its name.And Michel Foucault was its high priest.The establishment that social constructionism attackedwas variously identified as:the patriarchal system, Judeo-Christian morality,gender bias, racial prejudice, & endemic homophobia.As usual, John Money's observations on the themes ofsex, gender, 'masculine' or 'feminine' personalities,& the roles we are assigned in relationships and in societyare wise and insightful.Even tho Money does not break any new ground in this book,it is worth one reading by people who have appreciated his other books.If you would like to discover other books on 'msculinity' and 'femininity',search the Internet for the following bibliography:\\"Best Books on Gender-Personality\\".James Leonard Park, creator of the Gender-Pattern Chart."},{"Title":"Child life in colonial days,","review":"This book provides fascinating details of what life was like for children in Colonial America: How they played, what their education was like, what they wore, etc. The information is drawn from such primary sources as letters, journals and school primers.
